here, we report a nasopharyngeal isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae composed of a mixture of two phenotypes; one encapsulated  and the other nonencapsulated, determined by serotyping, electron microscopy and fluorescence isothiocyanate dextran exclusion assay.
the nonencapsulated variant is superior in growth in vitro and is also 117-fold more adherent to and more invasive into detroit  <dig> human epithelial cells than the encapsulated variant.
the mutation caused phenotypic changes in growth, adherence to epithelial cells and transformability.
the polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence factor of the important human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae.
we identified a new single point mutation in capsule gene cpse of a clinical s. pneumoniae serotype 18c isolate sufficient to cause loss of capsule expression resulting in the co-existence of the encapsulated and nonencapsulated phenotype.
by whole genome sequencing, we demonstrated that the phenotypes differ by a single nucleotide base pair in capsular gene cpse  predicted to result in amino acid change from arginine to glycine at position  <dig>  located in the cytoplasmic, enzymatically active, region of this transmembrane protein.
mutation in capsule gene cpse may be a way for s. pneumoniae to lose its capsule and increase its colonization potential.
however, s. pneumoniae strains lacking capsule do occur.
expression of six competence pathway genes and one competence-associated gene was  <dig> to 34-fold higher in the nonencapsulated variant than the encapsulated and transformation frequency was  <dig> -fold greater.
this snp is responsible for loss of capsule production as the phenotype is transferred with the capsule operon.
