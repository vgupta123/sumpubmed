the novel transcription factor gene mtcbf <dig> identified here played an important role in response to abiotic stresses, indicating that it might be a good candidate gene for genetic improvement to produce stress-tolerant plants.
we conducted a detailed pathway analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the roots of medicago truncatula seedlings under salt stress and selected a transcription factor gene, mtcbf <dig>  for experimental validation.
expression of mtcbf <dig> in m. truncatula was induced by most of the abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, cold, and abscisic acid, suggesting crosstalk between these abiotic stresses.
salt stress hinders the growth of plants and reduces crop production worldwide.
however, different plant species might possess different adaptive mechanisms to mitigate salt stress.
transgenic arabidopsis over-expressing mtcbf <dig> enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress, and activated expression of downstream genes that contain dre elements.
comprehensive transcriptomic analysis revealed complex mechanisms exist in plants in response to salt stress.
one of the highly induced transcription factor genes was successfully cloned, and was named mtcbf <dig>  phylogenetic analysis revealed that mtcbf <dig>  which belongs to the ap2-erebp transcription factor family, is a novel member of the cbf transcription factor in m. truncatula.
analysis of  <dig> statistically significant expression profiles revealed different behaviors between primary and secondary metabolism pathways in response to external stress.
secondary metabolism that helps to maintain osmotic balance was induced.
over-expression of mtcbf <dig> in m. truncatula also enhanced salt tolerance and induced expression level of corresponding downstream genes.
