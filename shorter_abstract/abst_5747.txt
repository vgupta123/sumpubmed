characterization of mature protein n-termini by large scale proteomics is challenging.
in this context, we have developed the encounter tool  to score all characterized peptides using discriminating parameters to identify bona fide mature protein n-termini and  to determine the n-terminus acetylation yield of the most reliable ones.
data processing using the encounter tool provided an efficient and rapid way to extract the most reliable mature protein n-termini.
in an a. thaliana cell lysate,  <dig> distinct proteotypic n-termini were characterized of which  <dig> were located at the predicted protein n-terminus  and  <dig> were located further downstream .
such data processing allows the identification of the exact n-terminus position and the associated acetylation yield.
the encounter tool provides a unique way to extract accurately the most relevant mature proteins n-terminal peptides from large scale experimental datasets.
selected peptides were subjected to n-terminus acetylation yield determination.
