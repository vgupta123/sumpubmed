many algorithms for finding transcription factor binding sites have concentrated on the characterisation of the binding site itself: and these algorithms lead to a large number of false positive sites.
in our sample of seventeen transcription factors — taken from different families of transcription factors — the average proportion of sites in this subset of classes was 75%, with values for individual factors ranging from 48% to 98%.
this method of analysis will help to find transcription factor binding sites and assist with the problem of false positives.
we find that the human genome may be described by  <dig> pairs of mosaic classes, each defined by its base frequencies, , so that typically a run of  <dig> to  <dig> bases belongs to the same class.
these results are not a consequence of the class composition in promoter regions.
these results also imply a profound difference between the mosaic classes.
the dna sequence which does not bind has been modeled only to the extent necessary to complement this formulation.
