the present study evaluated the performance of the caninehd in detecting cnvs and extends the current catalogue of canine cnv regions with several dozens of novel cnv regions.
substantial contribution to phenotypic diversity is accounted for by copy number variants .
the hitherto largest dataset in canine cnv discovery was assessed,  <dig> dogs from  <dig> different breeds, enabling identification of novel cnvs and a thorough characterisation of breed-specific cnvs.
a stringent procedure identified  <dig> cnv regions with the smallest size of 38Â kb and of the  <dig> cnv regions,  <dig> overlapped  <dig> annotated genes.
