here we introduce a new algorithm, pscore, able to score peaks according to their likelihood of representing metabolites defined in a mass spectral library.
metabox reported lower percentages of false positives and false negatives, and was able to report a higher number of potential biomarkers associated to the metabolism of female and male mice.
although additional computational tools have been developed for processing amdis results and to perform normalisations and statistical analysis of metabolomics data, there is not yet a single free software or package able to reliably identify and quantify metabolites analysed by gc-ms.
we implemented pscore in a r package called metabox and evaluated the applicability and potential of metabox by comparing its performance against amdis results when analysing volatile organic compounds  from standard mixtures of metabolites and from female and male mice faecal samples.
here we present an algorithm implemented in a r package, which allows users to construct flexible pipelines and analyse metabolomics data in a high-throughput manner.
for this, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  has been largely applied and many computational tools have been developed to support the analysis of metabolomics data.
identification and quantification of metabolites is among the most critical and time-consuming steps in gc-ms metabolome analysis.
