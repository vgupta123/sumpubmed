of these five, polypeptides representing expression products of abc and lppb were recognised on immunoblots by sera obtained from cattle during a natural outbreak of the disease.
mycoplasmal genes were identified by matching the nucleotide sequences of dna from immunoselected phage particles with the mycoplasmal genome.
identifying which of the causative agent's proteins trigger potentially protective immune responses is an important step towards developing a subunit vaccine.
accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether phage display combined with bioinformatics could be used to narrow the search for genes that code for potentially immunogenic proteins of mmmsc.
since phage display physically couples phenotype with genotype, it was used to compile a list of sequences that code for mmmsc proteins bearing epitopes which were recognised by antibodies in the serum of infected animals.
the phage display step empirically identified sequences by their interaction with antibodies which accordingly reduced the number of orfs that had to be expressed for testing.
since the disease is a serious problem that can affect cattle production in parts of africa, there is a need for an effective and economical vaccine.
using this method together with computer algorithms designed to score parameters that influence surface accessibility and hence potential antigenicity, five genes  were chosen to be expressed in escherichia coli.
since the production of igg <dig> and iga are associated with a th <dig> cellular immune response which is implicated in protection against cbpp, antigens which elicit these immunoglobulin subclasses may be useful in developing a subunit vaccine.
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia  is a mycoplasmal disease caused by mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
this is a particular advantage when working with mmmsc since the mycoplasmal codon for tryptophan needs to be mutated to prevent it from being translated as a stop in e. coli.
