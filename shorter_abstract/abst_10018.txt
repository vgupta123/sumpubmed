for three different kinds of binding sites, mosfom displays an excellent ability to differentiate active compounds through energy and shape complementarity.
the multi-objective optimization method was successfully applied in virtual screening with two different scoring functions that can yield reasonable binding poses and can furthermore, be ranked with the potentially compromised conformations of each compound, abandoning those conformations that can not satisfy overall objective functions.
different scoring functions focus on diverse aspects of ligand binding, and no single scoring can satisfy the peculiarities of each target system.
results suggest that mosfom can effectively enhance enrichment and performance compared with a single score.
in this paper, two multi-objective optimization methods, called mosfom, were developed for virtual screening, which simultaneously consider both the energy score and the contact score.
therefore, the idea of a consensus score strategy was put forward.
