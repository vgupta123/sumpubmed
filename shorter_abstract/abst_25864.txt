the correlation between growth increments and an aridity index revealed that growth before two years old  was more responsive to changes in water availability than late growth  for both height and circumference.
the genetic basis of growth traits has been widely studied in forest trees.
quantitative trait locus  studies have highlighted the presence of both stable and unstable genomic regions accounting for biomass production with respect to tree age and genetic background, but results remain scarce regarding the interplay between qtls and the environment.
these results suggest that early growth responses to water availability determine the genetic architecture of total growth at the mature stage and highlight the importance of considering growth as a composite trait  for a better understanding of its genetic bases.
within the trials, qtl analysis revealed collocations between primary and secondary growth qtls as well as between early growth increments and final growth qtls.
heritabilities for incremental growth were more heterogeneous over time even if ranges of variation were similar .
in this study, our main objective was to dissect the genetic architecture of the growth trajectory with emphasis on genotype x environment interaction by measuring primary and secondary growth covering intervals connected with environmental variations.
we found a regular increase in heritability with time for cumulative growth for both height  and circumference .
between trials, few common qtls were detected highlighting a strong environmental effect on the genetic architecture of growth, validated by significant qtl x e interactions.
three different trials with the same family of eucalyptus urophylla x e. grandis hybrids  were planted in the republic of congo, corresponding to two qtl mapping experiments and one clonal test.
