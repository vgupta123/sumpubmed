telomerase activity is expressed in all platypus tissues like that of cold-blooded animals and murine rodents.
the oantert encodes a protein with a high sequence similarity to marsupial tert and avian tert.
several alternatively spliced oantert variants structurally similar to avian tert variants were identified.
like the tert of sauropsids and marsupials, as well as that of sharks and echinoderms, oantert contains extended variable linkers in the n-terminal region suggesting that they were present already in basal vertebrates and lost independently in ray-finned fish and eutherian mammals.
interestingly, female platypuses express higher levels of telomerase in heart and liver tissues than do males.
the tert gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex and is responsible for maintaining telomere length.
oantert shares many features with tert of the reptilian outgroup, suggesting that oantert represents the ancestral mammalian tert.
vertebrate telomerase has been studied in eutherian mammals, fish, and the chicken, but less attention has been paid to other vertebrates.
features specific to tert of eutherian mammals have, therefore, evolved more recently after the divergence of monotremes.
the platypus occupies an important evolutionary position, providing unique insight into the evolution of mammalian genes.
oantert was localized on pseudoautosomal regions of sex chromosomes x3/y <dig>  expanding the homology between human chromosome  <dig> and platypus sex chromosomes.
