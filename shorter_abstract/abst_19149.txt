using prior experimental evidence that shows uaug effects on translation repression together with mirna expression data specific to cell lines, we demonstrate through computational analysis that cell-specific down-regulation of protein expression  correlates well with the simultaneous presence of mirna and target uaug sequences in one cell type and not others, suggesting tissue-specific translation repression by mirnas through uaugs.
using sequence data from whole-genome cdna alignments we identified  <dig> uaug sequences on the 5'-utr that specifically interact with 3'-ends of conserved mirnas.
we propose that these uaugs represent a subset of mirna interaction sites on 5'-utrs in mibridge, whereby a mirna binding a uaug hinders the progression of ribosome scanning the mrna before it reaches the open reading frame .
our computed results demonstrate that tissue- or cell-line specific repression of protein translation by uaugs can be explained by the presence or absence of mirnas that target these uaug sequences.
separately, upstream augs  in 5'-utrs are known to regulate genes translationally without affecting mrna levels, one of the mechanisms for mirna-mediated repression.
using klf <dig> as an example , we show computationally that mirnas expressed only in hela cells and not in neuroblastoma  cells can bind the uaugs responsible for translation inhibition.
similarly, seven members of the klf family of genes containing uaugs were computationally identified as interacting with several mirnas.
