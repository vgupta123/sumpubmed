a combination of different types of next-generation sequencers for analyzing individual genomes may be an efficient means of validating multiple single nucleotide variations calls simultaneously.
our results show the versatility and usefulness of the combination of exome sequencing with whole-genome sequencing in studies of human population genetics and demonstrate that combining data from multiple sequencing platforms is an efficient approach to validate and supplement snp calls.
here, we analyzed  <dig> independent japanese genomes using two next-generation sequencing platforms: the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform for whole-genome sequencing , and the ion proton semiconductor sequencer for whole exome sequencing .
validation of single nucleotide variations in whole-genome sequencing is critical for studying disease-related variations in large populations.
we compared the variant calls for the  <dig> samples, and found that the concordance between the two next-generation sequencing platforms varied between 83% and 97%.
