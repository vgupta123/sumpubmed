sequence features were used to build a support vector machine model for e. coli proteins, allowing the assignment of any sequence to the drug target or non-target classes, with an accuracy in the training set of 94%.
we identified  <dig> proteins  in the non-target set that have target-like properties, many of which have unknown function.
<dig> of these proteins have significant and undesirable similarity to a human protein, leaving  <dig> target like proteins that are not present in humans.
in particular,  <dig> are essential genes where the cell is not able to recover from a random insertion disruption.
we suggest that antibiotic discovery programs would be more likely to succeed if new targets are chosen from this set of target like proteins or their homologues.
we analysed  <dig> non-redundant antibiotic target proteins from all bacteria,  <dig> antibiotic target proteins from e. coli only and  <dig> non-drug targets from e. coli to identify differences in their properties and to predict new potential drug targets.
