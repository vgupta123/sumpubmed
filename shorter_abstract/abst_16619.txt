to further improve structure alignment quality, the fr-tm-align algorithm has been developed where aligned fragment pairs are used to generate the initial seed alignments that are then refined using dynamic programming to maximize the tm-score.
fr-tm-align, a new algorithm that employs fragment alignment and assembly provides better structural alignments in comparison to tm-align.
most structure comparison methods involve generation of an initial seed alignment, which is extended and/or refined to provide the best structural superposition between a pair of protein structures as assessed by a structure comparison metric.
fr-tm-align uses an exhaustive procedure to generate initial seed alignments.
on average, the structural alignments generated using fr-tm-align have a higher tm-score  and coverage  in comparison to those generated by tm-align.
for the assessment of the structural alignment quality from fr-tm-align in comparison to other programs such as ce and tm-align, we examined various alignment quality assessment scores such as psi and tm-score.
the assessment showed that the structural alignment quality from fr-tm-align is better in comparison to both ce and tm-align.
