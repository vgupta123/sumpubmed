we argue that this is too pessimistic a view, and conclude that evidence points towards vetulicolians being members of the stem-group deuterostomes; a group best known as the chordates , but also including the ambulacrarians , and xenoturbellids.
our observations suggest that food captured in the anterior cavity was transported to dorsal and ventral gutters, which then channeled material to the intestine.
vetulicolians are a group of cambrian metazoans whose distinctive bodyplan continues to present a major phylogenetic challenge.
establishing the homology of these structures is central to resolving where vetulicolians sit in metazoan phylogeny.
this divergence of opinions revolves around a strikingly arthropod-like body, but one that also bears complex lateral structures on its anterior section interpreted as pharyngeal openings.
new material from the chengjiang lagerst√§tte helps to resolve this issue.
second, of the key innovations that underpinned deuterostome success, the earliest and arguably most seminal was the evolution of openings that define the pharyngeal gill slits of hemichordates  and chordates.
