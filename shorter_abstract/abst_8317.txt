we analysed two srna deep sequencing datasets, prepared from different rna size fractions, to identify srnas involved in apple stem grooving virus  infection.

plant small rnas  associated with virulent virus infections have been reported by previous studies, while the involvement of srnas in latent virus infection remains largely uncharacterised.
the results revealed the vsirnas profile of an asgv variant, as well as the alteration of the trna-derived srna profile in response to latent virus infection.
a vsirna profile for one of the asgv variants was also generated showing an increase in sirna production towards the 3′ end of the virus genome.
these srnas covered a broad size-range and originated from both ends of the mature trnas as well as from their central regions.
several trna-derived srnas showed differential regulation due to asgv infection.
srna analysis revealed virus-derived sirnas  originating from two asgv genetic variants.
it also highlights the importance of library preparation in the interpretation of high-throughput sequencing data.
