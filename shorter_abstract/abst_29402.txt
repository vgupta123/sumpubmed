using two publicly available cross-platform testing data sets, cross-platform normalization methods are compared based on inter-platform concordance and on the consistency of gene lists obtained with transformed data.
of the four successful methods, xpn generally shows the highest inter-platform concordance when treatment groups are equally sized, while dwd is most robust to differently sized treatment groups and consistently shows the smallest loss in gene detection.
simultaneous measurement of gene expression on a genomic scale can be accomplished using microarray technology or by sequencing based methods.
researchers who perform high throughput gene expression assays often deposit their data in public databases, but heterogeneity of measurement platforms leads to challenges for the combination and comparison of data sets.
we provide an r package, conor, capable of performing the nine cross-platform normalization methods considered.
researchers wishing to perform cross platform normalization face two major obstacles.
scatter and roc-like plots are produced and new statistics based on those plots are introduced to measure the effectiveness of each method.
