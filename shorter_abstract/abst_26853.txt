the transcriptomes reflect early larval stages, adult worms including late larvae, and growth-arrested dauer larvae and allowed the identification of developmentally regulated gene clusters.
by combining expression data with phylogenetic analysis, we found that developmentally regulated genes are found in paralogous clusters that have arisen through lineage-specific duplications after the split from the caenorhabditis elegans branch.
consequently, this may contribute to the substantial divergence in expression profiles that has been observed across larger evolutionary time scales.
the development of multicellular organisms is accompanied by gene expression changes in differentiating cells.
gene expression clusters characterizing early larval stages show most significant enrichments of chaperones, while collagens are most significantly enriched in transcriptomes of late larvae and adult worms.
our data reveals similar trends as previous transcriptome profiling of dauer worms and represents the first expression data for early larvae in p. pacificus.
we propose that gene duplications of developmentally regulated genes represent a plausible evolutionary mechanism to increase the dosage of stage-specific expression.
we sequenced rna-seq libraries throughout a developmental timecourse of the nematode pristionchus pacificus.
