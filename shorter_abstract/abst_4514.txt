on a test set comprising six bacterial draft genomes, assembled using either a single illumina miseq or roche  <dig> library, we show that even a 50Ã— coverage of uncorrected pacbio rs long reads is sufficient to drastically reduce the number of contigs.
the recent introduction of the pacific biosciences rs single molecule sequencing technology has opened new doors to scaffolding genome assemblies in a cost-effective manner.
we conclude that the recent advances of the pacbio sequencing technology and chemistry, in combination with the limited computational resources required to run our program, allow to scaffold genomes in a fast and reliable manner.
here we propose a novel hybrid assembly methodology that aims to scaffold pre-assembled contigs in an iterative manner using pacbio rs long read information as a backbone.
