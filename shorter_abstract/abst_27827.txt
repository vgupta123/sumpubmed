fmap performs alignment, gene family abundance calculations, and statistical analysis .
the available functional analysis pipelines lack several key features:  an integrated alignment tool,  operon-level analysis, and  the ability to process large datasets.
here we introduce our open-sourced, stand-alone functional analysis pipeline for analyzing whole metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data, fmap .
fmap functional predictions are consistent with currently available functional analysis pipelines.
fmap is a comprehensive tool for providing functional analysis of metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing data.
with the added features of integrated alignment, operon-level analysis, and the ability to process large datasets, fmap will be a valuable addition to the currently available functional analysis toolbox.
