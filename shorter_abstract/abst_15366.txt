aim of this study was to identify additional ksrp targets whose stability and steady-state levels are enhanced by pi3k-akt activation.
among them, seven mrnas were upregulated in cells expressing activated akt <dig>  both steady-state levels and stability of these new ksrp targets were consistently increased by either ksrp knock-down or pi3k-akt activation.
our study identified a set of transcripts that are targets of ksrp and whose expression is increased by pi3k-akt activation.
the increased expression of these gene products upon pi3k-akt activation could play a role in the cellular events initiated by this signaling pathway.
first, through microarray analyses of the au-rich transcriptome in pituitary αt3- <dig> cells, we identified  <dig> are-containing transcripts upregulated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of akt <dig>  in parallel, by an affinity chromatography-based technique followed by microarray analyses,  <dig> mrnas target of ksrp, additional to β-catenin, were identified.
these mrnas encode rna binding proteins, signaling molecules and a replication-independent histone.
