cnv workshop has been successfully utilized for assessment of genomic variation in healthy individuals and disease cohorts and is an ideal platform for coordinating multiple associated projects.
results are easily queried, sorted, filtered, and visualized via a web-based presentation layer that includes a gbrowse-based graphical representation of cnv content and relevant public data, integration with the ucsc genome browser, and tabular displays of genomic attributes for each cnv.
cnv workshop includes three major components: detection, annotation, and presentation of structural variants from genome array data.
predicted cnvs are captured in a mysql database that supports cohort-based projects and incorporates a secure user authentication layer and user/admin roles.
to our knowledge, cnv workshop represents the first cohesive and convenient platform for detection, annotation, and assessment of the biological and clinical significance of structural variants.
the increasing availability of high-resolution genome surveillance platforms provides opportunity for rapidly assessing research and clinical samples for cnv content, as well as for determining the potential pathogenicity of identified variants.
to assist with determination of pathogenicity, detected cnvs are also annotated automatically for gene content, known disease loci, and gene-based literature references.
