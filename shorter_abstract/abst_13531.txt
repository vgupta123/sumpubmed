a number of methods for computing disease similarity had been developed; however, none of them were designed to utilize information of the entire protein interaction network, using instead only those interactions involving disease causing genes.
in this study, we propose a new method  for computing disease similarity by integrating medical literature and protein interaction network.
mednetsim consists of a network-based method , which employs the entire protein interaction network, and a medline-based method , which computes disease similarity by mining the biomedical literature.
integrating biomedical literature and protein interaction network can be an effective way to compute disease similarity.
it was found that quality of protein interaction data was more important than its volume.
it may be beneficial to steer more resources torward studying gene-disease associations and improving the quality of protein interaction data.

disease similarities can be computed using the proposed methods at http://www.digintelli.com:8000/.
its average auc  reached  <dig>  %.
medsim, whose performance was even comparable to some function-based methods, acquired the highest average auc in all semantic-based methods.
integration of medsim and netsim  further improved the average auc to  <dig>  %.
utilizing higher volume of disease-related gene data further improved the average auc of mednetsim and netsim to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.
most of previously published methods required gene-disease association data, unfortunately, many diseases still have very few or no associated genes, which impeded broad adoption of those methods.
on the contrary, higher volume of gene-disease association data was more beneficial, even with a lower reliability.
we further studied the effectiveness of different data sources.
