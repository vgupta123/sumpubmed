group i intron genotype analysis was based on the four highly conserved insertion sites of the lsu .
fifty-seven beauveria bassiana isolates - <dig> from spain- were characterized, integrating group i intron insertion patterns at the 3'-end of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal gene  and elongation factor 1-alpha  phylogenetic information, in order to assess the genetic structure and diversity of this spanish collection of b. bassiana.
in follow, ef1-Î± phylogeny served to classify most of the strains in the b. bassiana s.s.  group and separate them into  <dig> molecular subgroups, all of which contained a group i intron belonging to the ic <dig> subtype at the ec <dig> position.

interestingly, the members of the latter two genotypes showed unique differences in their growth temperatures.
most spanish b. bassiana isolates  are grouped into a major phylogenetic subgroup with word-wide distribution.
in general, no correlation was observed between the molecular distribution and geographic origin or climatic characteristics where the spanish b. bassiana isolates were sampled.
however, high phylogenetic diversity was also detected among spanish isolates from close geographic zones with low climatic variation.
