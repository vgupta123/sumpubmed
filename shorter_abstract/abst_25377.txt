peptide amidation was increased over endogenous levels by exogenous pam, and targeting pam to the endoplasmic reticulum or trans-golgi network increased peptide amidation compared to endogenous cho pam.
to vary access of the enzyme to its substrate, exogenous pam was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-golgi network, endosomes and lysosomes or to the lumen of the secretory pathway.
to make large amounts of high molecular weight amidated product, chinese hamster ovary  cells were engineered to express exogenous pam.
immunocytochemical analyses of cho cells and a pituitary cell line demonstrated that targeting of exogenous pam was partially successful.
pam substrates generated by expressing peptidylglycine substrates  fused to the c-terminus of immunoglobulin fc in cho cell lines producing targeted pam.
