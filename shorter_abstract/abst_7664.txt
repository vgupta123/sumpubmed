our segmentation framework is flexible and provides very good segmentations of multi-color muscle fibers.
we propose to integrate an edge detector into a superpixel algorithm and customize the method for multi-channel images.
this paper addresses the difficulties and presents a superpixel-based framework for segmentation of regenerated muscle fibers in mice.
the enhanced superpixel method outperforms the original and another advanced superpixel algorithm in terms of both boundary recall and under-segmentation error.
one difficulty of such strategies is segmenting the cell boundaries, which is a very different problem from segmenting color images from the real world.
confetti fluorescence and other multi-color genetic labelling strategies are useful for observing stem cell regeneration and for other problems of cell lineage tracing.
