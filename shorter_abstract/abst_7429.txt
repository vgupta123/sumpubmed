in total,  <dig>  of snps are likely to represent duplicated genes or highly similar members of gene families, rather than alternative alleles of the same gene, since they showed a high frequency of heterozygosity.
they have been used to build a genetic linkage map that can be applied to quantitative trait locus  discovery.
the percentage of successful assays was 75%, with  <dig> snps amplifying correctly.
here we report the identification of snps from sequence data generated by a large-scale expressed sequence tag  program, focusing on fish originating from canadian waters.
we detected  <dig> snps that met our selection criteria .
atlantic cod  is a species with increasing economic significance for the aquaculture industry.
the remaining polymorphic snps  were categorised as validated snps.
however a small number of snps  that are polymorphic in the western atlantic were monomorphic in fish tested from three european populations.
genes that map within qtl intervals can be prioritized for testing to determine whether they contribute to observed phenotypes.
a preliminary linkage map has been constructed with  <dig> major linkage groups and  <dig> mapped snps.
of the  <dig> contigs from which validated snps were selected, 31% have a significant blast hit.
these snps represent powerful tools to accelerate the genetic improvement of cod aquaculture.
while many microsatellite markers have been developed in cod, the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  is currently limited.
