multiple sequence formats can be read and multiple sequences may be plotted in a single results window.
graphdna is a platform-independent, open source, tool for the analysis of nucleotide trends in dna sequences.
these asymmetries in nucleotide composition have been extensively analyzed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and related to chromosome organization, transcription orientation and other processes in certain organisms.
graphdna is a new java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of dna nucleotide composition.
the program accepts genbank, embl and fasta files as an input, and it displays multiple dna nucleotide composition graphs  in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences.
