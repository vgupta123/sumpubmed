locus per locus amova showed ssrs both inside orfs and upstream 5’utr were more conserved within species compared to ssrs in other genomic regions, suggesting their evolution is constrained by the functions of the regions they are in.
results showed a clear dominance of trirepeats and a selection against other repeat number, i.e.
principal coordinates analysis  indicated that even if ssrs inside orfs were less polymorphic than those in intergenic regions, they were more powerful in differentiating species.
the main underlying hypothesis of this study is that the evolution of simple sequence repeats  is correlated with the evolution of the genomic region in which they are located, resulting in differences of motif size, number of repeats, and levels of polymorphisms.
by coupling a genome-wide ssr survey in the genome of the plant pathogenic fungus heterobasidion irregulare with an analysis of intra- and interspecific variability of  <dig> ssr markers in five populations of the two sibling species h. irregulare and h. annosum, we investigated mechanisms of evolution of ssrs.
adaptive processes shape the evolution of genomes and the diverse functions of different genomic regions are likely to have an impact on the trajectory and outcome of this evolution.
di- and tetranucleotides, both in regions inside open reading frames  and upstream 5’ untranslated region .
our work linked the variation and the type of ssrs with regions upstream 5’utr, putatively harbouring regulatory elements, and shows that the evolution of ssrs might be affected by their location in the genome.
