the number of significantly stress regulated genes increased dramatically after  <dig> h stress treatment and peaked at  <dig> h. go enrichment test revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes were involved in signal transduction, energy, transcription, secondary metabolism, transporter, disease and defence response.
in a total of  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated at various time points.
the current knowledge of saline-alkaline stress transcriptome is mostly focused on saline  stress and only limited information on alkaline  stress is available.
using affymetrix® soybean genechip®, we conducted transcriptional profiling on glycine soja roots subjected to  <dig> mmol/l nahco <dig> treatment.
plant roots are the primary site of perception and injury for saline-alkaline stress.
this is the first comprehensive wild soybean root transcriptome analysis under alkaline stress.
these analyses have identified an inventory of genes with altered expression regulated by alkaline stress.
