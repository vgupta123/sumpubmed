to prevent host suicide, colicins, bacteriocins of e. coli, form tight complexes with their cognate immunity proteins.
the escherichia coli uropathogenic-specific protein  is a bacteriocin-like genotoxin, active against mammalian cells and associated with e. coli strains that provoke pyelonephritis, prostatitis and bacteraemia.
our data infer that nonspecific dna binding of the imu <dig> immunity protein, prevents suicide of e. coli producing the genotoxin usp.
isolation and partial characterisation of the usp-associated immunity protein- <dig>  revealed that, while usp and imu <dig> do not form a high affinity complex, imu <dig> exhibits dna and rna binding activity.
