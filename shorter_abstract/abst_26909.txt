by identifying tss and promoters on a global scale, our work provides a firm foundation for the continued study of s. meliloti gene expression with relation to gene organization, σ factors and other transcription factors, and regulatory rnas.
using an rnaseq approach and rna populations representing  <dig> different growth and stress conditions, we comprehensively mapped s. meliloti transcription start sites .
our work identified  <dig>  tss that we grouped into six categories based on the genomic context of their transcripts: mrna , leaderless mrnas , putative mrnas , internal sense transcripts , antisense rna , and trans-encoded srnas .
altogether, we predicted  <dig>  new promoter sequences, including  <dig>  located upstream of protein coding genes and  <dig> located upstream of antisense rna or trans-encoded srna genes.

to validate promoter predictions for targets of the general stress response σ factor, rpoe <dig> , we identified rpoe2-dependent genes using microarrays and confirmed tss for a subset of these by 5′ race mapping.
we used this tss information to identify transcription factor binding sites and putative promoter sequences recognized by seven of the  <dig> known s. meliloti σ factors σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σh <dig>  σh <dig>  σe <dig>  σe <dig>  and σe9).
