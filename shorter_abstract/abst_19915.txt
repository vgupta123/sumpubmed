another difference is demonstrated by helices  <dig> and  <dig> that form a helical hairpin that is situated approximately parallel to the canonical helix  <dig>
the dlc2-sam domain adopts a structure that is topologically more similar to an anti-parallel four-helix bundle than a canonical sam domain.
the dlc2-sam domain structure reveals an atypical four-helix composition that is distinct from the five-helix sam domain structures that have been determined to date.
this alternate topology may allow the dlc2-sam domain to interact with a novel set of ligands.
towards understanding the function of dlc <dig>  we have solved the nmr solution structure of the sam domain.
from structural alignments, helix  <dig> of the canonical sam domain appears to be replaced by shorter, extended secondary structure that follows a similar path.
