but they displayed sharply contrasted deadenylation patterns that account for variations observed previously by dna array and correlated with the presence of a putative cytoplasmic polyadenylation element in their 3' untranslated region.
we have investigated how post transcriptional control of maternal transcripts was affected during in vitro and in vivo maturation, as a model of differential developmental competence.
similar variations in abundance and polyadenylation status were observed during in vitro maturation or in vivo maturation, except for prdx <dig>  that appears as a marker of in vivo maturation.
they do not evidence a general alteration of this phenomenon after in vitro maturation as compared to in vivo maturation, but indicate that some individual messenger rna can be affected.
throughout in vitro development, oocyte restricted transcripts were progressively degraded until the morula stage, except for melk ; and the corresponding genes remained silent after major embryonic genome activation.
four genes are characterized here for the first time in bovine: ring finger protein  <dig>  and breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance  <dig> , whose oocyte preferential expression was not previously reported in any species, as well as maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase  and stella.
using real time pcr, we have analyzed variation of maternal transcripts, in terms of abundance and polyadenylation, during in vitro or in vivo oocyte maturation and in vitro embryo development.
in bovine maturing oocytes and cleavage stage embryos, gene expression is mostly controlled at the post-transcriptional level, through degradation and deadenylation/polyadenylation.
altogether, our data emphasize the extent of post-transcriptional regulation during oocyte maturation.
we included three known oocyte marker genes , zygote arrest  <dig> , nacht, leucine rich repeat and pyd containing  <dig> ).
most transcripts underwent a moderate degradation during maturation.
