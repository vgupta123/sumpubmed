a specific subset of trnas contains a thiolated uridine residue at the wobble position to improve the codon-anticodon interaction and translational accuracy.
based on the arabidopsis protein sequence, ctu2-type proteins of other plant species can now be readily identified.
ctu <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, yet its activity seems to be particularly important in root tissue.
ctu <dig> is essential for trna thiolation as a ctu <dig> mutant fails to perform this trna modification.
the proteins involved in trna thiolation are reminiscent of prokaryotic sulfur transfer reactions and of the ubiquitylation process in eukaryotes.
ctu <dig> is essential for trna thiolation and interacts with rol <dig>  the previously identified ctu <dig> homolog of arabidopsis.
the analysis of ctu <dig> adds a new component to the so far characterized protein network involved in trna thiolation in arabidopsis.
a ctu <dig> knock-out mutant shows an alteration in root development.
this manuscript describes the identification of ctu <dig>  the second cytoplasmic thiouridylase protein of arabidopsis thaliana.
for other proteins, the identification of the plant homologs is much less clear, due to the low conservation in protein sequence.
