the current study demonstrates the complexity of an archetypal mammalian intestinal mrna transcriptome in high resolution and identifies novel transcriptionally active regions at strand-specific, single base resolution.
we assessed tissue-specific transcriptomal architecture and the presence of novel transcriptionally active regions .
we further categorized our findings by their relative adjacency to described exonic elements and investigated regional differences of novel transcribed elements in small intestine and colon.
our analysis for the first time shows a strand-specific comparative picture of ntars in two tissues and represents a resource for further investigating the transcriptional processes that contribute to tissue identity.
