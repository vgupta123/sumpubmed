injection stress" is augmented by food restriction and appears to summate with effects of the group i mglur agonist in activating erk1/ <dig> and creb.
chronic food restriction augments the rewarding effect of centrally administered psychostimulant drugs and this effect may involve a previously documented upregulation of d- <dig> dopamine receptor-mediated map kinase signaling in nucleus accumbens  and caudate-putamen .
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether chronic food restriction increases striatal map kinase signaling in response to the group i mglur agonist, dhpg.
psychostimulants are known to induce striatal glutamate release, and group i metabotropic glutamate receptors  have been implicated in the cellular and behavioral responses to amphetamine.
to probe whether the augmented erk1/ <dig> and creb activation in vehicle-injected food-restricted rats are mediated by one or more glur types, effects of an nmda antagonist , ampa antagonist , and group i mglur antagonist  were compared to saline-vehicle.
these results indicate that a group i mglur agonist induces phosphorylation of akt, erk1/ <dig> and creb in both cpu and nac.
however, group i mglur-mediated signaling may not be upregulated in food-restricted rats.
in addition, although dhpg activated akt, there was no difference in akt activation between feeding groups.
rather, a physiological response to "i.c.v.
injection treatment represents additional evidence of enhanced cns responsiveness in these subjects, the functional significance and underlying mechanism of this effect remain to be elucidated.
