here, we present mirtrail, an integrative tool that allows for performing comprehensive analyses of interactions of genes and mirnas based on expression profiles.
expression profiling provides new insights into regulatory and metabolic processes and in particular into pathogenic mechanisms associated with diseases.
mirtrail identified several deregulated mirnas that target deregulated mrnas including mirnas hsa-mir-23b and hsa-mir- <dig>  which target the highest numbers of deregulated mrnas and regulate the pathway "basal cell carcinoma".
to this end, mirtrail integrates information on  <dig>  genes, almost  <dig>  mirnas, and roughly  <dig>  putative interactions, for homo sapiens and accordingly for mus musculus and danio rerio.
the integrated analysis of mrna and mirna data should generate more robust and reliable results on deregulated pathogenic processes and may also offer novel insights into the regulatory interactions between mirnas and genes.
for interactively visualizing obtained results, it relies on the network analyzers and viewers bina or cytoscape-web, also enabling direct access to relevant literature.
moreover, mirtrail cannot only be applied to microarray based expression profiles, but also to ngs-based transcriptomic data.
