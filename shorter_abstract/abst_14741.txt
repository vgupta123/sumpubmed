the enzymes involved in the starch synthetic direction such as adpg pyrophosphorylase , soluble starch synthase , starch branching enzyme  and granule-bound starch synthase  showed a decreasing trend in mother scales and higher gene expression in bulblets at bulblet appearance and enlargement stages while the enzyme in the cleavage direction, starch de-branching enzyme , showed higher gene expression in mother scales than in bulblets.
to gain insight into carbohydrate-related genes involved in bulblet formation and development, we conducted comparative transcriptome profiling of lilium davidii var.
the results of kegg pathway enrichment analysis showed that starch and sucrose metabolism constituted the predominant pathway among the three library pairs.

gene expression analysis of the key enzymes in starch and sucrose metabolism suggested that sucrose synthase  and invertase , mainly hydrolyzing sucrose, presented higher gene expression in mother scales and bulblets at stages of bulblet appearance and enlargement, while sucrose phosphate synthase  showed higher expression in bulblets at morphogenesis.
this could facilitate further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in lily and other related species.
an extensive transcriptome analysis of three bulblet development stages contributes considerable novel information to our understanding of carbohydrate metabolism-related genes in lilium at the transcriptional level, and demonstrates the fundamentality of carbohydrate metabolism in bulblet emergence and development at the molecular level.
the formation and development of bulblets are crucial to the lilium genus since these processes are closely related to carbohydrate metabolism, especially to starch and sucrose metabolism.
based on clusters of orthologous groups  analysis, 8% of the sequences were attributed to carbohydrate transport and metabolism.
the starch content in mother scales and bulblets decreased and increased, respectively, with almost the same trend as sucrose content.
