it has been utilized to address a broad range of bioinformatics problems.
in conclusion, we deem that embf is more suitable for short fragment anchoring problem where result completeness and accuracy is predominant and the reference sequences are relatively large.
due to the sheer number of fragments produced by next-generation sequencing technologies and the huge size of reference sequences, anchoring would rapidly becoming a computational bottleneck.
moreover, when the reference sequence size is increased, the efficiency of soap will get degraded as far as 30%, while embf have preferable increasing tendency.
limited by reliable output sequence length of next-generation sequencing technologies, we are confined to study gene fragments with 30~ <dig> bps in general and it is relatively shorter than traditional gene fragment length.
anchoring gene fragments in long reference sequence is an essential and prerequisite step for further assembly and analysis works.
the efficiency is defined as the count of total output results divided by time consumed to retrieve them.
the emerging next-generation sequencing method based on pcr technology boosts genome sequencing speed considerably, the expense is also get decreased.
we compared algorithm efficiency on blat, soap and embf.
