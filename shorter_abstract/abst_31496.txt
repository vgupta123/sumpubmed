we identified  <dig> novel srnas and performed experimental validation on five srnas that play a role in adaptation of burkholderia to cell stressors.
these studies provide a broad analysis of differential burkholderia srna expression profiles and illustrate the complexity of bacterial gene regulation in response to different environmental stress conditions.
in particular, the trans-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig> exhibited differential expression profiles dependent on growth phase and cell stimuli, such as antibiotics and serum.
we profiled srna expression in the gram-negative bacteria burkholderia thailandensis cultured under  <dig> distinct growth conditions using a burkholderia-specific microarray that contains probe sets to all intergenic regions greater than  <dig> bases.
in response to specific environmental changes, srnas can modulate the expression levels of target genes, thus enabling adaptation of cellular physiology.
bacterial small rnas  regulate gene expression by base-pairing with downstream target mrnas to attenuate translation of mrna into protein at the post-transcriptional level.

this srna-mediated downregulation of gene expression may be a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene dosage control.
in addition, expression of cis-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig> found in the 5′ untranslated regions of their cognate genes correlated with tight regulation of gene transcript levels.
furthermore, knockdown of the highly-expressed bth_s <dig> by antisense transcripts reduced b. thailandensis cell growth and attenuated host immune response upon infection, indicating that bth_s <dig> functions in bacterial metabolism and adaptation to the host.
