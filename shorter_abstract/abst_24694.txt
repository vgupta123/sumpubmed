every species studied possesses a large family of 14â€“ <dig> hyprps.
rapid sequence diversification is consistent with only limited requirements for structure conservation and, together with high variability of gene expression patterns, limits the interpretation of any functional study focused on a single hyprp gene or a couple of hyprp genes in single plant species.
a distinct subfamily of relatively well-conserved c-type hyprps, often with long hydrophobic pr domains, has been identified.
we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of hyprps from seven plant species, including representatives of gymnosperms and both monocot and dicot angiosperms.
hyprps represent a dynamically evolving protein family apparently unique to seed plants.
expression profiles of potato and arabidopsis hyprp genes exhibit instances of both overlapping and complementary organ distribution.
the diversified non-c-type hyprp genes from recently amplified chromosomal clusters in arabidopsis often share their specialized expression profiles.
we suggest that ancestral hyprps with long proline-rich domains produced the current diversity through ongoing gene duplications accompanied by shortening, modification or loss of the proline-rich domains.
c-type genes have broader expression patterns in both species , although orthologous genes exhibit some differences.
atypical  n-terminal domains apparently evolved independently in multiple lineages of the hyprp family, possibly via inversion or loss of sequences encoding proline-rich domains.
most of the diversity in gymnosperms and angiosperms originates from different branches of the hyprp family.
in most of gymnosperm  hyprps, diversity appears within the c-type group while angiosperms have only a few of well-conserved c-type representatives.
understanding the evolutionary dynamics of hyprps might provide not only insight into their so far elusive function, but also a model for other large protein families in plants.
