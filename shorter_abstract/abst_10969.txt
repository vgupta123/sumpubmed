here we report that a point mutation at the phospholipase cγ  docking site in the mouse neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor trkb  specifically impairs fiber guidance inside the vestibular sensory epithelia, but has limited effects on the survival of vestibular sensory neurons and growth of afferent processes toward the sensory epithelia.
in addition, we find that absence of the plcγ mediated trkb signalling interferes with the transformation of bouton type afferent terminals of vestibular dendrites into calyces  on type i vestibular hair cells; the latter are normally distributed in these mutants as revealed by an unaltered expression pattern of the potassium channel kcnq <dig> in these cells.
these results demonstrate a crucial involvement of the trkb/plcγ-mediated intracellular signalling in structural aspects of sensory neuron plasticity.
the vestibular system provides the primary input of our sense of balance and spatial orientation.
dysfunction of the vestibular system can severely affect a person's quality of life.
therefore, understanding the molecular basis of vestibular neuron survival, maintenance, and innervation of the target sensory epithelia is fundamental.
