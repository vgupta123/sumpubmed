pamps, the method presented in this work, usually results in a 30% reduction in the number of degenerate primers required to cover all sequences, compared to the previous algorithms.
in addition, it results in fewer primers which reduces the synthesis costs and improves the amplification sensitivity.
due to small running time, using pamps allows designing degenerate primers for huge numbers of sequences.
different algorithms have been proposed to solve various versions of degenerate primer design problem.
for one of the most general cases, multiple degenerate primer design problem, very few algorithms exist, none of them satisfying the criterion of designing low number of primers that cover high number of sequences.
