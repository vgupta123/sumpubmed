the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to thirteen different antibiotics and an antibiotic combination of thirty-eight m. sp.
adequate housing and appropriate antibiotic treatment are promoted in the control of the disease.
the results highlight the importance of testing mycoplasma species for antibiotic susceptibility before therapy.
<dig>  however, strains with elevated mic values were detected for all applied antibiotics.
valnemulin, tiamulin and tylvalosin were found to be the most effective antibiotics in the study.
tylvalosin  and two pleuromutilins  were found to be the most effective drugs against m. sp.
