antimicrobial resistance profiles, serotype frequency and genomic profile of unrelated p. aeruginosa isolates of veterinary origin , including domesticated, farm, zoo and wild animals mainly from portugal were studied.
serotype frequency and antimicrobial resistance patterns found in p. aeruginosa from animals were as expected for this species.
treatment options are dramatically decreasing, due to antimicrobial resistance and the microorganism’s large versatile genome.
this study confirms earlier results that p. aeruginosa has a non-clonal population structure, and shows that p. aeruginosa population from animals is homogeneously scattered and indistinguishable from the global population structure.

the genomic profile, determined by diversilab system , was compared with the p. aeruginosa global population structure to evaluate their relatedness.
animal isolates form a population with a non-clonal epidemic structure indistinguishable from the global p. aeruginosa population structure, where no specific ‘animal clonal lineage’ was detected.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human opportunistic pathogen responsible for fatal nosocomial infections worldwide, and has emerged as a relevant animal pathogen.
