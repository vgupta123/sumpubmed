we offer the source code and convenient binary packages along with extensive documentation at http://3dviewer.neurofly.de.
the reconstruction, segmentation and registration are best approached from the 3d representation of the data set.
our framework enables biomedical image software development to be built with 3d visualization capabilities with very little effort.
here we present a platform-independent framework based on java and java 3d for accelerated rendering of biological images.
in particular, we provide high-level access to volume rendering, volume editing, surface extraction, and image annotation.
