the site-saturation mutagenesis and structural modelling analysis indicated that q10y substitution stabilized ttag structure via additional hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
and this work also provides new insights into the catalytic and thermal tolerance mechanisms of α-glucosidases, which may guide molecular engineering of α-glucosidase and other thermostable enzymes for industrial application.
ttag showed differences on substrate specificity, transglycosylation, multimerization, effects of metal ions and optimal ph from other reported thermus α-glucosidases.
thermal stable α-glucosidases with transglycosylation activity could be applied to the industrial production of oligosaccharides as well as conjugation of sugars to biologically useful materials.
the purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 184 kda and consisted of 59-kda subunits; it showed hydrolytic activity for pnp-α-d-glucopyranoside , sucrose, trehalose, panose, and isomaltooligosaccharides and very low activity for maltose.
one single-substitution ttag mutant q10y with improved thermostability was also obtained from random mutagenesis library.
our findings indicate that ttag is a highly thermostable and more acidic α-glucosidase distinct from other reported thermus α-glucosidases.
the highest specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg was observed for pnpg at 90 °c and ph  <dig> ; pb2+ provided a 20 % activity increase.
transglycosylation activity was also observed with sucrose and trehalose as substrates.
