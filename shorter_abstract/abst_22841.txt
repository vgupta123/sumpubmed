we have presented a novel scoring function which can distinguish not only hp/mp ortholog pairs, but also non-homologous pairs at high accuracies.
we report a novel scoring function for discriminating hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins with application to predicting the relative thermostability of protein mutants.
in addition, the residue substitution preference matrix assembled in this study may reflect the thermal adaptation induced substitution biases.
one critical problem is the lack of reliable methods to estimate the relative thermostability of possible mutants.
it was constructed by a linear combination of ten important features identified by a feature ranking procedure based on the random forest classification algorithm.
additional blind tests using two datasets of experimentally investigated mutations demonstrated that the scoring function can be used to predict the relative thermostability of proteins and their mutants at very high accuracies .
most importantly, it can be used to accurately predict the relative stability of proteins and their mutants, as demonstrated in two blind tests.
we also developed an amino acid substitution preference matrix between mesophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, which may be useful in designing more thermostable proteins.
the ability to design thermostable proteins is theoretically important and practically useful.
