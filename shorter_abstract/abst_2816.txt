a large proportion  of snp induced amino-acid changes and the ka/ks ratio calculated for all alleles with a complete orf indicated a low selective constraint with respect to the high level of redundancy of the olfactory combinatory code and an ongoing pseudogenisation process, which affects dog breeds differently.
knowledge of the genetic diversity of olfactory receptors is essential if we are to understand the differences in olfactory sensory capability between individuals.
linkage disequilibrium within or genes and or clusters suggested a gene conversion process, consistent with a mean level of polymorphism higher than that observed for introns and intergenic sequences.
snp frequency showed the overall level of polymorphism to be high.
our demonstration of a high overall level of polymorphism, likely to modify the ligand-binding capacity of receptors distributed differently within the six breeds tested, is the first step towards understanding why labrador retrievers and german shepherd dogs have a much greater potential for use as sniffer dogs than pekingese dogs or greyhounds.
we sequenced  <dig> or genes considered representative of the whole or canine repertoire, which consists of more than  <dig> genes, in a cohort of  <dig> dogs of six different breeds.
more than 50% of or genes were found to harbour a large number of snp, whereas the rest were devoid of snp or only slightly polymorphic.
