we have studied the extent of sexual dimorphism in gene expression in the brain of two species of songbirds, the zebra finch  and the common whitethroat , using large-scale microarray technology.
moreover, they suggest that zebra finches and common whitethroats dosage compensate partly different sets of genes on the z chromosome.
our results corroborate the results of recent studies in chicken and zebra finch which have been interpreted as caused by a low degree of dosage compensation in female birds .
such differences might correspond to genes with different rates of evolution related to sexual dimorphism in the avian brain, and might therefore be correlated with differences between the species in sex-specific behaviours.
studies of gene expression in related species can shed light on the flexibility, or degree of conservation, of the gene expression profiles underlying sexual dimorphism.
it is possible that this pattern reflects differences in either the essentiality or the level of sexual antagonism of these genes in the respective species.
in accordance, sexual dimorphism in gene expression is common and extensive.
genes with sexually dimorphic regulation are known to evolve rapidly, both in dna sequence and in gene expression profile.
sexual dimorphism in gene expression was extensive in both species, and predominantly sex-linked: most genes identified were male-biased and z-linked.
to a large extent the systematic differences between the sexes must therefore arise from processes involving gene regulation.
despite virtually identical dna sequences between the sexes, sexual dimorphism is a widespread phenomenon in nature.
interestingly, approximately 50% of the male-biased z-linked genes were sex-biased only in one of the study species.
