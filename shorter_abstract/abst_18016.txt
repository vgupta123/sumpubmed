pagn is an outer membrane protein that may contribute to the virulence of s. typhimurium.
the pagn protein displays similarity to the hek and tia invasins/adhesins of escherichia coli.
s. enterica sv typhimurium pagn mutants display a reduction in adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells.
here we show that the outer membrane located pagn protein mediates agglutination of red blood cells and that this can be masked by lps.
when expressed in escherichia coli the pagn protein supports adhesion to and invasion of mammalian cells in a manner that is dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangements.
this protein is a haemagglutinin and contributes to the adherence to mammalian cells.
previously,pagn mutants have been shown to be less competitive in vivo and thus this may be due to their lessened ability to interact with mammalian cells.
the pagn gene of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is a phop-regulated gene that is up-regulated during growth within macrophages and in vivo in murine models of infection.
thus far no function has been ascribed to the pagn protein.
