since they can be helpful in improving the annotation of apicomplexan genomes and their functional characterization, we have developed a web server apicoalign for finding orthologs and aligning apicomplexan proteins.
using these matrices, we were able to find orthologs for rhomboid proteases of p. berghei, p. falciparum &p. vivax and large subunit of u <dig> snrnp auxiliary factor of cryptosporidium parvum in arabidopsis thaliana.
database searches against non-redundant  database have shown that smat <dig> gives superior performance compared to blosum series in terms of e-values, bit scores, percent identity, alignment length and mismatches for most of the apicomplexan proteins studied here.
here we extend that study to nine apicomplexan species other than p. falciparum and develop a web application apicoalign for improving the annotation of apicomplexan proteins.
the smat <dig> and pffsmat <dig> substitution matrices perform better for apicomplexan proteins compared to blosum series.
cryptosporidium parvum and p. falciparum with their orthologs from other species using the pffsmat <dig> matrix.
the smat <dig> and pffsmat <dig> matrices perform better for apicomplexan proteins compared to blosum in detecting the orthologs and improving the alignment of these proteins with their potential orthologs respectively.
to improve the annotation of plasmodium falciparum proteins, we earlier developed parasite specific matrices  and demonstrated their  better performance over standard matrices .
