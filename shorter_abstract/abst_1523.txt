the micrornas from the halophyte species thellungiella salsuginea , which exhibits extreme salt stress tolerance, remain to be investigated.
it is interesting to identify the micrornas from t. salsuginea genome wide and study their roles in salt stress response.
our results indicated that diverse set of mirnas of t. salsuginea were responsive to salt stress and could play an important role in the salt stress response.

in this study, two t. salsuginea small rna libraries were constructed and sequenced using solexa technology.
cleavage sites of seven target genes were validated by 5â€™ race, and some of the mirnas were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis.
a total of  <dig> novel mirna candidates were identified, among which the mir* sequence of  <dig> mirnas was detected.
the sequenced genome of t. salsuginea and the availability of high-throughput sequencing technology enabled us to discover the conserved and novel mirnas in this plant species.
we identified  <dig> mirnas that had previously been reported in other plant species.
micrornas are key regulators of plant growth and development with important roles in environmental adaptation.
furthermore, numerous signaling factor encoding genes, defense-related genes, and transporter encoding genes were amongst the identified targets, some of which were shown to be important for salt tolerance.
the expression of most tested mirna families was up- or down-regulated upon nacl treatment.
the expression levels of  <dig> known mirnas in the roots and leaves of plants subjected to nacl treatment were determined by affymetrix microarray analysis.
in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> target mrnas were predicted for the previously identified and thellungiella-specific mirnas, respectively.
