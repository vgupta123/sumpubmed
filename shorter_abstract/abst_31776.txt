in the current study, two diagnostic methods for the detection of infections with s. vulgaris were compared and information on the occurrence of this parasite in german horses was gained.
the mcnemar’s test  revealed a significant difference and the kappa values  showed a moderate agreement between real-time pcr and larval culture.
a direct comparison of the two methods was possible in  <dig> samples including  <dig> follow-up examinations with the result of 11 s. vulgaris-positive samples by real-time pcr and 4 s. vulgaris-positive samples by larval culture.
to date, the emerging development of resistance in cyathostominae and parascaris spp.
for this purpose, faecal samples of  <dig> horses were screened for s. vulgaris with real-time pcr and an additional larval culture was performed in samples of  <dig> horses.
the larval culture demonstrated larvae of s. vulgaris in three of the  <dig> samples .
the real-time pcr detected a significantly higher proportion of positives of s. vulgaris compared to larval culture and should thus be considered as a routine diagnostic method for the detection of s. vulgaris in equine samples.

in this regard, reliable detection of parasitic infections, especially of the highly pathogenic s. vulgaris is essential.
the real-time pcr revealed s. vulgaris-dna in ten of  <dig> investigated equine samples .
a subset of  <dig> horses underwent multiple follow-up examinations with both methods in order to evaluate both the persistence of s. vulgaris infections and the reproducibility of each diagnostic method.
