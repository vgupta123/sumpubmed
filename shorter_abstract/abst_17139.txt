in this manuscript, employing deep rna sequencing of seven tissue samples, we characterize the transcriptomes of two commonly used nhp animal models: cynomolgus macaque  and african green monkey .
we elucidate tissue-specific expression profiles and report  <dig> experimentally validated novel transcripts in these nhp animal models.
the msa pipeline is also freely available.

unlike the human transcriptome, the transcriptomes of major nhp animal models are yet to be comprehensively annotated.
non-human primates  and humans share major biological mechanisms, functions, and responses due to their close evolutionary relationship and, as such, provide ideal animal models to study human diseases.
we report comprehensively annotated transcriptomes of two non-human primates, which we have made publically available on a customized ucsc genome browser interface.
rna expression in nhps provides specific signatures that are informative of disease mechanisms and therapeutic modes of action.
