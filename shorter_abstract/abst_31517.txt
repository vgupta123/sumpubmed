the signature pairs enriched in kinase - substrate binding interactions turned out to be highly specific to kinase subtypes.
the resulting list of signature pairs predicted kinase-substrate interactions in validation dataset not used in learning with high statistical accuracy.
phosphorylation events direct the flow of signals and metabolites along cellular protein networks.
the method presented here produces predictions of protein phosphorylation events with high accuracy and mid-level coverage.
