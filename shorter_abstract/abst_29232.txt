gene-expression correlations presumably responsible for these metabolic networks were determined using the metabolite correlations as clues.
the expansion of metabolite correlation to gene-expression correlation provides detailed insights into the systemic understanding of the plant cellular process regarding metabolome and transcriptome.
the modes of regulation at the metabolome level can be revealed by metabolic networks.
we investigated the metabolic network between wild-type and  <dig> mutant  plants regarding the alteration of metabolite accumulation in arabidopsis thaliana.
two arabidopsis mutants, mto <dig> and tt <dig>  exhibited the following changes in entire metabolome networks: the overall loss of metabolic stability  or the generation of a metabolic network of a backup pathway for the lost physiological functions .
