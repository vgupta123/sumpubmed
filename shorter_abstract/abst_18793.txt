we design the indel selection index to measure the selective constraint on non-3n indels in 5'utrs.
to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate selective constraints on non-3n indels in 5'utrs.
in 5'untranslated regions  in mammalian genomes, upstream start codons  and upstream open reading frames  can regulate protein translation.
such constraints may be associated with the regulatory functions of uaugs/uorfs in translational regulation or the generation of protein isoforms.
the results hold well regardless of differences in alignment tool, gene structures between human and mouse, or the criteria in selecting alternatively spliced isoforms used for the analysis.
the presence of non-3n indels in uorfs can potentially disrupt the functions of these regulatory elements.
we thus hypothesize that natural selection disfavors non-3n indels in 5'utrs when these regulatory elements are present.
by comparing the experimentally supported transcripts of human-mouse orthologous genes, we demonstrate that non-3n indels downstream of two types of uaugs  are underrepresented.
the index controls for the genomic compositions of the analyzed 5'utrs and measures the probability of non-3n indel depletion downstream of uaugs.
our study thus brings a new perspective to the evolution of 5'utrs in mammals.
