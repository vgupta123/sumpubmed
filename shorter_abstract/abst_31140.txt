in addition to correcting substitution errors, we locate and correct insertion, deletion, and homopolymer errors while remaining sensitive to low coverage areas of sequencing projects.
pollux is highly effective at correcting errors across platforms, and is consistently able to perform as well or better than currently available error correction software.
we have developed a general-purpose error corrector that corrects errors introduced by illumina, ion torrent, and roche  <dig> sequencing technologies and can be applied to single- or mixed-genome data.
using published data sets, we correct 94% of illumina miseq errors, 88% of ion torrent pgm errors, 85% of roche  <dig> gs junior errors.
