in the present study, we have used a quantitative metabolic flux analysis approach, together with measurement of gene expression and activity of key enzymes, to investigate changes in central carbon metabolism that occur in escherichia coli in response to paraquat-induced superoxide stress.
systematic adjustments of cellular physiological state clearly occurred in response to changes in metabolic fluxes induced by oxidative stress.
flux analysis based on nuclear magnetic resonance  and mass spectroscopy  measurements and computation provided quantitative results on the metabolic fluxes redistribution of the e. coli central carbon network under paraquat-induced oxidative stress.
the production of acetate increased significantly, the fluxes associated with the tca cycle decreased, and the fluxes in the glyoxylate shunt increased in response to oxidative stress.
metabolic flux analysis provided a quantitative and global picture of responses of the e. coli central carbon metabolic network to oxidative stress.
superoxide stress promotes the excessive production of reactive oxygen species  that have detrimental effects on cell metabolic and other physiological activities.
the metabolic fluxes of the glycolytic pathway were redirected to the pentose phosphate pathway .
the cellular responses of bacteria to superoxide stress can be used to model adaptation to severe environmental changes.
