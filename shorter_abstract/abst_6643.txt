although roughly a thousand genes are expected to be important for this function in drosophila melanogaster, just a few hundreds of them are known so far.
in this work we trained three learning algorithms to predict a “synaptic function” for genes of drosophila using data from a whole-body developmental transcriptome published by others.
assembly and function of neuronal synapses require the coordinated expression of a yet undetermined set of genes.
using statistical and biological criteria to analyze and combine the predictions, we obtained a gene catalogue that is highly enriched in genes of relevance for drosophila synapse assembly and function but still not recognized as such.
