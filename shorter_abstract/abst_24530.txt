previously, we identified a novel de marker, decay accelerating factor  <dig>  by identifying de specific genes from the expression profile of de derived from mouse embryonic stem cells  by microarray analysis, and in situ hybridization of early embryos.
definitive endoderm  gives rise to the respiratory apparatus and digestive tract.
daf1-expressing late definitive endoderm proliferates slowly and show low adhesive capacity.
