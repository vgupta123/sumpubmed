udder infections with environmental pathogens like escherichia coli are a serious problem for the dairy industry.
we have modelled this process in primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells  from the cow.
higher expressed were anti-microbial factors , cell and tissue protecting factors  as well as mediators of the sentinel function of mec .
lps priming alone caused differential expression of  <dig> genes and mediated significantly different response to a subsequent e. coli challenge of  <dig> genes.
we primed primary mec cultures for  <dig> h with lps  and stimulated three cultures either  <dig> h or  <dig> h later with 107/ml particles of heat inactivated e. coli bacteria for six hours.
lps-primed mec are fitter to repel pathogens and better protected against misguided attacks of the immune response.
priming-related alterations in the global transcriptome of those cells were quantified with affymetrix microarrays.
