finally, because the erk pathway can activate c-amp response element  binding  protein, and swim stress has recently been reported to enhance creb phosphorylation, changes in p-creb were also examined.
similarly, there was a region-specific discrepancy between erk and creb phosphorylation.
the mitogen-activated protein kinases  have been shown to participate in a wide array of cellular functions.
we recently demonstrated that restraint stress activates the erk mapk pathway, but not c-jun-n-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase  or p38mapk, in several rat brain regions.
p-jnk levels  were increased in all brain regions about 2–5-fold, whereas p-p38mapk levels remained essentially unchanged.
surprisingly, levels of the phosphorylated mapkks, p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig>  were increased in all five brain regions, and much more dramatically .
swim stress specifically and markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of the mapkks p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig> in all brain regions tested without apparent alteration in the phosphorylation of p-mkk3/ <dig>  curiously, phosphorylation of their cognate substrates  was increased to a much more modest extent, and in some brain regions was not altered.
in addition, effects on the phosphorylation state of the upstream activators of the mapks, their respective mapk kinases , were determined.
possible explanations for these findings and comparison with the effects of restraint stress will be discussed.
in the present study, we investigated the effects of a different stressor, acute forced swim stress, on the phosphorylation  state of these mapks in the hippocampus, neocortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum.
a single  <dig> min session of forced swimming increased p-erk <dig> levels 2–3-fold in the neocortex, prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in the hippocampus or amygdala.
