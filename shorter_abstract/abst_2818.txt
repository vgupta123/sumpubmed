three steps were developed to differentiate human ipscs into chondrocytes which were transplanted into rat oa models induced by monosodium iodoacetate .
after 6 days embryonic body  formation and 2 weeks differentiation, the gene and protein expression of col2a <dig>  gag and sox <dig> has significantly increased compare to undifferentiated hipscs.
the incapacity of articular cartilage  for self-repair after damage ultimately leads to the development of osteoarthritis.
after 15 weeks transplantation, no immune responses were observed, micro-ct showed gradual engraftment and the improvement of subchondrol plate integrity, and histological examinations demonstrated articular cartilage matrix production.
