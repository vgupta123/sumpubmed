we apply the reconstructed ancestral sequences to homology inference and functional site prediction.
as a computational tool to reconstruct ancestral protein sequences from a given multiple sequence alignment, ancescon shows high accuracy in tests and helps detection of remote homologs and prediction of functional sites.
we show that the usage of hypothetical ancestors together with the present day sequences improves profile-based sequence similarity searches; and that ancestral sequence reconstruction methods can be used to predict positions with functional specificity.
comparisons show that at large evolutionary distances our method gives more accurate ancestral sequence reconstruction than paml, phylip and paup*.
to improve the accuracy of evolutionary distance estimation and ancestral sequence reconstruction, two approaches are proposed to estimate position-specific evolutionary rates.
we developed ancescon, a package for distance-based phylogenetic inference and reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences that takes into account the observed variation of evolutionary rates between positions that more precisely describes the evolution of protein families.
additionally, reconstructed ancestral protein sequences could serve to fill in sequence space thus aiding remote homology inference.
in silico reconstruction of such ancestral protein sequences facilitates our understanding of evolutionary processes, protein classification and biological function.
