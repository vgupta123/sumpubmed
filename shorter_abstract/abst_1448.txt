the more general aim of this study was to obtain a functional annotation of a substantial portion of the greenfinch transcriptome that would enable to gain access to more specific genomic tools in subsequent studies.
we used transcriptome profiling in wild greenfinches  to detect whole blood transcripts that most profoundly indicate upregulation of antimicrobial defences during acute phase response.
this appears to be the first large scale transcriptional profiling of immune function in passerine birds.
the extensive sequence information collected enables to identify possible target and housekeeping genes needed to gain access to more specific genomic tools in future studies.
the manipulation caused marked upregulation of several transcripts related to immune activation.
the birds received either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or saline injections and rna-seq transcriptional profiling was performed 12Â h after treatment to provide initial functional annotation of the transcriptome and assess whole blood response to immune stimulation.
these included avian-specific antimicrobial agents avidin and gallinacin, but also some more general host response genes, such as serum amyloid a protein, lymphocyte antigen  <dig> and copper-transporting atpase  <dig>  however, links with avian immunity for most differentially regulated transcripts remained rather hypothetical, as a large set of differentially expressed transcripts lacked functional annotation.
this requires development of biomarkers of the activation of the immune system so that they can be collected non-lethally and sampled from small amounts of easily obtainable tissue.
immunoecology aims to explain variation among hosts in the strength and efficacy of immunological defences in natural populations.
