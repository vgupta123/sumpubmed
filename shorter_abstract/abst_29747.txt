because the “acgt” sequence does not occur primarily in the yeast genome, this specificity of the “acgt” sequence cannot be attributed to chance.
replication-independent endogenous double-strand breaks  occur in both humans and yeast in the absence of inductive agents and dna replication.
because these particular mechanisms regulate their generation and they possess potentially specific functions, rind-edsbs could be epigenetic marks.
in human cells, rind-edsbs are hypermethylated, preferentially retained in the heterochromatin and unbound by γ-h2ax.
in this study, we sequenced rind-edsb pcr products of resting state saccharomyces cerevisiae using next-generation sequencing to analyze rind-edsb sequences.
