here we describe screenmill, a new software suite that automates image analysis and simplifies data review and analysis for high-throughput biological experiments.
the screenmill, software suite includes three software tools or "engines": an open source colony measurement engine  to quantitate colony growth data from plate images, a web-based data review engine  to validate and analyze quantitative screen data, and a web-based statistics visualization engine  to visualize screen data with statistical information overlaid.
many high-throughput genomic experiments, such as synthetic genetic array and yeast two-hybrid, use colony growth on solid media as a screen metric.
in addition, the dr engine and sv engine can be used to visualize and analyze other types of quantitative high-throughput data.
the algorithms implemented in screenmill are transparent allowing users to be confident about the results screenmill produces.
