for all analyses, the sensitivities at low false positive rates were observed together with estimates of the overall bias and the standard deviation.
recently, a large number of methods for the analysis of microarray data have been proposed but there are few comparisons of their relative performances.
the s-plus package edma, a stand-alone tool providing characterization of analyzed cdna-microarray data obtained from spike-in experiments, was developed and used to evaluate  <dig> normalization methods.
by using so-called spike-in experiments, it is possible to characterize the analyzed data and thereby enable comparisons of different analysis methods.
these methods gave considerable higher sensitivities than some commonly used analysis methods.
the use of spike-in experiments is a powerful approach for evaluating microarray preprocessing procedures.
many of the analyses had relatively low sensitivities, but analyses that used either the constrained model  or partial filtration  had with few exceptions high sensitivities.
if bias is not a major problem; we recommend the use of either the cm-procedure or partial filtration.
a spike-in experiment using eight in-house produced arrays was used to evaluate established and novel methods for filtration, background adjustment, scanning, channel adjustment, and censoring.
moreover, the bias depended on the underlying mrna-concentration; low concentration resulted in high bias.
