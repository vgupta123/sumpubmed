at the nomenclature section of the xviii international botanical congress in melbourne, australia , the botanical community voted to allow electronic publication of nomenclatural acts for algae, fungi and plants, and to abolish the rule requiring latin descriptions or diagnoses for new taxa.
the data show that the ability to publish electronically has not “opened the floodgates” to an avalanche of sloppy nomenclature, but concomitantly neither has there been a massive expansion in the number of names published, nor of new authors and titles participating in publication of botanical nomenclature.
using data on vascular plants from the international plant names index  spanning the time period in which these changes occurred, we analysed trajectories in publication trends and assessed the impact of these new rules for descriptions of new species and nomenclatural acts.
since the 1st january  <dig>  botanists have been able to publish new names in electronic journals and may use latin or english as the language of description or diagnosis.

the e-publication changes introduced in the melbourne code have gained acceptance, and botanists are using these new techniques to describe and publish their work.
