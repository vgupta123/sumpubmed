a cross-analysis of a rationally designed panel of rna binding and atpase mutants and truncated receptors, using type i ifn promoter activation as readout, allows us to refine our understanding of the structure-function relationships of rig-i and mda <dig>  rna activation of rig-i depends on multiple critical rna binding sites in its helicase domain as confirmed by functional evidence using novel mutations.
whereas simultaneous atp and cognate rna binding is sufficient to activate rig-i by releasing autoinhibition of the signaling domains, the physiological role of the atpase activity of rig-i and mda <dig> remains controversial.
we propose that the turnover kinetics of the atpase domain enables the discrimination of self/non-self rna by both rig-i and mda <dig>  non-cognate, possibly self, rna binding would lead to fast atp turnover and rna disassociation and thus insufficient time for the caspase activation and recruitment domains  to promote downstream signaling, whereas tighter cognate rna binding provides a longer time window for downstream events to be engaged.
however, in vitro, they can bind to many rna species, while in cells there is an activation threshold.
as sf <dig> helicase/atpase family members, atp hydrolysis is dependent on co-operative rna and atp binding.
we found that rig-i or mda <dig> mutants with low atp hydrolysis activity exhibit constitutive activity but this was fully reverted when associated with mutations preventing rna binding to the helicase domain.
the exquisite fine-tuning of rig-i and mda <dig> rna-dependent atpase activity coupled to card release allows a robust ifn response from a minor subset of non-self rnas within a sea of cellular self rnas.
