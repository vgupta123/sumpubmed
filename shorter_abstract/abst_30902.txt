we report that the verification-based estimators are meaningful in the light of a feed forward between computational medicine and clinical bioinformatics.

firstly, we performed meta-analysis on a gene expression data of normal, osteoporotic and osteomyelitis bone conditions.
using information from the gene expression data we estimated parameters for a novel model of osteoporosis and of osteomyelitis.
on the other hand, osteoporosis is not a bacterial infection but similarly is a defective bone pathology arising due to imbalances in the rank/rankl/opg molecular pathway, and due to the progressive weakening of bone structure.
the infection rapidly leads to severe bone loss, necrosis of the affected portion, and it may even spread to other parts of the body.
since both osteoporosis and osteomyelitis cause loss of bone mass, we focused on comparing the dynamics of these diseases by means of computational models.
we mainly focused on rankl/opg signalling, the tnf and tnf receptor superfamilies and the nf-kb pathway.
we present a modeling framework able to reproduce aspects of the different bone remodeling defective dynamics of osteomyelitis and osteoporosis.
