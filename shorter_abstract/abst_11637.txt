here, we established cultures of schwann cell-free oecs from olfactory bulb  and mucosa  and compared them in assays to schwann cells.
so far, few investigations have tested different glial cell types within the same study under identical conditions.
all three glial cell types displayed phagocytic activity in a microbead assay.
these glial cultures were obtained from a canine large animal model and used for monitoring migration, phagocytosis and the effects on in vitro neurite growth.
transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells  and schwann cells  is a promising therapeutic strategy to promote axonal growth and remyelination after spinal cord injury.
moreover, potential contamination of oec preparations with schwann cells was difficult to exclude.
ob-oecs and schwann cells migrated faster than om-oecs in a scratch wound assay.
ob-oecs migrate faster and enhance neurite growth of human model neurons better than schwann cells, suggesting distinct and inherent properties of these closely-related cell types.
previous studies mainly focused on the rat model though results from primate and porcine models differed from those in the rat model.
interestingly, canine oecs show primate-like in vitro characteristics, such as absence of early senescence and abundance of stable p75ntr expression indicating that this species represents a valuable translational species for further studies.
glial cell migration was not modulated by cgmp and camp signaling, but activating protein kinase c enhanced motility.
