molecular switch systems that activate gene expression by a small molecule are effective technologies that are widely used in applied biological research.
this work focuses on characterizing a molecular switch system that quantitatively controls transgene expression.
previously, our group engineered a variant of the retinoid × receptor to be responsive to the synthetic compound, lg <dig>  but not responsive to its natural ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid.
this system is composed of an orthogonal ligand/nuclear receptor pair, lg <dig> and grqcimfi, along with an artificial promoter controlling expression of a target transgene.
the developed one-component system activates transgene expression when introduced transiently or virally.
we have successfully shown that this system can induce tightly controlled transgene expression and can be used for transient transfections or retroviral transductions in mammalian cell culture.
nuclear receptors are valuable candidates for these regulation systems due to their functional role as ligand activated transcription factors.
grqcimfi is composed of the fusion of the dna binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, gal <dig>  and a retinoid × receptor variant.
