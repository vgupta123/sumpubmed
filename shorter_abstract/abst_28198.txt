these strains were used to explore the process of recombination in chlamydia spp., including analysis of candidate recombination hotspots, and to correlate known c. trachomatis in vitro phenotypes with parental phenotypes and genotypes.
there was no evidence for preference for any specific region of the chromosome for recombination, and analyses of a total of over  <dig> individual recombination events do not provide any support for recombination hotspots in vitro.
there was a single deletion event in one recombinant progeny that resulted in the removal of  <dig>  kilobases between two rrna operons.
second, the formation of secondary inclusions within cells varied among recombinant progeny, but this did not cleanly segregate to specific regions of the chromosome.
these experiments examined the process of recombination in c. trachomatis and identified tools that can be used to associate phenotype with genotype in recombinant progeny.
first, the efficiency of attachment to host cells in the absence of centrifugation was examined, and this property segregated to regions of the chromosome that carry the polymorphic membrane protein  genes.
each of the  <dig> examined recombination events was the product of homologous recombination, and no candidate targeting motifs were identified at recombination sites.
