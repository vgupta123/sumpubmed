except for the distal leg, the total sweat volume measured at the other three sites had a significant correlation with bmi.
in terms of gender, men had larger total sweat volume, with median differences at the forearm, proximal leg, distal leg, and foot of  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl, and  <dig>  μl, respectively.
median differences at the forearm, proximal leg, distal leg, and foot were  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl,  <dig>  μl, and  <dig>  μl, respectively.
q-sweat is a model used for evaluating the post-ganglionic sudomotor function by assessing sweat response.
this is the first report to show the normative database of sweat response in chinese participants evaluated using q-sweat device.
skin temperature and sweat onset latency measured at the four sites  did not significantly correlate with age, gender, body height , body weight , and body mass index  but the total sweat volume measured in all four sites significantly correlated with sex, bh, and bw.

regarding bw difference , those with bw ≥ <dig> kg had larger total sweat volume.
this study aimed to establish the normative database of q-sweat test among chinese individuals since this type of information is currently lacking.
this normative database can help guide further research on post-ganglionic sudomotor or related clinical practice involving a chinese population.
there was an uneven distribution of male and female participants in the two bw groups.
in all conditions, the total sweat volume recorded at the foot site was the smallest.
