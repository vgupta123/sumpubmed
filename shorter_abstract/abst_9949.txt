profile snps were selected which, compared to the reference strain hm-1:imss sequence, changed an encoded amino acid at the snp position, and were present in independent e. histolytica isolates from different geographical origins.
to probe the population structure of e. histolytica and identify genetic markers associated with clinical outcome we identified in e. histolytica positive samples selected single nucleotide polymorphisms  by multiplexed massive parallel sequencing.
in phylogenetic trees, only four of the  <dig> samples were able to group in two sets of two with greater than 50% confidence.
an e. histolytica multilocus genotyping system based on trna gene-linked arrays has shown that genetic differences exist among parasites isolated from patients with different symptoms however, the trna gene-linked arrays cannot be located in the current assembly of the e. histolytica reference genome  and are highly variable.
the samples used in this study contained dna isolated from either xenic strains of e. histolytica trophozoites established in culture or e. histolytica positive clinical specimens .
our work is in agreement with previous findings of extensive diversity among e. histolytica isolates from the same geographic origin.
this study demonstrated that there are genetic differences between virulent and avirulent e. histolytica strains and that this approach has the potential to define genetic changes that influence infection outcomes.
