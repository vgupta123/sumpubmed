cpe116– <dig> provides an efficient tool for single step enrichment of different claudins from cell lysates.
relative mass spectrometric protein quantification with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture  made it possible to discriminate specific binding from non-specific association to gst and/or matrix material.
immunoblotting and mass spectrometry  experiments demonstrate strong enrichment of the cpe-binding claudins - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  indicating specific association with glutathione-s-transferase -cpe116– <dig> fusion protein.
claudins, a family of protein localized in tight junctions, are essential for the control of paracellular permeation in epithelia and endothelia.
numerous proteins were shown to be co-enriched with the cpe-binding claudins, but there are no indications  for an association with tight junctions.
the interaction of several claudins with clostridium perfringens enterotoxin  has been exploited for an affinity-based enrichment of cpe-binding claudins from lysates of normal rat cholangiocytes.
