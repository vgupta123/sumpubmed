it improves the calibration coefficients by applying a two-dimensional thin plate splines  smoothing algorithm.
we demonstrate that a pmf data set can be calibrated without resorting to external or relying on widely occurring internal calibrants.
the methods developed here were implemented in r and are part of the bioconductor package mscalib available from .
it computes a multiple peak-list alignment of the data set using a modified minimum spanning tree  algorithm.
the second method exploits the idea that hundreds of ms samples are measured in parallel on one sample support.
the tps based calibration algorithm might be used to correct systematic mass measurement errors observed for large ms sample supports.
the pmf process requires calibration, usually performed with external or internal calibrants of known molecular masses.
we studied the novel calibration methods utilising data generated by three different maldi-tof-ms instruments.
the first method utilises the local similarity of peptide maps generated after separation of complex protein samples by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
the mst calibration algorithm is well suited to calibrate ms spectra of protein samples resulting from two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation.
