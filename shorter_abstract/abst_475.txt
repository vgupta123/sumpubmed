the inability to culture icm cells as stem cells in the presence of an inhibitor of mapk activity together with the reported data indicates that mapk inhibition alone is not sufficient to maintain a pluripotent character in bovine cells.
to investigate which genes are involved in bovine pluripotency, expression profiles were generated from morula, blastocyst, trophectoderm and inner cell mass  samples using microarray analysis.
as mapk inhibition can increase the nanog/gata <dig> ratio in the inner cell mass, additionally blastocysts were cultured in the presence of a mapk inhibitor and changes in gene expression in the inner cell mass were analysed.
although nanog expression was elevated upon mapk inhibition, sox <dig> and pou5f <dig> expression showed little increase.
expression of other genes in the mapk pathway including dusp <dig> and spry <dig>  or influenced by mapk inhibition such as ifnt, was down-regulated.
genes expressed at higher levels in the icm were enriched in the rna splicing and regulation of gene expression go term.
the data obtained from the microarray studies provide further insight in gene expression during bovine embryonic development.
they show an expression profile in pluripotent cells that indicates a pluripotent, epiblast-like state.
genes with higher expression levels in morulae were enriched in the rna processing go term.
