the method was tested on genotype-resistance data for mutants of hiv protease and reverse transcriptase.
the approach of encoding the protein structure and sequence as a 210-dimensional vector, based on delaunay triangulation, has promise as an accurate method for predicting resistance from sequence for drugs inhibiting hiv protease and reverse transcriptase.
prediction of resistance from genotype data is a valuable guide in choice of drugs for effective therapy.
in order to improve the computational prediction of resistance from genotype data we have developed a unified encoding of the protein sequence and three-dimensional protein structure of the drug target for classification and regression analysis.
drug resistance has become a severe challenge for treatment of hiv infections.
cross-validated regression analysis with the sparse dictionary gave excellent correlation between predicted and observed resistance.
our graph based sequence-structure approach gives high accuracy with a new sparse dictionary classification method, as well as support vector machine and artificial neural networks classifiers.
