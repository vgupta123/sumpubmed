here, we describe a community-driven effort, in which more than  <dig> experts in s. typhimurium biology and systems biology collaborated to reconcile and expand the s. typhimurium bigg knowledge-base.
the consensus mr was obtained starting from two independently developed mrs for s. typhimurium.
metabolic reconstructions  are common denominators in systems biology and represent biochemical, genetic, and genomic  knowledge-bases for target organisms by capturing currently available information in a consistent, structured manner.
key results of this reconstruction jamboree include i) development and implementation of a community-based workflow for mr annotation and reconciliation; ii) incorporation of thermodynamic information; and iii) use of the consensus mr to identify potential multi-target drug therapy approaches.
taken together, with the growing number of parallel mrs a structured, community-driven approach will be necessary to maximize quality while increasing adoption of mrs in experimental design and interpretation.
