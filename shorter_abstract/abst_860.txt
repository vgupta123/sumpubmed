gene set analysis  is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge.
however, previous gsa methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.
gage shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used gsa methods of gsea and page.
gage consistently outperformed two most frequently used gsa methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways.
the gage method is implemented in r in the "gage" package, available under the gnu gpl from .
gage reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies.
we successfully apply gage to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques.
gage is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs.
gsa focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance.
for a previously unpublished bmp <dig> study, gage predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical bmp-tgf beta signaling, jak-stat signaling, wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathwaysâ€“all of which are supported by the experimental literature.
we demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects:  consistency across repeated studies/experiments;  sensitivity and specificity;  biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.
to address these limitations, we present a new gsa method called generally applicable gene-set enrichment .
