as the semantic web is being introduced into the life sciences, the basis for a distributed knowledge-base that can foster biological data analysis is laid.
in particular, we present two examples relative to ontologies representing biological pathways: we demonstrate how these can be abstracted and visualized as interaction networks, and how reasoning on causal dependencies within elements of pathways can be implemented.
we show with this plugin how the use of ontological knowledge in biological analysis can be extended through the use of inference.
the recent availability of high-throughput data in molecular biology has increased the need for a formal representation of this knowledge domain.
rdfscape is a plugin that has been developed to extend a software oriented to biological analysis with support for reasoning on ontologies in the semantic web framework.
however, there still is a dichotomy, in tools and methodologies, between the use of ontologies in biological investigation, that is, in relation to experimental observations, and their use as a knowledge-base.
