in situ hybridization  is a powerful method for visualizing gene expression patterns at the organismal level with cellular resolution.
the expression patterns of  <dig> genes that encode enzymes were determined by ish in the mid-gestation mouse embryo, a stage that models the complexity of the adult organism.
the annotated expression patterns were deposited on the genepaint database and are retrievable by user-defined queries including gene name and sites of expression.
the  <dig> expression patterns discussed here comprised gene products with activities associated with catalysis.
many mrnas encoding glycolytic and tca cycle enzymes exhibited a characteristic expression pattern.
forty-five percent of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes  showed a regional expression pattern.
we found no difference in tissue specificity between mrnas encoding housekeeping functions and those encoding components of signal transduction pathways, as exemplified by the kinases.
