the balance between immune stimulation and tolerance is particularly important at mucosal interfaces, where discrimination between dangerous pathogens and innocuous antigens takes place.
the dc isolated from tonsil were a mixed population containing both myeloid and plasmacytoid dc, but all showed similar responses.
to examine this, tonsil dc were isolated and cultured with potent dc activators; ifnγ, anti-cd <dig> antibody, lps and poly i:c either singly or in combination.
tonsil dc released il12p <dig> upon stimulation with ifnγ , anti-cd <dig> antibody, and lps, but unlike monocyte-derived dc, they did not increase the expression of cell surface activation molecules above those induced by culture alone.
poly i:c, a potent stimulator of laboratory generated dc inhibited the activation of tonsil dc by other adjuvants.
dendritic cells  play the key role in directing antigen-specific immune responses and manipulating their function may be a useful tool for immunotherapy.
