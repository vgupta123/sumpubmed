using a combination of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that the morphological switch occurs in less than 27 h, with phenotypic cell modifications being detected within the first 4 h. using rnaseq, we found that over 22% of the genome of o. novo-ulmi is differentially expressed during the transition.

yeast-to-hypha transition is a major morphological change in fungi.
further, we found that several genes that are homologous to s. cerevisiae mapk genes are regulated during the yeast-to-hypha transition in o. novo-ulmi and mostly over-expressed, suggesting convergence in gene expression regulation.
our results are the first report of a time-course experiment monitoring the morphological transition in a non-model sordariomycota species and reveal many genes of interest for further functional investigations of fungal dimorphism.
here, we investigate cell remodeling and transcriptomic modifications that occur during this morphological switch in the highly aggressive ascomycete fungus ophiostoma novo-ulmi, the causal agent of dutch elm disease.
molecular regulators and pathways that are involved in this process have been extensively studied in model species, including saccharomyces cerevisiae.
