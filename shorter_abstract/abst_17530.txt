both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> contribute to the negative regulation of leprb signaling.
here we have studied the roles of the intracellular tyrosine residues in the negative feedback regulation of leprb-signaling under chronic leptin stimulation.
mutational analysis showed that the presence of either tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in the intracellular domain of leprb was sufficient for the attenuation of stat <dig> phosphorylation, whereas mutation of both tyrosines rendered leprb resistant to feedback regulation.
the inhibitory effects of socs <dig> and socs <dig> differ in the dependence on the tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of leprb.
leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts via its hypothalamic receptor  to regulate energy balance.
in contrast, the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> was enhanced by the presence of tyr <dig> but not tyr <dig>  finally, the reduction of the stat-phosphorylating activity of the leprb complex after  <dig> h of leptin stimulation was not accompanied by the dephosphorylation or degradation of leprb or the receptor-associated jak molecule, but depended on tyr <dig> and/or tyr <dig>
