different selection methods  omit different rnas, resulting in different fractions of the transcriptome being sequenced.
a combination of reference transcriptome filtering and a ratio-based correction can create equivalent expression profiles from both polya-selected and rrna-depleted libraries.
gene-level expression estimates were obtained using a two-part process centred on the high-speed transcript quantification tool kallisto.
firstly, a set of reference transcripts was defined that constitute a standardised rna space, with expression from both datasets quantified against it.
using these approaches, previous rna-seq datasets could potentially be processed and integrated with newly sequenced libraries.
the method was developed by comparing two rna-seq datasets from ovine macrophages, identical except for rna selection method.
this approach will allow meta-analysis and integration of existing rna-seq data into transcriptional atlas projects.
this study aimed to develop a systematic means of accounting for library type that allows data from these two methods to be compared.
the outcome is an almost perfect correlation between gene expression estimates, independent of library type and across the full range of levels of expression.
