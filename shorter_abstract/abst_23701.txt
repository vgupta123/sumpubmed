a higher seroprevalence was found in pigs in herds in central and northern china, which may correspond to the greater use of the intensive production systems in these areas.
the apparent seroprevalence of l. intracellularis seropositivity was 57% .
the prevalence of l. intracellularis seropositivity in local breed pigs was significantly less than that in imported breeds.
the aim of the current study was to estimate the seroprevalence of l. intracellularis antibodies in intensive pig farms in china.
antibodies against l. intracellularis were detected using a specific blocking elisa.
we conclude that l. intracellularis is widely prevalent in commercial pigs in china.
the highest true prevalence was observed in sows and boars, suggesting that within a herd these stock classes are a reservoir for infection.
animals from all age groups were sampled including pre-weaning piglets, weaners, fattening pigs, adult sows and boars.
the true prevalence  was 77% .
porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by lawsonia intracellularis  is a major concern to the pig industry worldwide.
