in transcriptomic studies, fwer should not be critical, as analyses at higher levels would not be influenced by a few false positives.
microarray technology has enabled the measurement of comprehensive transcriptomic information.
additionally, the concerns for fdr are not suitable for the sharp null hypotheses on expression levels.
unexpectedly, however, the appropriateness of the test methodologies, the concerns of multiplicity, and the compensation methodologies have not been sufficiently confirmed.
rather, the results of parametric tests should be evaluated directly.
these characteristics are inconsistent with premises underlying the compensation methodologies, which assume that most of the null hypotheses are true.
therefore, although compensation methods have been recommended to deal with the problem of multiplicity, the compensations are actually inappropriate for transcriptome analyses.

therefore, the certainty of each observed difference should be confirmed at earlier steps of the analyses, and statistical tests are frequently used for this purpose.
however, each data entry may reflect trivial individual differences among samples and also contain technical noise.
compensations are not only unnecessary, but will increase the occurrence of false negative errors, and arbitrary adjustment of the threshold damages the objectivity of the tests.
