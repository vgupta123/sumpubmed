previous studies have indicated that a number of transcription factors modulate the transcriptome in successive waves during meiosis and spore formation in fission yeast.
interestingly, spo <dig> is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the rae1-dependent mrna export pathway, but is unlikely to be involved in global mrna export.
furthermore, cytoplasmic localization of spo <dig> is important for its function, which suggests the involvement of spo <dig> in post-transcriptional regulation.
spo <dig> is exported from the nucleus with mrnas via the rae1-dependent pathway.
gene encodes a meiosis-specific rna-binding protein, which is required for the progression of meiosis ii and spore formation.
mrna, and the mechanism of how spo <dig> stimulates the mrna to promote the progression of meiosis ii and spore formation remains an intriguing question for future research.
mrna as one of the critical targets of spo <dig>  the pcr1
to assess the functional significance of rna-recognition motifs  of spo <dig>  we constructed a series of new spo <dig> truncated mutants and previously reported spo <dig> missense mutants.
however, the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation in meiosis are not fully understood.
characterization of meiosis-specific rna-binding proteins will provide insight into how post-transcriptional regulation influence gene expression during sexual differentiation.
