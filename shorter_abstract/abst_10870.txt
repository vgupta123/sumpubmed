to assess the effectiveness of emergency vaccination for reducing the contact-induced infection and pathological damage caused by the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , twenty pigs were equally divided into four groups.
these results indicated that emergency vaccination could effectively alleviate hpprrsv infection during experimental contact exposure.
higher serum ifn-γ levels were detected among the pigs that received emergency immunisation.
thus, ifn-γ may be involved in immunity against hpprrsv infection.
the rectal temperatures, clinical signs, pathologic lesions and viraemia of the piglets were detected and evaluated.
