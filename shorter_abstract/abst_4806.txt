we characterized likely orthologs of zonadhesin in both t. rubripes and d. rerio and uncovered zonadhesin-like genes in s. salar and d. rerio.
the expression patterns of fish zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes suggest that the reproductive role of zonadhesin evolved later in the mammalian lineage.
analysis of puffer fish  and zebrafish  sequence data identified zonadhesin  genes that share the same domain order, content, and a conserved syntenic relationship with mammalian zonadhesin.
the genomic structure and testes-specific expression of zonadhesin is known for many mammalian species.
zlg is similar in adhesion domain content to mammalian zonadhesin; however, the domain order is altered.
here we investigate the genomic structure and expression of zonadhesin-like genes in three species of fish.
the cdna and corresponding genomic locus of a zonadhesin-like gene  in atlantic salmon  were sequenced.
unlike mammalian zonadhesin, d. rerio zan and s. salar zlg were expressed in the gut and not in the testes.
all zonadhesin genes characterized to date consist of meprin a <dig> antigen receptor tyrosine phosphatase mu  domains, mucin tandem repeats, and von willebrand  adhesion domains.
each of these genes contains mam, mucin, and vwd domains.
a zonadhesin-like gene in d. rerio was also identified.
while these domains are associated with several proteins that show prominent gut expression, their combination is unique to zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes in vertebrates.
