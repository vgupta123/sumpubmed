significant amounts of scfve2/p <dig> were released in the extracellular medium of bv-infected cells in high-molecular weight, pelletable form.
expression of scfve2/p <dig> in insect cells using a bv vector resulted in baculoviral progeny displaying scfve2/p <dig>  the function required for bv envelope incorporation was carried by the n-terminal octadecapeptide of scfve2/p <dig>  which acted as a signal peptide for bv display.
this particulate form corresponded to bv particles displaying scfve2/p <dig> molecules, inserted into the bv envelope via the scfv n-terminal region.
cells permissive to virus can become refractory to viral replication upon intracellular expression of single chain fragment variable  antibodies directed towards viral structural or regulatory proteins, or virus-coded enzymes.
for example, an intrabody derived from mh-svm <dig>  a monoclonal antibody against a conserved c-terminal epitope of the hiv- <dig> matrix protein , was found to exert an inhibitory effect on hiv- <dig> replication.
the bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> molecules were found to be immunologically functional, as they reacted with the c-terminal epitope of map <dig>  fusion of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid residues from the scfve2/p <dig> sequence  to another scfv recognizing cd <dig>  conferred the property of bv-display to the resulting chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig>
fusion of this peptide to the n-terminus of scfv molecules of interest could be applied as a general method for bv-display of scfv in a gp64- and vsv-g-independent manner.
