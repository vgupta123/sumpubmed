arabidopsis thaliana is known to encode a family of five profilin sequence variants: three vegetative  profilins that are predominantly expressed in all vegetative tissues and ovules, and two reproductive profilins that are specifically expressed in pollen.
these plants displayed significantly compounded developmental defects, as well as distinct lateral root growth morphological phenotypes.
to further examine these effects, double mutants and double and triple gene-silenced rnai epialleles were created.
the actin cytoskeleton is involved in an array of integral structural and developmental processes throughout the cell.
these results suggest that having at least one vegetative profilin gene is essential to viability.
evidence is presented that combinations of independent function, quantitative genetic effects, and functional redundancy have preserved the three vegetative profilin genes in the arabidopsis lineage.
