the annotation includes gene identification and orientation on dna strand, description of the v, d and j genes by assigning imgt® labels, gene functionality, and finally, gene delimitation and cluster assembly.
owing to the particularities of ig and tr gene structures related to these molecular mechanisms, conventional bioinformatic software and tools are not adapted to the identification and description of ig and tr genes in large genomic sequences.
imgt/ligmotif currently annotates human and mouse ig and tr loci in large genomic sequences.
the antigen receptors, immunoglobulins  and t cell receptors , are specific molecular components of the adaptive immune response of vertebrates.
in order to answer that need, imgt®, the international immunogenetics information system®, has developed imgt/ligmotif, a tool for ig and tr gene annotation.
synthesis of the ig and tr proteins requires rearrangements of v and j, or v, d and j genes at the dna level, followed by the splicing at the rna level of the rearranged v-j and v-d-j genes to c genes.
