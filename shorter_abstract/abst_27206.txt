our work suggests that b. pertussis adapted by successive accumulation of snps and by gene activation.
to elucidate how b. pertussis has adapted to vaccination, we compared genome sequences of two ptxp <dig> strains with four strains isolated before and after the introduction vaccination.
compared to ptxp <dig> strains, ptxp <dig> produce more ptx resulting in increased virulence and immune suppression.
the resurgence of pertussis has been associated with the expansion of bordetella pertussis strains with a novel allele for the pertussis toxin  promoter, ptxp <dig>  which have replaced resident ptxp <dig> strains.
the distribution of snps in regions involved in transcription and translation suggested that changes in gene regulation play an important role in adaptation.
in particular changes in gene regulation may have played a role in adaptation.
modern strains differed significantly from prevaccination strains, both phylogenetically and with respect to particular alleles.
no evidence was found for acquisition of novel genes.
it remains a major cause of infant death worldwide and is the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries.
