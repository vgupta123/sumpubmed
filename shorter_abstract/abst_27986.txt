due to experiment ethics, research interests of biologists and resources limitations, homologous genes from different species currently are annotated with different terms.
it is positively correlated with the similarity derived from various types of biological data and has been applied to predict gene function.
our study shows that semantic similarity based interspecies gene function annotation from homologous species is more prominent than traditional intraspecies approaches.

gene ontology  is a collaborative project that maintains and develops controlled vocabulary  to describe the molecular function, biological roles and cellular location of gene products in a hierarchical ontology.
the experimental results demonstrate that:  semantic similarity between genes from homologous species contributes much more on the improved accuracy  than genes from single species alone, and genes from two species with low homology;  go annotations of genes from homologous species are complementary to each other.
for this investigation, we utilize three representative semantic similarity metrics to compute similarity between genes from two species.
go consortium independently and collaboratively annotate terms to gene products, mainly from model organisms  they are interested in.
semantic similarity between genes is derived from go hierarchy and annotations of genes.
in this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to replenish annotations of incompletely annotated genes by using semantic similarity between genes from two species with homology.
we perform experiments on archived  go annotations of four species  to assess the contribution of semantic similarity between genes from different species.
this work can promote more research on semantic similarity based function prediction across species.
next, we determine the k nearest neighborhood genes from the two species based on the chosen metric and then use terms annotated to k neighbors of a gene to replenish annotations of that gene.
