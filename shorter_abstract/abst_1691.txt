six candidate proteins are suggested to be involved in the virulence of y. pseudotuberculosis, none of which have previously been implicated in the virulence of y. pseudotuberculosis and three have no record of involvement in the virulence of any bacteria.
using phylogenetic profiles of protein clusters from completed microbial genome sequences, we identified seventeen protein candidates that are common to diverse human pathogens and absent or uncommon in non-pathogens.
mutants of  <dig> of these candidates were successfully generated in yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the potential role of the proteins in virulence was assayed in an animal model.
new and improved antimicrobial countermeasures are urgently needed to counteract increased resistance to existing antimicrobial treatments and to combat currently untreatable or new emerging infectious diseases.
