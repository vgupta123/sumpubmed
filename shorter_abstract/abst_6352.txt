in tobacco, these mybs were shown to induce the anthocyanin pathway when co-expressed with bhlhs, while over-expression of strawberry and apple genes in the crop of origin elevates anthocyanins.
in apple fruit, skin anthocyanin levels are controlled by a gene called myba or myb <dig>  while the gene determining fruit flesh and foliage anthocyanin has been termed myb <dig>  in order to further understand tissue-specific anthocyanin regulation we have isolated orthologous myb genes from all the commercially important rosaceous species.
it has implications for the development of new coloured fruit and flowers, as well as aiding the understanding of temporal-spatial colour change.
myb transcription factors, with high sequence identity to the apple gene were isolated from across the rosaceous family .
