we were able to map these ctfbss to promoters of  <dig> of the  <dig> new candidate estrogen responsive escc genes, thereby increasing confidence that these  <dig> escc genes are responsive to estrogen since their promoters contain both: a/mapped eres, and b/at least four ctfbss characteristic of escc genes that are responsive to estrogen.
eres mapped to the promoter sequence of  <dig> %  of escc genes of which  <dig> %  are known to be estrogen responsive, while  <dig> %  are new candidate estrogen responsive genes.
we believe that our results provide useful information for those interested in genes responsive to hormones and in the design of hormone-based therapies.
our study develops a systems biology methodology using esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  as a model to identify estrogen responsive genes.
by analyzing transcription factor binding sites  in the promoters of the  <dig>  known estrogen responsive escc genes under study, we found that their regulatory potential may be characterized by  <dig> significantly over-represented co-localized tfbss .
to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to use a cancer disease model as the framework to identify hormone responsive genes.
moreover, several groups have reported the importance of estrogen induced gene regulation in esophageal cancer .
recent publications confirm that 47%  of these  <dig> predicted genes are indeed responsive to estrogen.
the efficient design of estrogen therapies requires as complete as possible list of genes responsive to estrogen.
putative estrogen responsive elements  mapped to the promoter region of the escc genes were used to initially identify candidate estrogen responsive genes.
of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> %  are known to be estrogen responsive.
eres did not map to  <dig> escc genes.
