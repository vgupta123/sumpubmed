in recent years, there have been several sialome projects revealing transcripts expressed in the salivary glands of ticks, which are important vectors of several human diseases.
additionally, our results corroborate previous evidence of gene duplication in the evolution of ticks.
in addition to a large number of homologues of the known transcripts, we obtained several novel predicted protein sequences.
in the attempt to describe expressed genes and their dynamics throughout the feeding period, we constructed cdna libraries from four different feeding stages of ixodes ricinus females: unfed,  <dig> hours after attachment, four  and seven days  after attachment.
here, we focused on the sialome of the european vector of lyme disease, ixodes ricinus.
our work contributes to the growing list of proteins associated with tick feeding and sheds more light on the dynamics of the gene expression during tick feeding.
