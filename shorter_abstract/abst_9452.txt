in our previous study, mouse mscs  were implanted into the brains of apoe null mice, resulting in production of small amounts of apoe in the brain and attenuation of cognitive deficits.
mesenchymal stem cells or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  are adult progenitor cells found in numerous tissues.
therefore human mscs  are a promising vector for the administration of apoe ε <dig> in humans.
pparγ agonists, neural stem cell conditioned medium, osteo-inductive media, dexamethasone, and adipo-inductive media  were tested.
they are easily expanded in culture and engraft into host tissues when administered appropriately.
apolipoprotein e  is a molecular scavenger in the blood and brain.
the data demonstrated that pre-treatment and perhaps co-administration of mscs homozygous for apoe ε <dig> and dexamethasone may represent a novel therapy for severe instances of ad, atherosclerosis and other apoe-related diseases.
upon withdrawal of the inductive stimuli, the apoe secretion persisted for a further  <dig> days.
