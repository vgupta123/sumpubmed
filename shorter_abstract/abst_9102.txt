this paper describes classification models that were constructed to predict which fixed-ratio mixtures created from a pool of  <dig> drugs would show a high degree of in-vitro synergism against h <dig> human lung cancer cells.
useful classification models can be constructed to predict drug synergism, even in those situations where a limited subset of component drugs can be tested.
explanatory variables were based on virtual docking profiles.
results were compared to models where explanatory variables were constructed using the pseudomolecule approach of sheridan.
one of the tested drugs was doxorubicin and the others were natural compounds including quercetin, curcumin, and egcg.
the cytotoxicity of all  <dig> drugs and of  <dig> of the  <dig>  possible mixtures was tested in the laboratory and synergism indices were generated using the mixlow method.
this distinction may become important as virtual docking software becomes more accurate and docking results more closely resemble actual binding affinities.
safer and more effective mixtures of anticancer drugs are needed, and modeling can assist in this endeavor.
precision for a nonstandard leave-many-out cross validation procedure was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the negative and positive classes, respectively.
compared to the pseudomolecule approach, the virtual docking approach has the advantage of greater potential for biologic interpretation.
