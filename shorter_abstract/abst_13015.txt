the phenotypic microarray data indicates that m. phaseolina can adapt to a wide range of osmotic and ph environments.
we sequenced and assembled ~49â€‰mb into  <dig> super-scaffolds covering  <dig> % of the m. phaseolina genome.
the m. phaseolina genome provides a framework of the infection process at the cytological and molecular level which uses a diverse arsenal of enzymatic and toxin tools to destroy the host plants.
further understanding of the m. phaseolina genome-based plant-pathogen interactions will be instrumental in designing rational strategies for disease control, essential to ensuring global agricultural crop production and security.
as a broad host range pathogen, m. phaseolina possesses a large number of pathogen-host interaction genes including those for adhesion, signal transduction, cell wall breakdown, purine biosynthesis, and potent mycotoxin patulin.
to overcome the host plant defense response, m. phaseolina encodes a significant number of p450s, mfs type membrane transporters, glycosidases, transposases, and secondary metabolites in comparison to all sequenced ascomycete species.
a strikingly distinct set of carbohydrate esterases  are present in m. phaseolina, with the ce <dig> and ce <dig> families remarkably higher than any other fungi.
macrophomina phaseolina is one of the most destructive necrotrophic fungal pathogens that infect more than  <dig> plant species throughout the world.
this phytopathogen has an abundance of secreted oxidases, peroxidases, and hydrolytic enzymes for degrading cell wall polysaccharides and lignocelluloses to penetrate into the host tissue.
