between 2005– <dig> a series of s. typhimurium outbreaks occurred in tasmania, australia, that were all traced to eggs originating from a single chicken farm.
we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> isolates linked to these outbreaks, in order to investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic s. typhimurium clone in a natural, spatiotemporally restricted population.
the isolates, which shared a phage type similar to dt <dig> known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a clade within the s. typhimurium population with close similarity to the reference genome sl <dig> .
ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone  which likely represents the population of s. typhimurium circulating at the chicken farm; the other two were from sporadic cases and were genetically distinct from this clone.
divergence dating indicated that all  <dig> isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid 1990s, and the clone began to diversify in 2003– <dig>  this clone spilled out into the human population several times between 2005– <dig>  during which time it continued to accumulate snps at a constant rate of 3– <dig> snps per year or 1x10- <dig> substitutions site-1 year- <dig>  faster than the longer-term  rates estimated previously for s. typhimurium.
our data suggest that roughly half of non-synonymous substitutions are rapidly removed from the s. typhimurium population, after which purifying selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions become fixed in the population.
the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates were nearly identical to sl <dig> in terms of gene content and virulence plasmids.
two additional plasmids were identified in the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates, pstm <dig> and pstm <dig>  both plasmids were inci <dig>  but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts shows these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events.
this study provides a high-resolution insight into short-term microevolution of the important human pathogen s. typhimurium.
