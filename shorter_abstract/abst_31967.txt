taking advantage of various tools and databases, putative functions were assigned to  <dig>  of these genes.
clustering and assembly identified a set of  <dig> different transcripts denoted the avena sativa cold induced unigene set .
oat is an important crop in north america and northern europe.
this will lead to a better understanding of the cellular biology of this important crop and will open up new ways to improve its agronomical properties.
of the  <dig> unigene sequences,  <dig> displayed significant homology  to genes previously reported to be involved in cold stress related processes.
the cbf transcription factors have a major role in regulating cold acclimation.
the library was prepared from pooled rna samples isolated from leaves of four-week old avena sativa  plants incubated at +4Â°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours.
the asciunigene set will now be used to fabricate an oat biochip, to perform various expression studies with different oat cultivars incubated at varying temperatures, to generate molecular markers and provide tools for various genetic transformation experiments in oat.
