while the format provides an explicit framework to describe experiments, increase of experimental steps makes it less obvious to understand the content of the sdrf files.
here, we describe a new tool, sdrf2graph, for displaying experimental steps described in an sdrf file as an investigation design graph, a directed acyclic graph representing experimental steps.
visualization of the investigation design graph  structure leads to an easy understanding of the experimental process described in the sdrf files even if the experiment is complicated, and such visualization also encourages the creation of sdrf files by providing prompt visual feedback.
sdrf2graph is applicable for a wide range of sdrf files for not only microarray-based analysis but also other genome-scale technologies, such as next generation sequencers.
the experimental process is a part of the meta-data required to interpret the produced data, and sdrf  supports its description in a spreadsheet or tab-delimited file.
