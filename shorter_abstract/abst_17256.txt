trans-acting sirnas , which are secondary sirnas triggered by mirnas, and sirnas from natural antisense transcripts  are two well-studied classes of endo-sirnas.
combining next-generation sequencing and computational and experimental analyses, we profiled and characterized sncrna species and mrna genes from the plants that experienced severe and moderate chilling stresses, that underwent further severe chilling stress after chilling acclimation at moderate stress, and that grew under the normal condition.
in order to understand sncrnasâ€™ roles in plant chilling response and stress acclimation, we performed a comprehensive study of mirnas and endo-sirnas in cassava , a major source of food for the world populations in tropical regions.
the conservation of these sncrna might shed lights on the role of sncrna-mediated pathways affected by chilling stress and stress acclimation in euphorbiaceous plants.
systematic and computational analysis of micrornaome and experimental validation collectively showed that mirnas, ta-sirnas, and possibly nat-sirnas play important roles in chilling response and chilling acclimation in cassava by regulating stress-related pathways, e.g.
in addition to known mirnas, we identified  <dig>  novel mirnas as well as  <dig>  putative secondary sirna-yielding and  <dig>  nat-sirna-yielding candidate loci in cassava and castor bean, respectively.
we also included castor bean  in our study to understand conservation of sncrnas.
