the associated ground truth data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods, to improve methods and to compare results.
we present a biosegmentation benchmark that includes infrastructure, datasets with associated ground truth, and validation methods for biological image analysis.
our benchmark consists of different classes of images and ground truth data, ranging in scale from subcellular, cellular to tissue level, each of which pose their own set of challenges to image analysis.
the primary motivation for creating this resource comes from the fact that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for an end-user to choose from a wide range of segmentation methods available in the literature for a particular bioimaging problem.
while the primary focus is on biological images, we believe that the dataset and infrastructure will be of interest to researchers and developers working with biological image analysis, image segmentation and object tracking in general.
this online benchmark will facilitate integration and comparison of image analysis methods for bioimages.
