our results may suggest that, upon cycloheximide treatment, either a labile protein required for polarised membrane recycling is lost, or a control mechanism linking protein synthesis to membrane recycling is activated.
it has previously been shown that a short incubation of dictyostelium discoideum amoebae in cycloheximide eliminates fluid phase endocytosis.
furthermore, fluid phase endocytosis, phagocytosis and capping cease in the presence of  <dig> mm cycloheximide, although membrane uptake, as measured using fm1- <dig>  is unaffected.
in the presence of cycloheximide, aggregation-competent amoebae sensitive to camp, although round, can still localise crac, abp <dig>  pi3k and actin polymerisation in response to a micropipette filled with camp.
cycloheximide is a protein synthesis inhibitor that acts specifically on the 60s subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes.
the behaviour of wild-type amoebae in the presence of cycloheximide is surprisingly similar to that of amoebae having a temperature-sensitive version of nsf at the restrictive temperature.
