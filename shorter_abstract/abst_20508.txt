to explore the evolutionary relationship among these dof proteins, a combined phylogenetic tree has been constructed with the brachypodium dofs and those from rice and barley.
through searches in the b. distachyon genome,  <dig> dof genes have been identified and a phylogenetic comparison with the oryza sativa and the hordeum vulgare dofs has been performed.
these are seed maturation and germination, light-mediated regulation, phytohormone and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, etc.
using rt-qpcr analysis the expression profiles of the annotated bddof genes across four organs  has been investigated.
these results have led to a classification of the bddof genes into two groups, according to their expression levels.
this phylogenetic analysis has classified the dof proteins into four major cluster of orthologous groups .
brachypodium distachyon has been the first pooideae grass to be sequenced and, due to its genomic, morphological and physiological characteristics, has emerged as the model system for temperate cereals, such as wheat and barley.
transcription factors  are proteins that have played a central role both in evolution and in domestication, and are major regulators of development in living organisms.
comparison of the expression profiles of the brachypodium dof genes with the published functions of closely related dof sequences from the cereal species considered here, deduced from the phylogenetic analysis, indicates that although the expression profile has been conserved in many of the putative orthologs, in some cases duplication followed by subsequent divergence may have occurred .
plant genome sequences reveal that approximately 7% of all genes encode putative tfs.
the genes highly or preferentially expressed in seeds have been subjected to a more detailed expression analysis .
