taking advantage of available genome sequences and annotation for toxoplasma gondii  and plasmodium falciparum , we designed a single oligonucleotide microarray capable of supporting a wide range of applications at relatively low cost, including genome-wide expression profiling for toxoplasma, and single-nucleotide polymorphism -based genotyping of both t. gondii and p. falciparum.
this array is in widespread use by the t. gondii research community, and several aspects of the design strategy are likely to be useful for other pathogens.
recent sequencing of additional t. gondii isolates identifies > <dig> k new snps, including ~ <dig> k that intersect with expression profiling probes, yielding additional markers for genotyping studies, and further validating the utility of a combined expression profiling/genotyping array design.
are also pursued at pilot scale to inform future array designs.
expression profiling of the three clonotypic lineages dominating t. gondii populations in north america and europe provides a first comprehensive view of the parasite transcriptome, revealing that ~49% of all annotated genes are expressed in parasite tachyzoites  and 26% of genes are differentially expressed among strains.
in addition to providing an initial global view of the t. gondii transcriptome across major lineages and permitting detailed resolution of recombination points in a historical sexual cross, the multifunctional nature of this array also allowed opportunities to exploit probes for purposes beyond their intended use, enhancing analyses.
additional applications facilitating snp and transcript discovery, alternative statistical methods for quantifying gene expression, etc.
microarrays are invaluable tools for genome interrogation, snp detection, and expression analysis, among other applications.
a novel design utilizing few probes provided high confidence genotyping, used here to resolve recombination points in the clonal progeny of sexual crosses.
