it has been reported to be a mediator of type i ifns, nf-kb, and mhc class i gene.
the expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, and il- <dig> genes in negative irrelevant transfection controls was up-regulated at  <dig> hps after lps treatment compared to the vehicle controls.
in the current study, we investigated the role of nlrc <dig> in the regulation of ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i in the chicken hd <dig> macrophage cell line, by using rnai technology.
gene expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours post stimulation  was quantified by qpcr.
no direct relationship was found between nlrc <dig> knockdown and il- <dig> and mhc class i expression.
nlrc <dig> is a member of the card domain containing, nucleotide-binding oligomerization -like receptor  family, which recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and initiates an innate immune response leading to inflammation and/or cell death.
after  <dig> hours, cells were exposed to lps or poly  or a vehicle control.
stimulation by lps appeared to relatively restore the decrease in nlrc <dig>  ifna, and ifnb expression, but the difference is not significant.
the knockdown of nlrc <dig> expression negatively mediates gene expression of ifna and ifnb in the chicken hd <dig> cell line; therefore, nlrc <dig> likely has a role in positive regulation of ifna and ifnb expression.
however, the specific role of nlrc <dig> as a modulator of the inflammatory immune response remains controversial.
future studies will further clarify the roles of nlrc <dig> and other nlrs in infectious diseases of chickens and may increase the efficacy of antiviral vaccine design.
functional characterization of chicken nlrc <dig> in an in vitro system demonstrated its importance in regulating intracellular molecules involved in inflammatory response.
