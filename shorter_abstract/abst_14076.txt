yanasquare is an application software for rapid setup, visualization and analysis of small, larger and genome-scale metabolic networks.
as application examples we set-up and model the phospholipid network in the phagosome and genome-scale metabolic maps of s.aureus, s.epidermidis and s.saprophyticus as well as test their robustness against enzyme impairment.
modeling of metabolic networks includes tasks such as network assembly, network overview, calculation of metabolic fluxes and testing the robustness of the network.
