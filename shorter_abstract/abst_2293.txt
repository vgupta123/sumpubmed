we demonstrated that the production of biofilms grown under dynamic mode was also delayed and reduced.
70% of the strains were susceptible to virstatin  when biofilms grew in static mode, whereas 60% of strains respond to the treatment when their biofilms grew in dynamic mode.
cell surface appendages are important determinants of the a. baumannii biofilm formation and as such constitute interesting targets to prevent the development of biofilm-related infections.
by its action on pili biogenesis, virstatin demonstrated a very promising antibiofilm activity affecting more than 70% of the a. baumannii clinical isolates.
one reason for this emergence is due to its natural ability to survive in the hospital environment, which may be explained by its capacity to form biofilms.
after a dose–response experiment, we determined that 100 μm virstatin led to an important decrease  of biofilms formed by a. baumannii atcc <dig> grown under static mode.
acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen causing infections worldwide.
as expected, motility and atomic force microscopy experiments showed that virstatin acts on the a. baumannii pili biogenesis.
