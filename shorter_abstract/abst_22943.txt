the origin of the largest genomic island by horizontal gene transfer  could be corroborated by lack of coverage among metagenomic sequences from a fresh water microbialite.
interestingly, most genes coding for proteins with a diguanylate cyclase domain are predicted to be xenologs, suggesting a role for horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of synechococcus sensory systems.
here we looked for genomic islands in the fresh water cyanobacteria synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  that could be used as targets for deletion.
we considered that genes in genomic islands could be found if they showed a combination of: a) unusual g+c content; b) unusual phylogenetic similarity; and/or c) a small number of the highly iterated palindrome  <dig>  motif plus an unusual codon usage.
our estimates of genomic islands in pcc  <dig> are larger than those predicted by other published methods like sigi-hmm.
our results set a guide to non-essential genes in s. elongatus pcc  <dig> indicating a path towards the engineering of a model photoautotrophic bacterial cell.
simpler biological systems should be easier to understand and to engineer towards pre-defined goals.
evidence is also presented that xenologous genes tend to cluster in operons.
