pdgfrα expression was noted in all tumor samples.
in contrast pdgfrβ expression was found in only a few tumor samples but was evident in the stroma of all tumor specimens.
toceranib phosphate  has a reported objective response rate of 25% in both canine apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma  and thyroid carcinoma , with stable disease occurring in an additional 50-60% of dogs.

however, phosphorylation of ret was detected in 54% of the primary agasaca and 20% of tc.
mrna for vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα/β, kit and ret was detected in all agasaca samples.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate agasaca and tc samples for the expression and activation of vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα, pdgfrβ, kit and ret to assess whether dysregulation of these receptor tyrosine kinases  may contribute to the biologic activity of toceranib.
mrna for vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα/β, and kit was detected in all tc samples, while mrna for ret was amplified in 10/ <dig> samples.
vegfr <dig> was expressed in 19/ <dig> primary and 6/ <dig> metastatic agasaca and 6/ <dig> tc samples.
kit was present in 8/ <dig> primary and 3/ <dig> metastatic agasaca and 9/ <dig> tc samples.
