egf repeats 22– <dig> of drosophila notch overlap the genetically-defined 'abruptex' region, and competed with delta for binding to proteins containing the ligand-binding domain.
both delta and the abruptex region are heavily modified by protein o-fucosylation, but the split mutation of drosophila notch, which affects o-fucosylation of egf repeat  <dig>  did not affect binding of notch to either delta or the abruptex region.
some egf repeats are modified by o-fucosylation, and most have no identified role in ligand binding.
using a binding assay with purified proteins in vitro, it was determined that, in addition to binding to delta, the ligand binding region of notch bound to egf repeats 22– <dig> of notch, but not to other egf repeat regions of notch.
the abruptex region may serve as a barrier to notch activation by competing for the ligand-binding domain of notch.
delta differed from the abruptex domain in showing markedly enhanced binding at acid ph.
extracellular domains of the notch family of signalling receptors contain many egf repeat domains, as do their major ligands.
