two outstanding compounds, bisdemethylcurcumin  and  <dig> -bis- <dig> -dimethoxystyryl)isoxazole ,were well oriented in the binding pocket almost in the simulation time,  <dig> ns.
the specificity of curcumin analogs selected from the docked results was examined against human breast cancer cell lines.
this evidence confirmed the results of cell-based assays and the docking studies.
knowing that curcumin has been used as food to inhibit cancer activity, this study evaluated the efficacy of natural curcumins and curcumin analogs as her <dig> inhibitors using in vitro and in silico studies.
the curcumin analogs considered in this study composed of  <dig> groups classified by their core structure, Î²-diketone, monoketone, pyrazole, and isoxazole.
by modifying curcumin analogs, we found that protein-ligand affinity increases.
the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group could enhance affinity by forming hydrophobic interactions and the hydrogen bond with the hydrophobic pocket.
the series of curcumin compounds were screened using a computational molecular docking and followed by human breast cancer cell lines assay.
the screened curcumin compounds were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulation study.
hydroxyl, carbonyl or methoxy group also formed hydrogen bonds with residues in the adenine pocket and sugar pocket of her2-tk.
both as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig> could inhibit breast cancer cell lines though inhibiting of her2-tk.
her <dig> has been used as a drug target for cancers.
in the present study, both computational and experimental studies were performed.
in particular, to effectively treat her2-positive cancer, small molecule inhibitors were developed to target her <dig> kinase.
this information would explore more understanding of curcuminoid structures and her2-tk.
