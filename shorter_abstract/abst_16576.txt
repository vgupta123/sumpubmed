we then modeled patterns of substrate depletion, and used these models to examine if substrate usage preferences and substrate depletion kinetics of individual isolates can be used to predict the metabolism of a co-culture of the isolates.
our results indicate that a significant portion of a model communityâ€™s overall metabolism can be predicted based on the metabolism of the individuals.
based on the nature of our model, the resources that significantly deviate from the prediction highlight potential metabolic pathways affected by species-species interactions, which when further studied can potentially be used to modulate microbial community structure and/or function.
contrary to studies in model organisms, we found surprisingly few correlations between resource preferences and maximal growth rate or biomass composition.
examining how individual species use resources in their growth medium or environment  over time in batch culture conditions can provide rich phenotypic data that encompasses regulation and transporters, creating an opportunity to integrate the data into a predictive model of resource use by a mixed community.
here we use exometabolomic profiling to examine the time-varying substrate depletion from a mixture of  <dig> amino acids and glucose by two pseudomonas and one bacillus species isolated from ground water.
