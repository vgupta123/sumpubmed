overall, from both macroscopic and microscopic data of this study indicate the injectable ha-dox hydrogels presented as a long-lasting pharmacotherapeutic agent to apply for oa therapy.
we evaluated the therapeutic effects of intra-articular injections of hydrogels containing hyaluronic acid  and doxycycline  in a rabbit oa model.
thirteen week old new zealand white rabbits undergone a partial meniscectomy and unilateral fibular ligament transection were administered with either normal saline , ha, dox or ha-dox hydrogels on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12; animals were also examined the pain assessment in every three days.
the degree of pain was significantly attenuated after day  <dig> post-treatment with both ha and ha-dox hydrogels.
in addition, ha-dox hydrogels also ameliorated the progression of oa by protecting the injury of articular cartilage layer and restoring the elastoviscosity.
in macroscopic appearance, ha-dox hydrogel group showed a smoother cartilage surface, no or minimal signs of ulceration, smaller osteophytes, and less fissure formation in compare to ha or dox treatment alone.
in the areas with slight oa changes, ha-dox hydrogel group exhibited normal distribution of chondrocytes, indicating the existence of cartilage regeneration.
