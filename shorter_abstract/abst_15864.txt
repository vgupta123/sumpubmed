our model is able to detect gene clusters that would be also detected with
predicted solely on the basis of a pairwise similarity measure of the genes of
gene order analyses and thus may deteriorate gene cluster prediction.
approaches for gene cluster prediction suitable in scenarios ranging from
traditional gene family-based gene cluster prediction, via multiple conflicting
in this work, we present a new dynamic model and efficient computational
we evaluate our gene family-free model against a gene
computationally predicted on the basis of sequence similarity or higher order
wrong or deficient gene family assignments.
