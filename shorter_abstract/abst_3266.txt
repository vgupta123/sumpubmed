mid-pleistocene-age phylogeographic structure was found within two smaller-bodied species  matched expectations from the genetic datasets for a. zelandica and a. strepitans, suggesting that the range of a. zelandica was greatly reduced while a. strepitans refugia were more extensive.
we examined mitochondrial and nuclear-gene phylogenies and phylogeography, bayesian relaxed-clock divergence timing  and ecological niche models of the species from the smaller radiation.
however, interspecific divergence time estimates had large confidence intervals and were highly dependent on the assumed tree prior, and comparisons of uncorrected and patristic distances suggested difficulty in estimation of branch lengths.
however, no lgm habitat could be reconstructed for a. cingulata and n. sericea, suggesting survival in microhabitats not detectable with our downscaled climate data.
two large-bodied forest taxa  showed minimal phylogeographic structure, with intraspecific diversification dating to ca.
one extensively studied lineage includes 90% of the extant species , while the other contains just four extant species  and has been little studied.
unlike the large and continuous diversification exhibited by the kikihia-maoricicada-rhodopsalta clade, the contemporaneous amphipsalta-notopsalta lineage contains four comparatively old  species that show only recent diversification.
mitochondrial and nuclear-gene trees supported the monophyly of amphipsalta.
