parsimony networks, mismatch distributions and phylogenetic analyses identify the caribbean population of c. multilineata as the oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the circum-atlantic radiation of this species.
reef fish distributions at the boundaries between caribbean and brazilian provinces  indicate that the microevolutionary patterns we detected in c. multilineata and other reef fishes translate into macroevolutionary processes and that origin and accumulation have acted in concert to form the greater caribbean biodiversity hotspot.
to examine how origin and accumulation affected the greater caribbean center of diversity, we conducted a range-wide survey of mtdna cytochrome b in the widespread atlantic reef damselfish chromis multilineata  that included  <dig> locations in all four tropical atlantic biogeographic provinces: the greater caribbean, brazil, the mid-atlantic ridge, and the tropical eastern atlantic.
however, some caribbean haplotypes in this species were derived from brazilian lineages, indicating that mtdna diversity has not only originated but also accumulated in the greater caribbean.
data from the wrasses and parrotfishes indicate an origin in the greater caribbean in one case, caribbean origin plus accumulation in another, and accumulation in the remaining two.
