somatic mosaicism of copy number variants  in human body organs and de novo cnv event in monozygotic twins suggest that de novo cnvs can occur during mitotic recombination.
in addition to the de novo cnvs, we identified a 37Â mb-sized copy neutral de novo loss of heterozygosity event on chromosome  <dig> in clone- <dig>
to study de novo genetic events in cloned animals can help understand formation mechanisms of genetic variants and their biological implications.
we analyzed cnvs in seven cloned dogs using the nuclear donor genome as reference by array-cgh, and identified five de novo cnvs in two of the seven clones.
two larger de novo cnvs  on chromosomes x and  <dig> in clone- <dig> were consistently validated by all three experiments.
to our knowledge, this is the first report of de novo cnvs in the cloned dogs which were generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.
in this study, we explored de novo cnv event in cloned dogs with identical genetic background.
these de novo cnv events are important for understanding genetic background of evolution and diverse phenotypes.
genomic qpcr, dye-swap array-cgh analysis and b-allele profile analysis were used for their validation.
