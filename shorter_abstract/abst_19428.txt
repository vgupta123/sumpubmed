a molecular clock suggests that the diversification of coccinia began about  <dig>  ma ago, with most of the extant species diversity dating to the pliocene.
the data revealed four species groups, one in southern africa, one in central and west african rain forest, one widespread but absent from central and west african rain forest, and one that occurs from east africa to southern africa.
here we study the effects of historical climate change, and the associated habitat fragmentation, on diversification in the mostly sub-saharan cucurbit genus coccinia, which has  <dig> species in a broad range of biota from semi-arid habitats to mist forests.
ancestral biome reconstruction reveals six switches between semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest, and members of several species pairs differ significantly in their tolerance of different precipitation regimes.
climatic tolerances were assessed from the occurrences of  <dig> geo-referenced collections and worldclim variables.
