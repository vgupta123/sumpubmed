this data was confirmed by rt-pcr, revealing the presence of different transcripts that would encode the chimeric proteins csnkÎ²-ly6g5b and g6f-ly6g6d, in which the ly- <dig> domain would join to a kinase domain and an ig-like domain, respectively.
the ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes encode ly- <dig> domain proteins, whose expression seems to be regulated in an original fashion, consisting of an intron retention event which generates, through an early premature stop codon, a non-coding transcript, preventing expression in most cell lines and tissues.
in addition, by quantitative pcr we found that the retained and spliced forms are differentially expressed in tissues indicating an active regulation of the non-coding transcript.
this retention event appears not to be solely dependent on intron features, because in the case of ly6g5b, when the intron is inserted in the artificial context of a luciferase expression plasmid, it is fully spliced but strongly stabilises the resulting luciferase transcript.
