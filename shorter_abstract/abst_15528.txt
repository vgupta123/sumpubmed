recent studies have underscored the role of enhancers in defining cell type-specific transcriptomes.
the results presented in this study reveal the complexity and dynamics of tf- enhancer binding before and after stimulation in myeloid apcs.
here, we address these questions in two types of myeloid antigen presenting cells , macrophages and dendritic cells , before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide , a potent stimulator of the innate immune response.
our classification suggests that transient loss of atf <dig> binding to a subset of these enhancers is important for regulation of early-induced genes.
there were significant correlations between the sets of tfs bound to enhancers prior to stimulation and expression changes of nearby genes after stimulation.

however, little is known about combinatorial binding of tfs to enhancers, dynamics of tf binding following stimulation, or the downstream effects on gene expression.
cell type-specific enhancers are bound by combinations of shared and cell type-specific transcription factors .
