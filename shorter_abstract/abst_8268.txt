in this study, we used a population genetic approach to test this hypothesis by comparing dna sequences of  <dig> putative immune system genes in the crustacean daphnia pulex with  <dig> non-immune system genes.
in support of the hypothesis, results from a multilocus extension of the mcdonald-kreitman  test indicate that immune system genes as a class have experienced more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes.
our data are consistent with the hypothesis that immune system genes undergo more adaptive evolution than non-immune system genes, possibly as a result of host-parasite arms races.
understanding which parts of the genome have been most influenced by adaptive evolution remains an unsolved puzzle.
however, not all immune system genes show evidence of adaptive evolution.
the results of these analyses highlight several candidate loci undergoing adaptive evolution that could be targeted in future studies.

additionally, we apply single locus mk tests and calculate population genetic parameters at all loci in order to characterize the mode of selection  in the genes that show the greatest deviation from neutral evolution.
