an ongoing issue in pattern recognition in microarrays has been how to determine the number of patterns  to use for data interpretation, and this is a critical issue as measures of statistical significance in gene ontology or pathways rely on proper separation of genes into groups.
using gene ontology and data on gene regulation in the saccharomyces genome database, we identified the transcriptional signatures of several cellular processes in yeast, including cell wall creation, ribosomal disruption, chemical blocking of protein synthesis, and, criticially, individual signatures of the strongly coupled mating and filamentation pathways.
this works demonstrates that microarray data can provide downstream indicators of pathway activity either through use of gene ontology or transcription factor databases.
as numerous diseases involve errors in signal transduction, modern therapeutics often target proteins involved in cellular signaling.
we determined from measurements of gene persistence in patterns across multiple potential dimensionalities that  <dig> basis vectors provides the correct dimensionality for interpreting the data.
we demonstrate the technique using the rosetta yeast deletion mutant data set, decompositional analysis by bayesian decomposition, and annotation analysis using clutrfree.
