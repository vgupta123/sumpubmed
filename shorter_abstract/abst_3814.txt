recombinant di also bound a series of  <dig> polyclonal igg samples derived from patients with aps.
this constitutes the first description of prokaryotic expression of soluble di of β2gpi.
furthermore if di or peptide derivatives of di are eventually used in the therapeutic setting either as toleragen or as a competitive inhibitor of pathogenic apl, then an e. coli production system may aid cost-effective production.
by producing a synthetic gene globally optimised for expression in e. coli, tightly regulating expression and utilising periplasmic product translocation, efficient, soluble e. coli expression of the eukaryotic protein di of β2gpi is possible.
binding to murine monoclonal antibodies that recognise conformationally restricted epitopes on the surface of di and pathogenic human monoclonal igg apl was confirmed by direct and indirect immunoassay.
domain i  of human beta  <dig> glycoprotein i  is thought to contain crucial antibody binding epitopes for antiphospholipid antibodies , which are critical to the pathogenesis of aps.
by virtue of a pelb leader sequence, periplasmic localisation of di aided disulphide bond formation and toxicity was addressed by tightly regulating expression through the high stringency t7lac promoter.
purified, soluble his-tagged di in yields of  <dig> μg/l bacterial culture was obtained and confirmed on western blot.
this novel platform of expression utilising pan-gene prokaryote codon optimisation for di production will aid future antigenic studies.
