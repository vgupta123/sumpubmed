overall we find that the mutual information between the signal inputs and the lux output is less than one bit.
at the level of individual cells, the heterogeneity in the lux response depends only on the average degree of activation, so that the noise in the output is not reduced by the presence of the second hsl signal.
it remains unclear how crosstalk between c8hsl and 3oc6hsl affects the information that the bacterium obtains through quorum sensing.
the lux genes in v.fischeri do not appear to distinguish between the two hsl inputs, and even with two signal inputs the regulation of lux is extremely noisy.
at the level of a population average, the crosstalk between the c8hsl and 3oc6hsl inputs is well-described by a competitive inhibition model.
while the role of the 3-oxo-c <dig> homoserine lactone  signal in activating the lux genes has been extensively studied and modeled, the role of the c <dig> homoserine lactone  is less obvious, as it can either activate luminescence or block its activation.
by measuring the fluorescence of individual v.fischeri cells containing a chromosomal gfp-reporter for the lux genes, we study how combinations of exogenous hsls affect both the population average and the cell-to-cell variability of lux activation levels.
one of the puzzles in bacterial quorum sensing is understanding how an organism integrates the information gained from multiple input signals.
