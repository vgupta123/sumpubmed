the recombinant toxins  were purified from bacterial crude extracts.
approximately  <dig> â€“  <dig> mg of highly purified recombinant toxins were obtained from one liter of bacterial culture.
the resulting rtcda and rtcdb had similar molecular masses to the native toxins, and their biological activities were found to be similar to their native counterparts after an extensive examination.
due to the large size and poor stability of the proteins, the active recombinant tcda and tcdb have been difficult to produce.
the constructs were transformed into b. megaterium protoplasts and the protein expression was controlled under a xylose promoter.
