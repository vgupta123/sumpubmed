exploration of "tree space" with garli, using grid computing, showed that hundreds of searches are typically needed to find the best-feasible phylogeny estimate for these data.
to begin addressing this problem, we tested the ability of five protein-coding nuclear genes , and character subsets therein, to resolve relationships among  <dig> species representing  <dig>  superfamilies and  <dig>  families of ditrysia under maximum likelihood analysis.
superfamilies are typically recovered or nearly so, but usually without strong support.
our results  corroborate the broad outlines of the current working phylogenetic hypothesis for ditrysia,  demonstrate that some prominent features of that hypothesis, including the position of the butterflies, need revision, and  resolve the majority of family and subfamily relationships within superfamilies as thus far sampled.
in the mega-diverse insect order lepidoptera , deeper relationships are little understood within the clade ditrysia, to which 98% of the species belong.
separate analyses of mostly synonymous versus non-synonymous character sets revealed notable differences , including a marked influence of compositional heterogeneity on apparent signal in the third codon position .
our trees show broad concordance with previous morphological hypotheses of ditrysian phylogeny, although most relationships among superfamilies are weakly supported.
