we show that, in the data used, our method is able to distinguish cis-regulatory modules by exploiting statistical differences between the probability distributions of similar words in regulatory and other dna.
the potential application of our method includes annotation of new genomic sequences and motif discovery.
we exploit one of the basic informational properties of regulatory dna: abundance of over-represented transcription factor binding site  motifs, although we do not look for specific tfbs motifs, per se .
we present a novel statistical method, the "fluffy-tail test", to recognise regulatory dna.
though overrepresentation of tfbs motifs in regulatory dna has been intensively exploited by many algorithms, it is still a difficult problem to distinguish regulatory from other genomic dna.
