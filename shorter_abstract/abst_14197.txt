the e <dig> allele may maintain vegetative growth in early-flowering genetic backgrounds, and also be useful as a long-juvenile allele, which causes late flowering under short-daylength conditions, in low-latitude regions.
the soybean maturity gene e <dig> is ft2a, and its recessive allele delays flowering because of lower transcript abundance that is caused by allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of sore- <dig>  the ft2a transcript abundance is thus directly associated with the variation in flowering time in soybean.
comparison of the expression levels of different alleles among near-isogenic lines and photoperiod-insensitive cultivars indicated that the sore- <dig> insertion attenuated ft2a expression by its allele-specific transcriptional repression.
understanding the molecular mechanisms of flowering and maturity is important for improving the adaptability and yield of seed crops in different environments.
in soybean, a facultative short-day plant, genetic variation at four maturity genes, e <dig> to e <dig>  plays an important role in adaptation to environments with different photoperiods.
however, the molecular basis of natural variation in time to flowering and maturity is poorly understood.
using a cross between early-maturing soybean cultivars, we performed a genetic and molecular study of flowering genes.
fine mapping, sequencing, and expression analysis revealed that e <dig> is ft2a, an ortholog of arabidopsis flowering locus t. regardless of daylength conditions, the e <dig> allele was transcribed at a very low level in comparison with the e <dig> allele and delayed flowering.
