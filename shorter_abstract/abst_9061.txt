this mutation was described to cause instability in the banf <dig> protein, causing a disruption of the nuclear envelope structure.
we demonstrate, using biochemical assays, that the banf <dig> a12t protein is impaired in its ability to bind dna while its interaction with nuclear envelope proteins is unperturbed.
consistent with this, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the mutant protein induces the ngps cellular phenotype, while the protein localizes normally to the nuclear envelope.
here we demonstrate that the banf <dig> a12t protein is indeed correctly folded, stable and that the observed phenotype, is likely due to the disruption of the dna binding surface of the a12t mutant.
our study clarifies the role of the a12t mutation in ngps patients, which will be of importance for understanding the development of the disease.
premature aging syndromes recapitulate many aspects of natural aging and provide an insight into this phenomenon at a molecular and cellular level.
