while early stage proliferation and specific neurog2- and krox20-dependent waves of neuronal subtype specification involve activation of tcf transcription, late stage progenitor proliferation and neurog1-marked sensory neurogenesis are regulated by a function of β-catenin independent of tcf activation and adhesion.

thus, switching modes of β-catenin function are associated with consecutive cell fate specification and stage-specific progenitor proliferation.
we show that of all peripheral nervous system structures, only sensory dorsal root ganglia require β-catenin for proper formation and growth.
however, it has been difficult to study its pleiotropic effects, because of the dual capacity of β-catenin to coordinate cadherin-dependent cell adhesion and to act as a component of wnt signal transduction.
surprisingly, however, dorsal root ganglia development is independent of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion.
rather, both progenitor cell proliferation and fate specification are controlled by β-catenin signaling.
to distinguish between the divergent functions of β-catenin during peripheral nervous system development, we made use of a mutant allele of β-catenin that can mediate adhesion but not wnt-induced tcf transcriptional activation.
