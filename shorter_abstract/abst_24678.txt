epitope identification is an essential step toward synthetic vaccine development since epitopes play an important role in activating immune response.
in addition, we found that all amino acid positions in nonapeptides could effect on performances of the predictive models including non-anchor positions.
interestingly, the most informative aapps estimated by our study were those developed by micheletti and simons while previous studies utilized two aapps developed by miyazawa & jernigan and betancourt & thirumalai.
our method achieved high performance in testing with benchmark datasets.
finally, epiccapo+ref was applied to identify candidates of promiscuous epitopes.
we have developed a novel epitope prediction method named epiccapo and its variants, epiccapo+ and epiccapo+ref.
most of these methods, however, are based on sophisticated nonlinear techniques for achieving higher predictive performance.
the predictive performances of epiccapo+ and epiccapo+ref outperformed other state-of-the-art methods without losing interpretability.
we speculate that our techniques may be useful in the development of new vaccines.
as a result,  <dig> % of the predicted nonapeptides epitopes were consistent with preceding studies based on immunological experiments.
in addition, our study identified a number of candidates of promiscuous ctl epitopes consistent with previously reported immunological experiments.
classical experimental approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and therefore computational methods for generating epitope candidates have been actively studied.
