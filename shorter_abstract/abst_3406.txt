in summary, our comprehensive network-based pan-cancer stratification provides valuable information about inter- and intra- cancer stratification for patient clinical assessments and therapeutic strategies.
our study not only revealed recurrently reported cross-cancer similarities, but also identified novel ones.
identification of tumor heterogeneity and genomic similarities across different cancer types is essential to the design of effective stratified treatments and for the discovery of treatments that can be extended to different types of tumors.
the micro-scale stratification shows essential pan-cancer heterogeneity with subgroup-specific gene network characteristics and biological functions.
here, we performed a network-based integrative pan-cancer genomic analysis on > <dig> samples from  <dig> cancer types to uncover novel stratifications among tumors.
the macro-scale stratification demonstrates strong clinical relevance and reveals consistent risk tendency among cancer types.
