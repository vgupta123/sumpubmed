for the profiling of micrornas we recommend use of rna samples with a rna integrity number equal to or above seven.
to correlate clinically relevant parameters with microrna expression, total rna is frequently prepared from samples that were archived for various time periods in frozen tissue banks but, unfortunately, rna integrity is not always preserved in these frozen tissues.
tissue samples were maintained on ice for defined time periods prior to total rna extraction, which resulted in different degrees of rna degradation.
microrna expression cannot be reliably profiled in degraded total rna.
here, we investigate whether experimentally induced rna degradation affects microrna expression profiles.
our results demonstrate that the loss of rna integrity leads to in unpredictability of microrna expression profiles for both, array-based and miqpcr assays.
