d. shibae will be a valuable model organism to study bacterial differentiation into pleomorphic cells.
dinoroseobacter shibae, a member of the roseobacter clade abundant in marine environments, maintains morphological heterogeneity throughout growth, with small cells dividing by binary fission and large cells dividing by budding from one or both cell poles.
this morphological heterogeneity is lost if the quorum sensing  system is silenced, concurrent with a decreased expression of the ctra phosphorelay, a regulatory system conserved in alphaproteobacteria and the master regulator of the caulobacter crescentus cell cycle.
here we tested if the qs induced differentiation of d. shibae is mediated by the ctra phosphorelay.
the ctra phosphorelay induces differentiation of a marine roseobacter strain that is strikingly different from that of c. crescentus.
we discovered for the first time that the ctra phosphorelay controls the biosynthesis of signaling molecules.
instead of a tightly regulated cell cycle and a switch between two morphotypes, the morphology and cell division of dinoroseobacter shibae are highly heterogeneous.
transcriptome analysis revealed that ctra is a master regulator for flagellar biosynthesis and has a great influence on the transition to stationary phase.
mutants for ctra, chpt and ccka showed almost homogeneous cell morphology and divided by binary fission.
several phylogenetic clusters of alphaproteobacteria revealed a ctra binding site in the promoters of qs genes, including roseobacters and rhizobia.
it consists of the sensor histidine kinase ccka, the phosphotransferase chpt and the transcriptional regulator ctra.
for ctra and chpt, expression in trans on a plasmid caused the fraction of cells containing more than two chromosome equivalents to increase above wild-type level, indicating that gene copy number directly controls chromosome number.
