the ubiquitin-proteasome system is the predominant pathway for myofibrillar proteolysis but a previous study in c2c <dig> myotubes only observed alterations in lysosome-dependent proteolysis in response to complete starvation of amino acids or leucine from the media.
here, we determined the interaction between insulin and amino acids in the regulation of myotube proteolysis
incubation of c2c <dig> myotubes with  <dig>  × physiological amino acids concentration , relative to  <dig>  × pc aa, significantly increased total proteolysis and the expression of 14-kda e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating enzyme .
increasing amino acids or leucine alone, act additively with insulin to down regulate proteolysis and expression of components of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
the effects of amino acids on proteolysis but not insulin and leucine, are blocked by inhibition of the mtor signalling pathway.
incubation of rapamycin  inhibited amino acid or insulin-dependent p <dig> s <dig> kinase phosphorylation, blocked  the inhibitory effects of  <dig>  × pc aa on protein degradation, but did not alter the inhibitory effects of insulin or leucine
in a c2c <dig> myotube model of myofibrillar protein turnover, amino acid limitation increases proteolysis in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner.
