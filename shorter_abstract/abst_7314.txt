a small dataset of ests from atlantic white shrimp  was used to test this algorithm so that the detailed results could be examined.
in organisms with limited genomic information, like marine organisms, this challenge is even greater due to annotation uncertainty.
this general design procedure is not limited to designing single-species cdna microarrays for marine organisms, and it can equally be applied to multiple-species microarrays of any organisms with limited genomic information.
probe selection for cdna microarrays using expressed sequence tags  is challenging due to high sequence redundancy and potential cross-hybridization between paralogous genes.
no general tool is available for cdna microarray probe selection for these organisms.
for organisms with limited genomic information, combining hierarchical clustering methods to analyze ests can yield an optimal cdna microarray design.
the choice of how many microarray probes to retain was made based on an index developed for this research: a sequence diversity index  within a sequence diversity plot .
expression microarrays are increasingly used to characterize environmental responses and host-parasite interactions for many different organisms.
therefore, the goal of the design procedure described here is to select a subset of ests that will minimize sequence redundancy and characterize potential cross-hybridization while providing functionally representative probes.
if biomarker discovery is the goal of the microarray experiments, the average linkage method is more effective, while single linkage is more suitable if identification of physiological mechanisms is more of interest.
