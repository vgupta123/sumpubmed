the enrichment of the cnvrs with r gene models and their overlap with gene loci of agricultural significance draw attention to a form of unexplored genetic variation in apple.
to improve the reliability of our results, we developed a quality control and analysis procedure that involved checking for organelle dna, not repeat masking, and the determination of cnvr identity using a permutation testing procedure.
copy number variation  is a common feature of eukaryotic genomes, and a growing body of evidence suggests that genes affected by cnv are enriched in processes that are associated with environmental responses.
of note was a cluster of resistance gene models on chromosome  <dig> near a region containing multiple major gene loci conferring resistance to apple scab.
cnvrs were detected using ngs data derived from  <dig> accessions of m. x domestica analyzed using the read-depth method, as implemented in the cnvrd <dig> software.
to verify that detected cnvrs were not artifacts, we analyzed the b- allele-frequencies  within a single nucleotide polymorphism  array dataset derived from a screening of  <dig> individual apple accessions and found the cnvrs were enriched for snps having aberrant bafs .
overall, we identified  <dig> cnvrs, which spanned  <dig> Â % of the apple genome.
this research will underpin further investigation of the role that cnv plays within the apple genome.
putative cnvrs overlapped  <dig> gene models and were enriched for resistance  gene models .
here we use next generation sequence  data to detect copy-number variable regions  within the malus x domestica genome, as well as to examine their distribution and impact.
