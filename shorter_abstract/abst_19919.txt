a total of  <dig> abc transporters containing all eight described subfamilies  were identified in the b. tabaci q genome, including  <dig> abcas,  <dig> abcbs,  <dig> abccs,  <dig> abcds,  <dig> abce,  <dig> abcfs,  <dig> abcgs and  <dig> abchs.
in comparison to other species, subfamilies g and h in both phloem- and blood-sucking arthropods are expanded.
the temporal expression profiles of these  <dig> abc transporters throughout b. tabaci developmental stages and their responses to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, were investigated using rna-seq analysis.
it is the first genome-wide analysis of the entire repertoire of abc transporters in b. tabaci.
the identification of these abc transporters, their temporal expression profiles during b. tabaci development, and their response to a neonicotinoid insecticide lay the foundation for functional genomic understanding of their contribution to the invasiveness of b. tabaci.
because of their role in detoxification, insect abc transporters have gained more attention in recent years.
in this study, we annotated abc transporters from a newly sequenced sweetpotato whitefly genome.
furthermore, the mrna expression of  <dig> abc transporters  representing all eight subfamilies was confirmed by the quantitative real-time pcr .
furthermore, mrna expression levels estimated by rt-qpcr and rna-seq analyses were significantly correlated .
abc transporter superfamily is one of the largest and ubiquitous groups of proteins.
