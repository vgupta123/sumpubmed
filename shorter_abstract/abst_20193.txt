transcriptional profiling of tissue biopsies from upec-infected kidney tissue revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes  <dig> h post-infection.
our hypothesis-free approach identified components of infection-associated multi-cellular tissue responses and demonstrated how a comparative analysis allows retrieval of relevant information from lower-quality data sets.
comparative transcriptomics analysis of the  <dig> h data set and online available studies of early local infection and inflammation defined a core of  <dig> genes constituting a "general tissue response to early local bacterial infections".
subsequent experimental analyses confirmed a systemic increase of ifn-γ in rats with an ongoing local kidney infection, correlating to splenic, rather than renal ifng induction and suggested this inter-organ communication to be mediated by interleukin - <dig>  the use of comparative transcriptomics allowed expansion of the statistical data handling, whereby relevant data could also be extracted from the  <dig> h data set.
out of the  <dig> differentially expressed core genes, some represented specific  <dig> h responses, illustrating the value of comparative transcriptomics when studying the dynamic nature of gene regulation in response to infections.
their relevance for the infection process was supported by a gene ontology  analysis.
hitherto reported transcription profiles on host-pathogen interactions are strongly biased towards in vitro studies.
the data further define marked representation of ifn-γ responsive genes and a prompt inter-organ communication as a hallmark of an early local tissue response to infection.
