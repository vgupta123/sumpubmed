the genes affected by non-ref te insertion were functionally enriched for stress response mechanisms in all three crops.
these observations suggest that transposon insertion is not a random event and it makes genomic diversity, which may affect the intraspecific adaption and evolution of crops.
a large number of tes have been identified in reference genome of each crop, which are the important part of genome.
transposons  are dna sequences that can change their position within the genome.
we found that non-ref tes have a strong positive correlation with gene number and have a bias toward insertion near genes, but with a preference for avoiding coding regions in maize and sorghum.
to identify and characterize crop non-ref tes, we analyzed non-ref tes in more than  <dig> accessions from rice , maize  and sorghum  using resequenced data with paired-end mapping methods.
we identified  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  non-ref tes in rice, maize and sorghum, respectively.
genome-wide characterization analysis shows that most of non-ref tes were unique and non-ref te classes shows different among rice, maize and sorghum.
however, whether there existed tes with different insert positions in resequenced crop accession genomes from those of reference genome , and what the characteristics  are.
