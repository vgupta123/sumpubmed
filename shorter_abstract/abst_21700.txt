thus, this study not only provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of uniconazole-induced hormone variation and starch accumulation but also highlighted the potential for duckweed to be feedstock for biofuel as well as for sewage treatment.
to elucidate the mechanisms of high starch accumulation, in the study, the responses of l. punctata to uniconazole were investigated using a quantitative proteomic approach combined with physiological and biochemical analysis.
uniconazole contributes to starch accumulation of duckweed, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear.
importantly, the expression levels of several key enzymes in the starch biosynthetic pathway were up-regulated, which supported the enzymatic assay results and may explain why there is increased starch accumulation.
these generated data linked uniconazole with changes in expression of enzymes involved in hormone biosynthesis and starch metabolic pathways and elucidated the effect of hormones on starch accumulation.
using systematical screening, we determined that the highest biomass and starch percentage of duckweed was obtained after uniconazole application.
the increased endogenous aba may up-regulate expression of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase to promote starch biosynthesis.
duckweed  has the potential to remediate wastewater and accumulate enormous amounts of starch for bioethanol production.
