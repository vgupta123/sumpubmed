and based on the proposed performance indices, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation.
in this study, we adopted/proposed eight performance indices to make a comprehensive performance evaluation on the prediction results of  <dig> existing cooperative tfs identification algorithms.
as each algorithm integrated different data resources and was developed based on different rationales, it possessed its own merit and claimed outperforming others.
this motivated us to propose a series of indices to objectively evaluate the prediction performance of existing algorithms.
the results showed that wang j's study obtained the best performance evaluation on the prediction of cooperative tf pairs in yeast.
however, the claim was prone to subjectivity because each algorithm compared with only a few other algorithms and only used a small set of performance indices for comparison.
eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is known to be highly connected through the networks of cooperative transcription factors .
the recent advances in computational techniques led to various predictions of cooperative tf pairs in yeast.
we collected  <dig> sets of predicted cooperative tf pairs  in yeast from  <dig> existing algorithms in the literature.
it was seen that the ranking scores of a set of pctfps vary with different performance indices, implying that an algorithm used in predicting cooperative tf pairs is of strength somewhere but may be of weakness elsewhere.

using the eight performance indices we adopted/proposed, the cooperativity of each pctfp was measured and a ranking score according to the mean cooperativity of the set was given to each set of pctfps under evaluation for each performance index.
