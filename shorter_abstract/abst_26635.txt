dna extraction from plant tissues, unlike dna isolation from mammalian tissues, remains difficult due to the presence of a rigid cell wall around the plant cells.
in combination with conventional dna isolation techniques, the new enzymatic method allows to obtain high-yield, high-molecular weight dna, which can be used for many applications, including genome characterization by aflp, rapd and ssr.
the method gave good results in  <dig> of the  <dig> tested species.
currently used methods inevitably require a laborious mechanical grinding step, necessary to disrupt the cell wall for the release of dna.
using a cocktail of different carbohydrases, a method was developed that enables a complete digestion of the plant cell walls and subsequent dna release.
