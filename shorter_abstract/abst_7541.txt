understanding and predicting the effects of mutations on protein structure and phenotype is an increasingly important area.
introducing a hydrophobic residue on the surface, or a hydrophilic residue in the core, no longer shows significant differences between snps and pds.
a new web interface has been developed allowing users to analyze their own mutations.
results of machine learning using the structural analysis results to predict pathogenicity considerably outperform other methods.
we have updated saapdb and improved its analyses, but with the increasing rate with which mutation data are generated, we have created a new analysis pipeline and web interface.
finally we have developed a machine learning method which gives a cross-validated accuracy of  <dig> , considerably out-performing well known methods including sift and polyphen <dig> which give accuracies between  <dig>  and  <dig> .
