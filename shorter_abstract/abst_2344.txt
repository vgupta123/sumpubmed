we demonstrate that mavacoxib has a direct cell killing effect on cancer cells, increases apoptosis in cancer cells in a manner that may be independent of caspase activity, and has an inhibitory effect on cell migration.
importantly, we demonstrate that cancer stem cells derived from osteosarcoma cell lines are sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of mavacoxib.
both nsaids can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro.
our results suggest that mavacoxib has anti-tumour effects and that this in vitro anti-cancer activity warrants further study.
importantly, cancer stem cells derived from an osteosarcoma cell line are sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of mavacoxib.
