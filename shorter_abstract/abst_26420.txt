we formulate a method termed tree branches evaluated statistically for tightness  for identifying significantly distinct tree branches in hierarchical clusters.
based on our benchmark analysis, tbest is a tool of choice for detection of significantly distinct branches in hierarchical trees grown from biological data.
we test tbest as a tool for tree-based data partitioning by applying it to five benchmark datasets, one of them synthetic and the other four each from a different area of biology.
