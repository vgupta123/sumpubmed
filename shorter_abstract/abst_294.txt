positive e. coli clones and a. pretiosum transconjugants were assayed by catechol.
a series of integrative expression vectors have been made with the following features: the is <dig> transposase from streptomyces coelicolor, the constitutive erme* promoter from saccharopolyspora erythraea, different ribosome-binding site  sequences and xyle as a translational reporter.
although the most common integration site was within a putative orf with sequence similarity to nadh-flavin reductase, ap- <dig> levels and cell growth of transconjugants were unaffected.
plasmid integration sites in transconjugants were investigated and four different sites were observed.
one way to increase ap- <dig> production would be to constitutively express selected genes so as to relieve bottlenecks in the biosynthetic pathway; however, an integrative expression vector for a. pretiosum is lacking.
the aim of this study was to construct a vector for heterologous gene expression in a. pretiosum.
a set of integrative vectors for constitutive gene expression in a. pretiosum has been constructed.
