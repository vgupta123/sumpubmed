we hypothesize that the recruitment of the part of ltr as a novel exon in great ape species occurred prior to the divergence of orangutans and humans from a common ancestor  as a result of a single mutation in the proto-splice site.
sequencing and analysis of the homologous regions of genomes of several primates indicate that the ltr retrotransposon was inserted into the il22ra <dig> gene at least prior to the divergence of apes and old world monkeys from a common ancestor .
we found that long terminal repeat  retrotransposons are associated with  <dig>  human genes .
