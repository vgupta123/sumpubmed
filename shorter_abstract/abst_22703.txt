namely, it includes annotations for genetic information carriers , proteins , small metabolites, physiological states and laboratory techniques.
the inter-annotator agreement statistics provide evidence of the importance of a consolidated background when dealing with such complex descriptions, the ambiguities naturally arising from the terminology and their impact for modelling purposes.
thus, one of the challenges posed to biomedical text mining tools is that of learning to recognise a wide variety of biological concepts with different functional roles to assist in these processes.
here, we present a novel corpus concerning the integrated cellular responses to nutrient starvation in the model-organism escherichia coli.
to the best of our knowledge, a corpus that details such a wide range of biological concepts has never been presented to the text mining community.
availability is granted for the full-text corpora of  <dig> freely accessible documents, the annotation scheme and the annotation guidelines.
our corpus is a unique resource in that it annotates biomedical concepts that play a functional role in expression, regulation and metabolism.
