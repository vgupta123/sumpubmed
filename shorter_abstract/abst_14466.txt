analysis of stem and branch secondary xylem indicates substantial similarity in gene ontologies including carbohydrate enzymes, response to stress, protein binding, and allowed us to find transcription factors and heat-shock proteins differentially expressed.
expression patterns of myb transcription factors and heat-shock proteins in lignified tissues are dissimilar when tree development was evaluated, obtaining more expression of tgmyb <dig> and tgmyb <dig> in lignified tissues of 60-year-old trees, and more expression in tghsp <dig>  tghsp <dig>  tghsp <dig> and tgbi in stem secondary xylem of 12-year-old trees.
these results will open new perspectives for studies of diversity, ecology, breeding and genomic programs aiming to understand deeply the biology of this species.
investigation of some of the key regulators of lignin biosynthesis in teak, however, could be a valuable step towards understanding how rigidity of teak wood and extractives content are different from most other woods.
considering how important the secondary xylem and sapwood transition from young to mature trees is, little is known about the expression differences between those successional processes and which transcription factors could regulate lignin biosynthesis in this tropical tree.
currently, tectona grandis is one of the most valuable trees in the world and no transcript dataset related to secondary xylem is available.
we present a widely expressed gene catalog for t. grandis using illumina technology and the de novo assembly.
tgmyb <dig>  tgmyb <dig> and tgces presented higher expression in mature secondary xylem, in contrast with tgmyb <dig>  tghsp <dig>  tghsp <dig>  tghsp <dig>  and tgbi whose expression is higher in young lignified tissues.
although myb transcription factors are one of the largest superfamilies in plants related to secondary metabolism, it has not yet been characterized in teak.
the obtained transcriptome data represents new sequences of t. grandis deposited in public databases, representing an unprecedented opportunity to discover several related-genes associated with secondary xylem such as transcription factors and stress-related genes in a tropical tree.
a total of  <dig>  transcripts were obtained, with  <dig>  and  <dig> genes differentially expressed for stem and branch secondary xylem, respectively, during age transition.
tgmyb <dig> is expressed at lower level in secondary xylem.
