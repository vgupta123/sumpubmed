our analysis identified clusters of positions along the coding regions that may undergo a conserved evolutionary selection for strong or weak local folding maintained across different viral variants.
previous studies have recognized functional rna structures in the genome of the dengue virus.
here we performed the first large scale comprehensive genomics analysis of selection for local mrna folding strength in the dengue virus coding sequences, based on a total of  <dig>  genomes and  <dig> serotypes.

although some of the identified positions undergo frequent synonymous / non-synonymous substitutions, the selection for folding strength therein is preserved, and thus cannot be trivially explained based on sequence conservation alone.
specifically, 53- <dig> clusters for strong folding and 49- <dig> clusters for weak folding  aggregated of positions with a significant conservation of folding energy signals  were recognized.
however, these studies usually focused either on the viral untranslated regions or on very specific and limited regions at the beginning of the coding sequences, in a limited number of strains, and without considering evolutionary selection.
