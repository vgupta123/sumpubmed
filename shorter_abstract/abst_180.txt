as a prerequisite for targeted genetic modifications, the complete genome sequence of the organism has to be known.
here, we present the complete genome sequence of actinoplanes sp.
the complete genome sequence of actinoplanes sp.
se50/ <dig> and other actinoplanes spp.
the genome features a high mean g + c content of  <dig> % and consists of one circular chromosome with a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp hosting  <dig>  predicted protein coding sequences.
furthermore, the identified non-ribosomal peptide synthetase- and polyketide synthase-clusters potentially encode new antibiotics and/or other bioactive compounds, which might be of pharmacologic interest.
another key feature of the genome represents the discovery of a functional actinomycete integrative and conjugative element.
in this regard, the identified actinomycete integrative and conjugative element could play a central role by providing the basis for the development of a genetic transformation system for actinoplanes sp.
se50/ <dig> , the first publicly available genome of the genus actinoplanes, comprising various producers of pharmaceutically and economically important secondary metabolites.
consequently, derived actinoplanes strains with increased acarbose yields are being used in large scale industrial batch fermentation since  <dig> and were continuously optimized by conventional mutagenesis and screening experiments.
se50/ <dig> marks an important step towards the rational genetic optimization of the acarbose production.
phylogenetic analysis of the core genome revealed a rather distant relation to other sequenced species of the family micromonosporaceae whereas actinoplanes utahensis was found to be the closest species based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparison.
as the incidence of diabetes is rapidly rising worldwide, an ever increasing demand for diabetes drugs, such as acarbose, needs to be anticipated.
