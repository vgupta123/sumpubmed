the study therefore showed that selection and inclusion of efficient polysaccharide hydrolysing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in an inoculum offer increased methane productivity in ad of l. hyperborea.
inoculum  <dig> also gave the highest acetate production  in a single-stage fermenter ad system and produced most methane  in phase ii of a two-stage ad system.
however, an inoculum of slurry from a human sewage anaerobic digester, one of rumen contents from seaweed-eating north ronaldsay sheep and inoculum  <dig> used most seaweed volatile solids  , suggesting that these each had efficient seaweed polysaccharide digesting bacteria.
all the inocula could degrade l. hyperborea and produce methane to some extent.
this inoculum will now being tested in larger scale  continuously stirred reactors optimised for feed rate and retention time to determine maximum methane production under single-stage and two-stage ad systems.
the hydrolysis of seaweed polysaccharides is the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion  of seaweeds.
