additionally, mps <dig> mutant loss of pnes integrity was shown by replacing leucine with alanine which produced a diffused subcellular distribution, compared to the wild type protein which resides predominantly in cytoplasm.

furthermore, a putative nuclear export sequence  motif at the n-terminal of mps <dig> was identified by analyzing the motif of mps <dig>  this motif shows a high sequence similarity to the classic nes, a fusion of this motif with egfp results in dramatic exclusion of the fusion protein from the nucleus.
taken these findings together, it was concluded that the pnes sequence is sufficient for the mps <dig> export from nucleus during interphase.
mps <dig>  an essential component of the mitotic checkpoint, is also an important interphase regulator and has roles in dna damage response, cytokinesis and centrosome duplication.
