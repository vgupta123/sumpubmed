the ovary is a complex mixture of different cell types.
enrichment in specific cell types was controlled by qrt-pcr analysis of known genes: six oocyte-specific genes  and three granulosa cell-specific genes .
successful achievement of early folliculogenesis is crucial for female reproductive function.
despite many studies, little is known about the cell-specific gene expression driving early folliculogenesis.
functional analyses allowed the characterization of the three main cellular events involved in early folliculogenesis and confirmed the relevance and potential of lcm-derived rna.
the process is finely regulated by cell-cell interactions and by the coordinated expression of genes in both the oocyte and in granulosa cells.
the recently developed laser capture microdissection  technique coupled with microarray experiments is a promising way to address the molecular profile of pure cell populations.
however, one main challenge was to preserve the rna quality during the isolation of single cells or groups of cells and also to obtain sufficient amounts of rna.
lcm and microarray analysis allowed us to identify novel gene expression patterns in follicular cells at different stages and in oocyte populations.
we developed a new tissue fixation protocol ensuring efficient single cell capture and rna integrity during the microdissection procedure.
