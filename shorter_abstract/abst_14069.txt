three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in two villages receiving three annual rounds of mda .
in the 3 × treatment arm, a short-term increase in prevalence of s. aureus carriage was seen following mda from  <dig> % at css- <dig> to  <dig> % at css- <dig> .
we used the framework of this trial to carry out an opportunistic study to investigate if the increased rounds of treatment resulted in increased prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of macrolide-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
three annual rounds of mda with azithromycin were associated with a short-term increase in both the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of s. aureus and prevalence of carriage of azmr and imlsb

in css- <dig>  prevalence of carriage of resistant strains was higher in the 3 × treatment arm than in the 1 × treatment .
in a cluster-randomized trial , we compared the reduction in the prevalence of active trachoma in communities that received three annual rounds of mda to that in communities that received a single treatment round.
