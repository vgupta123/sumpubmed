during this differentiation process, the cytoskeleton is reorganized, and proteins of the centrosome re-localize to the surface of the nucleus.
because we observe that centrosome protein re-localization occurs early during differentiation, we believe that it is of functional importance for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in the differentiation process.
the exact timing of this event, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood.
centrosome proteins that accumulate at the nuclear surface form an insoluble matrix that can be reversibly disassembled if isolated nuclei are exposed to mitotic cytoplasm from xenopus egg extract.
we demonstrate that this re-localization occurs already at the single cell stage, prior to fusion into myotubes.
our data provide new insights into the reorganization of centrosome proteins during muscular differentiation, at the structural and biochemical level.
our microscopy data suggest that this perinuclear matrix of centrosome proteins consists of a system of interconnected fibrils.
