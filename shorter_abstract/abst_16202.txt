crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the major types of chronic inflammatory bowel disease occurring in the colon and small intestine.
our results suggested lactobacillus plantarum myl <dig> inhibited inflammation in caco- <dig> cells through regulation of gene expressions of tollip, socs <dig>  socs <dig>  and iκbα, rather than ship- <dig> and irak- <dig>
our findings suggest that either heat-killed probiotics or probiotic cell wall extracts are able to attenuate inflammation through pathways similar to that of live bacteria.
we proposed that live/ heat-killed lactobacillus plantarum myl <dig> and bacterial cell wall extract treatments impaired tlr4-nfκb signal transduction through tollip, socs- <dig> and socs- <dig> activation, thus inducing lps tolerance.
however, the mechanism of probiotic actions remains unclear.
