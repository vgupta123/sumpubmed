intron gains reportedly are very rare during evolution of vertebrates, and the mechanisms underlying their creation are largely unknown.
multiple intron gains were detected in a group of ray-finned fishes, once the canonical groups of vertebrate serpins had been established.
in two genes, co-occurrence of non-standard introns was observed, implying that intron gains in vertebrates may even happen concomitantly or in a rapidly consecutive manner.
the association of intron gains in the serpin superfamily with a group of fishes that underwent genome compaction may indicate that dna breakage/repair processes might foster intron birth.
here we investigated intron dynamics in the serpin superfamily in lineages pre- and postdating the split of vertebrates.
the co-occurrence of non-standard introns within the same gene discloses the possibility that introns may be gained simultaneously.
multiple intron acquisitions were identified in serpin genes of a lineage of ray-finned fishes, but not in any other vertebrates, suggesting that insertion rates for introns may be episodically increased.
previous investigations have shown that, during metazoan radiation, the exon-intron patterns of serpin superfamily genes were subject to massive changes, in contrast to many other genes.
dna breakage/repair processes associated with genome compaction are introduced as a novel factor potentially favoring intron gain, since all non-canonical introns were found in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that experienced genomic downsizing.
