for this we placed candidate disease resistance genes and qtls against late leaf spot disease on the genetic map of the a-genome of arachis, which is based on microsatellite markers and legume anchor markers.
groupings of candidate genes and qtls for late leaf spot resistance were apparent on the upper region of linkage group  <dig> and the lower region of linkage group  <dig>  indicating that these regions are likely to control disease resistance.
wild species generally harbor greater levels of resistance and even apparent immunity, although the linkage of agronomically un-adapted wild alleles with wild disease resistance genes is inevitable.
however, in peanut there is an almost complete lack of knowledge of the regions of the arachis genome that control disease resistance.
candidate genes and qtls were distributed on all linkage groups except for the smallest, but the distribution was not even.
sources of resistance against many diseases are available in cultivated peanut genotypes, although often not in farmer preferred varieties.
these marker types are transferable within the genus arachis and to other legumes respectively, enabling this map to be aligned to other arachis maps and to maps of other legume crops including those with sequenced genomes.
in this work we identified candidate genome regions that control disease resistance.
worldwide, diseases are important reducers of peanut  yield.
in total,  <dig> sequence-confirmed candidate disease resistance genes and five qtls were mapped.
