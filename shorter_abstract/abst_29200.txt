it is now possible to address significant evolutionary genomics questions by applying high-throughput sequencing to discover the majority of genes for ecologically tractable species, and by subsequently developing microarray platforms from which to investigate gene regulatory networks that function in natural systems.
we used gs-flx titanium sequencing  of two normalized libraries of pooled rna samples to characterize a transcriptome of the dark-eyed junco , a north american sparrow that is a classically studied species in the fields of photoperiodism, speciation, and hormone-mediated behavior.
though genomic-level data are becoming widely available, many of the metazoan species sequenced are laboratory systems whose natural history is not well documented.
in contrast, the wide array of species with very well-characterized natural history have, until recently, lacked genomics tools.
annotation of roughly half of the putative genes was accomplished using sequence similarity, and expression was confirmed for the majority with a preliminary microarray analysis.
