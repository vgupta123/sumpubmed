banana cultivars are mostly derived from hybridization between wild diploid subspecies of musa acuminata  and m. balbisiana , and they exhibit various levels of ploidy and genomic constitution.
however, for the main commercial subgroups, structure appeared to be less efficient to detect the ancestry in diploid groups, possibly due to sampling restrictions.
the data generated by flow cytometry, its and ssr supported the hypothesis about the occurrence of homeologue recombination between a and b genomes, leading to discrepancies in the number of sets or portions from each parental genome.
the possibility of inferring the membership among accessions to correct the effects of genetic structure opens possibilities for its use in marker-assisted selection by association mapping.
our objectives were to determine the genomic constitution based on internal transcribed spacer  regions polymorphism and the ploidy of all accessions by flow cytometry and to investigate the population structure of the collection using simple sequence repeat  loci as co-dominant markers based on structure software, not previously performed in musa.
from the  <dig> accessions analyzed by flow cytometry, the correct ploidy was confirmed or established for  <dig> , whereas digestion of the its region confirmed the genomic constitution of  <dig> .

the co-dominant nature of ssr was explored to analyze the structure of the population based on a bayesian approach, detecting  <dig> subpopulations.
structure analysis enabled the efficient detection of ancestry of recently developed tetraploid hybrids by breeding programs, and for some triploids.
neighbor-joining clustering analysis derived from ssr binary data allowed the detection of two major groups, essentially distinguished by the presence or absence of the b genome, while subgroups were formed according to the genomic composition and commercial classification.
knowledge regarding the genetic relationships and diversity between modern cultivars and wild relatives would assist in conservation and breeding strategies.
