the unique features of this tool will be very helpful for those studying gene regulatory elements that exist in non-coding regions.
furthermore, it is observed that regulatory elements found in non-coding regions are highly conserved across different species.
the development of a centralized resource that allows for the quick and easy retrieval of non-coding sequences from multiple species and is capable of handing multi-gene queries is critical for the analysis of non-coding sequences.
the ncsrs is a web-based bioinformatics tool that performs fast and convenient retrieval of non-coding and coding sequences from multiple species related to a specific gene or set of genes.
it has been demonstrated that parts of the non-coding region play a critical role as gene regulatory elements.
however, the analysis of these regulatory elements is not as straightforward as it may first seem.
this paper presents a non-coding sequences retrieval system .
the large size of the genome sequences has made them difficult to study using traditional methods.
this tool has compiled resources from multiple sources into one easy to use and convenient web based interface.
here we describe the development of a web-based non-coding sequence retrieval system.
