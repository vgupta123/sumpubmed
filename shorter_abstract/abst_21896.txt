here we present a computational study focused on identification of the novel pcw genes in arabidopsis based on the co-expression analyses of transcriptomic data collected under  <dig> conditions, using a bi-clustering technique.
these co-expression modules cover  <dig> known/annotated pcw genes and  <dig>  new candidates.
we believe our approach and data presented here will be useful for further identification and characterization of pcw genes.
all the predicted pcw genes, co-expression modules, motifs and their annotations are available at a web-based database: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/publications/materials/shanwang/cwrpdb/index.html.
in addition, for the co-expressed genes in each module, we predicted and analyzed their cis regulatory motifs in the promoters using our motif discovery pipeline, providing strong evidence that the genes in each co-expression module are transcriptionally co-regulated.

from the all co-expression modules, we infer that  <dig> modules are related to four major pcw synthesis components, using three complementary methods.
our analysis identified  <dig> highly co-expressed gene clusters  under some experimental conditions, each containing at least one gene annotated as pcw related according to the purdue cell wall gene families database.
although substantial efforts have been invested into studying this problem, the vast majority of the pcw related genes remain unknown.
