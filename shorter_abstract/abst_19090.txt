microcell-mediated chromosome transfer  is a technique by which a chromosome is moved from donor to recipient cells by microcell fusion.
however, peg is not applicable for all types of recipient cells, because of its cell type-dependent toxicity.
however, the low efficiency of peg-induced fusion with hfl <dig> was not improved by the mv fusogen.
microcell donor cho cells carrying a human artificial chromosome  were transfected with genes encoding hemagglutinin  and fusion  proteins of an attenuated measles virus  edmonston strain.
mixed culture of the cho transfectants and mv infection-competent human fibrosarcoma cells  formed multinucleated syncytia, suggesting the functional expression of the mv-h/f in the cho cells.
the fusion efficiency was determined by counting the total number of stable clones obtained in each experiment.
drug-resistant cells appeared after selection in culture with blasticidin targeted against the tagged selection marker gene on the hac.
ectopic expression of mv envelope proteins provides an efficient recipient cell-oriented mmct protocol, facilitating extensive applications for studies of gene function and genetic corrections.
in ht <dig> and himsc, the maximum efficiency observed was  <dig> and  <dig> times greater than that using conventional peg fusion, respectively.
the cytotoxicity of peg limits the yield of microcell hybrids to low level .
retention of the hac in the microcell hybrids was confirmed by fish analyses.
