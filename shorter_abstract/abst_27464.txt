horizontal gene transfer  is considered to be a major force driving the evolutionary history of prokaryotes.
our systematic approach consisted of several specialized features including the application of a parsimony method for inferring phyletic patterns followed by blast filter, automated phylogenetic reconstruction and the application of patterns for hgt detection.
we identified  <dig> instances of hgt in  <dig> complete rickettsiales genomes, of which  <dig> were previously unidentified instances of hgt from anaplasma, wolbachia, candidatus pelagibacter ubique and rickettsia genomes.
hgt is widespread in prokaryotes, contributing to the genomic repertoire of prokaryotic organisms, and is particularly apparent in rickettsiales genomes.
we developed an automated approach for the detection of hgt from other organisms  into rickettsiales genomes.
in this work, we focus on genes transferred from distantly related species into rickettsiales species.
additionally, putative cases with no phylogenetic support were assigned gene ontology terms.
