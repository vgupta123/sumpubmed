in order to find statistically significant effector genes for pathogen entry, we systematically analyzed entry pathways in human host cells for eight pathogens using image-based kinome-wide sirna screens with sirnas from three vendors.
pmm allows incorporating sirna weights that can be assigned according to available information on rnai quality.
moreover, pmm is able to estimate a sharedness score that can be used to focus follow-up efforts on generic or specific gene regulators.
our results show parallel rnai screening can improve the results of individual screens.
large-scale rnai screening has become an important technology for identifying genes involved in biological processes of interest.
however, the quality of large-scale rnai screening is often deteriorated by off-targets effects.
we propose a parallel mixed model  approach that simultaneously analyzes several non-identical screens performed with the same rnai libraries.
we show that pmm gains statistical power for hit detection due to parallel screening.
