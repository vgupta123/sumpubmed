mcmc-bpn is successful in using few inter-process links to explain as many of the perturbed gene-gene interactions as possible.
we apply mcmc-bpn to publicly available liver-related datasets to demonstrate that the networks formed by the most probable inter-process links reported by mcmc-bpn show high relevance to each biological condition.
we show that mcmc-bpnâ€™s ability to discern the few key links from in a very large solution space by comparing results from two other methods for detecting inter-process links.
thereby, bpns summarize the important biological trends within a response network by reporting a digestible number of inter-process links that can be explored in greater detail.
gene set enrichment has become standard for summarizing the results of these analyses in terms functionally coherent collections of genes such as biological processes.

response networks, computed through the integration of gene interaction networks with expression perturbation data, may themselves contain tens of thousands of interactions.
microarray experiments can simultaneously identify thousands of genes that show significant perturbation in expression between two experimental conditions.
