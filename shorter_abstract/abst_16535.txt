this study demonstrated that five orfs upstream of the hyp-gene cluster are co-transcribed with the hyp-genes, and identified three tsps in the extended hyp-gene cluster in nostoc sp.
a correctly assembled active site requires the involvement of at least seven proteins, encoded by hypabcdef and a hydrogenase specific protease, encoded either by hupw or hoxw.
short conserved sequences were found in six intergenic regions of the extended hyp-operon, appearing between  <dig> and  <dig> times in the genome.
in addition, five upstream orfs located in between hupsl, encoding the small and large subunits of the uptake hydrogenase, and the hyp-operon, and two downstream orfs from the hyp-genes were shown to be part of the same transcript unit.
strain pcc  <dig>  this may indicate a function related to the assembly of a functional uptake hydrogenase, hypothetically in the assembly of the small subunit of the enzyme.
strain pcc  <dig> may contain both an uptake and a bidirectional hydrogenase.
orthologues of the four orfs asr0689-alr <dig>  with a highly conserved genomic arrangement positioned between hupsl, and the hyp genes are found in several other n2-fixing cyanobacteria, but are absent in non n2-fixing cyanobacteria with only the bidirectional hydrogenase.
the present study addresses the presence and expression of hyp-genes in nostoc sp.
