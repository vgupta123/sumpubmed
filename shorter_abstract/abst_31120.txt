we show that the region encoding gli <dig> repressor domain is subject to alternative splicing in the gonadal tissues and different cell lines.
our data suggest that in addition to proteolytic processing, alternative splicing may be another important regulatory mechanism for the modulation of repressor and activator properties of gli <dig> protein.
both forms contain premature translational stop codons in the gli <dig> open reading frame  starting from exon  <dig>  translation of gli2Δ <dig> and gli2Δ4– <dig> in vitro, initiated from downstream aug codons, produced n-terminally truncated proteins.
however, expression of the gli2Δ4– <dig> resulted in about 10-fold increase in activation, suggesting that deletion of the major part of repressor domain was responsible for the enhanced activation of gli <dig> protein.
in gli-dependent transactivation assay, expression of gli2Δ <dig> induced activation of the reporter gene similar to that of the full-length construct  containing complete orf.
