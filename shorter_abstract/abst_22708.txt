resilin is progressively bent as a flagellum is abducted and resumes its natural shape when the joint recoils.
the joint is therefore controlled by a single abductor muscle operating against a spring in which the elastic properties of resilin play a key role.
the contraction of a single abductor muscle controls the power stroke  of each flagellum, which is accompanied by flaring of feather-like setae which increase its surface area.
the relationship between the extent of abduction and the angular velocity of the return stroke indicates the operation of a spring.
no muscle can bring about the return stroke .
blue fluorescence under uv light, and its dependence on the ph of the bathing medium, indicates that resilin is present at the joint between an exopodite and flagellum, at the annuli of a flagellum and at the base of the setae.
