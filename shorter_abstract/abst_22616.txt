despite the need to evaluate the impact of such changes on tree genetic diversity, we almost entirely lack genomic resources.
these newly identified putative variants are a first step towards acquiring much needed genomic resources for tropical tree species.
we have developed an r and bioperl-based bioinformatic procedure for de novo assembly, gene functional annotation and marker discovery.
patterns of gene expression were similar across species, with metabolism of aromatic compounds standing out as an overrepresented gene function.
the relative representation of gene functions in the four transcriptomes suggests that secondary metabolism may be particularly important in tropical trees.
we sequenced cdna libraries from three organs  using  <dig> pyrosequencing.
mismatch identification takes into account single-base quality values as well as the likelihood of false variants as a function of contig depth and number of sequenced chromosomes.
the amazonian rainforest is predicted to suffer from ongoing environmental changes.
the differential representation of transcripts among tissues suggests differential gene expression, which opens the way to functional studies in these non-model, ecologically important species.
