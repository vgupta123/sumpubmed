the range model shows an increase in sensitivity compared with the single-width ones, while providing competitive precisions on the e. coli benchmark.
galf-g also helps to discover an additional motif which has probably not been annotated in the dataset.
de novo motif discovery serves as a promising way to predict and better understand tfbss for biological verifications.
effectiveness can be maintained even using a very small population, exhibiting very competitive efficiency.
in discovering multiple overlapping motifs in a real liver-specific dataset, galf-g outperforms meme by up to 73% in overall f-scores.
users can easily specify the difference amongst expected motif kinds via similarity test.
however, current techniques either prohibit overlapping tfbss or lack explicit control of different motifs.
deciding a single motif width by existing models may be biased and misleading.
we propose a new generalized model to tackle the motif widths by considering and evaluating a width range of interest simultaneously, which should better address the width uncertainty.
galf-g was tested extensively on over  <dig> synthetic, real and benchmark datasets, and is usually better than the state-of-the-art methods.
identification of transcription factor binding sites  is a central problem in bioinformatics on gene regulation.
moreover, a meta-convergence framework for genetic algorithms , is proposed to provide multiple overlapping optimal motifs simultaneously in an effective and flexible way.
incorporating genetic algorithm with local filtering  for searching, the new galf-g  algorithm is proposed based on the generalized model and meta-convergence framework.
additionally, multiple, possibly overlapping, candidate motifs are desired and necessary for biological verification in practice.
