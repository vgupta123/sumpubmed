additionally, we show that smite outperforms functional epigenetic modules , the current paradigm of using the spin-glass algorithm to integrate gene expression and epigenetic data.
smite combines p-values by accounting for the correlation between non-independent values within data sets, allowing genes and gene modules in an interaction network to be assigned significance values.
smite represents a flexible, scalable tool that allows integration of transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory data from genome-wide assays to boost confidence in finding gene modules reflecting altered cellular states.
the molecular assays that test gene expression, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation are increasingly diverse and numerous.
our significance-based modules integrating the transcriptome and epigenome  approach was developed to integrate transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory data without a loss of resolution.
