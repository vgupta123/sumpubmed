the genomic resources developed to study x. tropicalis biology will accelerate exploration of amphibian physiology and genetics.
further annotation included gene ontology functional classification, interpro domain analysis, alternative splicing and non-coding rna identification.
gene expression profiles were derived from est counts and used to define transcripts specific to metamorphic stages of development.
we initiated a large-scale partial cdna sequencing project to provide a functional genomics resource on genes expressed in the nervous system during early embryogenesis and metamorphosis in x. tropicalis.
these cdna sequences permit in silico cloning of numerous genes and will facilitate studies aimed at deciphering the roles of cognate genes expressed in the nervous system during neural development and metamorphosis.
the western african clawed frog xenopus tropicalis is an anuran amphibian species now used as model in vertebrate comparative genomics.
in particular, the model will facilitate analysis of key questions related to anuran embryogenesis and metamorphosis and its associated regulatory processes.
it provides the same advantages as xenopus laevis but is diploid and has a smaller genome of  <dig>  gbp.
therefore x. tropicalis is more amenable to systematic transcriptome surveys.
these partial cdna sequences were obtained from an embryonic head and retina library  and from a metamorphic brain and spinal cord library .
comparison of these cdna sequences with protein databases indicates that 46% contain their start codon.
a gene index was defined and analysed after the collection of over  <dig>  high quality sequences.
