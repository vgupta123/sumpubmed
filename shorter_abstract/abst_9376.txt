we applied a population genetic approach to evaluate support for subgroups within this material, using aflp data.
for  <dig> species no conclusions could be drawn as the number of accessions included in our dataset was too low.
these molecular data should be combined with data from morphological surveys, with geographical distribution data, and with information from crossing experiments to identify natural units at the species level.
therefore, the approach taken provides a general method to evaluate the taxonomic system in any species complex for which molecular data are available.
the taxonomy and systematic relationships among species of solanum section petota are complicated and the section seems overclassified.
the results showed that the south american members of section petota could be arranged in  <dig> clusters of various size and composition.
our approach is based on the following assumptions:  accessions that may exchange genetic material can be analyzed as if they are part of one gene pool, and  genetic differentiation among species is expected to be higher than within species.
however, accessions of other species were distributed over more than one cluster, and did not form genetically distinct units.
many of the presumed species from south america are very similar and they are able to exchange genetic material.
some of the species clustered as genetically distinct groups, either on their own, or combined with one or more other species.
