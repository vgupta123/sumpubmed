here we propose a bayesian model  to predict imprinted genes on the basis of allelic expression observed in mrna-seq data of independent human tissues.

our model  was capable of identifying imprinted genes with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations.
by applying dspig to the mrna-seq data, we predicted  <dig> imprinted genes in  <dig> cerebellum samples and  <dig> imprinted genes in  <dig> diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates.
to date, however, fewer than  <dig> imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome.
for ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an r package for dspig at http://www.shoudanliang.com/dspig/.
with the prevalence of the mrna-seq technology, dspig has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of imprinted genes.
with simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dspig.
