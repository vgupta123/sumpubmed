to gain more information pertaining to gene resistance within this family,  <dig> lrr regions were cloned in  <dig> different wild/cultivated potato accessions.
our findings suggest that this family harbors an unusually high level of genetic abundance, making it of particular interest.
these genes confer resistance against  <dig> distantly related pathogen species in  <dig> different solanaceae hosts.
again, frequent copy number variations and a high level of divergence between homolog were observed common among accessions.
also, frequent frameshift mutations and abundant gene conversion events were identified in these lrr regions.
this revealed a large variation in copy number within this gene family among species and a great divergence was found both between and within species.
together with other reported examples, our study also provides evidence that multi-resistance is a common trait in r gene families like this.
first, homologs of this gene family were identified in the pepper, tomato and potato genomes.
three nbs-lrr genes, rpi-blb <dig>  mi- <dig> , and cami, constitute a very special plant resistance gene family.
to characterize this noted resistance, we conducted a series of studies on this gene family.
