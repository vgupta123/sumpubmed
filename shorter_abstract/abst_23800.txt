standard curve of gapdh expression in serial diluted total rna, melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to determine the reliability of gapdh as reference gene.
several genes have been used as housekeeping genes and choosing an appropriate reference gene is important for accurate quantitative rna expression in real time rt-pcr technique.
the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different experimental treatments on the expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  mrna so that the reliability of gapdh as reference gene for quantitative real time rt-pcr in human diploid fibroblasts  can be validated.
therefore it can be used as housekeeping gene for quantitative real time rt-pcr technique in human diploid fibroblasts particularly in studying cellular senescence.
hdfs with different experimental treatments exhibited diverse cell morphology with different expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase  activity.
hdfs in  <dig> different treatment groups viz; young , senescent , h2o2-induced oxidative stress and γ-tocotrienol -treated groups were harvested for total rna extraction.
total rna concentration and purity were determined prior to gapdh mrna quantification.
the expression levels of reference genes should remain constant between the cells of different tissues and under different experimental conditions.
however the expression level of gapdh was consistent in all treatment groups.
the study demonstrated that gapdh is reliable as reference gene for quantitative gene expression analysis in hdfs.
