the resistance of this opportunist pathogen to β-lactam antibiotics is determined mainly by production of the inactivating enzyme ampc, a class c cephalosporinase with a regulation system more complex than those found in members of the enterobacteriaceae family.
one of the regulatory mechanisms for ampc expression, recently identified in clinical isolates, is the inactivation of lmm-pbp <dig> , a protein whose catalytic activity on natural substrates has remained uncharacterized until now.
the results showed a decrease in the relative quantity of dimeric, trimeric and anhydrous units, and a smaller reduction in monomer disaccharide pentapeptide  levels, validating the occurrence of d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase activities.
lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bifunctional enzyme presenting both d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase activities; the d,d-endopeptidase function is predominant.
we carried out in vivo activity trials for lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa on macromolecular peptidoglycan of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

this data contributes to understanding of the regulatory aspects of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in this bacterial model.
the fact that mutant pbp <dig> induces ampc, may indicate that a putative muropeptide-subunit product of the dd-epase activity of pbp <dig> could be a negative regulator of the pathway.
community and nosocomial infections by pseudomonas aeruginosa still create a major therapeutic challenge.
this regulatory system also participates directly in peptidoglycan turnover and recycling.
kinetic evaluation of the direct d,d-peptidase activity of this protein on natural muropeptides m <dig> and d <dig> confirmed this bifunctionality and the greater affinity of lmm-pbp <dig> for its dimeric substrate.
our study provides unprecedented functional and structural information which supports the proposal of this protein as a potential hydrolase-autolysin associated with peptidoglycan maturation and recycling.
a three-dimensional model for the monomeric unit of lmm-pbp <dig> provided structural information which supports its catalytic performance.
under conditions of induction for this protein and cefoxitin treatment, the reduction in m <dig> is not fully efficient, implying that lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa presents better behaviour as a d,d-endopeptidase.
