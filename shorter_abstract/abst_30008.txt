enrichment for injury detection and cell cycle arrest factors  and p21) occurred most frequently in bn cells; however, their numbers did not correlate with dna damage levels and it is likely that the two processes have different causative mechanisms.
low density cell culture should be avoided as it enriches for both dna damage and mitotic defects .
as monolayers differing only slightly in baseline dna damage levels showed markedly variable responses to a further injury, studies of effects of various stressors on tendon cells must be very carefully controlled.

however, significant levels of cell death were not measured, suggesting that dna repair was occurring.
we investigated indicators of replicative damage in sdft fibroblast monolayers, effects of this on their reparative ability, and measures that can be taken to reduce it.
comet assays showed that dna repair was delayed in proportion to levels of genotoxic stress.
continued use of early passage cultures expressing initially high levels of Î³h2ax puncta should be avoided for mechanistic studies and ex-vivo therapeutic applications, as this will not be resolved with further replicative cycling.
we found significant evidence of replicative stress, initially observing consistently large numbers of binucleate  cells.
superficial digital flexor tendon  injuries of horses usually follow cumulative matrix microdamage; it is not known why the reparative abilities of tendon fibroblasts are overwhelmed or subverted.
both dsbs and bn cells were greatest in subconfluent  monolayers.
