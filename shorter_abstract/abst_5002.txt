interestingly, compared to cgt-/- mice the amount of glccer in cns myelin was strongly reduced in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice by more than 80%.
the importance of galcer and sulfatide has been validated using udp-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase-deficient  mice, which are impaired in myelin maintenance.
in order to test this hypothesis, we have generated cgt-/- mice with an additional deletion of the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase  gene.
this was accompanied by a significant increase in sphingomyelin, which was the predominant sphingolipid in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice.
these data show that compact myelin can be formed with non-hydroxylated sphingomyelin as the predominant sphingolipid and suggest that the presence of hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin in cgt-/- mice does not functionally compensate the loss of hfa-galcer.
despite these significant changes in myelin sphingolipids, compact myelin was formed in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice, and g-ratios of myelinated axons in the spinal cord of 4-week-old fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice did not differ significantly from that of cgt-/- mice, and there was no obvious phenotypic difference between fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- mice
these mice, however, are still able to form compact myelin.
