the functional annotation of variants provides the basis for exhaustive genotype imputation in the population, e.g., for highest-resolution genome-wide association studies.
forty-three animals accounting for about  <dig> percent of the genetic diversity of the fleckvieh population, a cattle breed of southern germany and austria, were sequenced with coverages ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and averaging  <dig> .
there are  <dig>  variants in coding regions of  <dig>  genes,  <dig> percent being non-synonymous exchanges, of which  <dig> variants are predicted to cause premature stop codons.
we therefore resorted to re-sequencing of a limited number of bovine animals selected to explain a major proportion of the population's genomic variation, so called key animals, in order to provide a catalogue of functional variants and a substrate for population- and genome-wide imputation of variable sites.
low- to medium-coverage re-sequencing of individuals explaining a major fraction of a population's genomic variation allows for the efficient and reliable detection of most variants.
after alignment to the reference genome  and multi-sample variant calling, more than  <dig> million variant positions were identified, about  <dig> percent biallelic single nucleotide variants  and  <dig> percent short insertions and deletions .
