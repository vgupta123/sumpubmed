finally, inhibiting this pathway exacerbated the inflammatory response to stroke as camkk β or camk iv ko mice had increased levels of the pro-inflammatory serum cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin  <dig>  after stroke.
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase  is a major kinase that is activated by elevated intracellular calcium.
interestingly, mounting evidence has suggested potential sex differences in the response to stroke treatment in patients as, at least in part, distinct cell death programs may be triggered in females and males following stroke.
therefore, camkk signaling may be a potential target for stroke treatment in both males and females.
our results demonstrated that camkk β or camk iv ko exacerbated both ischemic injury and behavioral deficits in female mice.
transcriptional inactivation was observed in mice lacking either camkk β or camk iv, as indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated camp response element-binding protein  and b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  proteins.
inhibition of camkk signaling exacerbated stroke outcome and increased bbb impairment, transcriptional inactivation and inflammatory responses in females after stroke.
in this study, we examined stroke outcomes in ovariectomized camkk β and camk iv deficient females.
genetic deletion of camkk β or camk iv increased hemorrhagic transformation after stroke, and this was associated with both increased mmp <dig> activity and loss of the blood brain barrier  protein collagen iv.

stroke is the primary cause of long-term disability in the united states.
this suggests that the camkk pathway is involved in the immune response to brain injury.
it has recently been suggested that camkk and camk iv, a downstream target molecule, are neuroprotective in stroke in males.
cell death/survival signaling and inflammatory responses were assessed.
