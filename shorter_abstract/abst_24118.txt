however, the assignment of evolutionarily conserved roles to gata homologs requires a detailed framework of orthologous relationships.
although two distinct classes, gata <dig> and gata <dig>  have been unambiguously recognized among deuterostome gata genes, it has been difficult to resolve exact orthologous relationships among protostome homologs.
our study shows how sampling of additional genomic data, especially from less derived and interspersed protostome taxa, can be used to resolve the orthologous relationships within more divergent gene families.
in particular, we resolved the orthology and evolutionary birth order of all arthropod gata homologs including the highly divergent drosophila gata genes.
protostome gata genes are often present in multiple copies within any one genome, and rapidly evolving gene sequences have obscured orthology among arthropod and nematode gata homologs.
using molecular phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences, together with conserved synteny and comparisons of intron/exon structure, we inferred the evolutionary relationships among these  <dig> protostome gata homologs.
furthermore, the intron/exon structures of the arthropod gata <dig> orthologs suggest a distinct order of gene duplication events.
reciprocal best hit blast analysis suggested orthology of these gata genes to either the ancestral bilaterian gata <dig> or the gata <dig> class.
we have identified the complete gata complement  from a diverse sampling of protostome genomes, including six arthropods, three lophotrochozoans, and two nematodes.
