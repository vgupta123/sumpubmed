a similar localisation was observed for vha-e <dig>  whereas  the subcellular localisation of vha-e <dig> indicated the trans golgi network -specifity of this subunit.
the transmembrane topology and stoichiometry of the proteolipid vha-c" as well as the stoichiometry of the membrane integral subunit vha-e within the v-atpase complex were investigated by in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer .
however, neither vha-c" isoform  <dig> nor any of the two vha-e isoforms were identified at the tonoplast.
whereas the membrane integral subunit vha-e is present in two copies within the complex, the proteolipid subunit vha-c" takes part in complex formation with only one copy.
the plant proteolipid ring is a highly flexible protein subcomplex, tolerating the incorporation of truncated and hybrid proteolipid subunits, respectively.
this suggest a function in endomembrane specific vha-assembly or targeting rather than proton transport.
