the basis of the program is a generic genome browser with sub-maps holding information about genomic objects .
documentation, tutorials and demonstration sites are available at the url: http://genopole.pasteur.fr/syntview.
syntview is not linked to any particular database, allowing the user to plug his own data into the system seamlessly, and use external web services for added functionalities.
this innovative approach to data exploration could not be achieved with most existing genome browsers, which are more static and/or do not offer multiple views of multiple genomes.
the software is characterised by the presentation of syntenic organisations of microbial genomes and the visualisation of polymorphism data  along these genomes; these features are accessible to the user in an integrated way.
the most important assets of syntview are:  the interactivity due to the flash technology;  the capabilities for dynamic interaction between many specialised views; and  the flexibility allowing various user data sets to be integrated.
it can thus be used to investigate massive amounts of information efficiently at the chromosome level.
we developed syntview, a comparative and interactive viewer for microbial genomes, designed to run as either a web-based tool  or a desktop application .
