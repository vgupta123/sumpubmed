we have tested the software on a large data set  produced by subtractive hybridization.
est express is an open-source, cross-platform web server application that imports sequences from cdna libraries, such as those generated through subtractive hybridization or yeast two-hybrid screens.
the emergence of redundant databases such as unigene and centralized annotation engines such as entrez gene has allowed the development of software that can analyze a great number of sequences in a matter of seconds.
the software consists of a user-friendly gui powered by php and mysql that allows for online collaboration between researchers and continuity with unigene, entrez gene and refseq.
two key features of the software include a novel, simplified entrez gene parser and tools to manage cdna library sequencing projects.
it then provides several layers of annotation based on entrez gene and refseq to allow the user to highlight useful genes and manage cdna library projects.
