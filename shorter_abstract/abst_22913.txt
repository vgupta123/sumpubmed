we show that such differences in gene expression can be used to differentiate between etanercept responders and non-responders.
among all patients, 50% exhibited a heightened inflammatory signature, with increased expression of genes expressed by t-cells, monocytes and dendritic cells.
epidermal degs, however, may be driven by the activity of ap- <dig> and cellular responses to il- <dig>  il-17a and il- <dig> family cytokines.
psoriasis degs are partly explained by shifts in the cellular composition of psoriasis lesions.
psoriasis lesions are characterized by large-scale shifts in gene expression.
we analyzed existing datasets to evaluate genome-wide expression in lesions from  <dig> psoriasis patients.
our aims were to identify mechanisms that drive differential expression and to characterize heterogeneity among lesions in this large sample.
among patients, we uncovered a range of inflammatory- and cytokine-associated gene expression patterns.
