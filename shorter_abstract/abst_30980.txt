successful transformation of these species requires an understanding of factors controlling expression of their genes.
this study characterizes the levels of gus expression and levels of uida mrna that code for β-glucuronidase  expression in leaves of gladiolus and arabidopsis using gubq <dig>  a polyubiquitin promoter with a  <dig>  kb intron, isolated from the non-cereal monocot gladiolus, and an intronless version of this promoter.
in arabidopsis and gladiolus, the presence of uida mrna was independent of the presence of the 5′utr-intron.
the 5′utr-intron from gubq <dig> resulted in a similar pattern of β-glucuronidase translation efficiency for both species even though the intron resulted in different patterns of uida mrna accumulation for each species.
gus expression was significantly decreased in gladiolus and abolished in arabidopsis when the 5′utr-intron was absent.
the gubq <dig> promoter directs high levels of gus expression in young leaves of both gladiolus and arabidopsis.
gladiolus and arabidopsis were verified by southern hybridization to be transformed with the uida gene that was under control of either the gubq <dig> promoter , a 5′ gubq <dig> promoter missing its  <dig>  kb intron , or the camv 35 s promoter.
there are many non-cereal monocots of agronomic, horticultural, and biofuel importance.
the 5′-utr intron enhanced translation efficiency for both gladiolus and arabidopsis.
introns have been known to affect both the level and tissue-specific expression of genes in dicots and cereal monocots, but there have been no studies on an intron isolated from a non-cereal monocot.
