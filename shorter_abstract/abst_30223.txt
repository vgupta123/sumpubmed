global analysis of gene expression changes in whole r. microplus ticks during larval, pre-attachment and early adult stages feeding on bos indicus and bos taurus cattle were compared using gene expression microarray analysis.
r. microplus ticks demonstrate different transcript expression patterns when they encounter tick resistant and susceptible breeds of cattle.
existing knowledge pertaining to the host or host breed effects on tick transcript expression profiles during the tick - host interaction is poor.
the analysis of all tick stages under survey suggested a coordinated regulation of defence proteins, proteases and protease inhibitors to achieve successful attachment and survival of r. microplus on different host breeds, particularly bos indicus cattle.
in this study we provide the first transcriptome evidence demonstrating the influence of tick resistant and susceptible cattle breeds on transcript expression patterns and the molecular physiology of ticks during host attachment and feeding.
among the  <dig>  r. microplus transcripts from bmigi version  <dig> we identified  <dig> high and  <dig> low expressed transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed between r. microplus feeding on tick resistant cattle  compared to r. microplus feeding on tick susceptible cattle  .
the microarray data used in this analysis have been submitted to ncbi geo database under accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>
