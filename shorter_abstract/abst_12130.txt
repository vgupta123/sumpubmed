an oligo-dna microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in r. decussatus heavily infected by perkinsus olseni.
the extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed.
an overview on the genes related with the immune system on r. decussatus transcriptome is also reported.
after we sequenced r. decussatus transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to perkinsiosis.
the grooved carpet shell clam ruditapes decussatus is the autochthonous european clam and the most appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view.
in this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the carpet shell clam and perkinsus, two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction.
