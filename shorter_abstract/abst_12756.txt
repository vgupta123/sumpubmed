transpath database key node analysis identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/ <dig> activation pathway as the putative target of bf/s+l/ep and cytopiloyne.
functional comparative genomic analysis of the cellular immunological effects of different anti-inflammatory phytocompounds is considered as a helpful approach to distinguish the complex and specific bioactivities of candidate phytomedicines.
western blot confirmed that delayed inactivation of the erk pathway was indeed demonstrable for these two preparations during the mid-stage  of lps stimulation.
the current focused dna microarray approach rapidly identified important subgenomic differences in the pattern of immune cell-related gene expression in response to specific anti-inflammatory phytocompounds.
