we therefore compare prism's performance against nine popular motif finders on  <dig> well-characterized s. cerevisiae regulons.
the identification of statistically overrepresented sequences in the upstream regions of coregulated genes should theoretically permit the identification of potential cis-regulatory elements.
however, in practice many cis-regulatory elements are highly degenerate, precluding the use of an exhaustive word-counting strategy for their identification.
the relationship between statistical measures of the binding sites and the set as a whole leads to a simple means of identifying the diverse range of cis-regulatory elements to which a protein binds.
this approach requires no tunable parameters, thereby lending itself to unbiased performance comparisons.
our results support a proposed mechanism of action for the yeast cell-cycle transcription factor stb <dig>  whose binding site has not been determined experimentally.
in this paper, we report prism, a degenerate motif finder that leverages the relationship between the statistical significance of a set of binding sites and that of the individual binding sites.
prism first identifies overrepresented, non-degenerate consensus motifs, then iteratively relaxes each one into a high-scoring degenerate motif.
this approach leverages the advantages of word-counting, in that position dependencies are implicitly accounted for and local optima are more easily avoided.
while numerous methods exist for inferring base distributions using a position weight matrix, recent studies suggest that the independence assumptions inherent in the model, as well as the inability to reach a global optimum, limit this approach.
