one approach to make it more manageable is to focus on the inference of context-specific networks involving a few interacting transcription factors  and all of their target genes.
we present a computational framework for bayesian statistical inference of target genes of multiple interacting tfs from high-throughput gene expression time-series data.
we use ordinary differential equation models that describe transcription of target genes taking into account combinatorial regulation.
our results show that it is possible to infer regulatory links between multiple interacting tfs and their target genes even from a single relatively short time series and in presence of unmodelled confounders and unreliable prior knowledge on training network connectivity.
during the prediction phase we apply bayesian model selection on a genome-wide scale and score all alternative regulatory structures for each target gene.
the method consists of a training and a prediction phase.
