we performed genome wide dna methylation profiling comparing normal-weight and obese 9â€“ <dig> year old children to investigate possible epigenetic changes correlated with obesity.
we conclude that coronin  <dig> is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and this role stems, to some degree, from the effect on feeding for calories and reward.
anatomical profiling of coronin  <dig>  mrna expression in mice revealed that it is highly expressed in appetite and energy balance regulating regions, including the hypothalamus, striatum and locus coeruleus, the main noradrenergic brain site.
interestingly, we found that food deprivation in mice downregulates hypothalamic coro <dig> mrna levels, and injecting ethanol, an appetite stimulant, increased the number of coro <dig> expressing cells in the locus coeruleus.
of note, obese children had significantly lower methylation levels at a cpg site located near coronin  <dig> , which encodes a tryptophan-aspartic acid dipeptide -repeat containing protein most likely involved in golgi complex morphology and function.
