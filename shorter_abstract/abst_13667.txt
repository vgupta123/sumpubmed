to evaluate this, we investigated the effect of hfq on the expression of virulence-associated genes including thermostable direct hemolysin , which is considered to be an important virulence factor in v. parahaemolyticus, using an hfq deletion mutant.
interestingly, other genes involved in the pathogenicity of v. parahaemolyticus, such as vp <dig>  vopc, and vopt, were also up-regulated in the mutant strain.
hfq regulates the expression of virulence-associated factors such as tdh and may be involved in the pathogenicity of v. parahaemolyticus.
the transcriptional activity of tdha was particularly increased in the mutant strain.
however, it is not clear whether hfq regulates virulence in vibrio parahaemolyticus.
these results indicate that hfq is closely associated with the expression level of the tdh gene.
the hfq gene is conserved in a wide variety of bacteria and hfq is involved in many cellular functions such as stress responses and the regulation of gene expression.
it has also been reported that hfq is involved in bacterial pathogenicity.
quantification of tdh promoter activity and mrna demonstrated that transcription of the tdh gene was up-regulated in the mutant strain.
the production of tdh in the hfq deletion mutant was much higher than in the parental strain.
