we developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline for microrna sequencing data  that integrates read pre-processing, alignment, mature/precursor/novel mirna detection and quantification, data visualization, variant detection in mirna coding region, and more flexible differential expression analysis between experimental conditions.
using well characterized data, we demonstrated the pipeline’s superior performances, flexibility, and practical use in research and biomarker discovery.
however, analyzing mirna sequencing data is challenging as it needs significant amount of computational resources and bioinformatics expertise.
in either case, summary and expression reports for all samples are generated for easier quality assessment and downstream analyses.
the results are presented in the convenient way for investigators or analysts to conduct further investigation and discovery.
according to computational infrastructure, users can install the package locally or deploy it in amazon cloud to run samples sequentially or in parallel for a large number of samples for speedy analyses.

mirna profiling through next generation sequencing  has become the main platform for biological research and biomarker discovery.
lack of flexibility and reliability of these web applications are also common issues.
