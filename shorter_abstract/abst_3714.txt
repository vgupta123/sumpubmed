type vi glandular trichomes represent the most abundant trichome type on leaves and stems of tomato plants and significantly contribute to herbivore resistance, particularly in the wild species.
in both species, the junction between the intermediate cell and the four glandular cells constitute a breaking point facilitating the decapitation of the trichome and thereby the quick release of the metabolites.
using a variety of cell imaging techniques, a detailed record of the anatomy and developmental stages of type vi trichomes in the cultivated tomato  and in a related wild species  is provided.
the two species differ in the shape of the trichome head which is round in s. habrochaites and like a four-leaf clover in s. lycopersicum, correlating with the presence of a large intercellular cavity in s. habrochaites where the produced metabolites accumulate.
finally, immuno-labelling with antibodies recognizing specific cell wall components indicate a key role of pectin and arabinogalactan components in the differentiation of type vi trichomes.
our observations explain the adaptive morphologies of type vi trichomes for metabolite storage and release and provide a framework for further studies of these important metabolic cellular factories.

a strongly auto-fluorescent compound transiently accumulates in the early stages of development suggesting a potential role in the differentiation process.
