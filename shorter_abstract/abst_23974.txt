this species consists of two forms, denoted molestus and pipiens, that exhibit important behavioural and physiological differences.
furthermore, the differential introgression of molestus genes into the pipiens form may induce a more opportunistic biting behaviour in the latter thus potentiating its capacity to act as a bridge-vector for the transmission of arboviral infections.
higher proportions of admixture were observed in pipiens individuals suggesting that more molestus genes are being introgressed into the pipiens form than the opposite.
the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic status of these forms remain unclear.
both physiological/behavioural and genetic data provide evidence for the sympatric occurrence of molestus and pipiens forms of cx.
culex pipiens l. is the most widespread mosquito vector in temperate regions.
bayesian clustering analysis based on the genotypes of  <dig> microsatellites revealed two distinct genetic clusters that were highly correlated with the alternative traits that define pipiens and molestus.
in these southern habitats, the extent of hybridisation and its impact on the extent of genetic divergence between forms under sympatric conditions has not been clarified.
admixture analysis yielded hybrid rate estimates of 8-10%.
for this purpose, we have used phenotypic and genetic data to characterise cx.
in northern european latitudes molestus and pipiens populations occupy different habitats , a separation that most likely promotes genetic isolation between forms.
