depending on user preference, results can be publicized or shared by uploading to a web server or cloud driver, allowing other users to directly access results via a web browser.
this paper presents cispath, an r/bioconductor package deployed on cloud servers for client users to visualize, manage, and share functional protein interaction networks.
with this r package, users can easily integrate downloaded protein-protein interaction information from different online databases with private data to construct new and personalized interaction networks.
since the results produced with the use of this package are in the form of web pages, cloud users can easily view and edit the network graphs via the browser, using a mouse or touch screen, without the need to download them to a local computer.
the easy installation and operation is an attractive quality for r beginners and users with no previous experience with cloud services.
additional functions allow users to generate specific networks based on private databases.
since all network views are shown in web pages, such package is particularly useful for cloud users.
all software and associated data are hosted on the cloud, allowing users to access them via a web browser from any computer, anywhere.
