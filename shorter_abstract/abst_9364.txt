since our prediction method relies only on the conservation patterns of primary sequences, it also provides an opportunity to search novel selenoproteins and other readthrough proteins.
selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are the 21st and 22nd amino acids, which are genetically encoded by stop codons.
assuming that the 23rd amino acid is also encoded by a stop codon, we systematically predicted proteins that contain stop-codon-encoded amino acids from  <dig> prokaryotic genomes.
our result suggests that the unknown amino acid encoded by stop codons does not exist, or its phylogenetic distribution is rather limited, which is in agreement with the previous study on trna.
however, no promising candidate for the 23rd amino acid was detected, and only one novel selenoprotein was predicted.
a protein-level study will provide independent insight into the novel amino acid.
recently, a computational study addressed this question and reported that no trna gene for unknown amino acid was found in genome sequences available.
since a number of microbial genomes have been completely sequenced to date, it is tempting to ask whether the 23rd amino acid is left undiscovered in these genomes.
it successfully recovered many of currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins.
