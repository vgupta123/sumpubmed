in all cases we pay special attention to the integration of mutation impact services with external sadi services providing information about related biological entities, such as proteins, pathways, and drugs.
we have identified that sadi provides an effective way of exposing our mutation impact data such that it can be leveraged by a variety of stakeholders in multiple use cases.
our previous work on text mining for mutation impacts resulted in  the development of a gate-based pipeline that mines texts for information about impacts of mutations on proteins,  the population of this information into our owl dl mutation impact ontology, and  establishing an experimental semantic database for storing the results of text mining.
we describe several sadi services we created based on our text mining api and data, and demonstrate how they can be used in a number of biologically meaningful scenarios through a sparql interface  to sadi services.
sadi is a set of conventions for creating web services with semantic descriptions that facilitate automatic discovery and orchestration.
we describe a case study exploring and demonstrating the utility of the sadi approach in our context.
this article explores the possibility of using the sadi framework as a medium for publishing our mutation impact software and data.
