we first look for local similarities in a set of binding pockets and then check whether the bound ligands, even if completely different, share a common fragment that can account for the presence of the structural motif.
thanks to this method we can identify structural motifs whose functional significance is explained by the presence of shared features in the interacting ligands.
here we propose a novel methodology that takes into account the structure of both the binding pocket and the ligand.
the application of this method to a large dataset of binding pockets allows the identification of recurring protein motifs that bind specific ligand fragments, even in the context of molecules with a different overall structure.
previous approaches to the comparative analysis of binding pockets have usually been focused either on the ligand or the protein component.
in the former case the analysis is restricted to binding pockets interacting with similar ligands, while in the latter it is difficult to systematically check whether the observed structural similarities have a functional significance.
