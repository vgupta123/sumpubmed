we demonstrate that the developed method and taffel tool give new insight to the analysis of differentially expressed genes and can generate novel hypotheses.
a major challenge in genomic research is identifying significant biological processes and generating new hypotheses from large gene sets.
we present a novel method called independent enrichment analysis  and software taffel that eases the task by clustering genes to subgroups using gene ontology categories and transcription regulators.
our comparison to other popular methods showed that the iea method implemented in taffel can find important biological phenomena, which are not reported by other methods.
many of these pathways and the associated regulatory mechanisms might be obscured by a large number of other significant processes and thus not identified as significant by standard gene set enrichment analysis tools.
