instead a basal position as sister group to all other bilaterian animals was suggested, mainly based on molecular evidence.
phylogenetic analyses of concatenated alignments of amino acid sequences from protein coding genes support a position of acoela and nemertodermatida as the sister group to all other bilateria.
our data provided no support for a sister group relationship between xenoturbellida and acoela or acoelomorpha.
the phylogenetic position of xenoturbella bocki as sister group to or part of the deuterostomes was also unstable.
we describe the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a member of the acoela, symsagittifera roscoffensis.
gene content and circular organization of the mitochondrial genome does not significantly differ from other bilaterian animals.
however, gene order shows no similarity to any other mitochondrial genome within the metazoa.
gene order of mitochondrial genomes seems to be very variable among acoela and nemertodermatida and the groundplan for the metazoan mitochondrial genome remains elusive.
more data are needed to interpret mitochondrial genome evolution at the base of bilateria.
this led to the view that features of acoels might reflect those of the last common ancestor of bilateria, and resulted in several evo-devo studies trying to interpret bilaterian evolution using acoels as a proxy model for the "urbilateria".
as such they remain a valid source for seeking primitive characters present in the last common ancestor of bilateria.
