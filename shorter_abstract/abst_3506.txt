examination of hemichannel function by fluorescent dye uptake assays revealed that cells with cx26i30n and d50y mutations had increased dye uptake compared to cx26wt  containing cells, indicating abnormal hemichannel activities.
here, we demonstrated that cx26i30n and d50y mutations resulted in the formation of aberrant hemichannels that might result in elevated intracellular calcium levels, a process which may contribute to the hyperproliferative epidermal phenotypes of kid syndrome.
here, we assessed the effect of two cx <dig> mutations associated with kid syndrome, cx26i30n and d50y, on protein biosynthesis and channel function in n2a and hela cells.
cells with mutant proteins had elevated intracellular calcium levels compared to cx26wt transfected cells, which were abolished by a hemichannel blocker, carbenoxolone , as measured by fluo-3Â am loading and flow cytometry.
further, these mutations resulted in the retention of cx <dig> protein in the golgi apparatus.
immunostaining experiments showed that cx26i30n and d50y failed to form gap junction plaques at cell-cell contact sites.
gap junctions facilitate exchange of small molecules between adjacent cells, serving a crucial function for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
these mutations can alter the formation and function of gap junction channels through different mechanisms, and in turn interfere with various cellular processes leading to distinct disorders.
however, the effects of these aberrant hemichannels on cellular processes are recently being deciphered.
for example, mutations in connexin <dig>  cause both non-syndromic deafness and syndromic deafness associated with skin abnormalities such as keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness  syndrome.
the kid associated cx <dig> mutations were mostly shown to result in elevated hemichannel activities.
