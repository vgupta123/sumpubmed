surgical site infections  are a recognized risk of any surgical procedure in veterinary medicine.
evidence-based guidelines for these procedures in veterinary medicine should be established and implemented in order to help reduce preventable ssis, while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
patient contact time with soap ranged from 10-462 s , and with alcohol from 3-220 s .
contact time during surgeon hand preparation ranged from 7-529 s  for soap-and-water and from 4-123 s  for ahr.
contact times with preoperative preparatory solutions for both patients and surgeons were often shorter than recommended.
the objectives of this pilot study were to describe preoperative patient and surgeon preparation practices in a sample of non-equine companion animal veterinary clinics, and to determine if there were any areas that consistently did not meet current guidelines.
when patient hair removal was observed, it was most commonly done using clippers , and in only one case was it performed prior to anesthetic induction.
one of the keys to prevention of ssis is reducing exposure of the surgical site to endogenous and exogenous microbes, beginning in the preoperative period.
alcohol-based hand rub  was used preoperatively in 2/ <dig> facilities, but soap-and-water hand scrub was most commonly used at all clinics.
some preoperative preparation practices were relatively consistent between clinics in this study, while others were quite variable.
