association based on genotype classes resulted in similar values, but missed several significant probes.
a simulation study was used to successfully validate the number of associating markers.
instead, use of continuous genotypes simplifies the analysis, saves computational time and results more potential markers.
available methods are limited with respect to the ploidy level or data producing technologies.
while genotype classification is an established noise reduction step in diploids, it gains complexity with increasing ploidy levels.
we associated continuous genotypes to three different traits and compared the results to the output of the genotype caller supermassa.
linear, bayesian and partial least squares regression were applied, to determine if the use of continuous genotypes is limited to a specific method.
we were able to detect associating probes using continuous genotypes for multiple traits, using different regression methods.
association of various phenotypic traits with continuous genotypes is successful with both uni- and multivariate regression methods.

a disease, a flowering and a growth trait with h <dig> of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were associated with a hexaploid chrysanthemum genotypes.
linear and partial least squares regression led to numerous associating probes.
the increased number of possible genotype classes complicates the differentiation between them.
eventually, the errors produced by misclassifications exceed the benefits of genotype classes.
alternatively, continuous genotype values can be used for association analysis in higher polyploids.
