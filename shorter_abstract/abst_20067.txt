based on the size of the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and extent of validated predictions this model represents the most comprehensive up-to-date effort to catalogue methanogenic metabolism.
by following a systematic workflow we reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic model for m. acetivorans.
the model also correctly recapitulates metabolic pathway usage patterns of m. acetivorans such as the indispensability of flux through methanogenesis for growth on acetate and methanol and the unique biochemical characteristics under growth on carbon monoxide.
methanosarcina acetivorans, with a genome size of ~ <dig>  mb, is the largest sequenced archaeon methanogen and unique amongst the methanogens in its biochemical characteristics.
the model achieves  <dig> % prediction agreement with in vivo growth data across different substrates and multiple gene deletions.
the reconstructed model is available in spreadsheet and sbml formats to enable dissemination.
