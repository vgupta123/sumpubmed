our results showed that our som analysis with appropriate metabolic time-courses effectively revealed the synchronous dynamics among metabolic modules and elucidated the underlying biochemical functions.
hierarchical clustering of a correlation coefficient matrix could help identify the bottleneck enzymes that regulate metabolic networks.
unsupervised clustering of comprehensive metabolic profiles using kohonen's self-organizing map  allowed classification of the biochemical pathways activated by the light and dark cycle.
in recent plant metabolomics approaches, the reconstruction of metabolic correlation networks has been attempted using statistical techniques.
however, the results were unsatisfactory and effective data-mining techniques that apply appropriate comprehensive datasets are needed.
using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry  and capillary electrophoresis diode-array detection , we analyzed the dynamic changes in the level of  <dig> basic metabolites in plant foliage  at hourly intervals over a 24-hr period.
we also demonstrated that som analysis was applicable to the estimation of unidentifiable metabolites in metabolome analysis.
the carbon and nitrogen  metabolism in both periods was also visualized as a phenotypic linkage map that connects network modules on the basis of traditional metabolic pathways rather than pairwise correlations among metabolites.
