we assume that information on the dependence structure between the expression levels of a set of genes is available in the form of a bayesian network , derived from external resources.
this implicitly treats the gene expression levels as independent, but they are in fact highly interdependent, and exploiting this enables substantial power gains to be realized.
the proposed method is straightforward, simple to implement, gives rise to substantial power gains, and may assist in relating the experimental results to the underlying biology.
we apply this approach to two datasets: one from a hepatotoxicity study in rats using a ppar pathway, and the other from a study of the effects of smoking on the epithelial transcriptome, using a global transcription factor network.
although genome-scale expression experiments are performed routinely in biomedical research, methods of analysis remain simplistic and their interpretation challenging.
