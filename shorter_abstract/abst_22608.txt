further downstream network reconstruction analysis was carried out to unravel hidden general regulatory networks where novel interactions could be further validated in web-lab experimentation and be useful candidates to be targeted for the treatment of neuronal developmental diseases.
thirty-eight key transcripts were identified, using the svm-based recursive feature elimination  method of feature selection, to best differentiate developing neocortical cells from neural progenitor cells in the svm and rf classifiers built.
also, these genes possessed a higher discriminative power  as compared commonly used statistical techniques or geneset-based approaches.
it is believed to be extensible and applicable to other single-cell rna-seq expression profiles like that of the study of the cancer progression and treatment within a highly heterogeneous tumour.
in this paper, we describe the novel methodology for the analysis of single-cell rna-seq data, obtained from neocortical cells and neural progenitor cells, using machine learning algorithms  and random forest ).
this novel approach reported for is able to identify transcripts, with reported neuronal involvement, which optimally differentiate neocortical cells and neural progenitor cells.
