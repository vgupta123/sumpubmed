this multi-faceted characterization of cd <dig> from cynomolgus macaque demonstrates its high genetic and biochemical similarities with human cd <dig> while the immunological comparison adds new insights into the dominant epitopes of the primate cd <dig> ectodomain.
a cdna was isolated from cynomolgus macaque peripheral blood leukocytes and is predicted to encode a type ii membrane protein of  <dig> amino acids with 92% identity to human cd <dig>  both rt-pcr-mediated cdna cloning and genomic dna pcr surveying were possible with heterologous human cd <dig> primers, demonstrating the striking conservation of cd <dig> in these primates.
these results open new prospects for the biomedical and pharmacological investigations of this receptor-enzyme.
monoclonal antibodies were raised against the cynomolgus cd <dig> ectodomain and were either species-specific or cross-reactive with human cd <dig>  in which case they were directed against a common disulfide-requiring conformational epitope that was mapped to the c-terminal disulfide loop.
