if eastern africa is to work towards control of foot-and-mouth disease  using the progressive control pathway for fmd  as a tool, then the capacity of national reference laboratories  mandated to diagnose fmd should match this task.
this study assessed the laboratory capacity of  <dig> nrls of the eastern africa region laboratory network member countries using a semi-structured questionnaire and retrospective data from the world reference laboratory for fmd annual reports and genbank® through national centre for biotechnology information for the period 2006– <dig>
hence, for the region to progress on the pcp-fmd, there is need to: implement regional control measures, improve the serological diagnostic test performance and laboratory capacity of the nrls , and to establish a regional reference laboratory to enforce qms and characterization of fmd virus containing samples.
the majority  of the nrls used serological techniques to diagnose fmd, seven used antigen elisa and three of these  also used molecular techniques which were the tests most frequently requested from collaborating laboratories by the majority  of the nrls.
the questionnaire response rate was 13/ <dig> .
four  laboratories had no quality management systems  in place and where qms existed it was still deficient, thus, none of the laboratories had achieved accreditation for fmd diagnosis.
this study indicates that fmd diagnostic capacity in eastern africa is still inadequate and largely depends on antigen and antibody elisas techniques undertaken by the nrls.
