the average quality of snvs identified, measured as the ratio of transitions to transversions, was higher using single sample methods than multi sample methods.
we explored the consequences of commonly recommended preparatory steps and the effects of single and multi sample variant identification methods using four publicly available software applications  on whole genome sequence data of  <dig> key ancestors of swiss dairy cattle populations.
preparatory realignment of insertions and deletions and subsequent base quality score recalibration had only minor effects on the number and quality of snvs identified by different software, but increased computing time considerably.
a consensus approach using results of different software generally provided the highest variant quality in terms of transition/transversion ratio.
the total number of snvs identified varied by software and method, with single  sample results ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   million variants.
average concordance for single  sample results with high-density chip data was  <dig> %  and average genotype concordance in correctly identified snvs was  <dig> %  across software.
the challenges of variant identification in organisms with lower quality reference genomes are less well documented.
our findings serve as a reference for variant identification pipeline development in non-human organisms and help assess the implication of preparatory steps in next-generation sequencing pipelines for organisms with incomplete reference genomes .
