altogether, our pe-4cseq analysis pipeline provides a comprehensive characterization of dna deletion effects on chromatin structure and function.
a significant number of differentially interacting regions  and chromatin compaction changes were detected in the deletion chromosome compared to a wild-type  control.
we applied this strategy to the study of chromatin interaction changes upon a  <dig> Â mb dna deletion in mouse region 4e <dig>
selected dirs were validated by 3d dna fish experiments, demonstrating the robustness of our pipeline.
we developed a new quantitative framework based on polymer physics for the analysis of paired-end sequencing 4c  data.
circular chromosome conformation capture  has provided important insights into three dimensional  genome organization and its critical impact on the regulation of gene expression.
