pixel-wise model-based quantitative parameters are estimated by fitting dce-mri data to several pharmacokinetic models using the levenberg-marquardt algorithm .
the proposed tool has been specially designed for easy selection of multi-pixel rois.
dce@urlab is a software application for analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data .
this software application has been programmed in the interactive data language  and tested both with publicly available simulated data and preclinical studies from tumor-bearing mouse brains.
a user-friendly solution for applying pharmacokinetic and non-quantitative analysis dce-mri in preclinical studies has been implemented and tested.
the tool incorporates a friendly graphical user interface  to interactively select and analyze a region of interest  within the image set, taking into account the tissue concentration of the contrast agent  and its effect on pixel intensity.
a public release of dce@urlab, together with the open source code and sample datasets, is available at http://www.die.upm.es/im/archives/dceurlab/.
