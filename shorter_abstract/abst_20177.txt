expression patterns of jcmyb <dig> were detected by using qpcr transcriptional activity jcmyb <dig> were confirmed through yeast one hybrid.
jcmyb <dig> is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activity.
subcellular localization of jcmyb <dig> protein were demonstrated by transient expression in the tobacco leaf.
here we perform genome-wide identification of myb family transcription factors in an energy plant j. curcas, including determining family composition, phylogenetic evolution and functional prediction analysis.
a comprehensive genome-wide analysis and phylogenetic relationship of r2r3-myb subfamily in j. curcas present the global identification and functional prediction of jcr2r3-mybs.
the myb family is one of the most abundant transcription factor families in plants.
additionally, jcmyb <dig> regulates the stress response signaling networks by interacting with meja and aba signaling pathway and functions in the root development of j. curcas.
jcmyb <dig> overexpressing plants are more tolerant to salt and cold stress than wild type plants.
the biological functions of some jcmybs were predicted according to orthology.
all of the r2r3-mybs are further classified into  <dig> groups which indicated functional conservation among previously identified groups of r2r3-myb proteins.
myb proteins are involved in plant development, abiotic stress tolerance, hormone signal transduction and disease resistance.
the function of jcmyb <dig> in salt and freezing tolerance were detected in transgenic plants.
