in the present study, we have used a comparative genomic approach to investigate gene content in  <dig> e. faecalis strains, with a special focus on cc <dig>  statistical analysis using fisher's exact test revealed  <dig> significantly enriched genes among cc2-strains.
from the draft genomes of cc2-strains hh <dig> and tx <dig>  we also identified a cc2-enriched non-v <dig> locus associated with the e. faecalis pathogenicity island .
population structure studies by multilocus sequence typing have defined distinct clonal complexes  of e. faecalis enriched in hospitalized patients .
the failure to identify pathogen-specific genes in enterococcus faecalis has led to a hypothesis where the virulence of different strains may be linked to strain-specific genes, and where the combined endeavor of the different gene-sets result in the ability to cause infection.
in conclusion, we have identified a set of genes with potential roles in adaptation or persistence in the hospital environment, and that might contribute to the ability of cc <dig> e. faecalis isolates to cause disease.
