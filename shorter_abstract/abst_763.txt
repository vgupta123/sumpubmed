we present an automated system which identifies the abstracts that contain an amino-acid-level mutation and then classifies them according to the mutation's effect on the enzyme.
for impact analysis, document classification is performed to identify the abstracts that contain a change in enzyme's stability or activity resulting from the mutation.
enzyminer identifies the abstracts that contain a protein mutation for a given enzyme and checks whether the abstract is related to a disease with the help of information extraction and machine learning techniques.
in this paper, therefore, we describe an unique method, termed as enzyminer, which automatically identifies the pubmed abstracts that contain information on the impact of a protein level mutation on the stability and/or the activity of a given enzyme.
though, several of the enzymes' databases are currently available, scientific literature still remains at large for up-to-date source of learning the effects of a mutation on an enzyme.
in the case of mutation identification, mugex, an automated mutation-gene extraction system has an accuracy of  <dig> % with a  <dig>  f-measure.
