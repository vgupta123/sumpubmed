no stomata was observed on exterior or interior gall surfaces under light or scanning electron microscopy, but their inner surfaces were covered with fungal hyphae.
in this research, we collected cup-like galls induced by bruggmanniella sp.
we characterized several of their photosynthetic characteristics including chlorophyll fluorescence , stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic capacity, biochemical components such as total soluble sugar, starches, free amino acids, and soluble proteins.
compared with host leaves, galls exhibited slightly lower chlorophyll fluorescence; however, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity were not detected at all.
galls accumulated higher total soluble sugars and free amino acids but less soluble proteins than host leaves.
confocal imagery showed a gradient of chloroplasts distribution between gall outer and inner surfaces.
our results strongly suggest that leaf-derived cecidomyiid galls are a type of chlorophyll-deficient non-leaf green tissue and consists on a novel sink in l. acuminate.
on host leaves of litsea acuminata and assessed them to investigate source-sink relationships between galls and host leaves.
