ultra-high throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities both for discovery of novel molecular species and for detailed comparisons of gene expression patterns.
we tested several computational approaches for the analysis of class differences between high throughput sequencing datasets and describe a novel application of a log linear model that has provided the most effective analysis for this data.
we prepared small rna libraries from  <dig> tumour/normal pairs of human cervical tissue samples.
this method resulted in the identification of  <dig> mirnas that were differentially-expressed between the tumour and normal samples at a false discovery rate less than  <dig> .
both arms of the hairpin precursor were observed in twenty-three of the newly identified mirna candidates.
this approach can potentially be applied to any kind of rna sequencing data for analysing differential sequence representation between biological sample sets.
