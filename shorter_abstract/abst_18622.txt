transcranial magnetic stimulation  was used to investigate how changes in corticospinal excitability  are dependent on anticipated task variables of intended future actions.
specifically, single- and paired-pulse tms was used to evaluate corticospinal excitability during the action selection phase preparatory to grasp execution.
anticipatory planning, the ability to anticipate future perceptual-motor demands of a goal-oriented action sequence, is essential for flexible, purposeful behavior.
once an action goal has been defined, movement details necessary to achieve that goal can be selected.
how, we may ask, are the cerebral circuits involved in movement selection influenced by anticipated object-center task demands?
anticipation of intended task demands plays an important role in controlling multi- step actions during which ongoing behavior may need to be adjusted.
