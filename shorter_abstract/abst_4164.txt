the prevalence and type of plasmids, resistance genes and integrons carried by two collections of multiresistant e. coli producing or not extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases have been compared.
no significant differences were observed in the distribution of class  <dig> and class  <dig> integrons among multiresistant e. coli producing or not esbl, and dfra17-ant-ie was the cassette arrangement most commonly found.
in the concrete temporal and geographical context of this study, multiresistant e. coli producing esbl or other mechanisms of resistance were largely clonally diverse and present some differences in the types of harboured plasmids.
class  <dig> and class  <dig> integrons and antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by pcr and sequencing.
