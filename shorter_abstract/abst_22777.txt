solid tumours comprise various cells, including cancer cells, resident stromal cells, migratory haemopoietic cells and other.
a co-culture of canine mammary cancer cells and macrophages was established and maintained for  <dig> hrs.
having sorted the cells, gene expression in cancer cells and macrophages, using dna microarrays, was examined.
the microarray analysis revealed that co-culturing of cancer cells with macrophages initiated the myeloid-specific antigen expression in cancer cells, as well as cytokine/chemokine genes expression.
the presence of macrophages in the cancer environment induces acquisition of the macrophage phenotype  in cancer cells.
we presumed that cancer cells also acquire other myeloid features, such as: capabilities of cell rolling, spreading, migration and matrix invasion .
it may, perhaps, be the result of myeloid-cancer cell hybrid formation, or cancer cells mimicking macrophages phenotype, owing to various proteins secreted by macrophages.
microarray analysis showed that the up-regulated genes in the cancer cell lines are involved in  <dig> highly over-manifested pathways.
the results were confirmed using real-time qpcr and confocal microscopy.
this finding was confirmed at mrna and protein level.
exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms that orchestrate these phenomena has been the aim of our study.
these cells regulate tumour growth and metastasis.
macrophages constitute probably the most important element of all interactions within the tumour microenvironment.
