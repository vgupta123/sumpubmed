genes encoding putative transcriptional regulators, basal transcription factors, signal perception/transduction proteins, and chemotaxis/phototaxis proteins were abundant in the genome.
magadii has the genetic potential to adapt to its milieu by intracellular accumulation of inorganic cations and/or neutral organic compounds.
a proton-driven atp synthase and a variety of putative cytochromes and other proteins supporting aerobic respiration and electron transfer were encoded by one or more of nab.
the genome encodes a number of putative proteases/peptidases as well as protein secretion functions.
the knowledge gained from the genome sequence of this haloalkaliphilic archaeon is highly valuable in advancing the applications of extremophiles and their enzymes.
magadii is predicted to be metabolically versatile and it could use different carbon and energy sources to sustain growth.
comparative genome analyses facilitated the identification of genes encoding putative proteins involved in adaptation to hypersalinity, stress response, glycosylation, and polysaccharide biosynthesis.
natrialba magadii is an aerobic chemoorganotrophic member of the euryarchaeota and is a dual extremophile requiring alkaline conditions and hypersalinity for optimal growth.
magadii protein coding genes could not be assigned a function based on blast analysis and have been annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins.
magadii genes involved in coenzyme biosynthesis is a necessary step toward further reconstruction of the metabolic pathways in halophilic archaea and other extremophiles.
magadii consists of four replicons with a total sequence of  <dig> , <dig> bp and encodes  <dig>  putative proteins, some of which contain peptide repeats of various lengths.
