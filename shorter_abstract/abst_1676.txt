here we report that over-expression of full-length mnek <dig> inhibited ciliogenesis without disrupting centrosomes in the murine renal epithelial cell line imcd <dig>  in contrast, over-expression of the kinase domain with its associated basic region, but without the acidic domain, caused loss of centrosomes.
the neks are known as cell cycle kinases, but recent work in protists has revealed that in addition to roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression, some neks also regulate cilia.
we propose that neks participate in the coordination of ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression.
mutations in nek <dig>  are causal in the murine models of polycystic kidney disease kat and kat2j.
both defective ciliogenesis in response to too much mnek <dig> and disassembly of centrosomes in response to expression of the kinase lacking the presumptive regulatory domain was abrogated by kinase-inactivating mutations or by removal of the coiled-coil domain.
we observed that kinase-inactive, c-terminal truncations of mnek <dig> retaining the coiled-coil domain localized to the cilium, and we define a ciliary targeting region within the coiled-coil domain.
