this report presents results from a systematic screen for variation in repetitive dna in the genome of c. difficile.
based on an investigation of  <dig> c. difficile isolates comprising  <dig> ribotypes, tandem repeat sequencing demonstrated excellent concordance with widely used pcr ribotyping and equal discriminatory power.
we conclude that sequence analysis of the two repetitive loci introduced here may be highly useful for routine typing of c. difficile.
we describe two tandem repeat loci, designated 'tr6' and 'tr10', which display extensive sequence variation that may be useful for sequence-based strain typing.
moreover, tandem repeat sequences enabled the reconstruction of the isolates' largely clonal population structure and evolutionary history.
dna sequences may be stored in databases accessible over the internet, obviating the need for the exchange of reference strains.
tandem repeat sequence typing resolves phylogenetic diversity to a level equivalent to pcr ribotypes.
portability of genotyping data is desirable to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons and epidemiological studies.
