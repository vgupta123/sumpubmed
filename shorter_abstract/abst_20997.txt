in this study, we developed a gexp analyzer-based multiplex pcr assay to simultaneously detect seven aminoglycoside-resistance genes, including aac-ii, aac-ib, aac-ii, ant-i,aph-vi,arma and rmtb, and to analyze the distribution of these genes in clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates.
this gexp assay is demonstrated to be a rapid, cost-effective and high throughput method with high sensitivity and specificity for simultaneously detecting seven common aminoglycoside-resistance genes.
the presented method was applied to analyze the distribution of aminoglycoside-resistance genes in  <dig> clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates, and the results were compared with that of the conventional single pcr assay.
therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid, less-costly and high throughput and sensitive method to investigate the distribution of antimicrobial resistance gene in clinical isolates.
kappa values of the two methods for detecting each of the seven resistance genes were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
characterization and distribution of antimicrobial resistance gene profiles provide important information on the potential difficulty of treatment of bacteria.
the aminoglycoside-resistance genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and 16s rrna methyltransferases are main factors contributing to increasing resistance to aminoglycosides.
several molecular methods have been developed to investigate the prevalence of aminoglycoside-resistance genes.
these existing methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive or limited sensitivity in the epidemiological investigation.
