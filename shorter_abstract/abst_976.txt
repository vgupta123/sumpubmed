in a sample of  <dig> mexican-american subjects , we interrogated dna methylation differences by sex at birth using the 450 k beadchip in umbilical cord blood specimens, adjusting for cell composition.
we confirmed previously reported trends that methylation profiles are sex-specific even in autosomal genes, and also identified novel sex-associated cpgs in our methylome-wide analysis immediately after birth, a critical yet relatively unstudied developmental window.
host factors like sex and age strongly influence biological variation of dna methylation, but characterization of these relationships is still limited, particularly in young children.
further, for replicated hits, the direction of the association with methylation was highly concordant  with previous studies.
using pathway analysis, we found that sex-associated autosomal cpgs were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms related to nervous system development and behavior.
we observed that ~3 % of cpg sites were differentially methylated between girls and boys at birth .
among hits in our study,  <dig>  % had been previously reported as sex-associated cpg sites in other published human studies.
dna methylation is an important epigenetic mark that can potentially link early life exposures to adverse health outcomes later in life.
beyond individual cpgs, we found  <dig> sex-associated differentially methylated regions  where the majority  had higher methylation in girls.
to our knowledge, this is the first reported epigenome-wide analysis by sex at birth that examined dmrs and adjusted for confounding by cell composition.
