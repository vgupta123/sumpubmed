we used the respiratory bacterium bordetella bronchiseptica and its common natural host, the rabbit, to examine the intensity and duration of oro-nasal bacteria shedding in relation to changes in the level of serum antibodies, blood cells, cytokine expression and number of bacteria colonies in the respiratory tract.
differences in the initial number of bacteria shed between the first two groups were associated with differences in the level of serum antibodies and white blood cells.
shedding was positively affected by number of bacteria in the nasal cavity  but negatively influenced by serum igg, which also contributed to the initial reduction of bacteria in the nasal cavity.
three main patterns of shedding were identified: i- bacteria were shed intermittently , ii- bacteria shedding fell with the progression of the infection  and iii- individuals never shed bacteria despite being infected .
the mechanisms regulating these interactions are still obscure and more studies are needed to understand the persistence of bacteria in the upper respiratory tract and the processes controlling the intensity and duration of shedding.
these results suggest that the immunological conditions at the early stage of the infection may play a role in modulating the long term dynamics of b. bronchiseptica shedding.
we propose that igg influences the threshold of bacteria in the oro-nasal cavity which then affects the intensity and duration of individual shedding.
the role of host immunity has been recognized as not only playing a fundamental role in the interaction between the host and pathogen but also in influencing host infectiousness and the ability to shed pathogens.
findings show that infected rabbits shed b. bronchiseptica by contact up to  <dig>  months post infection.
