we characterized hundreds of mirnas in neuronal culture development and identified three major modes of mirna expression.
a number of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were located in five genomic clusters.
three main developmental patterns of microrna expression were observed: steady-state levels, up-regulated and down-regulated.
we examined mouse primary neuronal cultures, analyzing microrna and mrna expression.
micrornas are now recognized to be important regulators of mrna translation and stability in a wide variety of organisms.
