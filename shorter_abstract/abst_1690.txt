the aim of the present study is to histopathologically and genetically characterize a new animal model of pah and clarify the role of ox <dig> ligand in the pathogenesis of pah.
pah occurs with a secondary as well as a primary onset.
genetic analyses demonstrated a susceptibility locus of a b <dig> allele to this onset on chromosome  <dig>  immunological analyses revealed that the excessive ox <dig> signals in tgl mice attenuates expansion of regulatory t cells the b <dig> genetic background, suggesting an impact of the b <dig> genetic background on the differentiation of regulatory t cells.
comparative analysis performed using different strains of transgenic mice showed that this onset depends on the presence of ox40l in the b <dig> genetic background.
present findings suggest a role for the ox40l-derived immune response and epistatic genetic effect in immune-mediated pathogenesis of pah.
pulmonary arterial hypertension  is a disease category that clinically presents with severe ph and that is histopathologically characterized by the occlusion of pulmonary arterioles, medial muscular hypertrophy, and/or intimal fibrosis.
histopathological and physical examinations revealed the onset of pah-like disorders in the c57bl/ <dig>  strain of ox40l transgenic mice .
