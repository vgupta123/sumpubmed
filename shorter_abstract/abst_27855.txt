we provide evidence that  the evolutionary breakpoints that characterise human syntenies detected in the basal afrotheria correspond at the chromosomal band level with fragile sites,  that hsa 3p/ <dig> was in the amniote ancestor  and was subsequently disrupted in the lineage leading to marsupials.
inddition, by computationally scanning the newly released opossum  and chicken sequence assemblies for use as outgroups to placentalia, we validate the hsa 3/21/ <dig> chromosomal synteny as a rare genomic change that defines the monophyly of this ancient african clade of mammals.
here we test if there are chromosomal bands with a high tendency to break and reorganize in afrotheria, and by analyzing the expression of aphidicolin-induced common fragile sites in three afrotherian species, whether these are coincidental with recognized evolutionary breakpoints.
given that afrotheria is generally thought to root the eutherian tree in phylogenetic analysis of large nuclear gene data sets, the study of the organization of the genomes of afrotherian species provides new insights into the dynamics of mammalian chromosomal evolution.
we show that fragile sites are conserved among afrotherian species and these are correlated with evolutionary breakpoints when compared to the human  genome.
we described  <dig> fragile sites in the aardvark  genome,  <dig> in the golden mole , and  <dig> in the elephant-shrew  genome.
extant placental mammals are divided into four major clades .
on the other hand, support for hsa 1/19p, which is also thought to underpin afrotheria, is currently ambiguous.
