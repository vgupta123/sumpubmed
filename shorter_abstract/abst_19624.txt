for the convenience of further research, these reads should be aligned to the reference genome by read alignment tools.
despite the diversity of read alignment tools, most have no comprehensive advantage in both accuracy and speed.
we believe that the speed of read alignment tools still has huge room for improvement, while maintaining little to no loss in accuracy.
here we implement a new read alignment tool, fast seed-and-vote aligner , which is based on seeding and voting.
in some cases, reads have to be aligned in a short time.
it only requires ~10– <dig> cpu hours to run a whole genome read alignment, which is ~5– <dig> times faster than bwa.
