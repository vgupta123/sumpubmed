strains has revealed a high number of transposable elements in two of the strains.
the results of this study suggest that is elements may help drive chromosome differences in different frankia sp.
ean1pec  has  <dig> transposase orfs from  <dig> is families comprising  <dig> % of its cds.
strain acn14a  differs significantly from the other strains with only  <dig> transposase orfs  from  <dig> is families.
to identify putative or decaying is elements, a psi-tblastn search was performed on all three genomes, identifying 36%, 39% and 12% additional putative transposase orfs than originally annotated in strains cci <dig>  ean and acn, respectively.
the distribution of transposase orfs in each strain was then analysed using a sliding window, revealing significant clustering of elements in regions of the ean and cci <dig> genomes.
analysis of transposase orfs in frankia sp.
the clustering of transposase orfs near lcrs revealed a tendency for is elements to be associated with regions of chromosome instability in the three strains.
genome analysis of three frankia sp.
exceptions to this include representatives from the is <dig> family in strain ean and seven is <dig> transposases in all three strains that have a lower g+c content, suggesting recent horizontal transfer.
insertion sequences in the frankia genomes were analyzed using blast searches, phyml phylogenies and the irf  algorithms.
