six rna-seq libraries  were constructed and separately sequenced.
finally, a unigene  with strong homology to the s-rnase was analyzed.
rna-seq was employed to explore the molecular mechanisms of si and to identify si-related genes in c. sinensis.
the present study reports the transcriptome of styles after cross- and self-pollination in tea and offers novel insights into the molecular mechanism behind si in c. sinensis.
the rna-seq data were validated by qrt-pcr of  <dig> unigenes.
we believe that this rna-seq dataset will be useful for improvement in c. sinensis as well as other plants in the theaceae family.
it was mainly expressed in styles, with dramatically higher expression in self-pollinated versus cross-pollinated tissues at 24 h post-pollination.
the growth of pollen tubes following selfing and crossing was observed using fluorescence microscopy.
self-pollen tubes grew slower than cross treatments from 24 h to 72 h after pollination.
following assembly,  <dig>  unigenes were identified, and  <dig>   unigenes were annotated in five public databases: nr, kog, kegg, swiss-port and go.
uncovering the molecular basis of si of the tea plant may enhance breeding and simplify genomics research for the whole family.
