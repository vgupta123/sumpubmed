although functionally enigmatic, diversity in baculum form is hypothesised to result from sexual selection.
by providing the first evidence linking baculum morphology to male reproductive success, our results support the hypothesis that evolutionary diversity in baculum form is driven by sexual selection.

after controlling for body size and other reproductive traits, the width  of the house mouse baculum predicts both the mean number of offspring sired per litter and total number of offspring sired.
here we show that baculum size explains significant variation in the reproductive success of male house mice under competitive conditions.
diversity in penile morphology is characterised by extraordinary variation in the size and shape of the baculum  found in many mammals.
