we suggest that the horizontal gene transfer of a mitochondrial intron was facilitated by a symbiotic relationship between fungus and sponge.
the mitochondrial genome of metazoa is usually a compact molecule without introns.
ecological relationships are known to have implications at the genomic level.
here, an ecological relationship between sponge and fungus is suggested based on the genomic analysis.
exceptions to this rule have been reported only in corals and sea anemones , in which group i introns have been discovered in the cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes.
a phylogenetic analysis of the coi protein sequence and of the intron open reading frame suggests that the intron may have been transmitted horizontally from a fungus donor.
similar to all the cnidarian mitochondrial introns, the putative intron has group i intron characteristics.
