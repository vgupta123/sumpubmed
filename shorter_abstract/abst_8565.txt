svseq <dig> achieves more accurate calling through split-read mapping within focal regions.
svseq <dig> enables accurate and efficient sv calling through split-read mapping within focal regions using paired-end reads.
among these approaches, split-read mapping methods can be applied on low-coverage sequence data.
moreover, svseq <dig> supports insertion calling from low-coverage sequence data, while svseq <dig> only supports deletion finding.
recent advances in sequencing technologies make it possible to comprehensively study structural variations  using sequence data of large-scale populations.
for many simulated data and real sequence data, svseq <dig> outperforms some other existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency, especially when sequence coverage is low.
currently, more efforts have been taken to develop methods that call svs with exact breakpoints.
in this paper, we present a split-read mapping method implemented in the program svseq <dig> which improves our previous work svseq <dig>  similar to svseq <dig>  svseq <dig> calls deletions  with exact breakpoints.
svseq <dig> is also much faster because it only needs to examine a small number of ways of splitting the reads.
svseq <dig> also has a much desired feature: there is no need to specify the maximum deletion size, while some existing split-read mapping methods need more memory and longer running time when larger maximum deletion size is chosen.
