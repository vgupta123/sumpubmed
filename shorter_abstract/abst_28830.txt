the proposed method uses a novel filtering technique based on the longest common subsequence to identify similar sequence pairs.
the lcs-hit clustering program, using a novel filtering technique based on the longest common subsequence, is significantly faster than cd-hit without compromising clustering accuracy.

moreover, the filtering technique itself is independent from the cd-hit algorithm.
for a dataset of two million dna sequences, our method was approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times faster than cd-hit for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bases, respectively.
however, data analysis methods have not kept up, making it difficult to process the vast amounts of available sequence data.
