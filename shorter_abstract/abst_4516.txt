a broad comparison of cleavage types and apical cross patterns across lophotrochozoa shows high plasticity of these character sets and we therefore argue that these developmental traits should be treated and interpreted carefully when used for phylogenetic inferences.
however, developmental data on entoprocts employing modern methods are virtually non-existent and the data available rely exclusively on sketch drawings, thus calling for thorough re-investigation.
an apical rosette, typical for most spiralian embryos, is formed.
by applying fluorescence staining in combination with confocal microscopy and 3d-imaging techniques, we analyzed early embryonic development of a basal loxosomatid entoproct.
while the largest lophotrochozoan assemblage, the spiralia, which at least comprises annelida, mollusca, entoprocta, platyhelminthes, and nemertea, show a spiral cleavage pattern, ectoprocta, brachiopoda and phoronida  cleave radially.
