during a substantial elevation in scarlet fever  notifications in  <dig> a national genomic study was undertaken of streptococcus pyogenes  isolates from patients with sf with comparison to isolates from patients with invasive disease  to test the hypotheses that the increase in sf was due to either the introduction of one or more new/emerging strains in the population in england or the transmission of a known genetic element through the population of gas by horizontal gene transfer  resulting in infections with an increased likelihood of causing sf.
there is no evidence that the increased number of sf cases was a strain-specific or known mobile element specific phenomenon, as the increase in sf cases was associated with multiple lineages of gas.
post-normalisation emm types,  <dig> and  <dig>  were found to be over-represented in patients with sf versus igas .
no single phage was found to be over represented in sf vs igas.
isolates from patients with sf were of multiple distinct emm sequence types and phylogenetic lineages.
