based on our analyses, clutch number , number of fledglings in the brood, and age of breeding females were significant predictors of fledgling survival.
this paper describes fledgling mortality in the captive breeding population, and seeks to identify factors associated with fledgling survival and, ultimately, to identify steps to mitigate fledgling mortality.

unfortunately, high numbers of unexplained deaths among young birds in the captive breeding population threatened the success of this program.
over the study period  at two breeding sites,  <dig> losh were fledged.
