most existing methods seek recurrent patterns in known proteins based on manually-validated alignments of known protein families.
this paper concerns protonet, a automatic unsupervised global clustering system that generates a hierarchical tree of over  <dig> , <dig> proteins, based solely on sequence similarity.
this makes our current view of the protein world incomplete and biased.
in this paper we show that protonet correctly captures functional and structural aspects of the protein world.
