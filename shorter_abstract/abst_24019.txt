an internal ribosome entry site  was introduced for using two green fluorescence protein  fragments as a reporter to both antibody chains, the heavy chain and the light chain.
fluorescence-activated cell sorting -based cell line development is an efficient strategy for the selection of cho cells in high therapeutic protein production.

the qab was highly correlated with the fluorescence intensity with a high correlation coefficient, evidenced from the analysis of median gfp and qab in individual selected clones.
the facs-sorted pool with gfp expression had a higher specific antibody productivity  than that of the unsorted pool.
this study proved that the fragment complementation for split gfp could be an efficient indication for antibody production on the basis of high correlation of qab with reconstitution of gfp.
the cells co-transfected with two gfp fragments showed the emission of green fluorescence by the reconstitution of split gfp.
the establishment of high producer is an important issue in chinese hamster ovary  cell culture considering increased heterogeneity by the random integration of a transfected foreign gene and the altered position of the integrated gene.
taken together, we developed an efficient facs-based screening method for high antibody-producing cho cells with the benefits of the split gfp system.
