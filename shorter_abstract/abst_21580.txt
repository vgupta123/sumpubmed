the program achieves significantly improved recall rate at the cost of computational efficiency.
the resulting new program, graspx, achieves >30x speedup compared to its predecessor grasp.
in this article, we adopted three techniques to speed up the original version of grasp, including the pre-construction of extension links, local assembly of individual seeds, and the implementation of query-level parallelism.
in this article we present graspx, a fast and accurate homology-search program implementing a simultaneous alignment and assembly framework.
grasp was developed to implement a simultaneous alignment and assembly algorithm for annotation of short peptides identified on metagenomic reads.
graspx can be used for more comprehensive and accurate annotation of short peptides.
metagenomic samples are routinely sequenced using next-generation sequencing technologies that generate short nucleotide reads.
on the other hand, de novo assembly of a large metagenomic dataset is computationally demanding and the assembled contigs are often fragmented, resulting in the identification of protein sequences that are also of partial length and incomplete.
