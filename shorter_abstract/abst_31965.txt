we therefore designed a series of peptides based around either apolipoprotein receptor binding regions, or amphipathic α-helical domains, and tested these for antiviral and antibacterial activity.
previous reports have shown that peptides derived from the apolipoprotein e receptor binding region and the amphipathic α-helical domains of apolipoprotein ai have broad anti-infective activity and antiviral activity respectively.
indeed the apolipoprotein b-derived peptide mutants uncovered by the present study may have utility as hiv therapeutics or microbicides.
of the nineteen new peptides tested, seven showed some anti-infective activity, with two of these being derived from two apolipoproteins not previously used to derive anti-infective sequences.
although the strength of the anti-infective activity of the sequences identified was limited, this could be increased substantially by developing related mutant peptides.
the finding that an amphipathic α-helical region of apolipoprotein j has antiviral activity comparable with that for the previously reported apolipoprotein ai derived peptide 18a, suggests that full-length apolipoprotein j may also have such activity, as has been reported for full-length apolipoprotein ai.
apolipoprotein j  - based on a predicted amphipathic alpha-helical domain from apolipoprotein j - had measurable anti-hsv <dig> activity, as did apolipoprotein b  dp , the latter being derived from the ldl receptor binding domain b of apolipoprotein b. the more active peptide - apobdp - showed similarity to the previously reported apoe derived anti-infective peptide, and further modification of the apobdp sequence to align the charge distribution more closely to that of apoedp or to introduce aromatic residues resulted in increased breadth and potency of activity.
