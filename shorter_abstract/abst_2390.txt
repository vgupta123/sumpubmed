oral delivery of the resulting multi-wssv dsrna reduced % cumulative mortality and delayed average time to death compared to the non-treated group after wssv challenge.
in this study, we employed a combinatorial approach to interfere multiple gene functions of white spot syndrome virus , the most lethal shrimp virus, using a single-batch of dsrna, so-called “multi-wssv dsrna.” a co-cultivation of rnase-deficient e. coli was developed to produce dsrna targeting a major structural protein  and a hub protein  with high number of interacting protein partners.
estimated yield of multi-wssv dsrna  from the fed-batch process was  <dig> times higher than that obtained under a lab-scale culture with lb broth.
for a co-cultivation of transformed e. coli, use of terrific broth  medium was shown to improve the growth of the e. coli and multi-wssv dsrna yields as compared to the use of luria bertani  broth.
the optimal multi-wssv dsrna production was achieved by the use of glycerol feeding fed-batch cultivation with controlled ph and dissolved oxygen.
the cultivation technique developed herein should be feasible for industrial-scale rnai applications in shrimp aquaculture.

co-culture expression was conducted under glycerol feeding fed-batch fermentation.
rna interference  is a specific and effective approach for inhibiting viral replication by introducing double-stranded rna targeting the viral gene.
the present study suggests a co-cultivation technique for production of antiviral dsrna with multiple viral targets.
