stem cells and their niches are studied in many systems, but mammalian germ stem cells  and their niches are still poorly understood.
in rat testis, spermatogonia and undifferentiated sertoli cells proliferate before puberty, but at puberty most spermatogonia enter spermatogenesis, and sertoli cells differentiate to support this program.
we compared the transcript profiles of spermatogonia and sertoli cells from pre-pubertal and pubertal rats and examined how these related to genes expressed in testicular cancers, which might originate from inappropriate communication between gscs and sertoli cells.
comparing selective gene sets established in this study with published gene expression data of testicular cancers and their stroma, we identified sets expressed genes shared between testicular tumors and pre-pubertal spermatogonia, and tumor stroma and pre-pubertal sertoli cells with statistic significance.
our data suggest that ssc and their niche specifically express complementary factors for cell communication and that the same factors might be implicated in the communication between tumor cells and their micro-enviroment in testicular cancer.
thus, pre-pubertal spermatogonia might possess gsc potential and pre-pubertal sertoli cells niche functions.
the pre-pubertal spermatogonia-specific gene set comprised known stem cell and spermatogonial stem cell  markers.
we hypothesized that the different stem cell pools at pre-puberty and maturity provide a model for the identification of stem cell and niche-specific genes.
a large fraction of these specifically enriched transcripts encoded trans-membrane, extra-cellular, and secreted proteins highlighting stem cell to niche communication.
