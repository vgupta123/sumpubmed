in addition, genetic studies conducted in c. elegans have established that in double mutants mab- <dig> is epistatic to genes encoding various members of a transforming growth factor beta  signaling pathway involved in the formation of male-specific sensory organs.
finally, when targeted to an heterologous promoter, mab21l <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor.
our results provide the first biochemical and cellular foundation for future functional studies of mab- <dig> genes in normal neural development and its pathological disturbances.
we show that the vertebrate mab- <dig> homolog mab21l <dig> antagonizes the effects of bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  overexpression in vivo, rescuing the dorsal axis and restoring wild-type distribution of chordin and xvent <dig> transcripts in xenopus gastrulae.
