this, however, is a challenge if the genome sequence is still subject to changes.
we furthermore present a case study in which we re-mapped  <dig>  oligomer sequences from ilumina's bovinesnp <dig> beadchip to the bovine genome sequence.
also in animal sciences high density genotyping arrays are harnessed to analyse genetic variation.
high density genotyping arrays have become established as a valuable research tool in human genetics.
we have developed a mapping strategy and a suite of software scripts to update the chromosomal positions of oligomer sequences used for snp genotyping on high density arrays.
the positions of oligomer sequences in the genome are volatile even within one build of the genome.
we found in  <dig> cases substantial discrepancies between the manufacturer's annotations and our results.
to exploit the full potential of this technology single nucleotide polymorphisms  on the chips should be well characterized and their chromosomal position should be precisely known.
to facilitate the analysis of data from a gwas or from an expression study, especially with species whose genome assembly is still unstable, it is recommended to update the oligomer positions before data analysis.
