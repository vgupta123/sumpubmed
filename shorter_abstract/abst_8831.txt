ubiquitin-mediated protein modification and degradation are believed to play important roles in mammalian spermatogenesis.
subcellular localization and enzymatic activity assays suggested that these e3s might execute diverse functions in mammalian spermatogenesis.
among these, a significant portion is highly or specifically expressed in the testis.
rt-pcr results showed that all the selected genes were predominately expressed in the testis.
in present study, we set out to mine e3s from the mouse genome and to characterize their expression pattern, subcellular localization, and enzymatic activities based on microarray data and biochemical assays.
we selected  <dig> putative e <dig> genes to examine their mrna expression pattern, and several genes to study their subcellular localization and e <dig> ligase activity.
our results may serve as an initial guide to the field for further functional analysis.
we have identified a large number of putative e3s that are expressed during mouse spermatogenesis.
moreover, all the selected proteins were enzymatically active as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo assays.
we identified  <dig> putative e3s belonging to the ring, u-box, and hect subfamilies and found that most genes were conserved between mice and humans.
some putative e3s were localized in the cytoplasm while others were in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
