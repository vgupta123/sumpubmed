in this study we examine if ncoa <dig> has an oxidation resistance function similar to that demonstrated for oxr <dig>  we also examine ncoa <dig> expression in response to oxidative stress and its subcellular localization in human cells, comparing these properties with those of oxr <dig>
moreover, ncoa7's oxidation resistance function requires expression of only its carboxyl-terminal domain and is similar in this regard to oxr <dig>  we find that, in human cells, ncoa <dig> is constitutively expressed and is not induced by oxidative stress and appears to localize to the nucleus following estradiol stimulation.
the ncoa <dig> gene product is an estrogen receptor associated protein that is highly similar to the human oxr <dig> gene product, which functions in oxidation resistance.
like its homologue, oxr <dig>  it is capable of reducing the dna damaging effects of reactive oxygen species when expressed in bacteria, indicating the protein has an activity that can contribute to oxidation resistance.
we find that ncoa <dig>  like oxr <dig> can suppress the oxidative mutator phenotype when expressed in an e. coli strain that exhibits an oxidation specific mutator phenotype.
unlike oxr <dig>  it appears to localize to nuclei and interacts with the estrogen receptor.
