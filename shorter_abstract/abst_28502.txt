the aggregates are functional without requiring refolding and therefore have potential to be applied as homogenized plant tissue without extraction or purification.
pfa can also be extracted from plant tissue upon dissolution in a mild reducing buffer containing sds.
like the enzyme produced in p. furiosus and in e. coli, plant produced pfa preserves hyper-thermophilicity and hyper-thermostability and has a long shelf life when stored in lyophilized leaf tissue.
we expressed pfa in nicotiana tabacum and found that plant-produced pfa forms functional aggregates with an accumulation level up to  <dig>  g/kg fw  in field conditions.
a hyper-thermostable and ca 2++ independent α-amylase from pyrococcus furiosus  expressed in e.coli forms insoluble inclusion bodies and thus is not feasible for industrial applications.
tobacco may be a suitable bioreactor for industrial production of active hyperthermostable alpha amylase.
