insertion sequences  are small, mobile dna entities able to expand in prokaryotic genomes and trigger important rearrangements.
a total of  <dig> is4-related sequences were collected among more than  <dig> sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, representing more than a three fold increase of the initial inventory.
their narrow genomic impact and the existence of both is-poor and is-rich thriving prokaryotes suggested that these families, and probably iss in general, are occasionally used as a tool for genome flexibility and evolution, rather than just representing self sustaining dna entities.
