we conclude that our method for finding network motifs is scalable and computationally feasible for large motif sizes and a broad range of networks with different sizes and densities.
counting such overlapping copies introduces significant problems in motif identification.
by iteratively joining already identified motifs with those patterns, our algorithm avoids  constructing topologies which do not exist in the target network  repeatedly counting the frequency of the motifs generated in subsequent iterations.
we introduce a set of small patterns and prove that we can construct any larger pattern by joining those patterns iteratively.
we proved that any motif with four or more edges can be constructed as a join of the small patterns.
often, different copies of a given motif topology in a network share nodes or edges.
unlike most of the existing studies, our algorithm counts independent copies of each motif topology.
our experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that our method is significantly faster and more accurate than the existing methods including subdue and fsg.
