using marker data from our diversity panel comprised of  <dig> accessions from the five species listed above, we were able to separate accessions by species using both phylogenetic and principal component analyses.
however, microarrays designed for gene expression analysis rarely provide sufficient gene coverage for optimal detection of nucleotide polymorphisms, which limits utility in species with low rates of polymorphism such as lettuce .
by hybridizing genomic dna to a custom oligonucleotide array designed for maximum gene coverage, we were able to identify polymorphisms using two approaches for pair-wise comparisons, as well as a highly parallel method that compared all  <dig> genotypes simultaneously.
hybridization to microarrays to detect single feature polymorphisms is a powerful technique for marker discovery and genotyping because of its highly parallel nature.
this allowed us to detect greater than  <dig>  polymorphisms between the parental lines of our core mapping population, as well as numerous polymorphisms between cultivated lettuce and wild species in the lettuce genepool.
we developed protocols for hybridization of genomic dna to the genechipÂ® and refined custom algorithms that utilized coverage from multiple, high quality probes to detect single position polymorphisms in  <dig> bp sliding windows across each unigene.
