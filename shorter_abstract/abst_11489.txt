taking into account the biological properties shared by these two viruses, we decided in the current study to assess the protection of a live attenuated glycoprotein e  negative bohv- <dig> vaccine against a genital cphv- <dig> infection in goats.
the vaccine did not induce any undesirable local or systemic reaction and goats did not excrete ge-negative bohv- <dig>  after challenge, a significant reduction in disease severity was observed in immunised goats.
moreover, goats immunised with either ge-negative bohv- <dig> or cphv- <dig> exhibited a significant reduction in the length and the peak of viral excretion.
intranasal application of a live attenuated ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine is able to afford a clinical protection and a reduction of virus excretion in goats challenged by a cphv- <dig> genital infection.
the vaccine was inoculated intranasally twice three weeks apart followed by a subsequent cphv- <dig> intravaginal challenge which is the natural route of infection in three goats.
