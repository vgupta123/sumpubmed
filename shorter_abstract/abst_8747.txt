recent studies have demonstrated that the gene changes involved in spinal cord injury can be regulated by micrornas, which are a class of short non-coding rna molecules that repress target mrnas post-transcriptionally.
this analysis may facilitate the understanding of the time-specific altered expression of a large set of micrornas in the spinal cord after brachial root avulsion.
the altered mirna expression pattern suggests that the mapk and calcium signaling pathways are consistently involved in the injury response.
with consideration for the time course of the avulsion-induced gene expression patterns within dying motoneurons, we employed microarray analysis to determine whether and how micrornas are involved in the changes of gene expression induced by pathophysiological events in spinal cord motoneurons.
some of these mirnas target inflammatory-response genes in the early stage of injury, and others target neurotransmitter transport genes in the intermediate stages of injury.

the expression of a total of  <dig>  mirnas in the spinal cord of adult rats was identified.
in the ipsilateral half compared to the contralateral half of the spinal cord, on the 3rd day after the injury,  <dig> mirnas were upregulated, and  <dig> were downregulated, and on the 14th day after the injury,  <dig> mirnas were upregulated, and  <dig> were downregulated.
unilateral root-avulsion resulted in significant alterations in mirna expression.
