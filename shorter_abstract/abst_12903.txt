expression of notch <dig> receptors and ligands were detected in lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells.
notch <dig> is an important signaling pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells to plasmcytoid dendritic cells .
the cd34+ hematopoietic stem cells were extracted from umbilical cord blood in term parturition, and lin-cd45ra-dc precusors were separated and induced mature.
expression of notch <dig> receptor and ligands in lin-cd45ra-dc precusors was detected by real-time pcr and was down-regulated by shrna or Î³-secretase inhibitor .
previous evidence suggested that the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors were prior to plasmcytoid dendritic cells  than myeloid dendritic cells  within ovarian cancer microenvironment.
shrna mediated notch  <dig> knock-down significantly differentiated less plasmcytoid dendritic cells , but generated more myeloid dendritic cells , and this would not be influenced by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line.
and this would not be affected by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line.
therefore, we investigated the function of notch  <dig> signal pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors.
the notch <dig> mrna in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors can be down-regulated by shrna-notch <dig> lentivirus transfection and gsi.
flow cytometry was used to analyze the subset of dcs with or without skov <dig> culture supernatants.
