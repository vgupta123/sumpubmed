we present a protocol for the purification and labeling of yeast septin rods.
to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we introduced two different snap tag substrates: septin rods labeled with fluorescent bg compounds enabled us to monitor the formation of filaments by fluorescence microscopy whereas bg-biotin was used to couple septin rods to a sensor chip for quantitative surface plasmon resonance binding experiments.
in a first application, we determined the affinity and the binding kinetics of the yeast protein bni <dig> to the individually coupled septin rods.
in a further application we could demonstrate that a once formed septin rod hardly exchange its subunits.
the herein introduced protocol of purifying snap tag modified septins from e.coli allowed us to derivatize the obtained septin rods with probes for the further in vitro characterization of this class of cytoskeletal elements.
one subunit of the septin polymer was expressed as snap tag fusion protein allowing for rapid and stoichiometric labeling with derivatized benzylguanine .
the availability of a very diverse set of snap tag substrates should open the way to investigate different aspects of septin biochemistry in mechanistic detail.
this allowed researchers to quantitatively measure filament stability, the rates of filament turnover as well as the determination of the influence of cofactors on filament formation and structure.
septins form the least understood class of cytoskeletal structures in nearly all eukaryotic cells so far examined.
