their high representation in cdna libraries has resulted in the increase of rp sequences available from different organisms and their proposal as appropriate molecular markers for phylogenetic analysis.
the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole  and atlantic halibut , two commercially important flatfish species, has made possible the identification and systematic analysis of the complete set of rp sequences for the small  ribosome subunit.
amino acid sequence comparisons showed a high similarity both between these two flatfish species and with respect to other fish and human.
their levels can vary as a function of organism growth and development; however, some rps have been associated with other cellular processes or extraribosomal functions.
steady-state transcript levels for eight rps  in sole were quantitated during larval development and in tissues, using a real-time pcr approach.
ribosomal proteins  are key components of ribosomes, the cellular organelle responsible for protein biosynthesis in cells.
phylogenetic analysis clustered rps <dig> in two separate clades with their fish and mammalian counterparts.
on the contrary, rp transcripts increased co-ordinately after first larval feeding reducing progressively during the metamorphic process.
est analysis revealed the existence of two and four rps <dig> genes in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut, respectively.
