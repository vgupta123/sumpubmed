remarkably, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with t-activated® ie- <dig> and pp <dig> proteins resulted in the activation of a broad range of cmv-reactive effector cells, including cd3+cd4+ , cd3+cd8+ , cd3−cd56+  and cd3+cd56+  cells.
objective of this work was the optimization and technical validation of an ifn-γ elispot assay for a standardized, sensitive and reliable quantification of cmv-reactive effector cells.
accordingly, the optimized ifn-γ elispot assay revealed very high sensitivity  in a cohort of  <dig> healthy donors, of which  <dig> were cmv igg-seropositive.
the combined use of t-activated® ie- <dig> and pp <dig> proteins for the stimulation of pbmc with the optimized ifn-γ elispot assay represents a highly standardized, valuable tool to monitor the functionality of cmv-specific cmi with great sensitivity and reliability.
close monitoring of cmv-specific cmi is therefore clinically relevant and might allow a reliable prognosis of cmv disease as well as assist personalized therapeutic decisions.
all basic assay parameters and reagents were tested and optimized to establish a user-friendly protocol and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the elispot assay.
functional impairment of cmi in immunocompromized individuals however can lead to uncontrolled cmv replication and severe clinical complications.
optimized and standardized elispot revealed low intra-assay, inter-assay and inter-operator variability  and cv inter-site was lower than 40%.
in healthy individuals, cytomegalovirus  infection is efficiently controlled by cmv-specific cell-mediated immunity .
