the total intensity distributions showed that the snp-containing probes had a larger negative mean intensity difference  and greater range of the difference than did probes without snps.
this information was used to characterize probe measurements reported in a published, well-replicated lung adenocarcinoma study.
a mm signal often shows greater intensity than a pm signal; we propose that one underlying cause is the presence of allelic variants arising from single nucleotide polymorphisms .
affymapsdetector can be used to describe any affymetrix expression genechipâ„¢ with respect to snps.
such a change in status of the genes has the clear potential for influencing downstream clustering and classification results.
