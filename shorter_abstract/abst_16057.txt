analyses of five of these candidate genes from additional species of heterothallic neurospora revealed that three of them evolve under positive selection.
our results confirm a general pattern of rapid evolution of fungal sex-associated genes, compared to control genes with constitutive expression or a high relative expression during vegetative growth.
taken together, our study represents a novel finding of a genome-wide pattern of rapid evolution of sex-associated genes in the fungal kingdom, and provides a list of candidate genes important for reproductive isolation in neurospora.
in this study, we performed microarray hybridizations between rna from sexual and vegetative tissues of two strains of the heterothallic  filamentous ascomycete neurospora intermedia, to identify a set of sex-associated genes in this species.
we aligned expressed sequence tags  from sexual and vegetative tissue of n. intermedia to orthologs from three closely related species: n. crassa, n. discreta and n. tetrasperma.
however, the examples are too few to draw conclusions on a genome scale.
the resulting four-species alignments provided a dataset for molecular evolutionary analyses.
the broadly accepted pattern of rapid evolution of reproductive genes is primarily based on studies of animal systems, although several examples of rapidly evolving genes involved in reproduction are found in diverse additional taxa.
