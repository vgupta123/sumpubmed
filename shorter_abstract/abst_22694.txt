simple peak-picking algorithms, such as those based on lineshape fitting, perform well when peaks are completely resolved in multidimensional nmr spectra, but often produce wrong intensities and frequencies for overlapping peak clusters.
we produce peak shapes from fourier-transformed nmr spectra.
to alleviate this problem, a more sophisticated peaks decomposition algorithm, based on non-negative matrix factorization , was developed.

application of the nmf algorithm to a three-dimensional peak list of the  <dig> kda bi-domain section of the rcsd protein  as well as to synthetic hsqc data shows that peaks can be picked accurately also in spectral regions with strong overlap.
apart from its main goal of deriving components from spectra and producing peak lists automatically, the nmf approach can also be applied if the positions of some peaks are known a priori, e.g.
