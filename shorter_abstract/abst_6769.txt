current study was designed to isolate phytohormone producing endophytic fungus from the roots of cucumber plant and identify its role in plant growth and stress tolerance under saline conditions.
such fungal strain could be used for further field trials to improve agricultural productivity under saline conditions.
the results reveal that mutualistic interactions of phytohormones secreting endophytic fungi can ameliorate host plant growth and alleviate adverse effects of salt stress.
p. formosus association counteracted the adverse effects of salinity by accumulating proline and antioxidants and maintaining plant water potential.
we isolated nine endophytic fungi from the roots of cucumber plant and screened their culture filtrates  on gibberellins  deficient mutant rice cultivar waito-c and normal gas biosynthesis rice cultivar dongjin-byeo.
thus the electrolytic leakage and membrane damage to the cucumber plants was reduced in the association of endophyte.
on contrary, elevated endogenous gas  contents in endophyte-associated cucumber plants evidenced salinity stress modulation.

under salinity stress, p. formosus inoculation significantly enhanced cucumber shoot length and allied growth characteristics as compared to non-inoculated control plants.
the endophyte csh-6h was identified as a strain of paecilomyces formosus lhl <dig> on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of its sequence similarity.
the hypha of p. formosus was also observed in the cortical and pericycle regions of the host-plant roots and was successfully re-isolated using pcr techniques.
endophytic fungi are little known for exogenous secretion of phytohormones and mitigation of salinity stress, which is a major limiting factor for agriculture production worldwide.
analysis of the cf showed presence of gas  and indole acetic acid.
