phylogenetic trees are an important tool for representing evolutionary relationships among organisms.
to test our method we use published trees of vesicular stomatitis virus, west nile virus and rice yellow mottle virus.
best results were obtained when taxa were reordered using geographic information.
improving the trees using a separate genetic distance matrix altered the ordering of taxa, but not topology, moving the longest branches to the extremities, as would be expected since they are the most divergent lineages.
the evaluation of a new tree is based on different distance matrices, representing non-phylogenetic information such as other types of genetic distance, geographic distance, or combinations of these.
our innovative method makes phylogenetic trees easier to interpret, adding meaning to the taxon order and helping to prevent misinterpretations.
