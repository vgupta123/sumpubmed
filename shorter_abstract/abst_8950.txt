pcr and sequencing revealed the homozygous loss of coding sequences for these genes, except for exon 1Î² of cdkn2a, which codes for the n-terminus of p14arf.
here we extend our observations and present a case report on detail rearrangements on chromosome  <dig> as well as genetic variations in a tumour suppressor gene in normal dogs.
bac hybridisations on metaphases of two fibrosarcomas showed complex rearrangements on chromosome  <dig>  and loss of parts of this chromosome.
although there appear to be similarities between canine and human cancers, rather little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular alterations in canine tumours.
sequencing of this exon in  <dig> dogs from  <dig> different breeds revealed a polymorphic region involving a ggc triplet repeat and a ggggacggcggc repeat.
sequencing of cdkn2b across many different breeds revealed a widespread polymorphism within the first exon of the gene, immediately before the ankyrin coding sequences.
the chromosome alterations were reflected in the loss of sequences corresponding to two tumour suppressor genes involved in cell-cycle progression.
in some retriever breeds there is a high incidence of soft tissue sarcomas and we have previously reported alterations of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in two poorly differentiated fibrosarcomas.
microsatellite markers on a paired tumour and blood dna pointed to loss of heterozygosity on chromosome  <dig> in the cdkn2b-cdkn2a tumour suppressor gene cluster region.
