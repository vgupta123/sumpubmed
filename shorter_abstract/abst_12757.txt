in cross validation on the three sample topics against  <dig>  random articles, the classifier achieved excellent separation of relevant and irrelevant article score distributions, roc areas between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and averaged precision between  <dig>  and  <dig> .
mscanner is an implementation of a bayesian classifier that provides a simple web interface for submitting a corpus of relevant training examples in the form of pubmed ids and returning results ranked by decreasing probability of relevance.
for maximum speed it uses the medical subject headings  and journal of publication as a concise document representation, and takes roughly  <dig> seconds to return results against the  <dig> million records in medline.
the web interface provides interactive exploration of the results, and cross validated performance evaluation on the relevant input against a random subset of medline.
the data sets and open source code used to obtain the results in this paper are available on-line and as supplementary material, and the web interface may be accessed at .
its web interface simplifies the task of classifying medline citations, compared to building a pre-filter and classifier specific to the topic.
a few studies have considered generalisation of medline classification to operate on the entire medline database in a non-domain-specific manner, but existing applications lack speed, available implementations, or a means to measure performance in new domains.
