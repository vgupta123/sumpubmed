there was, however, evidence that populations of n. meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae and n. lactamica were distinct, with little support for frequent genetic recombination among these species, with the sequences from the gdh locus alone grouping the species into distinct clusters.
here, the same seven locus neisseria scheme was used to characterize a diverse collection of n. gonorrhoeae isolates to investigate whether this method would allow differentiation among isolates, and to distinguish these three species.
the seven loci neisseria mlst scheme was readily adapted to n. gonorrhoeae isolates, providing a highly discriminatory typing method.
although relatively few  polymorphisms were detected among the seven mlst loci, a total of  <dig> unique allele combinations , were observed, a number comparable to that seen among isolate collections of the more diverse meningococcus.
in addition, these data permitted phylogenetic and population genetic inferences to be made, including direct comparisons with n. meningitidis and n. lactamica.
patterns of genetic variation were consistent with high levels of recombination generating this diversity.
multilocus sequence typing  has been used successfully to characterize the related organisms neisseria meningitidis and neisseria lactamica.
a total of  <dig> gonococcal isolates were typed and submitted to the neisseria mlst database.
