the avian receptor was represented by siaαgal substructure and human receptor by siaαgal.
the aim of this study is to further explore whether computational simulation could be used as a prediction tool for host type selectivity in emerging variants.

the simulation results showed all hemagglutinin proteins used the same set of amino acid residues to bind with the glycoside; however, some mutations alter linkage preferences.
according to the conformation analysis of the bound receptors, we could predict the relative selectivity in accordance with in vitro experimental data when disaccharides receptor analogs were used.
this hypothesis has been proven correct, since viral isolates from vietnam and thailand have been found which have increased selectivity toward the human cell receptor.
it is known that the highly pathogenic avian influenza a virus h5n <dig> binds strongly and with high specificity to the avian-type receptor by its hemagglutinin surface protein.
preference toward human-type receptors is associated with a positive torsion angle, while avian-type receptor preference is associated with a negative torsion angle.
