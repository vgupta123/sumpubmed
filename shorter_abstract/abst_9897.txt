barley and particularly wheat are two grass species of immense agricultural importance.
this, together with large-scale clustering of the probesets from the two genechips into "homologous groups", has allowed us to perform a genomic-scale comparative study of expression patterns in these two species.
in addition, we show how the conservation of expression patterns can be used to elucidate, probeset by probeset, the reliability of the wheat genechip.
we explore the influence of the polyploidy of wheat on the results obtained with the wheat genechip and quantify the correlation between conservation in gene sequence and gene expression in wheat and barley.
furthermore, the comparison between the two species leads us to conclude that the conservation of both gene sequence as well as gene expression is positively correlated with absolute expression levels, presumably reflecting increased selection pressure on genes coding for proteins present at high levels.
while there are many differences in expression on the level of individual genes and tissues, we demonstrate that the wheat and barley transcriptomes appear highly correlated.
in addition, the results indicate the presence of a correlation between sequence and expression conservation within the triticeae.
we also show that, in general, the wheat genechip is not able to distinguish contributions from individual homoeologs.
we have used the wheat genechip to create a "gene expression atlas" for the wheat transcriptome .
for this, we chose mrna from a range of tissues and developmental stages closely mirroring a comparable study carried out for barley  using the barley <dig> genechip.
