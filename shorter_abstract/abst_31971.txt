here we present motiflab, a general workbench for analysing regulatory sequence regions and discovering transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory modules.
motiflab supports comprehensive motif discovery and analysis by allowing users to integrate several popular motif discovery tools as well as different kinds of additional information, including phylogenetic conservation, epigenetic marks, dnase hypersensitive sites, chip-seq data, positional binding preferences of transcription factors, transcription factor interactions and gene expression.
traditional methods for computational motif discovery often suffer from poor performance.
motiflab offers several data-processing operations that can be used to create, manipulate and analyse data objects, and complete analysis workflows can be constructed and automatically executed within motiflab, including graphical presentation of the results.
however, it is not always trivial to make use of this data in combination with existing motif discovery tools, especially for researchers who are not skilled in bioinformatics programming.
