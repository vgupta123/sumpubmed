variation within individual genomes ranges from single nucleotide polymorphisms  to kilobase, and even megabase, sized structural variants , such as deletions, insertions, inversions, and more complex rearrangements.
we expect that, because of their high abundance, svs might explain phenotypic differences and play a role in the evolution of the chicken genome.
we identified hundreds of shared and divergent svs in four commercial chicken lines relative to the reference chicken genome.
extrapolating our results, we estimate that there are thousands of rearrangements in the chicken genome, the majority of which are located in non-coding regions.
the majority of svs were found in intronic and intergenic regions, and we also found svs in the coding regions.
we observed that structural variation contributes to genetic differentiation among current domesticated chicken breeds and the red jungle fowl.
finally, our study exemplifies an efficient and cost-effective approach for identifying structural variation in sequenced genomes.
to identify the svs, we combined high-throughput short read paired-end sequencing of genomic reduced representation libraries  of pooled samples from  <dig> individuals and computational mapping of dna sequences from a reference genome.
