moreover, the recombinant anabaena strain over expressing alr <dig> showed higher resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting its potential to serve as stress-tolerant biofertilizers in rice fields.
cyanobacteria, progenitors of plant chloroplasts, provide a suitable model system for plants to study adaptation towards different abiotic stresses.
in anabaena pcc <dig>  alr <dig> transcript /alr <dig> protein was induced in response to abiotic stresses and its promoter was active in the vegetative cells as well as heterocysts.
the peroxidase/chaperone function of alr <dig>  its inherent transcriptional/translational induction under different abiotic stresses and localization in both vegetative cells and heterocysts could be an adaptive strategy to battle various oxidative stresses that anabaena encounters during its growth.
the wild-type alr <dig> protein or alr <dig> lacking the peroxidatic cysteine  or the resolving cysteine  existed as higher oligomers in their native form.
in contrast to other 2-cys-prxs, chaperone/peroxidase activity of alr <dig> was dependent on its redox state and not oligomerization status.
alr <dig> could protect plasmid dna from oxidative damage and physically associate with nadph-dependent thioredoxin reductase .
the wild-type or the mutant alr <dig> proteins showed similar chaperone activity, but only the wild-type protein exhibited peroxidase activity indicating that unlike peroxidase activity, chaperone activity was not dependent on cysteines.
on exposure to h2o <dig>  recombinant anabaena pcc <dig> strain over-expressing alr <dig>  showed reduced content of reactive oxygen species , intact photosynthetic functions and consequently better survival than the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig>  indicating that alr <dig> can protect anabaena from oxidative stress.
