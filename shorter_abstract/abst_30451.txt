gasp first assigns the positions of gaps in the phylogeny before using a likelihood-based approach centred on amino acid substitution matrices to assign ancestral amino acids.
prediction accuracy for ungapped data was similar to three alternative algorithms tested, with gasp performing better in some cases and worse in others.
the prediction of ancestral protein sequences from multiple sequence alignments is useful for many bioinformatics analyses.
several algorithms exist based on maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood methods but many current implementations are unable to process residues with gaps, which may represent insertion/deletion  events or sequence fragments.
predicting ancestral sequences is not a simple procedure and relies on accurate alignments and phylogenies.
here we present a new algorithm, gasp , for predicting ancestral sequences from phylogenetic trees and the corresponding multiple sequence alignments.
gasp  will predict ancestral sequences from multiple protein alignments of any size.
although not as accurate in all cases as some of the more sophisticated maximum likelihood approaches, it can process a wide range of input phylogenies and will predict ancestral sequences for gapped and ungapped residues alike.
gasp was tested on a number of simulated datasets based on real phylogenies.
