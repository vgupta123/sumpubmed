different mirna expression patterns have been described for dcm in humans and might represent potential diagnostic markers.
the aims of this study were to screen the mirna expression profile of canine serum using mirna microarray and to compare expression patterns of a group of doberman pinschers with dcm and healthy controls.
micrornas  are short non-coding rnas playing important roles in gene regulation.
between healthy and dcm dogs, mirna expression changes could be detected, but the results did not reach statistical significance most probably due to the small group size.
<dig> mirnas were differentially expressed in the two groups  >  <dig> ), but did not reach statistical significance after multiple testing correction .
numerous mirnas can be detected in canine serum.
dilated cardiomyopathy  is the most common heart disease in doberman pinschers.
eight doberman pinschers were examined by echocardiography and 24-hour-ecg and classified as healthy  or suffering from dcm .
mirnas are potential new circulating biomarkers in veterinary medicine and should be investigated in larger patient groups and additional canine diseases.
there are no studies investigating mirna expression profiles in canine dcm.
no significant differences were found using specific mirna qpcr assays .
total rna was extracted from serum and hybridized on a custom-designed 8x60k mirna microarray  containing probes for  <dig> individual mirnas.
although total rna concentrations were very low in serum samples,  <dig> different mirnas were detectable with sufficient signal intensity on mirna microarray.
