our graph-based algorithms take into account the topology of the sequence space induced by the data itself to construct a biologically meaningful partitioning.
we report on our developments in grouping all known protein sequences hierarchically into superfamily and family clusters.
comparisons with other widely used clustering methods on various data sets show the abilities and strengths of our clustering methods in producing a biologically meaningful grouping of protein sequences.
