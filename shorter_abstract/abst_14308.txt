the immunological response showed that the sera from the immunized animals were able to recognize the recombinant antigens.
micrurus corallinus  is a tropical forest snake belonging to the family elapidae.
however,  <dig> other classes of toxins were present, including c-type lectins, natriuretic peptide precursors and even high-molecular mass components such as metalloproteases and l-amino acid oxidases.
toxin transcripts represented 46% of the total ests.
in order to elucidate the molecular basis of this venom and to uncover possible immunogens for an antiserum, we generated expressed sequences tags  from its venom glands and analyzed the transcriptomic profile.
in addition, their immunogenicity was tested using dna immunization.
five antigenic candidates were selected  and used for a preliminary study of dna immunization.
as recombinant production of venom antigens frequently fails due to complex disulfide arrangements, dna immunization may be a viable alternative.
its venom shows a high neurotoxicity associated with pre- and post-synaptic toxins, causing diaphragm paralysis, which may result in death.
