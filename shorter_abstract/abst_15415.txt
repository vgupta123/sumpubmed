retrieval of embl or genbank entries using keywords is easy using tools such as acnuc, entrez or srs, but has some limitations, in particular when querying with complex keywords.
we improved parts of the bioperl library to allow parsing of large data files, and we embedded these scripts in a user friendly interface  for easy use.
acnuc works well, but does not allow precise queries in the feature qualifiers.
although not as fast as the public tools that use prebuilt indexes, parsing the complete entries using a script is often necessary in order to retrieve the exact data searched for.
embedding in a user friendly interface allows biologists to use the scripts, which can easily be modified, if necessary, by bioinformaticians for unforeseen needs.
