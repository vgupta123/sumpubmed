ratios of urinary biomarkers to creat were calculated, and compared with acceptable maximal values obtained for healthy dogs, as reported in the literature.
our aim was therefore to evaluate the renal and hepatic safety, and measure plasma derivatives of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry  in dogs.
long-term consumption of a pet specific blend of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry , was not associated with renal or hepatic injury, and can therefore be considered safe.
plasma cysc, urinary cysc/creat, clu/creat, and ngal/creat ratios were all beneath reported benchmarked maximums, with no evidence of pegb toxicity.
blood and urine samples were taken the week prior to study commencement, then at the end of the 24-wk study period.
of concern to us were cases of acute renal failure in dogs, after their ingestion of grapes or raisins.
routine markers of renal and liver damage, including creatinine , blood urea nitrogen, albumin, minerals, alkaline phosphatase , and alanine transaminase  were measured.
grape and blueberry extracts are known to protect against age-related cognitive decline.
however, beneficial effects achieved by mixing grape and blueberry extracts have yet to be evaluated in dogs, or their bioavailability assessed.
while several pegb-specific polyphenols and metabolites were detected in dog plasma, at the end of the pegb consumption period, our biomarker analyses presented no evidence of either renal or liver damage .
these groups received capsules containing no pegb , or pegb at  <dig>   <dig>  or 40 mg/kg bw/d, for 24 weeks.
