the intimate relationship between dogs and their owners has the potential to increase the risk of human exposure to bacterial pathogens.
a total of  <dig> apparently healthy dogs without diarrhoea from households , rescue centres , boarding kennels , retired greyhound kennels  and a pet nutrition facility  were investigated for salmonella shedding.
this study showed that the prevalence of salmonella from faeces from apparently healthy dogs from a variety of housing conditions is low; however, salmonella shedding was still identified.
this study therefore aimed to determine the prevalence of salmonella in the faeces of dogs from the midlands region of the united kingdom to assess exposure risk and potential for zoonotic transmission.
the species was s. enterica subspecies arizonae.
faecal samples were processed by an enrichment culture based method.
