this method provides a generic solution for high-throughput differentiation screens in primary human t cells where no single-gene or functional assay is available.
however, chemical screens to identify compounds that induce memory differentiation have been limited by 1) the lack of reporter-gene or functional assays that can distinguish naive and memory-phenotype t cells at high throughput and 2) a suitable cell-line representative of naive t cells.
this screening platform will allow the identification of small molecules, genes or soluble factors that direct memory differentiation in naive human lymphocytes.
here, we describe a method for gene-expression based screening that allows primary naive and memory-phenotype lymphocytes to be discriminated based on complex genes signatures corresponding to these differentiation states.
the differentiation of naive t and b cells into memory lymphocytes is essential for immunity to pathogens.
we used ligation-mediated amplification and a fluorescent, bead-based detection system to quantify simultaneously  <dig> transcripts representing naive and memory-phenotype signatures in purified populations of human t cells.
therapeutic manipulation of this cellular differentiation program could improve vaccine efficacy and the in vitro expansion of memory cells.
