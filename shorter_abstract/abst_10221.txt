the potential for different arrays of putative parasitism genes to be expressed in different nematode populations may indicate how h. glycines evolve mechanisms to overcome resistance.
this suggested that h. glycines has population-specific gene expression signatures.
the  <dig> genes that are suppressed in nl1-rhg, and hence induced in tn <dig> may represent genes that are important during the parasitic stages of h. glycines development.
a microarray analysis of  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> transcripts on the affymetrix® soybean genechip® were used to identify population-specific gene expression signatures in pre-infective second stage larva  prior to their infection of peking.
the analyses also identified numerous putative parasitism genes that are differentially expressed.
these analyses identify a genetic expression signature for these two populations both prior to and subsequently as they undergo an r or s reaction.
these genes included steroid alpha reductase, serine proteinase and a collagen protein.
the identification of genes like steroid alpha reductase and serine proteinase that are involved in feeding and nutritional uptake as being highly suppressed during the r response at 8d may indicate genes that the plant is targeting.
the comparative analysis of pi-l <dig> identified  <dig> genes that were suppressed in nl1-rhg as compared to tn <dig>  these genes included a different hgg- <dig> gene, an expb <dig> protein and a cuticular collagen.
substantial changes in gene expression became evident subsequently.
