our novel subnetwork alignment approach was used to compare networks in escherichia coli and p. falciparum.
some  <dig> p. falciparum proteins were revealed as functional orthologs of known cell cycle proteins in e. coli.
over one third of these predicted functional orthologs were annotated as "conserved plasmodium proteins" or "putative uncharacterized proteins" of unknown function.
the predicted functionalities included cyclins, kinases, surface antigens, transcriptional regulators and various functions related to dna replication, repair and cell division.
the results of our analysis demonstrate the power of our subnetwork alignment approach to assign functionality to previously unannotated proteins.
here, we apply a novel neighborhood subnetwork alignment approach to identify the interacting elements that help regulate the cell cycle of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.
here, the focus was on proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.
