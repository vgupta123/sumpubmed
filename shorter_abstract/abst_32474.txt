we found that nfsb is a useful reporter gene for measuring spontaneous mutation frequencies.
spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants arose at a frequency of ~ <dig> × 10- <dig> -  <dig> × 10- <dig> among the various strains tested.
cell extracts from n. gonorrhoeae were shown to possess nitroreductase activity, and activity was shown to be the result of nfsb.
transition, transversion, insertion and deletion mutations were all readily detectable with this reporter gene.
since bacterial resistance to this compound results primarily from mutations in the gene encoding nitroreductase, the resulting loss of function of nitroreductase results in a selectable phenotype; resistance to nitrofurantoin.
furthermore, we found that mutations were more likely to arise in homopolymeric runs rather than as base substitutions.
a nitroreductase- encoding gene was identified in the n. gonorrhoeae fa <dig> genome by using a bioinformatic search with the deduced amino acid sequence derived from the escherichia coli nitroreductase gene, nfsb.
we exploited this direct selection for mutation to study the frequency at which spontaneous mutations arise .
