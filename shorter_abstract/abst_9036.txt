transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing tacipk <dig> exhibited improved salt tolerance through increased na+ efflux and an enhanced reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity.
the expressions of many tacbls and tacipks were responsive to abiotic stresses  and abscisic acid treatment.
these results contribute to our understanding of the functions of cbl-cipk complexes and provide the basis for selecting appropriate genes for in-depth functional studies of cbl–cipk in wheat.
preferential interactions between tacbls and tacipks were observed in yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments.

calcineurin b-like  proteins belong to a unique group of calcium sensors in plant that decode the ca2+ signature by interacting with cbl-interacting protein kinases .
some tacbl and tacipk genes showed up- or down-regulated expressions during seed germination.
a total of seven tacbl and  <dig> tacipk genes were amplified from bread wheat, triticum aestivum cv.
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  and in silico expression analyses showed that tacbl and tacipk genes were expressed at different levels in different tissues, or maintained at nearly constant expression levels during the whole life cycle of the wheat plant.
analyses of a deletion series of tacipk proteins with amino acid variations at the c-terminus provided new insights into the specificity of the interactions between tacipks and tacbls, and indicated that the tacbl–tacipk signaling pathway is very complex in wheat because of its hexaploid genome.
although cbl-cipk complexes have been shown to play important roles in the responses to various stresses in plants, little is known about their functions in wheat.
