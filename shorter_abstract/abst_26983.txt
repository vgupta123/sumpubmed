finally, the biomass growth rate is excluded from the datasets and its prediction used to exemplify the capability of the model to calculate non-measured fluxes.
this contribution shows how a small-sized network can be assessed following a rational, quantitative procedure even when measurements are scarce and imprecise.
in this contribution, a simplified constraint-based stoichiometric model of the metabolism of the yeast pichia pastoris, a workhorse for heterologous protein expression, is validated against several experimental available datasets.
these models, combined with experimental data, are useful analytical tools to estimate the state exhibited  by the cells at given pseudo-steady conditions.
firstly, maximum theoretical growth yields are calculated and compared to the experimental ones.
