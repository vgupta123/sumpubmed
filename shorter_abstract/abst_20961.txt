we evaluated standard-curves using five different sets of cell culture passages, rna extraction, reverse transcription, and qrt-pcr quantification.
intra-assay precision was evaluated using  <dig> replicates of each gene, for  <dig> patients, in a single experiment.
the aim of this study is to describe a method for quantitation of gr alpha isoform  expression using real-time pcr  with analytical capabilities to monitor patients, offering standard-curve reproducibility as well as intra- and inter-assay precision.
inter-assay precision was evaluated on  <dig> experiments, using duplicate tests of each gene for two patients.
this is the first method for quantitation of grÎ± expression with technical characteristics that permit patient monitoring, in a fast, simple and robust way.
