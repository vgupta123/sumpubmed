to date, most studies that have examined mirna expression levels have used the global mean expression of all expressed genes or the expression of reference mrnas or nuclear rnas for normalization.
stepwise removal to determine the optimum number of reference mirnas identified mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as the most stably expressed in bovine samples and mir-26a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in porcine samples.
qrt-pcr was performed to quantify expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir- <dig>  mir-23b, let-7a and u <dig> for bovine samples and mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-148a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> for porcine oocytes.
we analyzed the suitability of a number of mirnas as potential expression normalizers in bovine oocytes and early embryos, and porcine oocytes.
the stages examined were bovine oocytes at the germinal vesicle  and metaphase ii stages, bovine zygotes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cell embryos, morulae and blastocysts, as well as porcine cumulus oocyte complexes, gv, metaphase i and ii oocytes.
the combination of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is optimal for normalizing mirna expression for qpcr experiments on bovine oocytes and preimplantation embryos; the preferred combination for porcine oocytes is mir-26a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>
accurate quantification of mirna expression using validated internal controls should aid in the understanding of their role in epigenetic modification of genome function.
the average starting material for each sample was determined using specific standard curves for each primer set.
