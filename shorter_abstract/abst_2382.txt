5' deletion examinations and luciferase reporter gene studies indicated that a  <dig> bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site is essential for transcriptional activity by the mtg <dig> promoter.
the tata-less and ccaat-less mtgr <dig> promoter retained most of the transcriptional activity within a - <dig> to - <dig> bp region with a gc-box-rich sequence containing multiple sp <dig> binding sites reminiscent of a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression.
however, mutations of individual sp <dig> binding sites did not repress promoter function; multiple active sp <dig> binding sites may be required to safeguard constitutive mtgr <dig> transcriptional activity.
the observed repression of mtg16/mtgr <dig> promoters by the leukemia associated aml1-eto fusion gene may have a role in hematopoietic dysfunction of leukemia.
furthermore, results from in vitro antibody-enhanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated binding of gata- <dig> to the gata - <dig> site.
our results demonstrate that the eto homologue promoters are regulated differently consistent with hematopoietic cell-type- specific expression and function.
furthermore, expression of the transcription factor herp <dig>  which represses gata- <dig>  produced strong inhibition of the mtg <dig> promoter reporter consistent with a role of gata- <dig> in transcriptional activation.
an evolutionary conserved gata binding site is critical in transcriptional regulation of the mtg <dig> promoter.
in contrast, the mtgr <dig> gene depends on a gc-box-rich sequence for transcriptional regulation and possible ubiquitous expression.
furthermore, eto homologue genes are 3'participants in leukemia fusions generated by chromosomal translocations responsible of hematopoietic dysregulation.
the tata- and ccaat-less promoter with a gc box close to the start site showed strong reporter activity when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.
