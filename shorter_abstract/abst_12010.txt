a bin2- <dig> like gain-of-function mutation has been inserted respectively in one of the homoeologous gene copies of task <dig>  and in one of the homoeologous gene copies of task <dig> .
arabidopsis plants were transformed with these mutated gene copies.
wheat embryos and seedlings were treated with compounds interfering with br signaling or modifying br levels to gain insight into the role of brassinosteroids in wheat development.
observed effects of epibrassinolide, propiconazole and bikinin treatments on wheat embryos and seedlings indicate a role for br signaling in embryonic patterning and seedling growth.
embryonic axis and scutellum differentiation were impaired, and seedling growth responses were affected when embryos were treated with epibrassinolides, propiconazole, and bikinin.
severe dwarf lines were partially rescued by bikinin beforehand shown to inhibit task kinase activity.
plant gsks are involved in hormonal signaling networks and are required for growth, development, light as well as stress responses.
severe dwarf phenotypes were obtained closely resembling those of arabidopsis bin2- <dig> lines and arabidopsis br-deficient or br-signaling mutants.
we explored in addition the physiological effects of brassinosteroids on wheat growth and development.
