the two-component regulatory system, involving the histidine sensor kinase degs and response regulator degu, plays an important role to control various cell processes in the transition phase of bacillus subtilis.

analyses of intermediates in central carbon metabolism revealed that intracellular fbp levels were lowered earlier in 1a <dig> than in  <dig> cells.
a genome wide transcriptome analysis comparing 1a <dig> and  <dig> cells suggested similar events occurring in other catabolite repressive loci involving induction of lcte encoding lactate dehydrogenase.
accumulation of degu-p in 1a <dig> affects central carbon metabolism involving lcte enhanced by unknown mechanisms, downregulates fbp levels earlier, and inactivates hprk to allow the  <dig> -kb transcription, and thus similar events may occur in other catabolite repressive loci.
under physiological conditions the  <dig> -kb rocg transcript may be tightly controlled by a roadblock mechanism involving p-ser-hpr/ccpa in  <dig> cells, while in 1a <dig> cells abolished repression of the  <dig> -kb transcript.
thus, transcription of the rocg locus was examined, and a novel  <dig> -kb transcript covering siva, rocg, and roca was found in 1a <dig> but not  <dig> cells.
growing 1a <dig> cells elevated the ph of soytone-based medium more than the parental strain  <dig> after the onset of the transition phase.
increased intracellular fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate  levels are known to activate the hpr kinase hprk, and to induce formation of the p-ser-hpr/ccpa complex, which binds to catabolite responsive elements  and exerts ccpa-dependent catabolite repression.
inactivation of rocg abolished 1a95-mediated increases in the ph of growth media.
a putative cre found within the intergenic region between siva and rocg, and inactivation of ccpa led to creation of the  <dig> -kb transcript in  <dig> cells.
