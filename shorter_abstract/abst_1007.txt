the embryonic temporal regulator fusca <dig>  plays major roles in the establishment of embryonic leaf identity and the regulation of developmental timing.
this alteration in vegetative phase transition is dependent on both embryonic and vegetative fus <dig> function, suggesting that this important transcriptional regulator controls both embryonic and vegetative developmental timing.
loss of fus <dig> function results in accelerated vegetative phase change, and this is again partially dependent on functional ethylene signaling.
the results of this study indicate that the embryonic regulator fus <dig> not only controls the embryonic-to-vegetative phase transition through hormonal  regulation but also functions postembryonically to delay vegetative phase transitions by negatively modulating ethylene-regulated gene expression.
loss-of-function mutations of this b <dig> domain transcription factor result in replacement of cotyledons with leaves and precocious germination, whereas constitutive misexpression causes the conversion of leaves into cotyledon-like organs and delays vegetative and reproductive phase transitions.
