meca positive isolates were analysed by staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec  and cassette chromosome recombinase  complex typing methods.
the study investigated  <dig> non-duplicate cons isolates obtained from the fresh stool samples of apparently healthy subjects in the community of ile-ife, south-western nigeria.
this study was carried out to examine the genetic resistance mechanisms in faecal isolates of cons.
coagulase-negative staphylococci  are opportunistic pathogens found as colonisers of the human gut.
several sccmec types were found: sccmec i- ccrabβ2-α <dig> , sccmecivb- ccrabβ2-α <dig> , sccmecivd- ccrabβ2-α <dig> , and untypable .
this genetic background could be a reservoir for interspecies gene transfer among cons and s. aureus in the intestinal tract.
antibiotic susceptibility testing was assessed by the disc diffusion test while antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by pcr.

resistance genes were detected only in isolates that showed resistance by phenotypic screening.
four of the five erythromycin resistant isolates were positive for the ermc gene, the remaining isolate carried the msra gene.
the tetk gene was detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> tetracycline resistant isolates while  <dig> possessed the tetm gene.
