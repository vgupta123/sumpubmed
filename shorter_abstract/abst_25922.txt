a comparative analysis of the genomes of seven yeast species yielded roughly  <dig> genomic loci that showed the hallmarks of evolutionary conserved rna secondary structures.
about  <dig> conserved rna structures were found outside annotated coding sequences and known ncrna genes.
transcription of about  <dig> predicted elements located in promoter regions and other, previously un-annotated, intergenic regions was supported by tiling array experiments, ests, or sage data.
coding sequences that carry predicted structured rna elements belong to a limited number of groups with common functions, suggesting that these rna elements are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and/or cellular localization.
in addition, a number of rna elements overlapped with previously characterized antisense transcripts.
in addition, we describe a large number of rna structures in coding sequences and also within antisense transcripts that were previously characterized using tiling arrays.
to supplement these searches, we performed a computational analysis of seven yeast species and searched for new ncrnas and rna motifs.
our computational predictions strongly suggest that yeasts harbor a substantial pool of several hundred novel ncrnas.
whole genome screens in higher eukaryotes, for example, provided evidence for a surprisingly large number of ncrnas.
many of these predicted elements overlapped with utr regions of particular classes of protein coding genes.
