a label-free imaging method would provide an alternative that would eliminate the requirement of transfected cells and modified biological molecules, and if collected nondestructively, would allow long term observation and analysis of live cells.
using surface plasmon resonance imaging , the deposition of protein by vascular smooth muscle cells  cultured on fibronectin was quantified as a function of cell density and distance from the cell periphery.
this technique is compatible with live cells such that it is possible to monitor cellular modifications to the extracellular matrix in real-time.
