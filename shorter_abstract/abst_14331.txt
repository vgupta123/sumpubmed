this included applying over  <dig> transcriptome microarrays to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of heliconius erato.
positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in heliconius wing pattern variation, but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which these genes interact to pattern a wing.
most differentially expressed genes were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or pigment synthesis.
this study identifies many new genes implicated in butterfly wing pattern development and provides a glimpse into the number and types of genes affected by variation in genes that drive color pattern evolution.
here we took a large-scale transcriptomic approach to identify the network of genes involved in heliconius wing pattern development and variation.
these include previously undescribed transporter genes associated with ommochrome pigmentation.
of these, the previously identified color pattern “switch gene” optix was recovered as the first transcript to show color-specific differential expression.
