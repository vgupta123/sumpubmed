the two above-mentioned problems are addressed by  the introduction of a weighted mapping, which accounts for the biochemical effects  of amino-acid changes,  the use of a clustering approach to detect groups of coevolving sites of virtually any size, and  the distinction between biochemical compensation and other coevolutionary mechanisms.
we apply this methodology to a previously studied data set of bacterial ribosomal rna, and to three protein data sets .
we succeed in detecting groups of sites which significantly depart the null hypothesis of independence.
the structural and functional relevance of these groups of sites are assessed, and the various evolutionary processes potentially generating correlated substitution patterns are discussed.
