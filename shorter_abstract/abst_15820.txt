both elevated salp level and the  humerus as location of the primary tumor are significant negative prognostic factors for both st and dfi in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma.
the objective of this study was to systematically review the prognostic factors that are described for canine appendicular osteosarcoma and validate their scientific importance.
increasing age was associated with shorter st and dfi, however, was not statistically significant because information of this factor was available in only a limited number of papers.
the third factor  was studied in a qualitative manner.
elevated salp and proximal humeral location are significant negative prognosticators for canine osteosarcoma.
age, breed, weight, sex, neuter status, location of tumor, serum alkaline phosphatase , bone alkaline phosphatase , infection, percentage of bone length affected, histological grade or histological subtype of tumor.
meta-analyses were done for two of the three selected possible prognostic factors , looking at both survival time  and disease free interval .
this period can be extended with adequate local intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, which has become common practice.
insight in truly significant prognostic factors at time of diagnosis may contribute to tailoring adjuvant therapy for individual dogs suffering from osteosarcoma.
when treated by amputation or tumor removal alone, median survival times  do not exceed 5â€‰months, with the majority of dogs suffering from metastatic disease.
several prognostic factors have been reported in many different studies, e.g.
appendicular osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary canine bone tumor.
