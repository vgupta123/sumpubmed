we have compared the results with those of similar experiments performed in another paradigm for microgravity simulation, the random positioning machine .
we have used a superconducting magnet to assess the effect of diamagnetic levitation on the fruit fly d. melanogaster in levitation experiments that proceeded for up to  <dig> consecutive days.
microarray analysis indicated changes in overall gene expression of imagoes that developed from larvae under diamagnetic levitation, and also under simulated hypergravity conditions.
diamagnetic levitation can be used to simulate an altered effective gravity environment in which gene expression is tuned differentially in diverse drosophila melanogaster populations including those of different age and gender.
we also found that a strong magnetic field, of  <dig>  tesla, had a significant effect on the expression of these genes, independent of the effects associated with magnetically-induced levitation and hypergravity.
a high gradient magnetic field can be used to levitate a biological organism so that its net weight is zero.
for example, several heat shock proteins were affected.
exposure to the magnetic field per se induced similar, but weaker, changes in gene expression.
significant changes were observed in the expression of immune-, stress-, and temperature-response genes.
we observed a delay in the development of the fruit flies from embryo to adult.
