gene ontology enrichment analysis showed a broader range of biological changes in biological processes for the differentially expressed genes, which include cell cycle, cell division, cell proliferation, chromosome segregation, cell death, component organization and biogenesis and metabolic process ontologies.
the alternate exon usage ontological enrichments are in metabolism and component organization and biogenesis.
the contribution of alternative splicing and isoform expression to cellular response is emerging as an area of considerable interest, and the newly developed exon arrays allow for systematic study of these processes.
we use this system to examine whole genome transcription and alternate exon usage events that are regulated during lymphocyte proliferation in an attempt to evaluate the exon arrays.
we use this pilot study to report on the feasibility of exon array implementation looking to replace the 3' in vitro transcription expression arrays in our laboratory.
there was an overlap of  <dig> transcripts which showed both differential expression and alternate exon usage over time.
flow cytometry measured cell cycle events and the affymetrix exon array platform was used to identify the gene expression and alternate exon usage changes.
gene expression changes were noted in a total of  <dig> transcripts, and alternate exon usage identified in  <dig> transcript clusters.
we focus on alternate exon usage changes in the transcripts of the spliceosome complex.
the real-time pcr validation rates were 86% for transcript expression and 71% for alternate exon usage.
this study illustrates that the exon array technology has the potential to provide information on both transcript expression and isoform usage, with very little increase in expense.
