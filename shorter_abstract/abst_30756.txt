snps at other bna <dig> sut <dig> sites were also significantly associated with at least one of six yield-related traits: efb, sp, number of seeds per silique, seed yield per plant, block yield, and tsw.
sequence, mapping, association, and expression analyses collectively showed significant diversity between the two bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles, which control some of the phenotypic variation for branch number and seed weight in b. napus consistent with expression levels.
four dominant sequence-characterized amplified region markers were developed to distinguish bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b. the two genes were estimated as alleles with two segregating populations  obtained by crossing '3715'Ã—'3769'.
photoassimilate transport is a major limiting factor for seed yield.
bna <dig> sut <dig> was mapped to the a <dig> linkage group of the tn doubled haploid population.
association analysis with a diverse panel of  <dig> rapeseed lines identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  in promoter and coding domain sequences of bna <dig> sut <dig> that were significantly associated with one of three yield-related traits: number of effective first branches , siliques per plant , and seed weight   across all four environments examined.
expression levels varied over various tissue/organs at the seed-filling stage, and bna <dig> sut <dig> expression positively correlated with efb and tsw.
the associations between allelic variation and yield-related traits may facilitate selection of better genotypes in breeding.
