however, to our best knowledge, none of existing ngs viewers can timely visualize genome-wide base-level read coverages in an interactive environment.
this viewer is the first to provide timely visualization of genome-wide read coverage at the base level in an interactive environment.
such a base-level read coverage provides further insights for alternative mrna splicing, single-nucleotide polymorphism , novel transcript discovery, etc.
light-rcv consists of four featured designs on the path from raw ngs data to the final visualized read coverage: i) read coverage construction algorithm, ii) multi-resolution profiles, iii) two-stage architecture and iv) storage format.
this study proposes an efficient visualization pipeline and implements a lightweight read coverage viewer, light-rcv, with the proposed pipeline.
next-generation sequencing  technologies has brought an unprecedented amount of genomic data for analysis.
finally, a case study was performed to demonstrate the importance of visualizing base-level read coverage and the value of light-rcv.
unlike array-based profiling technologies, ngs can reveal the expression profile across a transcript at the base level.
