several tools are available for visualizing genomic data.
it can also use the genome nucleotide sequence to compute and plot a density map of the gc content along chromosomes.
the resulting picture is readily configurable, and the colour scales used can be customized for a best fit to the data plotted.
the densities are represented by colour scales that can be customized to highlight critical points.
the input is gff3-formated data representing chromosomes  and sets of features which are used to calculate representations in density maps.
densitymap can compare the distributions of features; it calculates several chromosomal density maps in a single image, each of which describes a different genomic feature.
in practise, densitymap uses a tilling window to compute the density of one or more features and the number of bases covered by these features along chromosomes.
others, like phenogram and cvit, can be used to visualise whole genomes, but are not designed to display very dense genomic features .
we have therefore developed densitymap, a lightweight perl program that can display the densities of several features  along chromosomes on the scale of the whole genome.
