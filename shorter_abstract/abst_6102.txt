the muscle systems identified include numerous novel and most likely creeping-type larva-specific structures such as frontal organ retractors, several other muscle fibers originating from the frontal organ, and longitudinal prototroch muscles.
recent morphological and neuro-anatomical studies on the creeping-type larva support a close relationship of entoprocta and mollusca, with a number of shared apomorphies including a tetraneurous nervous system and a complex serotonin-expressing apical organ.
the evolutionary driving forces that have led to the emergence of the extraordinarily complex muscular architecture in this short-lived, non-feeding entoproct larval type remain unknown, as are the processes that give rise to the highly different and much simpler muscular bodyplan of the adult entoproct during metamorphosis.
entoprocta  is an enigmatic, acoelomate, tentacle-bearing phylum with indirect development, either via a swimming- or a creeping-type larva and still debated phylogenetic position within lophotrochozoa.
however, many morphological traits of entoproct larvae, in particular of the putative basal creeping-type larva, remain elusive.
applying fluorescent markers and 3d modeling, we found that this larval type has the most complex musculature hitherto described for any lophotrochozoan larva.
these include paired sets of dorso-ventral muscles that intercross ventrally above the foot sole and a paired enrolling muscle that is distinct from the musculature of the body wall.
