funestus genome annotation, validating 62 % of annotated introns, manually improving the annotation of seven gene families involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and integrated two published transcriptomic datasets with the recently published genome assembly.
ribosomal rna depletion of total rna using a kit designed to deplete human/rat/mouse rrna works in mosquitoes and, we argue, results in a truer representation of the transcriptome than poly selection.
we aimed to test and improve genomic tools for studying the major malaria vector anopheles funestus.
therefore, great care should be taken in comparing gene expression data among studies.
the mrna enrichment method makes a substantial, replicable difference to the transcriptome composition, at least partly due to the representation of non-polyadenylated transcripts in the final transcriptome.
we used the rnaseq data for validation and targeted manual editing of the draft an.
funestus genome annotation can be considerably improved with the help of these new rnaseq data and further guided manual gene editing efforts will be of great benefit to the anopheles research community for studies of this insect’s genome and transcriptome.
funestus, we compared two methods for enrichment of non-ribosomal rna for analysis: enrichment of polyadenylated rna and ribosomal rna depletion using a kit designed to deplete human/rat/mouse rrna.
