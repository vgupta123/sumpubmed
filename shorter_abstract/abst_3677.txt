the data do not support the hypothesis that hcmv-infection triggers restenosis via a stimulatory effect on cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia in comparison to non infected controls.
in our study we employed a human non-injury ex vivo organ culture model to investigate the effect of an in vitro permissive hcmv-infection on cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia for a period of  <dig> days.
after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days in culture staining of hcmv-antigens was carried out and reactive cell proliferation and neointimal thickening were analysed.
during the first  <dig> days in organ culture no cell proliferation or neointimal hyperplasia was detected.
at day  <dig> and day  <dig> moderate cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia was found both in hcmv-infected segments and mock infected controls.
cell free hcmv infection was performed with the fibroblast adapted hcmv strain ad <dig>  the endotheliotropic strain tb40e, and a clinical isolate .
neointimal hyperplasia in productively hcmv-infected segments was lower than in non infected at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  but relatively higher after infection with the endotheliotropic tb40e in comparison with the two other strains.
the impact of infections with the human cytomegalovirus  for the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis is still unclear.
