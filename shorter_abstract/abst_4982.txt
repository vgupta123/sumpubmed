the aim of this study is to describe the clinical and histopathological effects of topical insulin on second-intention healing of experimentally induced wounds in skin without dermal bony plates of trachemys scripta elegans exposed to daily variations in ambient temperature and in an aquatic environment.
morphometrically, insulin-treated wounds had significantly higher mean counts of heterophils , macrophages  and fibroblasts , whereas lymphocyte counts were significantly lower at day  <dig>  these results demonstrate that topical insulin modifies the inflammatory response of turtle skin up-regulating inflammatory cells at early stages and promoting wound healing.
topical porcine insulin  was applied daily  <dig> week.
topical insulin is a potentially useful therapy in skin wounds of trachemys scripta and should be evaluated in non-experimental wounds of turtles and other reptiles.

forty-four healthy adult females were assigned to two groups: group  <dig>  was used to assess clinical features such as wound contraction; group  <dig>  was used for histological evaluation and morphometric analysis.
for each control time , re-epithelisation and wound remodelling were evaluated histologically and the number of main inflammatory cells  was scored.
histologically, these clinical findings were associated with better re-epithelisation, inflammatory response, collagen synthesis and remodelling of the wounds.
mean wound contraction was higher in the insulin-treated group at each time point and differences were significant at day  <dig> .
