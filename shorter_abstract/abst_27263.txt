the search for new pm <dig> alleles was carried out on a geographically diverse set of  <dig> wheat accessions originating from  <dig> countries.
the identified wheat accessions with new resistance specificities can be used for marker-assisted transfer of the pm <dig> alleles to modern wheat lines.
this has resulted in a decline in the genetic diversity of agriculturally used wheat.
in the last hundred years, the development of improved wheat cultivars has led to the replacement of landraces and traditional varieties by modern cultivars.
thus, the repertoire of functional pm <dig> alleles now includes  <dig> genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes.
therefore, the gene bank accessions provide the basis for genetic improvement of crops for specific traits and and represent rich sources of novel allelic variation.
we have undertaken large scale molecular allele mining to isolate new alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene pm <dig> from wheat gene bank accessions.
