the analysis revealed three main genetic groups defined by human use and geographic origin: a) wine cultivars from western regions, b) wine cultivars from the balkans and east europe, and c) a group mainly composed of table grape cultivars from eastern mediterranean, caucasus, middle and far east countries.
a second structure level revealed two additional groups, a geographic group from the iberian peninsula and maghreb, and a group comprising table grapes of recent origins from italy and central europe.
in addition, wardâ€™s method revealed a third level of structure, corresponding either to limited geographic areas, to particular grape use or to family groups created through artificial selection and breeding.
structure clusters regrouped together a large proportion of family-related genotypes.
a large number of admixed genotypes were also identified.
in this work we study grapevine genetic structure in a large sample of cultivated varieties, to interpret the wide diversity at morphological and molecular levels and link it to cultivars utilization, putative geographic origin and historical events.
we analyzed the genetic structure of cultivated grapevine using a dataset of  <dig>  multi-locus genotypes defined by  <dig> microsatellite markers.
