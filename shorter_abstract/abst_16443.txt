through this methodology, the measures of performance used  are greater than 93% for the mus musculus and rattus norvegicus organisms, and varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the other organisms evaluated: arabidopsis thaliana, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens, nasonia vitripennis.
however, obtaining an accurate prediction is not always a simple task and can be modeled as a problem of classification between positive sequences  and negative sequences .
the precision increases significantly by 39% and  <dig> % for mus musculus and rattus norvegicus, respectively, when the knowledge obtained by the model is included.
in order to solve the problem of tis prediction, the results indicate that the methodology proposed in this work is adequate, particularly when using the concept of acquired knowledge which increased the accuracy in all databases evaluated.
the inclusion of certain features during training, for example, the presence of atg in the upstream region of the translation initiation site, improves the rate of sensitivity by approximately 7%.
using the m-clus balancing method generates a significant increase in the rate of sensitivity from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .
the problem is highly imbalanced because each molecule of mrna has a unique translation initiation site and various others that are not initiators.
