here we discuss an atlas viewer implemented to run on any workstation using the architecture neutral java programming language.
we report the development of a freely available java based viewer for 3d image data, descibe the structure and functionality of the viewer and how automated tools can be developed to manage the java native interface code.
for efficiency the image data is manipulated using the woolz image-processing library provided as a dynamically linked module for each machine architecture.
many three-dimensional  images are routinely collected in biomedical research and a number of digital atlases with associated anatomical and other information have been published.
