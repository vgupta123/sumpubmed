comparative genome-wide expression profiling identified  <dig> genes that discriminated between the early responses of the two cell types to bcr stimulation.
here we define the transcriptional changes that underlie bcr-induced apoptosis and proliferation of immature and mature b cells, respectively.
we further investigated the myc-dependent molecular mechanisms and found that myc promotes a bcr-dependent clonal expansion of mature b cells by inducing proliferation and inhibiting differentiation.
this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the early transcriptional events that lead to either deletion or clonal expansion of b cells upon antigen recognition, and demonstrates that myc functions as the hub of a transcriptional network that control b-cell fate in the periphery.
using mice with a conditional myc-deletion, we validated the microarray data by demonstrating that myc is critical to promoting bcr-triggered b-cell proliferation.
the b cell antigen receptor  is a signaling complex that mediates the differentiation of stage-specific cell fate decisions in b lymphocytes.
