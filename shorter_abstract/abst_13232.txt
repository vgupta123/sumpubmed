the dinucleotide frequency, coined the genome signature, facilitates the identification of putative horizontally transferred dna in complete genome sequences, since it was found to be typical for a certain genome, and similar between related species.
by comparison of the genome signature of  <dig> plasmid sequences with that of the genome of each respective host, we found that in general the genome signature of plasmids is dissimilar from that of their host genome.
our results show that the genome signature of plasmids does not resemble that of their host genome.
we propose an indiscriminate lifestyle for plasmids preserving the genome signature discordance between these episomes and host chromosomes.
these properties confine plasmids to a limited range of hosts, yielding a close and presumably stable relationship between plasmid and host.
we compared the dinucleotide composition of a large collection of plasmids with that of their host genomes to shed more light on this enigma.
most plasmids depend on the host replication machinery and possess partitioning genes.
however, plasmids are also thought to play a major role in horizontal gene transfer and thus are frequently exchanged between hosts, suggesting dinucleotide composition dissimilarity between plasmid and host genome.
this indicates either absence of amelioration or a less stable relationship between plasmids and their host.
