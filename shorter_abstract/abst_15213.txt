filter  <dig> screens snps by calculating a confidence score, based upon sequence redundancy and quality.
non-synonymous snps are subsequently identified by detecting open reading frames of consensus sequences  with snps.
we have developed a new algorithm to detect reliable snps and insertions/deletions  in est data, both with and without quality files.
qualitysnp's versatility is demonstrated by the identification of snps in est datasets from potato, chicken and humans.
the program, test data, and user manual are available at  and as additional files.
for the majority of the public est sequences, trace or quality files are lacking which makes detection of reliable snps even more difficult because it has to rely on sequence comparisons only.
computational strategies for snp discovery make use of the large number of sequences present in public databases ) and are considered to be faster and more cost-effective than experimental procedures.
a major challenge in computational snp discovery is distinguishing allelic variation from sequence variation between paralogous sequences, in addition to recognizing sequencing errors.
filter  <dig> screens for all potential snps and identifies variation between or within genotypes.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are important tools in studying complex genetic traits and genome evolution.
qualitysnp is an efficient tool for snp detection, storage and retrieval in diploid as well as polyploid species.
implemented in a pipeline called qualitysnp, it uses three filters for the identification of reliable snps.
filter  <dig> is the core filter that uses a haplotype-based strategy to detect reliable snps.
the pipeline includes a data storage and retrieval system for haplotypes, snps and alignments.
