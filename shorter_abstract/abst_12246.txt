the peptides assume a broad range of side chain and backbone orientations and have only a small effect on the area of the unit cell.
in this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a representative set of ten of these peptides  in two membrane mimetic interfaces: water-cyclohexane  and a fully solvated dioleoylphosphatidylcholine  bilayer  using both constant pressure and constant area ensembles.
there is little difference between simulations at a constant area of  <dig>  nm <dig> and simulations at constant pressure that approximately yield the same average area of  <dig>  nm <dig>
to gain a better understanding of the thermodynamics of such interactions, white and wimley created an interfacial hydrophobicity scale based of the transfer free energy from water to octanol or lipid bilayers of a series of synthetic peptapeptides   nat.
the x <dig> guest residue assumes average orientations that depend on the nature of the side chain.
the distribution of the x <dig> side chain depends on its nature, and can be determined from molecular dynamics simulations.
peptide-membrane interactions play a key role in the binding, partitioning and folding of membrane proteins, the activity of antimicrobial and fusion peptides, and a number of other processes.
we focus on partitioning of the ten peptides at the cyclohexane/water and lipid/water interfaces.
nonetheless, all peptides partition to the lipid/water interface with distributions with widths of 1â€“ <dig> nm.
this should be possible at the water/cyclohexane interface and likely will become feasible in the future for the phospholipids/water case.
the peptides rapidly equilibrate  and partition at the cyclohexane/water interface.
at the dopc/water interface, dynamics is much slower and convergence is difficult to achieve on a  <dig> ns timescale.
the time scale of peptide motion at a phospholipids-water interface is too long to directly calculate the experimentally measured hydrophobicity scale to test and improve the simulation parameters.
