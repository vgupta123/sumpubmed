nucleotide biases between organisms at the wobble position have been documented and correlated with the abundances of the complementary trnas.
here we demonstrate that in certain organisms the amount of gc at the wobble position  can be used to distinguish two classes of genes.
our findings suggest that high levels of gc <dig> typify a class of genes whose expression is regulated through dna methylation or are a legacy of accelerated evolution through gene conversion.
we discuss the three most probable explanations for gc <dig> bimodality: biased gene conversion, transcriptional and translational advantage and gene methylation.
we highlight the following features of genes with high gc <dig> content: they  provide more targets for methylation,  exhibit more variable expression,  more frequently possess upstream tata boxes,  are predominant in certain classes of genes  and  have a gc <dig> content that increases from 5'to 3'.
the bias is present in some plant species and warm-blooded vertebrates but not in all plants, or in invertebrates or cold-blooded vertebrates.
