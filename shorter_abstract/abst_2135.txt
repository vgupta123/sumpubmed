the clean tags were mapped to the reference sequences for annotation of expressed genes.
here, the expression profiles were analyzed between two soybean varieties in n-limited conditions to identify genes related to nue.
these findings will help to provide a detailed understanding of nue mechanisms, and also provide a basis for breeding soybean varieties that are tolerant to low-n conditions.
genetic engineering is one of the approaches to improve nue, but at present, it is hampered by the lack of information on genes associated with nue.
solexa sequencing is a new method for estimating gene expression in the transcription level.
twenty-four genes were randomly selected and confirmed their expression patterns by quantitative rt-pcr; twenty-one of the twenty-four genes showed expression patterns consistent with the digital gene expression  data.
a number of soybean genes were differentially expressed between the low-n-tolerant and low-n-sensitive varieties under n-limited conditions.
in total,  <dig> genes involved in twenty-two metabolic and signal transduction pathways were up- or down-regulated.
the yield and protein content of soybean seeds are directly affected by the n-use efficiency  of the plant, and improvements in nue will improve yields and quality of soybean products.
two soybean genotypes were grown under n-limited conditions; a low-n-tolerant variety  and a low-n-sensitive variety .
soybean requires a large amount of nitrogen  to accumulate high levels of n in the seed.
