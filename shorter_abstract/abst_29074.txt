abundant information about gene products is stored in online searchable databases such as annotation or literature.
genelibrarian is a java-based web application that automates the process of retrieving critical information from the literature and expanding the number of potential genes for further analysis.
the genelibrarian generates a summarized viewgraph of candidate genes for a user based on his/her preference and delivers the desired background information effectively to the user.
to efficiently obtain and digest such information, there is a pressing need for automated information-summarization and functional-similarity clustering of genes.
