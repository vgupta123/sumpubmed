the study approach of testing ten cows each ten times during three phases has proven to be appropriate.
future studies should however set the post-exposure phase later on.
in this experiment, the nir has resulted in changes in the enzyme activities.
certain enzymes were disabled, others enabled by nir.
the influence of electromagnetic fields on the health of humans and animals is still an intensively discussed and scientifically investigated issue .
we are surrounded by numerous electromagnetic fields of variable strength, coming from electronic equipment and its power cords, from high-voltage power lines and from antennas for radio, television and mobile communication.
the present results coincide with the information from the literature, according to which nir leads to changes in redox proteins, and that there are individuals who are sensitive to radiation and others that are not.
