thus the phenomenon of accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting  may play an important role in the evolution of three-finger toxins, resulting in a family of toxins with a highly conserved structural fold but widely varying biological activities.
such a "switching" of segments in exons may result in drastically altering the molecular surface topology and charge, and hence the molecular targets of these three-finger toxins.
here we report five gene structures of three-finger toxins from a viperid snake, sistrurus catenatus edwardsii.
venom proteins are encoded by multigene families that have evolved through a process of gene duplication followed by accelerated evolution in the protein coding region.
these toxin genes are structured similarly to elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin genes, with two introns and three exons.
both introns and exons show distinct patterns of segmentation, and the insertion/deletion of segments may define their evolutionary history.
