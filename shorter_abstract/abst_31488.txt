this is enhanced by the concordance shown between various database search algorithms for peptide identification.
proteomics methods based on mass spectrometry can be used for the discovery of novel biomarkers through their high sensitivity and specificity.
to avoid discarding other unique peptides, a confidence scale has been implemented in the pipeline giving priority to unique peptides that are identified by a union of algorithms.
further validation was done by focusing on the peptides that are unique to c. botulinum strains and absent in phylogenetically related clostridium species.
robust biomarkers are needed to improve microbial identification and diagnostics.
the pipeline has four main stages: sample preparation, mass spectrometry analysis, database searching and biomarker validation.
however, there has been a lack of a coherent pipeline connecting biomarker discovery with established approaches for evaluation and validation.
we propose such a pipeline that uses in silico methods for refined biomarker discovery and confirmation.
it also emphasises the importance of proteomics based methods in biomarker discovery.
from a list of  <dig> peptides,  <dig> candidate biomarkers were reliably identified as conserved across c. botulinum strains.
