datg <dig> acts genetically downstream of and is transcriptionally induced by jnk activity, and it is required for jnk-dependent production of mitogens such as wingless for aip.
members of this family are best characterized for roles in macroautophagy and neuronal development.
interestingly, this function of datg <dig> in aip is independent of its roles in autophagy and in neuronal development.
in addition to a role of datg <dig> in autophagy and neuronal development, we report a third function of datg <dig> for aip.
here, we show that atg <dig> in drosophila  has a previously unrecognized function for both regenerative and overgrowth-promoting aip in eye and wing imaginal discs.
under certain conditions, aip can cause tissue overgrowth with implications for cancer.
