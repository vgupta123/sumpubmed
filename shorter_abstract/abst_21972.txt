our results have shown that loss of endothelial viability as well as bbb function and integrity caused by ts exposure can be prevented or at least reduced by normal physiologic concentrations of antioxidant vitamins in vitro.
ts exacerbates inflammatory events and leads to endothelial overexpression of vascular adhesion molecules , release of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and nitric oxide , release and activation of matrix metalloproteinases , monocytic maturation into macrophages, and adhesion to the vascular endothelium.
tobacco smoke  contains highly reactive oxygen species , which cause oxidative damage in vascular tissue and may exacerbate inflammatory events leading to the blood-brain barrier damage  which accompanies the development of a variety of neurological disorders.
pre-treatment with antioxidant vitamins  effectively reduced the pro-inflammatory activity associated with ts, protecting the viability and functions of the bbb.
smokers often have elevated leukocyte counts , and significant decreases in plasma alpha-tocopherol  and ascorbic acid  levels due to increased anti-oxidative mobilization in response to oxidative stress evoked by ts.
