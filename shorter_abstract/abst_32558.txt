after 10 days of pretreatment, mice were exposed to the nicotine self-administration paradigm, consisting of four days of choice followed by three days of nicotine abstinence repeated for five weeks.
we investigated oral self-administration of nicotine using a two-bottle choice paradigm in which one bottle contained the vehicle , while the other contained nicotine  in vehicle.
mice pre-exposed to nicotine had upregulated α4yfp nachr subunits in the hippocampal medial perforant path and on ventral tegmental area gabaergic neurons as compared to chronic saline mice.
in this study, we examined whether mice pretreated with chronic nicotine, at a dosing regimen that results in maximal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  upregulation, would display evidence of nicotine-dependent behaviour during nicotine self-administration.
understanding the underlying causes of nicotine addiction will require a multidisciplinary approach examining the key molecular, cellular and neuronal circuit functional changes that drive escalating levels of nicotine self-administration.
chronic forced pre-exposure of nicotine is sufficient to induce elevated oral nicotine intake and supports the postulate that nachr upregulation may be a key factor influencing nicotine self-administration.
compared to control saline-pretreated mice, in a two bottle-choice experiment, nicotine-primed mice ingested a significantly larger daily dose of nicotine and also exhibited post-abstinence binge drinking of nicotine.
knock-in mice with yfp-tagged α <dig> nachr subunits  were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering either nicotine  or saline for 10 days.
