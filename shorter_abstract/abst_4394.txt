in this study, we identified  <dig> gis in au  <dig> by combining two computational tools.
the importance of the genes lipa  and copr  for bacterial invasion and replication indicates that they are required for the invasive properties of b. cenocepacia and may function as virulence determinants for bacterial pathogenesis and host infection.
genomic islands  are genomic regions that reveal evidence of horizontal dna transfer.
based on putative virulence factors, four gis were further identified as pathogenicity islands .
this approach of in silico prediction of gis and subsequent identification of potential virulence factors in the putative island regions with final validation using wet experiments could be used as an effective strategy to rapidly discover novel virulence factors in other bacterial species and strains.
feature analyses suggested that the predictions are highly reliable and hence illustrated the advantage of joint predictions by two independent methods.
through experiments of gene deletion mutants in live bacteria, two putative pais were confirmed, and the virulence factors involved were identified as lipa and copr.
