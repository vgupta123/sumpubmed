lock solutions were renewed every 24 h.
based on these data, alt with dap + ethanol and dap + cla should be explored in clinical trials.
only dap reached the limit of detection at 72 h, however did not prevent regrowth after 24 h of alt removal.
dap + ethanol and tec + ethanol eradicated biofilm at 72 h, but only dap + ethanol  and dap + cla  prevented regrowth at 24 h after alt removal.
all antibiotic combinations resulted in significant reductions  of log cfu/ml at 72 h for both organisms compared with controls.
dap resulted in significant reductions of log for all organism versus tec .
despite widespread use, optimum choice of antimicrobial agents, concentrations, combinations and exposure times have not been determined for antibiotic lock technique .
after 72 h catheters were reincubated with culture media to investigate bacterial regrowth.
our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotic combinations using an in vitro model of catheter-related infection.
