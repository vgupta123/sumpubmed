this methodology represents a simple, sensitive and specific molecular technique to determine the environmental distribution of coccidioides spp.
we report on the identification of c. posadasii in soil samples related to outbreaks of cm.
while only  <dig>  soil samples were positive for c. posadasii by mice inoculation, all  were positive by the molecular tool.
twenty four soil samples had their dna extracted and subsequently submitted to a semi-nested pcr technique using specific primers.
in endemic areas, but cannot distinguish the species.
since  <dig> several outbreaks of acute coccidioidomycosis  were diagnosed in the semi-arid northeast of brazil, mainly related to disturbance of armadillo burrows caused by hunters while digging them for the capture of these animals.
