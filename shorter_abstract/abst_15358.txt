all hox proteins contain a highly conserved homeodomain encoded by the homeobox motif, but the other regions are generally assumed to be less conserved.
the hox genes that encode transcription factors play a central role in this framework.
in this study, we used comparative genomic methods to infer possible functional elements in the coding regions of mammalian hox genes.
we identified a set of ultraconserved coding regions  outside the homeobox of mammalian hox genes.
the extremely high degree of sequence conservation in non-homeobox regions suggests that they might have important roles for the functions of hox genes.
although mammalian genomes are known to contain ultraconserved non-coding elements , this paper seems to be the first to report the ucrs in protein coding genes.
further analysis has indicated that these ucrs occur only in placental mammals and they evolved apparently after the split of placental mammals from marsupials.
here a ucr is defined as a region of at least  <dig> nucleotides without synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions among different orders of mammals.
