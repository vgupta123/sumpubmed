we identified  <dig>  predicted mirna-mrna pairs, of which  <dig> were previously verified by experiments in other groups.
our results demonstrate that integrated analysis of multi-dimensional data has the potential to unravel the mechanism of tumor initiation and progression.
using pathway enrichment analysis we also found that the genes in the target network of the top  <dig> important mirnas were mainly involved in cancer related signaling pathways, synaptic transmission and nervous systems processes.
we also constructed mirna coexpression networks and found  <dig> important mirnas of which  <dig> were significantly related to glioblastoma patients' survival.
we identified association of somatic mutations in  <dig> genes with glioblastoma, of which  <dig> genes are newly identified, and association of loss of heterozygosity  is identified in  <dig> genes with glioblastoma, of which  <dig> genes are newly discovered.
little attention has been paid to understanding how genetic variations, altered gene expression and microrna  expression are integrated into networks which act together to alter regulation and finally lead to the emergence of complex phenotypes and glioblastoma.
we indentified  <dig> cis-expression quantitative trait locus : tp <dig>  egfr, nf <dig> and pik3c2g;  <dig> trans eqtl and  <dig> trans mirna eqtl for somatic mutation;  <dig> cis-eqtl: nrap and egfr;  <dig> trans- eqtl and  <dig> trans- mirna eqtl for lost of heterozygosity  mutation.
