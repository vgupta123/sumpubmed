integrating these data dictates a reliable mapping between the identifier nomenclature resultant from the two high-throughput platforms.
studies integrating transcriptomic data with proteomic data can illuminate the proteome more clearly than either separately.
for each acc, we compared the retrieval sets of probeset ids from each mapping resource.
a mixture model for the correlations fitted well and supported regression analysis, providing a window into the performance of the mapping resources.
therefore data integration may also play a role in critiquing the fallible gene identifications that both platforms emit.
on the same samples, mrna expression was available.
