a multifocal accumulation of amyloid in different organs was found in one spaid-affected case.
shar-pei with a heterozygous genotype  were shown to have a  <dig> -fold higher risk for disease development, which gave evidence for an incomplete dominant mode of inheritance.
whole genome sequencing resulted in  <dig> variants, which were homozygous mutant private mutations in spaid-affected shar-pei.

the results showed the missense variant mtbp:g.19383758g > a in mtbp to be highly associated with spaid in shar-pei.
the results of this study give strong evidence for a variant in mtbp related with proinflammatory processes via mtbp-mdm <dig> pathway.
thus, these results enable a reliable detection of spaid in shar-pei dogs.
autoinflammatory diseases in dogs are characterized by complex disease processes with varying clinical signs.
no further spaid-associated variant with predicted high or moderate effects could be found in genes identified in roh regions.
clinical and histopathological examinations of two severely spaid-affected shar-pei revealed signs of inflammation including fever, arthritis, and perivascular and diffuse dermatitis in both dogs.
