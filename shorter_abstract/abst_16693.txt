our findings reveal that horizontal gene transfer can result in novel gene formation in eukaryotes despite miniaturized genomic targets and a need for co-option of reverse transcriptase.
endogenous derivatives of non-retroviral rna viruses are thought to be absent or rare in eukaryotic genomes because integration of rna viruses in host genomes is impossible without reverse transcription.
here, we provide direct evidence of integration by sequencing across host-virus gene boundaries and carry out phylogenetic analyses of fungal hosts and totivirids .
we detected previously unknown integrated totivirus-like sequences in three fungi .
however, there was evidence of transfer of totivirus-like sequences among fungi.
further, we examine functionality by tests of neutral evolution, comparison of residues that are necessary for viral capsid functioning and assays for transcripts, dsrna and viral particles.
sequencing evidence from gene boundaries was consistent with integration.
the phylogenetic evidence strongly indicated that the direction of transfer was from totivirus to fungus.
