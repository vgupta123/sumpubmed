arsenic accumulation in fish larvae and in different tissues from adult zebrafish was studied following short-term arsenic exposure.
the results showed that liver is the major organ of arsenic accumulation; other tissues such as gill, eye, heart, intestine muscle and skin also exhibited significant ability to accumulate arsenic.
this is the first molecular identification of fish arsenite transport systems and we propose that the extensive expression of the fish aquaglyceroporins and their ability to transport metalloids suggests that aquaglyceroporins are the major pathways for arsenic accumulation in a variety of zebrafish tissues.
our results demonstrated that these aquaglyceroporins exhibited different tissue expression.
our results will contribute to a new understanding of aquatic arsenic metabolism and will support the use of zebrafish as a new model system to study arsenic associated human diseases.
these aquaglyceroporins also facilitate uptake of inorganic asiii, masiii and sbiii.
these genes were named aqp <dig>  aqp3l, aqp9a, aqp9b and aqp <dig> according to their similarities to the corresponding human aqps.
the ability of these five aquaglyceroporins to transport water, glycerol and the metalloids arsenic and antimony was examined following expression in oocytes from xenopus leavis.
uptake is one important step of arsenic metabolism.
the zebrafish larvae also accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic.
however, the transport of asiii and masiii in in any fish species has not been characterized.
in this study, five members of the aquaglyceroporin family from zebrafish  were cloned, and their ability to transport water, glycerol, and trivalent arsenicals  and antimonite  was investigated.
