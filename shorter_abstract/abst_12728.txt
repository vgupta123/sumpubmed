to illustrate its performance, we called variants in three collections of samples  that cover a range of different genome sizes, levels of genome complexity, and ploidy.
to assess genotype accuracy, we compared these gbs-derived snp genotypes with independent data sets obtained from whole-genome sequencing or snp arrays.
we conclude that fast-gbs provides a highly efficient and reliable tool for calling snps from gbs data.
for most users, the main challenge in gbs is the bioinformatics analysis of the large amount of sequence information derived from sequencing gbs libraries in view of calling alleles at snp loci.
