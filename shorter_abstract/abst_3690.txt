most exposures resulted in an induction of dna damage signaling and apoptosis genes and a reduced expression of cell division genes in cells of both genotypes.
mmc treated rad54/rad54b mefs showed no induction of p53-signaling, dna damage response and apoptosis as seen for all the other treatments.
these data support our finding that different types of clastogens exist and that responses to these types depend on the dna repair status of the cells.
gene expression responses to clastogens, however, showed a genotype-dependent effect for blm and mmc.
previously we found that rad54/rad54b cells are more sensitive towards mitomycin c  as compared to wild-type  cells.
enu exposure did not lead to significant gene expression changes in cells of both genotypes, presumably due to its short half-life.
in order to get further insight into possible underlying mechanisms, gene expression changes in wt and rad54/rad54b mefs  after exposure to the clastogens mmc and blm were investigated.
