multi-layered gag immunodominant responses during the first year of infection were correlated with viral control, which provides a theoretical basis for vaccine design targeting msm subjects with the crf01_ae subtype.
gag and nef proteins were the main targets of ctl responses during the first year of hiv- <dig> infection, and this was evident from the data after adjusting for the length of amino acids by dividing the amino acids number of the corresponding protein and multiplying by  <dig>  additionally, relative magnitudes of gag at both  <dig> months and  <dig> year post infection were significantly negatively correlated with the viral set point .
ctl responses to gag, pol and nef proteins at  <dig> month and  <dig> year post infection were detected with gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot  assay using optimized consensus overlapping peptides, as well as the viral quasispecies sequences from the synchronous plasma.
the purpose of this study was to characterize specific cytotoxic t-cell  responses in men who have sex with men  subjects infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  crf01_ae subtype during the first year of infection and impacts on viral control and evolution.
subjects with multi-layered gag immunodominant responses during the first year of infection had significantly lower viral set points than subjects without such responses .
while the relative magnitude of nef at  <dig> year post infection were significantly positively correlated with viral set point .
