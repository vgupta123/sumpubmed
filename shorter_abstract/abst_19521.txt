we developed two medium-resolution, knowledge-based potentials for scoring protein-rna models obtained by docking: the quasi-chemical potential  and the decoys as the reference state potential .
we compared the discriminative power of dars-rnp and quasi-rnp for selecting rigid-body docking poses with the potentials previously developed by the varani and fernandez groups.
protein-rna interactions play fundamental roles in many biological processes.
both potentials use a coarse-grained representation for both rna and protein molecules and are capable of dealing with rna structures with posttranscriptionally modified residues.
in both bound and unbound docking tests, dars-rnp showed the highest ability to identify native-like structures.
understanding the molecular mechanism of protein-rna recognition and formation of protein-rna complexes is a major challenge in structural biology.
unfortunately, the experimental determination of protein-rna complexes is tedious and difficult, both by x-ray crystallography and nmr.
for many interacting proteins and rnas the individual structures are available, enabling computational prediction of complex structures by computational docking.
