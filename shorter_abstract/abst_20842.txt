newborn piglets gavaged with low dose soluble and particulate ova plus cpg odn and polyphosphazene adjuvants produced antigen-specific antibodies in serum and lung after systemic re-exposure in later life.
here, we will investigate whether newborn piglets gavaged with a vaccine comprised of ova plus unmethylated cpg oligodeoxynucleotides  combined with ova plus cpg encapsulated within polyphosphazene microparticles  responded with systemic and mucosal immunity.
further, piglets gavaged with  <dig>  mg ova/cpg + mp generated significant anti-ova igg and igg <dig> titres in lung compared to saline control piglets but results were comparable to titres measured in parenteral control piglets.
thus, a single oral exposure at birth to a combined soluble and particulate ova vaccine including adjuvants can circumvent induction of oral tolerance which impacts response to i.p.
these data indicate circumvention of oral tolerance but not induction of oral immunity.
newborn piglets  were gavaged with a combined soluble and particulate vaccine consisting of ova  plus  <dig> μg cpg and  <dig>  mg ova plus  <dig> μg cpg encapsulated within a polyphosphazene mp  referred to as ova/cpg + mp.
we observed significantly higher titres of serum anti-ova immunoglobulin  igm, iga, igg, igg <dig>  igg <dig> and igg in piglets immunized with  <dig>  mg ova/cpg + mp relative to saline control animals.
we previously determined that newborn piglets orally gavaged with ovalbumin  responded to systemic ova re-exposure with tolerance; if adjuvants were included in oral vaccine, piglets responded with antibody-mediated immunity :211– <dig>  2014).
