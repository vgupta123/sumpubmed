sexually antagonistic selection favors the accumulation of inversions that reduce recombination in regions adjacent to the sex-determination gene.
once established, the clonal inheritance of sex-linked inversions leads to the accumulation of deleterious alleles, repetitive elements and a gradual decay of sex-linked genes.
here we use whole genome sequencing to characterize the structure of a young sex chromosome and quantify sex-specific gene expression in the developing gonad.
sex-determination genes drive the evolution of adjacent chromosomal regions.
eight candidate sex-determination genes were identified within this region.
this study helps establish a model for studying the early-to-intermediate stages of sex chromosome evolution.
this in turn creates selective pressures for the evolution of mechanisms that compensate for the unequal dosage of gene expression.
the enrichment of female-biased gene expression inside the proposed inversion suggests incomplete dosage compensation.
