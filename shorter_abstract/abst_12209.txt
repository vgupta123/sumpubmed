functionally, this difference may correspond to regions with varied prevalence for neural stability/plasticity.
the purpose of this study was to localize regions of adult cns that contain a proteolytic-derived fragment of brevican which bears the adamts-cleaved neoepitope sequence.
proteolytic cleavage of pgs appears to alter the environment to one favoring plasticity and growth.
proteoglycan  in the extracellular matrix  of the central nervous system  may act as a barrier for neurite elongation in a growth tract, and regulate other characteristics collectively defined as structural neural plasticity.
wfa reactivity was found primarily as pnns, whereas brevican and the adamts-cleaved fragment of brevican were more broadly distributed in neuropil, and in particular regions localized to pnns.
in general, a marked discordance was observed in the regional localization between wfa and brevican or the adamts-derived n-terminal fragment of brevican.
the fragment was less abundant in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.
one example is hippocampus where the adamts-cleaved brevican fragment is found surrounding pyramidal neurons, in neuropil of stratum oriens/radiatum and the lacunosum moleculare.
