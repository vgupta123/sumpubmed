the database  comprises of  <dig> hmms of rbp families of known structure that have been generated using structure-based sequence alignments and  <dig> sequence-centric rbp family hmms.
in case of association of the protein with a family of known structures, output features like, multiple structure-based sequence alignment  of the query with all others members of that family is provided.
the input protein sequence is associated with structural or sequence domain families, if structure or sequence signatures exist.
the users can also browse through the database for details pertaining to each family, protein or rna and their related information based on keyword search or rna motif search.
proteins that fail to associate with such structure-centric families are further queried against the sequence-centric rbp family hmms in the hmmrbp database.
rna-binding proteins  interact with their cognate rna to form large biomolecular assemblies.
here, we report a web server, rstrucfam, to predict the structure, type of cognate rna and function of proteins, where possible, from mere sequence information.
further, cognate rna partner for that protein, gene ontology  annotations, if any and a homology model of the protein can be obtained.
rstrucfam is a web server that exploits structurally conserved features of rbps, derived from known family members and imprinted in mathematical profiles, to predict putative rbps from sequence information.
the web server employs hidden markov model scan  to enable association to a back-end database of structural and sequence families.
the web server can be accessed at the following link: http://caps.ncbs.res.in/rstrucfam.
further, all other essential information pertaining to an rbp, like overall function annotations, are provided.
