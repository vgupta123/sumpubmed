ko pups have significantly less non-rapid eye movement  sleep  and significantly more waking  than hz and wt siblings with no change in rapid eye movement  sleep time.
kv <dig> , a mammalian homologue of shaker, regulates neuronal excitability and affects nrem sleep.
kcna <dig> codes for kv <dig> , the alpha subunit of a shaker-like voltage-dependent potassium channel with high expression in the mammalian thalamocortical system.
the decrease in nrem sleep is due to an increase in the number of waking episodes, with no change in number or duration of sleep episodes.
ko pups die by p <dig> due to generalized seizures.
at p <dig> seizures are either absent or very rare in ko pups , and abnormal eeg activity is only present during the seizure.
continuous  electroencephalograph , electromyogram , and video recordings were used to measure sleep and waking in kcna <dig> ko, heterozygous  and wild-type  pups  and hz and wt adult mice .
