understanding molecular mechanisms that control photosynthesis and water use efficiency in response to drought is crucial for plant species from dry areas.
high density linkage maps for pinus pinaster were used in the detection of qtl for photosynthesis and water use efficiency at three water irrigation regimes.
the integration of qtl mapping of functional traits, genome annotation and allele association yielded several candidate genes involved with molecular control of photosynthesis and water use efficiency in response to drought in a conifer species.

functional annotation of genes within the qtl suggested  <dig> candidate genes for the analyzed traits.
allele association analysis in selected candidate genes showed three snps located in a myb transcription factor that were significantly associated with efficiency of energy capture by open psii reaction centers and specific leaf area.
the results obtained highlight the importance of maintaining the integrity of the photochemical machinery in p. pinaster drought response.
qtl detected for photochemical traits accounted for the higher percentage of phenotypic variance.
this study aimed to identify qtl for these traits in a mediterranean conifer and tested their stability under drought.
