the binary approach decreases the memory demand up to 96% without loss of speed giving the most efficient method available for computing elementary modes to date.
taking lessons from this benchmark, we here introduce a new method, the binary approach, which computes the elementary modes as binary patterns of participating reactions from which the respective stoichiometric coefficients can be computed in a post-processing step.
we show that computing the set of elementary modes is equivalent to computing the set of extreme rays of a convex cone.
however, computing elementary modes is a hard computational task.
this standard mathematical representation provides a unified framework that encompasses the most prominent algorithmic methods that compute elementary modes and allows a clear comparison between them.
the equivalence between elementary modes and extreme ray computations offers opportunities for employing tools from polyhedral computation for metabolic pathway analysis.
the new binary approach introduced herein was derived from this general theoretical framework and facilitates the computation of elementary modes in considerably larger networks.
metabolic pathway analysis has been recognized as a central approach to the structural analysis of metabolic networks.
we implemented the binary approach in fluxanalyzer  <dig> , a software that is free for academics.
