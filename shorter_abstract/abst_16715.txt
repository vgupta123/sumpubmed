to address the issue we introduce a new shape descriptor, called inner distance shape signature , for describing the 3d shapes of flexible molecules.
the inner distance is defined as the length of the shortest path between landmark points within the molecular shape, and it reflects well the molecular structure and deformation without explicit decomposition.
our idss is stored as a histogram which is a probability distribution of inner distances between all sample point pairs on the molecular surface.
the presented idss method can be considered as an alternative and complementary tool for the existing methods for rigid msc.
we demonstrate the effectiveness of idss within a molecular search engine application for a benchmark containing abundant conformational changes of molecules.
many molecules of interest are flexible and undergo significant shape deformation as part of their function, but most existing methods of molecular shape comparison  treat them as rigid bodies, which may lead to incorrect measure of the shape similarity of flexible molecules.
we show that idss is insensitive to shape deformation of flexible molecules and more effective at capturing molecular structures than traditional shape descriptors.
