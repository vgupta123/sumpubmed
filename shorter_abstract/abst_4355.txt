this resulted in the two allelic haplotypes sometimes assembling into separate contigs that had to be accommodated in the map framework or in local expansions of contig maps.
we report on the first whole genome physical map of grapevine built using high information content fingerprinting of  <dig>  bac clones from the cultivar pinot noir.
pinot noir, as most grape varieties, is highly heterozygous at the sequence level.
<dig> contigs are anchored to the genetic map, covering  <dig> of the  <dig> mb that make up the grape haploid genome.
a physical map is essential to positionally clone such genes and instrumental in a genome sequencing project.
we performed computer simulations to assess the effects of increasing levels of sequence heterozygosity on bac fingerprint assembly and showed that the experimental assembly results are in full agreement with the theoretical expectations, given the heterozygosity levels reported for grape.
we have developed a resource that makes it possible to access the grapevine genome, opening the way to a new era both in grape genetics and breeding and in wine making.
