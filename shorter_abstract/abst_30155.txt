a challenge now is to develop efficient strategies to use short-read length platforms for de novo assembly and marker development.
the scope of this study was to develop a de novo assembly of carrot ests from multiple genotypes using the illumina platform, and to identify polymorphisms.
a de novo assembly of transcriptome sequence from four genetic backgrounds produced  <dig>  contigs and singletons.
among next generation sequence technologies, platforms such as illumina and solid produce short reads but with higher coverage and lower cost per sequenced nucleotide than  <dig> or sanger.
in addition we produced the first large-scale transcriptome of carrot, a species lacking genomic resources.
over 50% of these assembled sequences were annotated allowing detection of transposable elements and new carrot anthocyanin genes.
out of verified ssr and snp markers 84% and 82% were polymorphic.
presence of multiple genetic backgrounds in our assembly allowed the identification of  <dig> computationally polymorphic ssrs, and  <dig>  snps at a depth of coverage of 20Ã— or more.
