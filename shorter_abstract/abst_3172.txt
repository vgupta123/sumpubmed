developmental differences in the accumulation of soybean vspβ when transgenically expressed in maize show that despite no changes in the vspb transcript level, vspβ protein that is readily detected in leaves of preflowering plants, becomes undetectable as seeds begin to develop.
similar genes are found in monocots; however, they do not accumulate in leaves as storage proteins, and the ability of monocot leaves to support accumulation of an ectopically expressed soybean vsp is in question.
to test this, transgenic maize  lines were created expressing soybean vspb from a maize ubiquitin ubi- <dig> promoter.
from  <dig> bombardments,  <dig> plants were regenerated, and plants from five independent lines produced vspb transcripts and vspβ polypeptides.
during seed-filling  in r <dig> plants, the vspβ protein was no longer detected in leaves and stems despite continued presence of the vspb rna.
the rna transcripts for this peptide either became less efficiently translated, or the vspβ protein became unstable during seed-fill.
developing monocots that accumulate more vegetative tissue protein is one strategy for improving nitrogen-sequestration and nutritive value of forage and silage crops.
