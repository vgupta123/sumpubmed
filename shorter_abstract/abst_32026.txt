the features of pafig were obtained by a two-round selection from aaindex.
using a 10-fold cross validation test on hexpepset dataset, pafig performed well with regards to overall accuracy of 81% and matthews correlation coefficient of  <dig> .
in the predicted fibril-forming hexpeptides, the amino acids – alanine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine occurred at the higher frequencies and the amino acids – aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, arginine and praline, appeared with lower frequencies.
the performance of pafig indicates that it is a powerful tool for identifying the hexpeptides associated with fibrillar aggregates and will be useful for large-scale analysis of proteomic data.
amyloid fibrillar aggregates of proteins or polypeptides are known to be associated with many human diseases.
we propose a method, named pafig  based on support vector machines, to identify the hexpeptides associated with amyloid fibrillar aggregates.
