here we develop a conformation ensemble approach to improve residue-residue contact prediction.
we applied our conformation ensemble approach to free modeling targets from both casp <dig> and casp <dig>  given a diverse ensemble of models, the method is able to achieve accuracies of.
when operating on a moderately diverse ensemble of models, the conformation ensemble approach is an effective means to identify medium and long range residue-residue contacts.
the various models capture slightly different conformations and contain complementary information which can be pooled together to capture recurrent, and therefore more likely, residue-residue contacts.
when applied to targets from casp <dig>  the accuracies of the top l/ <dig> medium and long range contact predictions were.
we collect a number of structural models stemming from a variety of methods and implementations.
<dig> for the top l/ <dig> long range contacts for casp <dig> targets .
protein residue-residue contact prediction is important for protein model generation and model evaluation.
an immediate benefit of the method is that when tied with a scoring scheme, it can be used to successfully rank models.
