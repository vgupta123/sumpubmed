used alone, the mas <dig>  algorithm for generating expression summaries has been criticized for high false positive rates resulting from exaggerated variance at low intensities.
subsequent analysis by real time pcr confirmed these changes.
here we show, with replicated cell line data, that, when used alongside detection calls, mas <dig> can be both selective and sensitive.
when used alongside detection calls, mas <dig> is a sensitive and selective algorithm for identifying differentially expressed genes.
in addition, with the latin square datasets often used to assess expression summary algorithms, filtered mas <dig>  was found to have performance approaching that of its peers.
