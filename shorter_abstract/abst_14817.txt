avian edcrps contain a species-specific number of sequence repeats with the consensus sequence ccdpcqv, thus resembling mammalian cysteine-rich krtaps which also contain sequence repeats of similar sequence.
here we have investigated the putative role of edcrp in the molecular architecture and evolution of feathers.
the results of this study suggest that convergent sequence evolution of avian edcrp and mammalian krtaps has contributed to independent evolution of feathers and hair, respectively.
mrna in situ hybridization demonstrated that chicken edcrp is expressed in the subperiderm layer of the embryonic epidermis and in the barbule cells of growing feathers.
comparative genomics showed that the presence of an edcrp gene and the high cysteine content of the encoded proteins are conserved among birds.
however, differences in gene loci and exon-intron structures suggest that edcrp and krtaps have not evolved from a common gene ancestor but represent the products of convergent sequence evolution.
feathers and hair consist of cornified epidermal keratinocytes in which proteins are crosslinked via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of structural proteins to establish mechanical resilience.
recently, we have identified a chicken gene, named epidermal differentiation cysteine-rich protein , that encodes a protein with a cysteine content of 36%.
