this selective pressure is likely to be reasonably weak and only twice in our dataset of  <dig> genomes do we see independent formation of a complete cluster containing all the catabolic genes in the pathway.
we have selected an exemplar well-characterised biochemical pathway, the phenylacetate degradation pathway, and we show that its complex history is only compatible with a model where a selective advantage accrues from moving genes closer together.
most of these theories have been dismissed because empirical data do not match the expectations of the models.
in this work we test the hypothesis that cluster formation is most likely due to a selective pressure to gradually co-localise protein products and that operon formation is not an inevitable conclusion of the process.
our model for cluster formation in prokaryotes, therefore, consists of a two-stage selection process.
additionally, de novo clustering of genes clearly occurs repeatedly, even though recombination should result in the random dispersal of such genes in their respective genomes.
