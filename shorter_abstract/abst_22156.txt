to test this hypothesis, we developed an inducible model of proliferative reactive gliosis in the absence of degenerative stimuli by genetically inactivating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip <dig>  in the adult mouse and determined the outcome on retinal structure and function.
the benign outcome of proliferative reactive m端ller gliosis suggests that reactive glia display context-dependent, graded and dynamic phenotypes and that reactivity in itself is not necessarily detrimental to neuronal function.
surprisingly, neuroglial interactions, retinal electrophysiology, and visual acuity were normal.
p27-deficient m端ller glia reentered the cell cycle, underwent aberrant migration, and enhanced their expression of intermediate filament proteins, all of which are characteristics of m端ller glia in a reactive state.
the response of mammalian glial cells to chronic degeneration and trauma is hypothesized to be incompatible with support of neuronal function in the central nervous system  and retina.
