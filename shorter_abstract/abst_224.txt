the duplication of sry on the rattus norvegicus y-chromosome has led to proteins with altered functional ability that may have been selected for functions in addition to testis determination.
in rattus norvegicus and other rodent species, the y-chromosome has accumulated multiple copies of sry loci.
this study characterizes the y-chromosome in the sry region of rattus norvegicus, while addressing functional variations seen in the sry protein products.
these suggest a role of active transposable elements in the evolution of the mammalian y-chromosome in species such as rattus norvegicus.
these copy number variations have been previously linked with changes in phenotype of animal models such as the spontaneously hypertensive rat .
eleven sry loci have been identified in the shr with one  containing a frame shift mutation.
three new, previously unidentified, sry loci were identified in this study  in both shr and wky.
translation of the sequences of each sry gene reveals eight proteins with amino acid differences leading to changes in nuclear localization and promoter activation of a sry-responsive gene.
in addition we have identified a retrotransposed copy of med <dig> originating from spliced mrna, two autosomal genes  and a normal mammalian y-chromosome gene  in the sry region of the rat y-chromosome.
repetitive element analysis revealed numerous line-l <dig> elements at regions where conservation is lost among the sry copies.
