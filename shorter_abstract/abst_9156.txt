these data suggest major differences with respect to tgf-beta mediated gene regulation in normal and transformed cells and significant role of non-canonical tgf-beta pathways in the regulation of many genes by tgf-beta.
semi-quantitative and real-time qrt-pcr analysis of some genes agrees with the microarray data.
interestingly, an integrin pathway inhibitor, rgd peptide, significantly affected tgf-beta regulation of thrombospondin  <dig> in a <dig> cells.
tgf-beta inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in normal epithelial cells and in contrast, acts as a pro-tumour cytokine by promoting tumour angiogenesis, immune-escape and metastasis.
it is not clear if various actions of tgf-beta on normal and tumour cells are due to differential gene regulations.
in order to identify the signalling pathways that influence tgf-beta mediated gene regulation, we used specific inhibitors of p <dig> map kinase, erk kinase, jnk kinase and integrin signalling pathways.
hence we studied the regulation of gene expression by tgf-beta in normal and cancer cells.
using human  <dig> k cdna microarrays, we show that  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated by tgf-beta in a <dig> cells in contrast to  <dig> genes exclusively regulated in hpl1d cells.
