we have earlier made an initial characterization in vivo of two mutant enzymes, nadd <dig> and nadd <dig>  strains with either mutation have decreased intracellular levels of nad+, especially for one of the alleles, nadd <dig>
in this study these two mutant proteins have been further characterized together with ten new mutant variants.
we have tested the activity of the enzymes in vitro and their effect on the growth phenotype in vivo.
in escherichia coli, the enzyme nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase is encoded by the nadd gene.
we have also shown that the nadd gene is essential for growth in e. coli.
of the, in total, twelve mutations four are in a conserved motif in the c-terminus and eight are in the active site.
on the other hand, our data has lead us to assign amino acid residues his- <dig>  arg- <dig> and asp- <dig> to the active site.
adenylation of nicotinate mononucleotide to nicotinate adenine dinucleotide is the penultimate step in nad+ synthesis.
