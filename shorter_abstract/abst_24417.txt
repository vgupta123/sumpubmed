this activity is correlated with the need for nucleotide precursors generated by the pentose phosphate pathway , of which g6pdh is the key enzyme.
we suggest the synchronism of egg metabolism with carbohydrate distribution based on the decreasing levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  activity and on the elevation observed in protein content up to  <dig> hae.
both cellular blastoderm formation  and germ band retraction  may be considered landmarks regarding glucose 6-phosphate  destination.
germ band retraction is a moment that was characterized as a landmark in glucose metabolism during aedes aegypti embryogenesis.
the results herein support the hypothesis that glucose metabolic fate changes according to developmental embryonic stages.
furthermore, the results also suggest a role for gsk <dig> in glycogen balance/distribution during morphological modifications.
in insects in general and in mosquitoes in particular energetic metabolism is well studied during oogenesis, when the oocyte exhibits fast growth, accumulating carbohydrates, lipids and proteins that will meet the regulatory and metabolic needs of the developing embryo.
on the other hand, events related with energetic metabolism during a. aegypti embryogenesis are unknown.
we observed high levels of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase  activity at the very beginning of embryogenesis, which nevertheless decreased up to  <dig> hae.
glycogen synthase kinase  activity was also monitored and shown to be inversely correlated with glycogen distribution during embryogenesis.
new methods of vector control are needed and can be achieved by a better understanding of the life cycle of this insect.
embryogenesis is a part of a. aegypty life cycle that is poorly understood.
glucose metabolism was investigated throughout aedes aegypti  embryonic development.
