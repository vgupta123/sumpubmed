discrepant results were resolved by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing.
clinically relevant broad diversity of bacterial isolates obtained during a 6-consecutive months of routine laboratory processing of clinical specimens were subjected to id by the bms and vms in parallel with vitek  <dig>  a conventional phenotypic system .
this study was undertaken to compare two maldi-tof ms-based, bruker microflex ms  and vitek ms  systems, for identification  of clinically significant bacterial isolates.
results were interpreted according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

bms and vms were rapid and proved to be consistently accurate for producing bacterial identification in a fraction of time it takes for identification by cps.
some s. mitis isolates were identified as s. pneumoniae by bms.
bms and vms correctly identified isolates to genus and species levels .
