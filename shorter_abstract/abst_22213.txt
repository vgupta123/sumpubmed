the use of a regression model with either an autocorrelated latent variable or a linear trend has allowed us to establish formally a seasonal component to certain types of colic presented to a uk referral hospital over a  <dig> year period.
problems were encountered in attempting to include both trend and latent serial dependence in models simultaneously; this is likely to be a consequence of a lack of power to separate these two effects in the presence of small counts, yet in reality the underlying physical effect is likely to be a combination of both.
these results were consistent irrespective of whether we were using a model including latent correlation or trend.
traditional time-series modelling approaches have limited applicability in the case of relatively rare diseases, such as specific types of equine colic.
importantly, this type of regression model has applications beyond the study of equine colic and it may be useful in the investigation of seasonal patterns in other, relatively rare, conditions in all species.
six- and twelve-month cyclical patterns were identified for all colics, all medical colics, epiploic foramen entrapment , equine grass sickness , surgically treated and large colon displacement/torsion colic groups.
a twelve-month cyclical pattern only was seen in the large colon impaction colic group.
in this paper we present a modelling approach that respects the discrete nature of the count data and, using a regression model with a correlated latent variable and one with a linear trend, we explored the seasonality of specific types of colic occurring at a uk referral hospital between january 1995â€“december  <dig>
time-series analysis provides a rigorous statistical approach to this question but until now, to our knowledge, it has not been used in this context.
