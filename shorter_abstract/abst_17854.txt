a multivalent dengue virus antigen was designed and shown to bind antibodies against all four denv types.
the pcp consensus program was used to automatically derive consensus sequences starting from sequence alignments of proteins from flaviviruses  and human enteroviruses, using a five dimensional set of eigenvectors that summarize over  <dig> different scalar values for the pcps of the amino acids.
a pcp-consensus protein of a dengue virus envelope protein was produced recombinantly and tested for its ability to bind antibodies to strains using elisa.
pcp-consensus sequences of the flavivirus family could be used to classify them into five discrete groups and distinguish areas of the envelope proteins that correlate with host specificity and disease type.
the process for deriving pcp-consensus sequences for any group of aligned similar sequences, has been validated for sequences with up to 50% diversity.
thus a new method, based on deriving physicochemical property -consensus sequences, was tested for its ability to generate reference sequences and distinguish functionally significant changes from background variability.
