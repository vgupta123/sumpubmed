the frequent occurrence of chemoresistant strains reduces the chances of eradication of h. pylori infection and prompted the investigation of non-antibiotic substances active against this organism.
the bactericidal activity of polysorbate  <dig> and the synergistic effect of the association with metronidazole and clarithromycin could be useful in the treatment of h. pylori infection.
polysorbate  <dig> exerted a synergistic effect when associated with metronidazole and clarithromycin: polysorbate  <dig> and metronidazole mbcs decreased by ≥  <dig> fold; clarithromycin mbcs for two resistant strains decreased by  <dig> and  <dig> times.
the principal alteration caused by polysorbate  <dig> consisted in the detachment of the outer membrane of bacteria.
synergistic effect of polysorbate  <dig> with antibiotics was investigated by the broth dilution and disc diffusion techniques.
we examined the antimicrobial activity to h. pylori of the surfactant polysorbate  <dig>  used alone and in association with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin and tetracycline.
we also aimed to study the ultrastructural alterations caused upon h. pylori by polysorbate  <dig>  alone and in combination with antibiotics.
twenty-two h. pylori strains were tested using the broth dilution method.
