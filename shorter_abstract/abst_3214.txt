using gα <dig> as a model, we asked if its recently discovered adaptor protein tetratricopeptide repeat  <dig>  binds to the same region as its canonical effector, phospholipase cβ .
our results suggest that gα <dig> can signal through tpr1/ras and plcβ simultaneously and independently.
progressive replacement of gα <dig> sequence with the corresponding residues of gαz eventually identified a stretch of six amino acids in the β <dig> region of gα <dig> which are responsible for tpr <dig> interaction and the subsequent ras activation.
the ability of the chimeras to activate downstream transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> and nuclear factor κb appeared to be associated with plcβ signaling.
since the β <dig> region only minimally contributes to interact with plcβ, several chimeras exhibited differential abilities to stimulate plcβ and ras.
as the core of the g protein signal transduction machinery, the gα subunits are required to interact with multiple partners.
the β <dig> region of gα <dig> is essential for interaction with tpr <dig> and the subsequent activation of ras, but has relatively minor influence on the plcβ interaction.
the gtp-bound active state of many gα subunits can bind a multitude of effectors and regulatory proteins.
yet it remains unclear if the different proteins utilize distinct or common structural motifs on the gα subunit for binding.
gα <dig> may utilize different structural domains to bind tpr <dig> and plcβ.
