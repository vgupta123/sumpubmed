the floxed β <dig> knockout mice described here will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the β <dig> subunit in development, ethanol and anesthetic action, normal physiology, and pathophysiologic processes.
palate development was normal in pan-neuronal β <dig> knockouts but ~61% died as neonates.
palate development was normal in forebrain selective β <dig> knockout mice.
forebrain selective knockout of β <dig> was achieved using α camkii-cre transgenic mice.
this subunit has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.
the β <dig> subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a receptor  has been reported to be important for palate formation, anesthetic action, and normal nervous system function.
to overcome many of these limitations, a mouse line with a conditionally inactivated β <dig> gene was engineered.
crossing the floxed β <dig> mice to a cre general deleter mouse line reproduced the phenotype of the previously described global knockout.
pan-neuronal knockout of β <dig> was achieved by crossing floxed β <dig> mice to synapsin i-cre transgenic mice.
survivors had reduced reproductive fitness, reduced sensitivity to etomidate, were hyperactive, and some became obese.
to further investigate involvement of this subunit, we previously produced mice with a global knockout of β <dig>  however, developmental abnormalities, compensation, reduced viability, and numerous behavioral abnormalities limited the usefulness of that murine model.
