in contrast to an identically constructed wild-type form of orco that does rescue the orco <dig> phenotype, all the orco cbs mutants remain stuck in the osn soma, preventing even the smallest odorant-evoked response.
as cam’s modulation of orco seems to be dependent on activity, we propose a model in which the cam/orco interaction allows insect osns to maintain appropriate dendritic levels of or regardless of environmental odorant concentrations.
like most animals, insects rely on their olfactory systems for finding food and mates and in avoiding noxious chemicals and predators.
while most amino acid residues in orco are well conserved across insect orders, one especially well-conserved region in orco’s second intracellular loop is a putative calmodulin  binding site .
when combined with an extended exposure to odorant, however, this late-onset cam knock-down significantly reduces both olfactory sensitivity and the trafficking of orco only to the ciliated dendrites of osns that respond to the exposed odorant.
we then generated a series of orco cbs mutant proteins and found that none of them rescue the orco-null orco <dig> mutant phenotype, which is characterized by an or protein trafficking defect that blocks spontaneous and odorant-evoked osn activity.
most insect olfactory neurons express an odorant-specific odorant receptor  along with orco, the olfactory co-receptor.
in this study, we show cam regulates or trafficking and olfactory responses in vivo in drosophila olfactory neurons via a well-conserved binding site on the olfactory co-receptor orco.
