cronobacter is a recently proposed genus consisting of six genomospecies that encompass the organisms previously identified as enterobacter sakazakii.
however, the primary reservoirs for subsequent contamination of foods with cronobacter remain undefined due to the ubiquitous nature of these organisms.
cronobacter are opportunistic pathogens and are known to cause serious infections in infants, particularly neonates.
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  identified  <dig> pfge types amongst the collection of strains.
infant formula has been identified as one route of transmission for infection in infants.
high case fatality rates have been associated with infections and acute sequelae can occur in survivors with severe ramifications on neurological development.
sequencing of the recn gene was used to differentiate among the recently described species of cronobacter.
this study identified the presence of cronobacter in dried milk and related products sourced from the nile-delta region of egypt.
and prevent its transmission into food products.
