given the distinct ecological and phenotypic specializations found among both described and undescribed cuvierina taxa, they may not respond equally to future ocean changes and may not be equally sensitive to ocean acidification.
we distinguished six morphotypes based on geometric morphometric analyses of shells from  <dig> museum and  <dig> fresh specimens.
we aimed to assess species boundaries and to reconstruct their evolutionary history.
we investigated phenotypic and genetic variation in pteropods belonging to the genus cuvierina in relation to their biogeographic distribution across the world’s oceans.
they also have high potential for the study of zooplankton evolution because they are metazoan plankton with a good fossil record.
shelled pteropods are planktonic gastropods that are potentially good indicators of the effects of ocean acidification.
our findings support the view that ecological differentiation may be an important driving force in the speciation of zooplankton.
these morphotypes have distinct geographic distributions across the atlantic, pacific and indian oceans, and belong to three major genetic clades based on coi and 28s dna sequence data.
however, we also found distinct morphotypes  that were ecologically, but not genetically differentiated.
we found evidence for ecological differentiation among all morphotypes based on ecological niche modelling with sea surface temperature, salinity and phytoplankton biomass as primary determinants.
