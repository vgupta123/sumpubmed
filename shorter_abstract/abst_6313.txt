the conservation of serp <dig> across multiple gram-positive organisms and its capability to bind atp and gtp support the need for further investigation of its role in bacterial growth.
however, in previously evaluated gram-positive species, the mmso is divergent upstream of dnag.
the transcriptional regulation of siga by σb provides evidence that the staphylococcal σb-dependent response is controlled at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.
the orfs of s. epidermidis were compared to the previously described mmso of b. subtilis and two additional orfs in s. epidermidis, serp <dig> and serp <dig>  were identified.
these studies demonstrated that the s. epidermidis  <dig> mmso contains two orfs  not described within the b. subtilis mmso and at least three promoters, one of which is σβ-dependent.
the largest transcript,  <dig>  kb in length, was expressed only in exponential growth and encompassed all four orfs .
a separate transcript  comprising serp <dig> and serp <dig> was expressed in early exponential growth.
functional studies of serp <dig> demonstrated that it was capable of binding both atp and gtp.
two smaller transcripts  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in size were detected with a siga probe in both exponential and post-exponential phases of growth.
western blot analysis correlated with the transcriptional profile and demonstrated that serp <dig> was detected only in the exponential phase of growth.
