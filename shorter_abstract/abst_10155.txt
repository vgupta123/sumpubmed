the objective of this randomised clinical trial was to assess the effectiveness of tildipirosin as a metaphylactic treatment in veal calves on the number of brd treatments, lung consolidation on thoracic ultrasonography  and average daily gain .
occurrence of mortality and brd treatments were recorded during the pre-weaning period.
the use of a metaphylactic treatment of tildipirosin 12 days after arrival of the veal calves was not associated with the number of brd treatments performed by the producer, ultrasonographic lung consolidation or weight gain .
in this study population with a low brd prevalence, we were not able to detect any benefit of tildipirosin as a metaphylactic treatment of brd at day  <dig> after arrival based on brd treatments, tus, and adg.
bovine respiratory disease  is a major problem in veal calf rearing units.
however, 13%  of calves included in the study already had ultrasonographic lung consolidation lesions 12 days after their arrival, which was before treatment time, and 27%  had lung consolidation at day  <dig>

a total of  <dig> veal calves from a pre-weaning fattening unit were randomly allocated to receive one of two treatments  at day  <dig> after entry in the pre-weaned unit.
