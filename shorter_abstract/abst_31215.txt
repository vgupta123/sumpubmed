a molecular-level understanding of the loss of curvy <dig>  gene expression  was investigated to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling cell morphogenesis and development in arabidopsis thaliana.
our results suggest that curvy <dig> gene participates in several biochemical pathways in arabidopsis thaliana including  cell morphogenesis regulation through actin cytoskeleton functional networks,  the transition of vegetative to the reproductive stage and  the production of seeds.
