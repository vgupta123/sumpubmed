deciphering this mechanism has been a daunting task due to the difficulty in characterizing protein-bound dna on a large scale.
here we introduce hpeak, a hidden markov model -based peak-finding algorithm for analyzing chip-seq data to identify protein-interacting genomic regions.
this approach enables hpeak to accurately infer genomic regions enriched with sequence reads by assuming realistic probability distributions, in conjunction with a novel weighting scheme on the sequencing read coverage.
using biologically relevant data collections, we found that hpeak showed a higher prevalence of the expected transcription factor binding motifs in chip-enriched sequences relative to the control sequences when compared to other currently available chip-seq analysis approaches.
in contrast to the majority of available chip-seq analysis software packages, hpeak is a model-based approach allowing for rigorous statistical inference.
