however, given the wealth of novel pathways obtained using these prediction methods, it is necessary to evaluate their relative feasibility, particularly within the context of the cellular environment.
we found that the novel pathways generated by bnice enabled the cell to produce more biomass than the known pathway.
we have utilized a computational framework called bnice to generate novel biodegradation routes for  <dig> ,4-trichlorobenzene  and incorporated the pathways into a metabolic model for pseudomonas putida.
computational tools to predict novel biodegradation pathways for pollutants allow one to explore the capabilities of microorganisms in cleaning up the environment.
through this work, computational tools are shown to be useful in the design and evaluation of novel xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, identifying cellularly feasible degradation routes.
we studied the cellular feasibility of the pathways by applying metabolic flux analysis  and thermodynamic constraints.
based on pathway analysis, mfa, and thermodynamic properties, we identified several promising pathways that can be engineered into a host organism to accomplish bioremediation.
this work was aimed at understanding how novel biodegradation pathways influence the existing metabolism of a host organism.
evaluation of the flux distribution profiles revealed that several properties influenced biomass production: 1) reducing power required, 2) reactions required to generate biomass precursors, 3) oxygen utilization, and 4) thermodynamic topology of the pathway.
we have identified attractive targets for metabolic engineers interested in constructing a microorganism that can be used for bioremediation.
