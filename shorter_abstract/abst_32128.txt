the estimation is performed similarly to the modified bayesian piecewise constant regression, but with improved estimators for the detection of the breakpoints.
combining cn and loh data, it is possible to better identify different types of genomic aberrations.
snp-microarrays are able to measure simultaneously both genotype and copy number  at several single nucleotide polymorphisms  along the genome.
using artificial and real data, we evaluate the quality of the estimation of gbpcr and we also show that it outperforms other well-known methods for loh estimation.
for example, a long sequence of homozygous snps might be caused by either the physical loss of one copy or a uniparental disomy event , i.e.
loss of heterozygosity  is the loss of the heterozygous status due to genomic events.
moreover, gbpcr performed very well in comparison with other methods for loh estimation and the estimated cn lesions on real data have been validated with another technique.
to better identify genomic aberrations, we propose a method  which infers the type of aberration occurred, taking into account all the possible influence in the microarray detection of the homozygosity status of the snps, resulting from an altered cn level.
