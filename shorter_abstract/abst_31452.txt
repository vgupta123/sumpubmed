in silico analysis of the genome of c. elegans identified  <dig> putative globin genes.
as an inroad to understanding this complexity we initiated a structural and functional analysis of the globin family in c. elegans.
all  <dig> c. elegans putative globin genes are transcribed.
all globin domains can be aligned so as to fit the globin fold, but internal interhelical and n- and c-terminal extensions and a variety of amino acid substitutions generate much structural diversity among the globins of c. elegans.
in contrast, the canonical globin of c. elegans, zk <dig> , is not responsive to anoxia.
they show wide diversity in gene structure and amino acid sequence, suggesting a long evolutionary history.
globin zk <dig>  is not responsive to oxygen deprivation and regulated by the ins/igf pathway only suggesting that this globin may contribute to the life maintenance program.
we analyze the expression profiles of the globins during the progression of the life cycle, and we find that distinct subsets of globins are induced, or repressed, in wild-type dauers and in daf-2/insulin-receptor mutant adults, although these animals share several physiological features including resistance to elevated temperature, oxidative stress and hypoxic death.
several globin genes are upregulated following oxygen deprivation and we find that hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> each are required for this response.
our data indicate that the daf- <dig> regulated transcription factor daf-16/foxo positively modulates hif- <dig> transcription under anoxia but opposes expression of the hif- <dig> responsive globin genes itself.
ten globins are responsive to oxygen deprivation in an interacting hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> dependent manner.
