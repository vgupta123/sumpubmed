the average protein sequence identities of the gpcr orthologue pairs is also lower than for the whole genomes.
however, current automated protein predictions and annotations are limited and error prone.
we found these to be 80% for the rat and human pairs and 90% for the rat and mouse pairs.
we searched the rat genome for gpcrs and obtained  <dig> full-length genes and  <dig> pseudogenes.
the total numbers of full-length genes  identified were  <dig>  for human and  <dig>  for mouse.
the largest diversification is seen for gpcrs that respond to exogenous stimuli indicating that the variation in their repertoires reflects to a large extent the adaptation of the species to their environment.
accurate comparisons of protein families in rat, mice and human are thus important for interpretation of many physiological and pharmacological studies.
this report provides the first overall roadmap of the gpcr repertoire in rat and detailed comparisons with the mouse and human repertoires.
gpcrs are important targets for pharmaceuticals and the rat is one of the most widely used model organisms in biological research.
we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of these families and provide detailed information about orthologues and species-specific receptors.
we identified  <dig> new full-length rat gpcrs, whereof  <dig> belong to the large group of olfactory receptors.
moreover, we updated the datasets of gpcrs from the human and mouse genomes with  <dig> and  <dig> new genes, respectively.
