thermostability, measured as tm by differential scanning calorimetry , was kept in the mutated variants and significant decrease  was only observed for the triple mutants.
turnover was only significantly changed using pnpglc, and was decreased 2- <dig> × in variants mutated at position  <dig>  while the single, double and triple mutated variants carrying a mutation at position  <dig>  increased turnover up to  <dig>  × compared to the wild type.
structural analysis pinpointed an area in the active site pocket with non-conserved residues between specificity groups in glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> .
an affinity change, leading to a decreased km, can be explained by an altered position of n <dig>  while the changes in turnover are more difficult to explain and may be the result of smaller conformational changes in the active site.
the thermostable β-glucosidase  from thermotoga neapolitana is a promising biocatalyst for hydrolysis of glucosylated flavonoids and can be coupled to extraction methods using pressurized hot water.
these results show that residues at the + <dig> subsite are interesting targets for mutagenesis and mutations at these positions can directly or indirectly affect both km and turnover.
a set of mutants of tnbgl1a were thus created to analyse the influence on the kinetic parameters using the model substrate para-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside , and screened for hydrolysis of q <dig>
three residues in this area located on β-strand  <dig>  close to sugar binding sub-site + <dig> were selected for mutagenesis and amplified in a protocol that introduced a few spontaneous mutations.
