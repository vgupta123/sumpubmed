the isolate was identified as b. bacteriovorus and named as strain tiberius.
the natural niche and dual predatory, and prey-independent growth of the b. bacteriovorus tiberius strain afforded it extensive non-predatory contact with other marine and freshwater bacteria from which lgt is evident in its genome.
the dual growth mode may reflect the high carbon content of the river, and gives b. bacteriovorus tiberius extended non-predatory contact with the other bacteria present.
unusually, this tiberius strain showed simultaneous prey-independent growth on organic nutrients and predatory growth on live prey.
to test these predictions, we isolated a predatory bacterium from the river tiber- a good potential source of lgt as it is rich in diverse bacteria and organic pollutants- by enrichment culturing with e. coli prey cells.
a previous genomic analysis of b. bacteriovorus strain hd <dig> suggested that predatory consumption of prey dna by lytic enzymes made bdellovibrio less likely than other bacteria to acquire dna by lateral gene transfer .
however the doolittle and pan groups predicted, in silico, both ancient and recent lateral gene transfer into the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome.
evolutionary genetics of bacterialateral gene transferpredatory bdellovibrio
bdellovibrio were previously described as “obligate predators” because only by mutations, often in gene bd <dig>  are  <dig> in ~1x <dig> of predatory lab strains of bdellovibrio converted to prey-independent growth.
despite the prey-independent growth, the homolog of bd <dig> did not have typical prey-independent-type mutations.
gene content comparisons support previously published in silico predictions for lgt in strain hd <dig> with substantial conservation of genes predicted to have ancient lgt origins but little conservation of at-rich genes predicted to be recently acquired.
