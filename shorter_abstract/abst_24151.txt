gene duplications expand the size of gene families, and subfunctionalization of paralog gene pairs is a predominant tendency after gene duplications.
examination of long-term evolutionary changes, six gmpht <dig> paralog gene pairs diverged at multiple levels, in aspects of spatio-temporal expression patterns and/or quanta, phosphates affinity properties, subcellular localization, and responses to phosphorus stress.
to date, experimental evidence for the evolutionary relationships among different paralog gene pairs of a given gene family in soybean is limited.
the soybean pht <dig> genes originated from four distinct ancestors prior to the gamma wgt and formed  <dig> paralog gene pairs and a singleton gene.
six of the paralog gene pairs underwent subfunctionalization, and while gmpht1; <dig> paralog gene experienced pseudogenization.
