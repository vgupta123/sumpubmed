the mammalian target of rapamycin  signalling pathway has emerged as a central regulator for many cellular processes including cell growth, apoptosis, metabolism, and protein synthesis.
high recombinant protein productivity in mammalian cell lines is often associated with phenotypic changes in protein content, energy metabolism, and cell growth, but the key determinants that regulate productivity are still not clearly understood.
in this study, we have performed a transcriptomic analysis using a pathway-focused polymerase chain reaction  array to compare the expression of  <dig> target genes related to the mtor signalling in two recombinant cho cell lines with a  <dig> -fold difference in specific monoclonal antibody productivity .
expression of p110δ correlated with specific productivity  across six different cho cell lines, with a range of expression levels from  <dig> to 51 pg/cell/day, suggesting that p110δ may be a key factor in regulating productivity in recombinant cell lines.
this role of this pathway changes in response to diverse environmental cues and allows the upstream proteins that respond directly to extracellular signals  to communicate with downstream effectors which, in turn, regulate various essential cellular processes.
