to achieve high antimicrobial efficacy and required biocompatibility for medical devices, we focused on optimizing octenidine coatings based on fatty acids.
in a  <dig> days elution experiment, octenidine-palmitate coated sutures demonstrated much slower drug release  than octenidine-laurate sutures .
the release of octenidine into aqueous solution was analyzed and long-term antimicrobial efficacy was assessed via agar diffusion tests using staphylococcus aureus.

octenidine coated sutures with a concentration of  <dig> μg/cm revealed high antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility.
in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial drug octenidine as a coating agent for surgical sutures.
sutures colonized by bacteria represent a challenge in surgery due to their potential to cause surgical site infections.
in order to reduce these type of infections antimicrobially coated surgical sutures are currently under development.
for this purpose, antimicrobial sutures were prepared with either octenidine-laurate or octenidine-palmitate at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/cm drug concentration normalized per length of sutures.
