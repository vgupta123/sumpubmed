we developed an improved primer which enabled sequencing of all strains, containing any type of genetic rearrangement, in a large study among community carriers and hospital inpatients in oxfordshire, uk .
formerly non-typeable strains were found in more spa-types associated with multilocus sequence type st <dig> , common among livestock, compared to other groups with any non-typeable strains , suggesting particular spa-types may have been under-represented in previous human studies.
this improved method allows us to spa-type previously non-typeable strains with rearrangements in the spa-gene and to resolve cases of mixed colonization with deletions in one or more strains, thus accounting for hidden diversity of s. aureus in both community and hospital environments.
we identified eight novel spa-gene variants, plus one previously described.
staphylococcal protein a  is an important virulence factor which enables staphylococcus aureus to evade host immune responses.
three of these rearrangements would be designated “non-typeable” using current spa-typing methods; they occurred in  <dig> %  asymptomatically carried and  <dig> %  inpatient s. aureus strains.
