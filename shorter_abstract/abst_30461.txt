the parameter values of the model are estimated from experimental quantitative time-course data.
the final model, whether it is conventional model with fixed predefined integer kinetic orders or a model with variable non-integer kinetic orders, is selected on the basis of a good agreement between simulations and the experimental data.
the selected kinetic model predicts that the system acts as an amplifier with maximum amplification and sensitivity for input signals whose intensity match physiological values for epo concentration and with duration in the range of one to  <dig> minutes.
the model is used to analyse the responsiveness and amplification properties of the pathway with sustained, transient, and oscillatory stimulation.
the amplification of signals, defined as an increase in the intensity of a signal through networks of intracellular reactions, is considered one of the essential properties in many cell signalling pathways.
the recruitment of epor to the plasma membrane, activation by epo, and deactivation of the epor/jak <dig> complex are considered as well as the activation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of stat <dig>  using qualitative biological knowledge, we first establish the structure of a general power-law model.
we hypothesise that these properties of the system directly relate to the saturation of epo receptor activation, its low recruitment to the plasma membrane and intense deactivation as predicted by the model.
