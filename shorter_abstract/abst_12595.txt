in addition to having a role in embryo hatching and outgrowth, we demonstrate that isp enzyme is localized to the site of embryo invasion during implantation and that its activity is important for successful implantation in vivo.
we have recently reported the expression of murine implantation serine proteinase genes in pre-implantation embryos  and uterus .
in addition to being co-expressed in uterus, we show that isp <dig> and isp <dig> are also co-expressed in the pre-implantation embryo.
these proteinases belong to the s <dig> proteinase family and are similar to mast cell tryptases, which function as multimers.
on the basis of similarities in structural, chemical, and functional properties, we suggest that this isp enzyme complex represents the classical hatching enzyme, strypsin.
our results demonstrate a critical role for isp in embryo hatching and implantation.
