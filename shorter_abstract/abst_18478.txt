in cows infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci, in the 1st or 2nd lactations  <dig> degs, while in the 3rd or 4th lactations,  <dig> degs were identified that involved in molecular functions such as protein, calcium ion and lipid binding, chemokine activity, and protein homodimerization.
gene network analysis showed degs associated with inflammation, cell migration, and immune response to infection, development of cells and tissues, and humoral responses to infections caused by both types of staphylococci.
moreover, the following genes that belong to several physiological pathways  were selected for further studies as candidate genes of mammary gland immune response for use in marker assisted selection : chemokine signaling pathway , cell adhesion molecules  pathway , antigen processing and presentation pathway , and nod-like receptor signaling pathway .
gene ontology functional classification showed the molecular functions of the degs overrepresented the activity of cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors.
it suggests these genes play a key role in the synchronization of the immune response of the cowâ€™s parenchyma against mastitis-causing bacteria.
in cows infected with coagulase-positive staphylococci, being in 1st or 2nd lactation,  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified.
a coagulase-positive staphylococci infection caused a markedly stronger host response than that of coagulase-negative, resulting in vastly increased degs.
genome-wide gene expression profiling allows for identification of genes involved in the defense response of the host against pathogens.
as presented here, transcriptomic analysis and bioinformatics tools were applied in order to identify genes expressed in the mammary gland parenchyma of cows naturally infected with coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
a significant increase in the expression of the fos, tnf, and genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex proteins  was observed.
