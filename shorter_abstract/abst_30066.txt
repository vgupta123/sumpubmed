an increasing number of researchers have released novel rna structure analysis and prediction algorithms for comparative approaches to structure prediction.
we conclude that comparative data can enhance structure prediction but structure-prediction-algorithms vary widely in terms of both sensitivity and selectivity across different lengths and homologies.
here we evaluate a number of rna folding algorithms using reliable rna data-sets and compare their relative performance.
furthermore, we outline some directions for future research.
