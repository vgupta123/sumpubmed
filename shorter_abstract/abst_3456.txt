we have determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of four specimens each of atlantic halibut , pacific halibut  and greenland halibut , and assessed the nucleotide variability within and between species.
the arrays are highly heteroplasmic in size and consist mainly of different variants of a 61-bp motif.
the complexity, distribution, and biological role of the heteroplasmic tandem repeat arrays in halibut mitochondrial control regions are discussed.
halibut mitochondrial genomes lacking arrays were also detected.
about  <dig> variable positions were identified within the four specimens in each halibut species, with the control regions as the most variable parts of the genomes .
we conclude that the most plausible explanation for array maintenance includes both the slipped-strand mispairing and dna recombination mechanisms.
