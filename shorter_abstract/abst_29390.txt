since early expression patterns and functions in xenopus laevis development have not been described, we have addressed these questions in the present study.
here we have analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of alk <dig> and alk6; we have also carried out loss-of-function studies to define the function of these receptors in early xenopus development.
from late gastrula stages onwards, their expression patterns diverged, which correlated with a specific, non-redundant requirement of alk <dig> in post-gastrula neural crest cells.
bmps activate heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of type i and type ii receptor-serine/threonine kinases.
bmp receptors ia and ib, also known as alk <dig> and alk <dig> respectively, are the most common type i receptors that likely mediate most bmp signaling events.
bone morphogenetic proteins regulate multiple processes in embryonic development, including early dorso-ventral patterning and neural crest development.
alk <dig> was essential for induction of neural crest cell fate and further development of the neural crest and its derivatives.
alk <dig> and alk <dig> are independently required for the spatially restricted activation of bmp signaling and msx <dig> upregulation at the neural plate border, whereas in post-gastrula development alk <dig> exerts a highly specific, conserved function in neural crest development.
