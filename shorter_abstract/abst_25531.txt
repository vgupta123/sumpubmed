according to the functional domain classification, a significant difference in distribution was observed between pcc and ncc  with the occurrence of nccs being more frequent in c-terminal region while pcc more often fall within functional domains.
screening distinctive cluster charges in viral proteomes suggested a functional role of these protein regions and might provide potential clues to improve the current understanding of viral diseases in order to tailor better preventive and therapeutic approaches.
to understand the mechanism by which the membrane translocation functionalities are embedded in viral proteins, we screened our pcc for sequences corresponding to cell-penetrating peptides  using two online databases: cellppd and cpppred.
in this study,  <dig> distinctive human viral proteomes were screened for the occurrence of charge clusters  using a new computational approach.
experimental validation is required to improve our understanding of the role of these pccs in viral infection process.
the identification of charge clusters  in proteins and their mapping within the protein structure sequence is an important step toward a comprehensive analysis of how these particular motifs mediate, via electrostatic interactions, various molecular processes such as protein sorting, translocation, docking, orientation and binding to dna and to other proteins.
few algorithms that specifically identify these charge clusters have been designed and described in the literature.
the number of protein sequences that are cc-free is  <dig>  while  <dig> and  <dig> proteins contained positive charge  and negative charge clusters , respectively.
three hundred and seventy three cc have been identified within the  <dig> viral protein sequences screened.
moreover,  <dig> ncc were conserved in  <dig> proteins while only  <dig> pcc were conserved in  <dig> protein sequences.
