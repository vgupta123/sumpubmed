no gel mobility shift was seen when protein extracts from either lb20- or nssm-grown m93sm cells were mixed with the dig-labeled empa oligomer.
m93sm cells express protease activity only when incubated at high cell density in fish gastrointestinal mucus.
the azocasein assay detected protease activity in all incubation conditions for nb <dig> culture supernatants.
gel mobility shift assays, using a digoxigenin -labeled oligomer containing a lux box-like element and the promoter for empa, were done to demonstrate the presence of a dna-binding protein.
protein extracts from nb <dig> cells incubated in luria bertani broth + 2% nacl , nine salts solution +  <dig> Î¼g/ml mucus , 3m , or nss resulted in a gel mobility shift.
site-directed mutagenesis was used to create vant mutants in v. anguillarum m93sm and nb <dig> to test whether vant is involved with the gel mobility shift.
the dna binding protein is not present in m93sm extracts.
previously we have shown that there are significant differences in empa expression in two strains of v. anguillarum, m93sm and nb <dig>  it is hypothesized that differences in empa regulation are due to differences in binding of regulatory elements.
two strains of v. anguillarum, m93sm and nb <dig>  were examined and compared for the presence of dna regulatory proteins that bind to and control the empa promoter region.
since the luxr homologue in v. anguillarum, vant, has been cloned, sequenced, and shown to be required for protease activity, we wanted to determine if vant mutants of nb <dig> exhibit the same gel shift observed in the wild-type.
the data demonstrate that protein extracts of v. anguillarum nb <dig> cells contain a protein that binds to a  <dig> bp oligomer containing the empa promoter-lux box-like region.
however, protein extracts from nb <dig> incubated in each condition still exhibited a gel shift when mixed with the dig-labeled empa oligomer.
both vant mutants, m <dig> and nb <dig>  did not produce protease activity in any conditions.
nb <dig> cells express empa during stationary phase in all growth conditions.
in contrast, protease activity was detected in m93sm culture supernatants only when incubated in nssm.
