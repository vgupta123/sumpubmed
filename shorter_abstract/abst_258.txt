furthermore, an evolutionarily-conserved conformational link from the location of this pocket, via the αef-αf loop, to phosphorylation sites on the activation loop is discovered.
a transient but druggable allosteric pocket in cdk <dig> is predicted to occur under the cmgc insert.
in addition, molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly being used to further explore the conformational landscape of these complexes.
the methodologies are encoded in a python package called polyphony, which is released as open source to accompany this paper .
novel methodologies are described for the analysis of multiple structures of a protein.
structure-based drug design is an iterative process, following cycles of structural biology, computer-aided design, synthetic chemistry and bioassay.
in favorable circumstances, this process can lead to the structures of hundreds of protein-ligand crystal structures.
currently, methods capable of the analysis of ensembles of crystal structures and md trajectories are limited and usually rely upon least squares superposition of coordinates.
the approaches are tested on crystal structures of cdk <dig> and other cmgc protein kinases and a simulation of p38α.
