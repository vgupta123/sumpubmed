obese males showed lower expression of the genetically imprinted and paternally expressed  <dig>  gene  and higher expression of the androgen receptor  gene .
at puberty, higher amounts of the androgen receptor and altered access to estrogen response elements in affected genes are likely responsible for male specific expression of genes that were epigenetically triggered.
we found that f1-males with a bfmi mother developed  <dig>  times more fat mass on a high fat diet at  <dig> weeks than f1-males of a bfmi father.
rna-seq data of liver provided evidence for higher biosynthesis and elongation of fatty acids  in obese male offspring of a bfmi mother versus lean offspring of a bfmi father.
we investigated parent-of-origin and allele-specific expression effects on obesity and hepatic gene expression in reciprocal crosses between the berlin fat mouse inbred line  and c57bl/6ncrl .
among the highest up-regulated protein coding genes in obese males were acot <dig> , cyp4a <dig>  and cyp4a <dig> , which hydroxylize fatty acids and which are known to be increased in liver steatosis.
the circadian rhythm was affected as well .

furthermore, fatty acid degradation  and the peroxisome pathway were impaired .
allelic imbalance was found for expression of atp-binding cassette transporter gene abca8b.
