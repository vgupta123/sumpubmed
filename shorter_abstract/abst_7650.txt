accordingly, we set out to develop a broadly-useful panel of genetic markers and to construct a linkage map dense enough for quantitative trait locus detection in an interval mapping framework for t. californicus--a first for copepods.
all markers were assembled into linkage groups, and the  <dig> linkage groups corresponded to the  <dig> known chromosomes of t. californicus.
seventy five percent of the mapped markers were detected in  <dig> additional populations of t. californicus.
of available model arthropod genomes, we were able to show more colocalized pairs of homologues between t. californicus and the honeybee apis mellifera, than expected by chance, suggesting preserved macrosynteny between hymenoptera and copepoda.
many of these markers are also found in multiple populations of t. californicus, and in two other species in the genus.
we were able to construct a linkage map with an average intermarker distance of  <dig>  cm, and a maximum intermarker distance of  <dig>  cm.
tigriopus californicus is ideally suited to serve as a genetic model copepod and has been the subject of extensive work in environmental stress and reproductive isolation.
we estimate a total genome size of  <dig>  cm, and a total coverage of  <dig> %.
this linkage map will facilitate genome sequencing, mapping and assembly in an ecologically and taxonomically interesting group for which genomic resources are currently under development.
