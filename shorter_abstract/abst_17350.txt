in this study we present a new framework for identifying signaling pathways in protein-protein interaction networks.
first, we eliminate false positives in the protein-protein interaction network by integrating the network with microarray expression profiles, protein subcellular localization and sequence information.
in addition, protein families are used to repair false negative interactions.
currently, protein-protein interaction data has excessive amount of noise, e.g., false positive and false negative interactions.
then the characteristics of known signal transduction pathways and their functional annotations are extracted in the form of association rules.
in most unicellular organisms, the number of signal transduction pathways influences the number of ways the cell can react and respond to the environment.
discovering signal transduction pathways is an arduous problem, even with the use of systematic genomic, proteomic and metabolomic technologies.
