moreover, we present a detailed gene expression analysis of four gene families , which take prominent roles in the pathogen response.
we have investigated a gene co-expression network activated in response to f. graminearum using rna-seq data from near-isogenic lines, harboring either the resistant or the susceptible allele for fhb <dig> and qfhs.ifa-5a.

a combination of a network-driven approach and differential gene expression analysis identified genes and pathways associated with fhb <dig> and qfhs.ifa-5a.
fusarium head blight  caused by fusarium graminearum schwabe is one of the most prevalent diseases of wheat  and other small grain cereals.
we find g-protein coupled receptor kinases and biosynthesis genes for jasmonate and ethylene earlier induced for fhb <dig>  similarly, we find genes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of riboflavin more abundant for qfhs.ifa-5a.
