after treating erythroid myeloid lymphoid  cells with all-trans retinoic acid , we investigated the expression and regulation of malat <dig> during hematopoietic differentiation, the results showed that atra significantly down regulates malat <dig> expression during the differentiation of eml cells.
furthermore, we testified that p <dig> over expression in eml cells causes down regulation of malat <dig>
in addition to its biological function, the study also uncovers the regulation pattern of malat <dig> expression mediated by p <dig> in hematopoietic differentiation.
mouse lrh  cells that represent the early-stage progenitor cells show a high level of malat <dig> expression, while lrb  cells that represent the late-stage progenitor cells had no detectable expression of malat <dig>
in this study we conformed that malat <dig> is highly conserved across vast evolutionary distances amongst  <dig> species of mammals in terms of sequence, and found that mouse malat <dig> expresses in tissues of liver, kidney, lung, heart, testis, spleen and brain, but not in skeletal muscle.
in summary, this study indicates malat <dig> plays a critical role in maintaining the proliferation potential of early-stage hematopoietic cells.
interestingly, we found two p <dig> binding motifs with help of bioinformatic tools, and the following chromatin immunoprecipitation  test conformed that p <dig> acts as a transcription repressor that binds to malat1’s promoter.
our research shed a light on exploring the malat <dig> biological role including therapeutic significance to inhibit the proliferation potential of malignant cells.
previous studies showed that malat <dig> is abundantly expressed in many tissues and involves in promoting tumor growth and metastasis by modulating gene expression and target protein activities.
