the aim of this study was to evaluate two different btsh products as alternative to rhtsh using mass spectrometry.
significantly higher endotoxin levels could be detected in all btsh products compared to the rhtsh.
both btsh products are crude mixtures and therefore not an acceptable alternative to rhtsh.
more than  <dig> proteins, including other pituitary hormones, bovine albumin, hemoglobin, and tissue proteins were identified in the btsh preparations.
the tsh stimulation test to confirm canine hypothyroidism is commonly performed using a recombinant human tsh , as up to date, canine tsh is not yet commercially available.
in contrast, rhtsh proved to be a highly pure product.
less expensive bovine tsh preparations  purified from bovine pituitary glands are readily commercially available.
limiting factors for the use of rhtsh are its high costs and occasional difficulties in product availability.
