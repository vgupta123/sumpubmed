the non-essential subunit, trs <dig>  is conserved only among many fungi and some unicellular eukaryotes.
ypt/rab gtpases and their gef activators regulate intra-cellular trafficking in all eukaryotic cells.
here, we show a phylogenetic analysis of the three trappii-specific subunits.
however, we show here that the yeast trs <dig> does not function as a trans-membrane protein, and the human tmem <dig> does not contain putative tmds.
multiple alignment analysis of each trappii-specific subunit revealed conserved domains that include highly conserved amino acids.
the conserved domains and amino acids discovered here can be used for functional analysis that should help to resolve the differences in the assigned functions of these proteins in fungi and animals.
in s. cerivisiae, the modular trapp complex acts as a gef for the golgi gatekeepers: ypt <dig> and the functional pair ypt31/ <dig>  while trappi, which acts in early golgi, is conserved from fungi to animals, not much is known about trappii, which acts in late golgi and consists of trappi plus three additional subunits.
currently, nibp is implicated in signaling, and tmem <dig> is suggested to have trans-membrane domains  and to function as a membrane channel.
the mammalian orthologs of trs <dig> and trs <dig>  nibp and tmem <dig>  respectively, are candidates for human disorders.
one copy of each of the two essential subunits, trs <dig> and trs <dig>  is present in almost every fully sequenced eukaryotic genome.
