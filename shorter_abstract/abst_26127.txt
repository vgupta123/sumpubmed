the enormous amount of sequence data available in the public domain database has been a gold mine for researchers exploring various themes in life sciences, and hence the quality of such data is of serious concern to researchers.
vector contamination remains a serious concern to the data quality in the public sequence database nowadays.
removal of vector contamination is one of the most significant operations to obtain accurate sequence data containing only a cdna insert from the basecalls output by an automatic dna sequencer.
in a recent study, where the program seqclean was used to remove vector contamination from our test set of est data compiled through various library construction systems, however, a significant number of errors remained after preliminary trimming.
vector contamination in dbest was also investigated in this study:  <dig> out of the  <dig> ests sampled from dbest  were found to match sequences in univec.
based on the results presented here, we feel that our modified procedure with seqclean should be recommended to all researchers for the task of vector removal from est or genomic sequences.
