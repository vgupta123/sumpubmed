during the last two decades, dna sequencing has led to the identification of numerous genes in key species; however, in most cases, their functions are still unknown.
furthermore, the phenotype of the obtained mutants indicates that medaka is an excellent animal model for investigating genome stability and gene function, especially when combined with tilling.
in this situation, reverse genetics is the most suitable method to assign function to a gene.
the method has been applied to a variety of plant and animal species.
these results demonstrate that the hrm assay is useful for screening mutations in tilling.
in this study, we developed a high resolution melting  assay and evaluated its effectiveness for screening enu-induced mutations in a medaka tilling library.
nonsense mutations were identified in each gene, and the phenotypes of these nonsense mutants confirmed their loss-of-function nature.
tilling  is a reverse-genetic strategy that combines random chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput discovery of the induced mutations in target genes.
therefore, we first tested the efficiency of the hrm assay by screening mutations in p <dig>  which indicated that the hrm assay is as useful as direct sequencing.
next, we screened mutations in the atr and atm genes with the hrm assay.
