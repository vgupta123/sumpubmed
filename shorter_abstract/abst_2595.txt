this met occurring in hccr- <dig> transfected cells is reminiscent of the transdifferentiation process during nephrogenesis.
this suggests that hccr- <dig> might be involved in the transdifferentiation process of cancer stem cell.
cell transdifferentiation is characterized by loss of some phenotypes along with acquisition of new phenotypes in differentiated cells.
we report here that hccr- <dig>  previously shown to play an oncogenic role in human cancers, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  in human and mouse, respectively.
therefore, we propose that hccr- <dig> may be a regulatory factor that stimulates morphogenesis of epithelia or mesenchyme during neoplastic transformation.
