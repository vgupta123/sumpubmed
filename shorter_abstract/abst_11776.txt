we previously reported that the pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes  by co-culture with neonatal cms  in vitro.
mouse induced pluripotent stem cells  were cultured in hanging drops to form embryoid bodies  and to induce myocardial differentiation.

co-culture with ncms markedly increased the generation of functional cms from ipscs.
these findings indicated that co-culture of ebs with ncms induces genes expressed in a mature pattern and stimulates the proliferation of ipsc-derived cms  by activating fak/jnk signaling.
our results revealed that co-culture with ncms significantly enhance the differentiation ability of ipscs by increasing mef2c and bcl- <dig> expressions concomitantly with a marked augment on cell proliferation through jnk signaling pathways.
co-culture of ebs and ncms was established in a transwell insert system, while ebs grown alone in the wells were used as controls.
