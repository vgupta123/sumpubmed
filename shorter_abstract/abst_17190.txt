with informative data, there is no significant difference in the results for either parameter or noise estimation.
in sts, data from each cell is analysed in a separate sub-problem, meaning that only data from the same cell is used to calculate the parameter values within that cell.
finally, we provide a small tutorial that shows how to use nlme for single-cell analysis, using the free and user-friendly software monolix.
different examples, both linear and nonlinear, and both simulated and real experimental data, have been examined.
these results hold independently of whether the loss of information is due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, too few data points, or a bad input signal.
studies of cell-to-cell variation have in recent years grown in interest, due to improved bioanalytical techniques which facilitates determination of small changes with high uncertainty.
nlme would therefore be advantageous compared to sts also for the study of cell-to-cell variation.
like much high-quality data, single-cell data is best analysed using a systems biology approach.
the most common systems biology approach to single-cell data is the standard two-stage  approach.
when considering uninformative single-cell data, nlme yields more accurate parameter and noise estimates, compared to more traditional approaches, such as sts and jlh.
herein, such a systematic comparison between sts and nlme has been performed.
this approach, called nonlinear mixed-effects modelling , makes use of all data, when estimating the patient-specific parameters.
