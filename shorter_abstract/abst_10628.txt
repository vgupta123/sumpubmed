bioinformatics data analysis is often using linear mixture model representing samples as additive mixture of components.
we propose an additive mixture model of a sample for feature extraction using, in principle, sparseness constrained factorization on a sample-by-sample basis.
it achieves average sensitivities of:  <dig>  ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  and average specificities of:  <dig> % , 99%  and  <dig> %  in  <dig> independent two-fold cross-validations.
the method proposed here is applied to well-studied protein and genomic datasets of ovarian, prostate and colon cancers to extract components for disease prediction.
yet, they will still be allocated to the related disease and/or control specific component.
since label information is not used in the selection process, case and control specific components can be used for classification.
as opposed to standard matrix factorization methods this can be achieved on a sample -by-sample basis.
as opposed to that, existing methods factorize complete dataset simultaneously.
the sample model is composed of a reference sample representing control and/or case  groups and a test sample.
postulating one or more components with indifferent features enables their removal from disease and control specific components on a sample-by-sample basis.
properly constrained blind matrix factorization methods extract those components using mixture samples only.
however, automatic selection of extracted components to be retained for classification analysis remains an open issue.
