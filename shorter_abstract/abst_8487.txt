dinoflagellate genes, similar to other eukaryotes, have a high gc-content that is reflected in the amino acid codon usage.
these data will be instrumental to future research to understand the unique and complex cell biology of these organisms and for potentially identifying the genes involved in toxin production.
dinoflagellates are important marine primary producers and grazers and cause toxic "red tides".
these taxa are characterized by many unique features such as immense genomes, the absence of nucleosomes, and photosynthetic organelles  that have been gained and lost multiple times.
we generated est sequences from non-normalized and normalized cdna libraries from a culture of the toxic species alexandrium tamarense to elucidate dinoflagellate evolution.
previous analyses of these data have clarified plastid origin and here we study the gene content, annotate the ests, and analyze the genes that are putatively involved in dna packaging.
