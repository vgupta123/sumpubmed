capitalizing on the plethora of recently sequenced genomes we have conducted comparative genomic studies to annotate the tor pathway throughout the fungal kingdom and related unicellular opisthokonts, including monosiga brevicollis, salpingoeca rosetta, and capsaspora owczarzaki.
the nutrient-sensing tor pathway governs cell growth and is conserved in nearly all eukaryotic organisms from unicellular yeasts to multicellular organisms, including humans.
the microsporidia are obligate intracellular pathogens with highly reduced genomes, and we hypothesize that they lost the tor pathway as they adapted and streamlined their genomes for intracellular growth in a nutrient-rich environment.
interestingly, the tor signaling cascade is absent in three microsporidian species with available genome sequences, the only known instance of a eukaryotic group lacking this conserved pathway.
the repeated independent duplications of the tor gene in the fungal kingdom might reflect selective pressure acting upon this kinase that populates two proteinaceous complexes with different cellular roles.
two tor paralogs are present in several fungal species as a result of either a whole genome duplication or independent gene/segmental duplication events.
these comparative genomic analyses illustrate the evolutionary trajectory of a central nutrient-sensing cascade that enables diverse eukaryotic organisms to respond to their natural environments.
