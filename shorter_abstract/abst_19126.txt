their ltrs possess a novel type of repeated motif  defined by its exceptionally high copy number, symmetry and core cgg-ccg signature.
the 5'ltr/internal domain junction and a polyc-rich integrase signal are also highly conserved domains of the sirevirus genome.
we performed sensitive comparative analysis of the genomes of a large set of ty1/copia retrotransposons.
their structure may dictate a life cycle with different regulation and transmission strategy compared to other pseudoviridae, which may contribute towards their pattern of distribution within and across plants.
our comparative analysis of retrotransposon genomes using advanced in silico methods highlighted the unique genome organization of sireviruses.
