the na+,k+-atpase plays an important role for ion homeostasis in virtually all mammalian cells, including neurons.
superresolution microscopy has thus opened up a new perspective to elucidate the nature of the physiological function, regulation and signaling role of na+,k+-atpase from its topological distribution in dendritic spines.
a compartmentalized distribution may have implications for the generation of local sodium gradients within the spine and for the structural and functional interaction between the sodium pump and other synaptic proteins.
with help of superresolving stimulated emission depletion microscopy the spatial distribution of na+,k+-atpase in dendritic spines of cultured striatum neurons have been dissected.
