<dig> binding included pou2f <dig>  while unique motifs in the spi-b regions contained a combined ets-irf motif.
analysis for high-stringency enriched genomic regions demonstrated that pu.
<dig> and spi-b are both expressed in b cells, and have been demonstrated to redundantly activate transcription of genes required for b cell differentiation and function.
<dig> were frequently located immediately upstream of genes associated with immune response and activation of b cells.
<dig> and spi-b may be explained by their interaction with a similar set of regions in the genome of b cells.
our results suggest that complementary biological functions of pu.
<dig> are highly related members of the e26-transformation-specific  family of transcription factors that have similar, but not identical, roles in b cell development.
motif-finding revealed that both transcription factors were predominantly located at the ets core domain , however, other unique motifs were identified when examining regions associated with only one of the two factors.
