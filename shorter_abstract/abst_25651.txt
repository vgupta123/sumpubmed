here we investigate genetic differences on the whole-genome level that are related to cpn tissue tropism and pathogenicity.
they could be distinguished from all other isolates by characteristic nssnps in genes involved in rb to eb transition, inclusion membrane formation, bacterial stress response and metabolism.
phylogenetic reconstruction revealed distinct evolutionary lineages containing primarily non-respiratory cpn isolates.
we have sequenced the genomes of  <dig> clinical isolates from different anatomical sites  of diseased patients, and one animal isolate.
the translation of the observed cpn genetic differences into biological functions and the prediction of novel pathogen-oriented diagnostic strategies have to be further explored.
in one of these, clinical isolates from coronary arteries and blood monocytes were closely grouped together.
chlamydia pneumoniae  are obligate intracellular bacteria that cause acute infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and have been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases.
all of them were isolated from the respiratory tract and shared more than 99% sequence identity.
in total  <dig>  snp loci and  <dig> indels have been identified in the genomes of all clinical cpn isolates.
the tyrp gene was always encoded as single copy in all vascular isolates.
this study substantially expands the genomic data of cpn and elucidates its evolutionary history.
these are distributed throughout the whole chlamydial genome and enriched in highly variable regions.
