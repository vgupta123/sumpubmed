the creation of a complete genome-wide map of transcription factor binding sites is essential for understanding gene regulatory networks in vivo.
however, current prediction methods generally rely on statistical models that imperfectly model transcription factor binding.
we propose a method for predicting transcription factor binding sites in the genome by directly mapping data generated from protein binding microarrays  to the genome and calculating a moving average of several overlapping octamers.
using this unique algorithm, we predicted binding sites for the essential pancreatic islet transcription factor nkx <dig>  in the mouse genome and confirmed >90% of the tested sites by emsa and chip.
pbm-mapping is an accurate method for predicting nkx <dig>  binding sites and may be widely applicable for the creation of genome-wide maps of transcription factor binding sites.
we have also identified an alternative core sequence recognized by the nkx <dig>  homeodomain.
