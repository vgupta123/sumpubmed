we assessed the degree to which the acc constitutes a barrier to gene flow between northern and southern populations and whether the onset of diversification of these corals coincides with the origin of the acc .
our divergence time analyses indicated that the separation of amphi-acc populations took place during the middle miocene around  <dig>  million years ago, i.e., after the formation of the acc.
we suggest that the acc constitutes a semi-permeable barrier to these deep-sea octocorals capable of separating and structuring populations, while allowing short periods of gene flow.

we also found significant genetic structure among our four regional populations.
in this study we conducted the first assessment of phylogeographical patterns in deep-sea octocorals in the south pacific and southern ocean, specifically a group of closely related bottlebrush octocorals , as a test case to study the effect of the acc on the population structure of brooding species.
however, we uncovered shared haplotypes among certain population pairs, suggesting long-distance, asymmetrical migration.
despite its potential importance for shaping biogeographical patterns, the distribution and connectivity of deep-sea populations across the acc remain poorly understood.
antarctica is surrounded by the antarctic circumpolar current , the largest and strongest current in the world.
