phase alignment extracted from within-brain dynamics was related to behavioral play onset asynchrony between guitarists.
whether between-brain oscillatory couplings play a causal role in initiating and maintaining interpersonal action coordination needs to be clarified by further research.
a substantial part of these interactions consists in synchronized goal-directed actions involving two or more individuals.
however, eeg recordings that permit the assessment of synchronized neuronal activities at much higher levels of temporal resolution have not yet been simultaneously assessed in multiple individuals and analyzed in the time-frequency domain.
our findings show that interpersonally coordinated actions are preceded and accompanied by between-brain oscillatory couplings.
by applying synchronization algorithms to intra- and interbrain analyses, we found that phase synchronization both within and between brains increased significantly during the periods of  preparatory metronome tempo setting and  coordinated play onset.
in this study, we simultaneously recorded eeg from the brains of each of eight pairs of guitarists playing a short melody together to explore the extent and the functional significance of synchronized cortical activity in the course of interpersonally coordinated actions.
