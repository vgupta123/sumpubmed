we demonstrate that marlin- <dig> is enriched in restricted areas of the brain including olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.
here we have studied the localization of marlin- <dig> in the rodent brain and cultured neurons combining immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and pre-embedding electron microscopy.
marlin- <dig> is expressed mainly in the central nervous system but little is known regarding its cellular and subcellular distribution in the brain.
our study constitutes the first detailed description of the cellular and subcellular distribution of marlin- <dig> in the brain.
in the cytoplasm it associates to microtubules in the dendritic shaft and occasionally with the golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum  and dendritic spines.
in addition, it binds the molecular motor kinesin-i and nucleic acids, preferentially single stranded rna.
our results demonstrate that marlin- <dig> is expressed in discrete areas of the brain.
marlin- <dig> is a microtubule binding protein that associates specifically with the gabab <dig> subunit in neurons and with members of the janus kinase family in lymphoid cells.
together with the abundance of the protein in dendrites and axons they are consistent with the emerging role of marlin- <dig> as an intracellular protein linking the cytoskeleton and transport.
as such, it will set the basis for future studies on the functional implications of marlin- <dig> in protein trafficking.
