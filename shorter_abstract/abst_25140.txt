fresh-frozen samples showed a good overall pearson correlation of  <dig> , and ffpe samples showed a lower overall correlation coefficient of  <dig> , which is likely due to sample quality.
we compared gene expression data obtained by nanostring vs. rq-pcr in both fresh-frozen and ffpe samples.
a recently developed probe-based technology, the nanostring ncounterâ„¢ gene expression system, has been shown to allow accurate mrna transcript quantification using low amounts of total rna.
we believe that this newly developed technique is optimal for large-scale validation studies using total rna isolated from archived, ffpe samples.
we found a higher correlation coefficient between fresh-frozen and ffpe samples analyzed by nanostring  compared to fresh-frozen and ffpe samples analyzed by rq-pcr .
based on our results, we conclude that both technologies are useful for gene expression quantification in fresh-frozen or ffpe tissues; however, the probe-based nanostring method achieved superior gene expression quantification results when compared to rq-pcr in archived ffpe samples.
we measured the mrna transcript abundance of  <dig> genes  in  <dig> samples  by both nanostring and sybr green i fluorescent dye-based quantitative real-time pcr .
in addition, nanostring data showed a higher mean correlation  between individual fresh-frozen and ffpe sample pairs compared to rq-pcr .
