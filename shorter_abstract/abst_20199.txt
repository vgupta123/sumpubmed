analysis of our model predictions also indicated that the method is potentially useful for understanding molecular mechanisms of drug action and for identifying protein targets that may potentiate the desired therapeutic effects of other drugs .

detailed cross-validation studies using united states food and drug administration-approved drugs for hypertension, human immunodeficiency virus, and malaria indicated that dpir provides robust predictions.
the method, based on genome-wide drug-protein interaction information and bayesian statistics, first identifies drug-protein interactions associated with a desired therapeutic effect.
for this approach to be statistically sound, it requires a large number of drugs in both classes.
a popular approach is to develop a classification model based on drugs with and without a desired therapeutic effect.
then, it uses key drug-protein interactions to score other drugs for their potential to have the same therapeutic effect.
