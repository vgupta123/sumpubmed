two different methods have been used to generate short hairpin rna  libraries; one is to use chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, and the other is to convert complementary dnas  into shrna cassettes enzymatically.
the high cost of chemical synthesis and the low efficiency of the enzymatic approach have hampered the widespread use of screening with shrna libraries.
we report here an improved method for constructing genome-wide shrna libraries enzymatically.
this method can readily be used to generate shrna libraries from a small amount of mrna and thus can be used to create cell- or tissue-specific libraries.
in recent years, high-throughput, genome-wide screening of sirna libraries has emerged as a viable approach.
the method includes steps of cdna fragmentation and endonuclease mmei digestion to generate 19-bp fragments, capping the 19-bp cdna fragments with a hairpin oligonucleotide, and amplification of the hairpin structures by pcr.
