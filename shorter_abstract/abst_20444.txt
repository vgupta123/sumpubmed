the average value of female index  of soybean accessions with resistant alleles was significantly lower than those with susceptible alleles for each peak snp.
multiple sources of resistance are urgently needed for effective management of scn via the development of resistant cultivars.
such proteins may participate in the resistant reaction to scn and were frequently found in the tightly linked genomic regions of the peak snps.
disease resistance proteins with leucine rich regions, cytochrome p450s, protein kinases, zinc finger domain proteins, ring domain proteins, myb and wrky transcription activation families were identified.
the multiple beneficial alleles from resistant germplasm sources will be useful for the breeding of cultivars with improved resistance to scn.
soybean cyst nematode  is one of the most fatal pests of soybean  merr.)
<dig>  exactly  <dig> new sources of scn resistance were identified.
gwas extended understanding of the genetic architecture of scn resistance in multiple genetic backgrounds.
analysis of genes near association signals may facilitate the recognition of the causal gene underlying scn resistances.

lines were genotyped by snp markers detected by the specific locus amplified fragment sequencing  approach.
genome-wide association mapping showed that a total of  <dig> association signals were significantly related to the resistance for the two hg types.
nineteen association signals were obtained for the resistance to the two hg types of scn.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to scn hg type  <dig>  and hg type  <dig> .
