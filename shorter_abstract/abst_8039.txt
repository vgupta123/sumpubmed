in the present study we have identified and characterized a quite novel aspect of scn neurobiology, doublecortin  protein expression within a defined group of adult rat scn neurons.
however, dcx is co-localized with neun in the ventral scn, and also with neuropeptides; dcx is extensively co-localized with grp and partially co-localized with vip.
we have also demonstrated for the first time that the scn as a whole exhibits low expression of the neuronal differentiation marker neun.
molecular circadian 'clocks' are not an exclusive property of scn neurons but the unique role of the scn as a central integrative pacemaker is associated with specialized aspects of neuronal organization.
the highly selective expression of dcx in the adult scn compared with other hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei shows that this map is somewhat uniquely required in certain scn neurons, perhaps contributing to a specific functional property of the brain's circadian clock nucleus.
