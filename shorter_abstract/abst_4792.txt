for this analysis on the illumina platform, merging and quality filtering of paired-end reads are essential first steps in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of downstream analysis.
mefit invokes casper  for merging paired-end reads and provides users the option to quality filter the reads using the traditional average q-score metric or using a maximum expected error cut-off threshold.
