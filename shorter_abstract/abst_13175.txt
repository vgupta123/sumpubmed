a developmental study covering the first  <dig> days following birth was conducted on a dnmt3l mutant mouse model; lower germ cell numbers and delayed entry into meiosis were observed in dnmt3l-/- males, pointing to a mitotic defect.
using a restriction enzyme qpcr assay , dna methylation analyses were conducted on postnatal primitive type a spermatogonia lacking dnmt3l.
methylation levels along  <dig> sites across chromosomes  <dig> and x decreased significantly by approximately 50% compared to the levels observed in dnmt3l+/+ germ cells, suggesting that many loci throughout the genome are marked for methylation by dnmt3l.
here we report on the role of dnmt3l in male germ cell development.
a temporal expression study showed that expression of dnmt3l is highest in prenatal gonocytes but is also detected and developmentally regulated during spermatogenesis.
more so, hypomethylation was more pronounced in regions of lower gc content than in regions of higher gc content.
formation of haploid spermatozoa capable of fertilization requires proper programming of epigenetic information.
