by integrating fear phenotypes, transcript profiling data from hippocampus and striatum and also genotype information, two gene co-expression networks correlated with context-dependent immobility were identified.
to explore the genetic networks governing the biology of conditional fear, we used a systems genetics approach to analyze a hybrid mouse diversity panel  with high mapping resolution.
we prioritized the key markers and genes in these pathways using intramodular connectivity measures and structural equation modeling.
in addition, we surveyed the architecture of brain transcript regulation and demonstrated preservation of gene co-expression modules in hippocampus and striatum, while also highlighting important differences.
a total of  <dig> behavioral quantitative trait loci were mapped with a false discovery rate of 5%.
