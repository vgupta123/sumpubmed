no molecular tools are available that can discriminate among the races, and the molecular basis of compatibility and disease progression are poorly understood.

our data suggest that resistance against fom in melon involves only limited transcriptional changes, and that wilting symptoms could derive, at least partially, from an active plant response.
we carried out a large-scale cdna-aflp analysis to identify host genes potentially related to resistance and susceptibility as well as fungal genes associated with the infection process.
five time points from the symptomless early stage  to obvious wilting symptoms  were considered for cdna-aflp analysis.
markedly different colonization patterns were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations.
rna samples from fom colonies of the three strains grown in vitro were also included in the analysis to facilitate the detection of in planta-specific transcripts and to identify tdfs differentially expressed among races/strains.
melon plants , which are susceptible to race  <dig>  and resistant to race  <dig>  were artificially infected with a race  <dig> strain of fom or one of two race  <dig>  w strains.
we discuss the pathogen-derived transcripts expressed in planta during the infection process and potentially related to virulence functions, as well as transcripts that are differentially expressed between the two fom races grown in vitro.
causes fusarium wilt, the most important infectious disease of melon .
host colonization of stems was assessed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation , and the fungus was reisolated from infected plants.
at the same time, a systematic reisolation procedure on infected stems allowed us to monitor fungal colonization in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations.
