here we describe, using molecular biology alone, a comprehensive characterization of  <dig> different hesc lines.
the use of amplified nucleic acids means that for the first time full characterization of hesc lines can be performed with little time investment and a minimum of material.
the information thus gained will facilitate comparison of lines and replication of results between laboratories.
however, hesc must be routinely analyzed at the genomic level to guard against deleterious changes during extensive propagation, expansion, and manipulation in vitro.
human embryonic stem cells  offer a renewable source of a wide range of cell types for use in research and cell-based therapies to treat disease.
we found that short tandem repeat  analysis, human leukocyte antigen  typing, single nucleotide polymorphism  genomic analysis, mitochondrial dna sequencing, and gene expression analysis by microarray can be used to fully describe any hesc culture in terms of its identity, stability, and undifferentiated state.
