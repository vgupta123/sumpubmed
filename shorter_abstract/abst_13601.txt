however, the mechanism by which hbc interacts with the human genome to exert effects on hepatocyte function remains unknown.
manipulation of the transcriptional profile in hbv-infected hepatocytes may represent a key pathogenic mechanism of hbv infection.
gene ontology and pathway analyses were performed on related genes.
this study investigated the distribution of hbc binding to promoters in the human genome and evaluated its effects on the related genesâ€™ expression.
among these,  <dig> are associated with known biological processes, and  <dig> regulate genes with defined molecular functions.
the quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was used to verify chip-on-chip results.
the core protein  of hepatitis b virus  has been implicated in the malignant transformation of chronically-infected hepatocytes and displays pleiotropic functions, including rna- and dna-binding activities.
the hbc antibody immunoprecipitated approximately  <dig> human gene promoters.
hbc has the ability to bind a large number of human gene promoters, and can disrupt normal host gene expression.
whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray  analysis was used to identify hbc-bound human gene promoters.
