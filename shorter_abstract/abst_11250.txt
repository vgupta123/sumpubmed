we identified a large number of genes encoding proteins with established functions in immunity related sensing of microbial signatures and signaling, as well as effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and inhibitors of microbial proteinases.
in addition, we found genes known as mediators of melanization or contributing to stress responses.
the larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella are increasingly used  as mini-hosts to study pathogenesis and virulence factors of prominent bacterial and fungal human pathogens,  as a whole-animal high throughput infection system for testing pathogen mutant libraries, and  as a reliable host model to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics against human pathogens.
using the transcriptomic data, we identified hemolymph peptides and proteins induced upon immune challenge by 2d-gelelectrophoresis combined with mass spectrometric analysis.
the generated data provide for the first time access to the genetic architecture of immunity in this model host, allowing us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen and parasite response and detailed analyses of both its immune responses against human pathogens, and its coevolution with entomopathogens.
we generated a total of  <dig>  pyrosequencing and  <dig>  high-quality sanger est sequences which clustered into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bases.
