introns-early explains this by speculating that a fraction of present-day introns were present between minigenes in the progenote and therefore must lie in phase- <dig>  in contrast, introns-late predicts that the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution reflects the nonrandomness of intron insertions.
we also tested whether the observed intron phase distributions from  <dig> eukaryotes can be explained by intron insertions on a genome-wide scale.
consistent with introns-late, the observed intron phase distributions matched those predicted by an intron insertion model quite well.
our results strongly support the introns-late hypothesis of the origin of spliceosomal introns.
we inferred the evolution of intron phase distribution from a dataset of  <dig> gene orthologs from seven eukaryotes using a maximum likelihood method.
in this paper, we tested the two theories using analyses of intron phase distribution.
in contrast to the prediction of introns-early, the inferred evolution of intron phase distribution showed that the proportion of phase- <dig> introns increased over evolution.
the distribution of intron phases is non-uniform, with an excess of phase- <dig> introns.
the origin of spliceosomal introns is the central subject of the introns-early versus introns-late debate.
