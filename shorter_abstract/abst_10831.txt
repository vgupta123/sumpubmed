it offers a clean interface for venn diagram construction and enables analysis of set unions while preserving the shape of the diagram.
interactivenn allows set unions in venn diagrams to be explored thoroughly, by consequence extending the ability to analyze combinations of sets with additional observations, yielded by novel interactions between joined sets.
set comparisons permeate a large number of data analysis workflows, in particular workflows in biological sciences.
venn diagrams are frequently employed for such analysis but current tools are limited.
we have developed interactivenn, a more flexible tool for interacting with venn diagrams including up to six sets.
