the pbgpe, gale and galu mutants were all predicted to be involved in lps biosynthesis and, in support of this, we have shown that these mutants are avirulent and sensitive to the cationic antimicriobial peptide, polymyxin b. on the other hand the proq, asma and hdfr mutants were not affected in virulence and were either as resistant  or slightly more sensitive  to polymyxin b than the wild-type .
although the colonization process  has been described phenomonologically very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms.
these mutants were mapped to  <dig> different genetic loci; the pbgpe operon, gale, galu, proq, asma and hdfr.
in total  <dig> genetic loci were identified and we present evidence that all of these loci are involved in the assembly and/or maintenance of lps and other factors associated with the cell surface.
therefore, this study highlights the importance of the cell surface in mediating the symbiotic and pathogenic interactions of photorhabdus.
therefore, in this study, we were interested in identifying genes in photorhabdus that are important for ij colonization.
this is the first report describing the outcome of a comprehensive screen looking for transmission mutants in photorhabdus.
interestingly several, but not all, of the transmission mutants identified were also avirulent suggesting that there is a significant, but not complete, genetic overlap between pathogenicity and mutualism.
in total  <dig> mutants were identified with transmission frequencies of â‰¤ 30% compared to wild-type.
photorhabdus are gram negative entomopathogenic bacteria that also have a mutualistic association with nematodes from the family heterorhabditis.
