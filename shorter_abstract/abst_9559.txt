l. chlorophorum expresses plastid-targeted proteins with a range of different origins, which probably arose through endosymbiotic gene transfer  and horizontal gene transfer .
some of these were of green algal origin.
other nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted protein genes, however, are clearly not of green algal origin, but have been derived from a number of different algal groups, including dinoflagellates, streptophytes, heterokonts, and red algae.
plastid replacements through secondary endosymbioses include massive transfer of genes from the endosymbiont to the host nucleus and require a new targeting system to enable transport of the plastid-targeted proteins across 3- <dig> plastid membranes.
this confirms that genes have been transferred from the plastid to the host nucleus of l. chlorophorum and indicates that the plastid is fully integrated as an organelle in the host.
the characteristics of n-terminal plastid-targeting peptides of all of these genes are substantially different from those found in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates and green algae.
the n-terminal extension of the genes is different from the extensions found in green alga and other dinoflagellates .
we sequenced  <dig>  randomly picked clones from a l. chlorophorum cdna library.
these modifications have likely enabled the mosaic proteome of l. chlorophorum.
in this study, we analyzed the phylogenetic origin and n-terminal extensions of plastid-targeted proteins from lepidodinium chlorophorum, a member of the only dinoflagellate genus that harbors a green secondary plastid rather than the red algal-derived, peridinin-containing plastid usually found in photosynthetic dinoflagellates.
