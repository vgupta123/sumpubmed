comparison to publicly available transcript collections suggests that the assembly covers ~75-80% of the complete transcriptome.
bread wheat is one of the world’s most important food crops and considerable efforts have been made to develop genomic resources for this species.
this includes an on-going project by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium to assemble its large and complex genome, which is hexaploid and contains three closely related ‘homoeologous’ copies for each chromosome.
<dig> % of cases the assembly was sufficiently accurate for homoeologous triplets to be cleanly separated into either two or three separate contigs.
this work therefore describes the first homoeolog-specific sequence assembly of the wheat transcriptome and provides a reference transcriptome for future wheat research.
