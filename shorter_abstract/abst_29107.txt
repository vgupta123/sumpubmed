by genome sequencing, spatio-temporal analysis and field epidemiology investigation, we can estimate their complex transform network and reveal the possible modes of transmission in this ward.
the rapid spread of clostridium difficile nap1/bi/ <dig>  has become one of the leading threats of healthcare-associated infections worldwide.
integrated epidemiological investigation and whole genome sequencing of all strains, we constructed a nosocomial transmission map of these two c. difficile  <dig> outbreaks and traced the origin of the infection.
based on their genetic diversity, we can assume that the toilets, bathroom, and janitor’s equipment room may be contaminated area, which may be suggested to improve infection control measures in the following health care.
surprisingly, we found the genome sequences were similar to c. difficile  <dig> strain r <dig>  indicating the occurrence of a rare c. difficile  <dig> strain in china.
through using whole genome sequencing, we succeeded to trace the origin of the bsi strain.
