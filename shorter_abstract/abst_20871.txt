we show that simple null models are poorly suited for bursty data, and they yield many false positives.
we also demonstrate the effect of the window size, i.e., maximum co-occurrence distance, on the significance results.
we evaluate the models and techniques on synthetic event sequences, and on real data consisting of potential transcription factor binding sites.
these events tend to occur in bursts: in some genomic regions there are more genes and therefore potentially more binding sites, while in some, possibly very long regions, hardly any events occur.
we extend the existing techniques that have been considered for determining the significance of co-occurrence patterns between a pair of event types under different null models.
event sequences where different types of events often occur close together arise, e.g., when studying potential transcription factor binding sites  of certain transcription factors  in a dna sequence.
determining a numerical value to summarize the tendency for co-occurrence between two tfs can be done in a number of ways.
more sophisticated models give better results in our experiments.
