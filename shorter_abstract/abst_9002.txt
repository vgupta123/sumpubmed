a pcr method was designed to detect and characterise new elements of this type based on this scaffold and a culture collection of fifty-eight ralstonia pickettii and ralstonia insidiosa strains were analysed for the presence of the element.
a pcr method was designed  to detect and characterise new elements of this type.
hl-ebgr <dig>  polaromonas, burkholderia and diaphorobacter sp.
these elements vary in size, gc content, putative function and have a mosaic-like structure of plasmid- and phage-like sequences which is typical of tn4371-like ices.
comparative sequence analysis of bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of a number of uncharacterised tn4371-like ices in the genomes of several β and γ- proteobacteria.
an element related to the ice tn <dig> was discovered during a bioinformatic search of the ralstonia pickettii 12j genome.
two novel tn4371-like ice were discovered and characterised, using the novel pcr method described in two different isolates of ralstonia pickettii from laboratory purified water.
the elements, which are found in ralstonia, delftia, acidovorax, bordetella, comamonas, acidovorax, congregibacter, shewanella, pseudomonas stenotrophomonas, thioalkalivibrio sp.
all elements found in this study possess a common scaffold of core genes but contain different accessory genes.
integrative conjugative elements  are important factors in the plasticity of microbial genomes.
