crude extracts of sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum attenuated spike frequency adaptation causing drg neurones to switch from firing single action potentials to multiple firing.
sarcophyton glaucum and lobophyton crassum contain natural products including 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium that increase the excitability of drg neurones.
whole cell patch clamp recording and intracellular ca2+ imaging were carried out on rat cultured dorsal root ganglion  neurones to characterize the actions of crude extracts and purified samples from red sea soft corals.
the mechanism of action of the natural products in the samples from the soft corals involved inhibition of voltage-activated k+ currents.
an active component of the crude marine samples was identified as 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium .
application of synthetic 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium at high concentration  also induced multiple firing and reduced voltage-activated k+ current.
the changes in excitability of drg neurones induced by 3-carboxy-1-methyl pyridinium suggest that this compound contributes to the bioactivity produced by the crude extracts from two soft corals.
the aim of the project was to identify compounds that would alter the excitability of drg neurones.
