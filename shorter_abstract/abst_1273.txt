computational methods that can accurately predict dna-binding sites on proteins will greatly expedite research on problems involving protein-dna interactions.
the proposed method achieved high accuracy when tested on a representative set of  <dig> protein-dna complexes using leave-one-out cross-validation.
protein-dna interactions play important roles in many biological processes.
comparisons with other methods showed that the proposed method was competitive in predicting dna-binding sites on unbound proteins.
the method represents protein surface patches using labeled graphs and uses a graph kernel method to calculate the similarities between graphs.
this paper presents a method for predicting dna-binding sites on protein structures.
it provides a competitive method for predicting dna-binding sites without requiring structure alignment.
a new surface patch is predicted to be interface or non-interface patch based on its similarities to known dna-binding patches and non-dna-binding patches.
