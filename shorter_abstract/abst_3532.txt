this would cause defects in the ability of the m <dig> macrophages to negatively regulate other immune cells such as t-cells in the lung, possibly explaining the systemic inflammation observed in vav1-cre x tβriifx/fx mice.
alternatively activated  macrophages are defined by their expression of specific gene products and play an important role in containing inflammation, removing apoptotic cells and repairing tissue damage.
our results establish a novel biological role for tgfβ signaling in controlling expression of genes characteristic for alternatively activated macrophages.
vav1-cre x tβriifx/fx mice, lacking tβrii function in hematopoietic cells, exhibited uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation and developed a lethal autoimmune syndrome at young age.
tβrii-/- cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells in the lymph nodes and spleen expressed increased cell surface cd <dig>  and cd <dig> was also higher on cd4+ lymph node t-cells.
upon stimulation with different cytokines, macrophages can undergo classical or alternative activation to become m <dig> or m <dig> macrophages.
whereas it is well-established that il- <dig> can drive alternative activation, if lack of tgfβ signaling at physiological levels affects m <dig> polarization has not been addressed.
moreover, the transcription of genes that are typically upregulated in m2-polarized macrophages, such as ym <dig>  mcr <dig> and mgl <dig>  was also decreased in peritoneal macrophages and il-4-stimulated tβrii-/- bmdms.
we found that cell surface and mrna expression of galectin- <dig>  which also regulates m <dig> macrophage polarization, was lower in tβrii-/- bmdms.
