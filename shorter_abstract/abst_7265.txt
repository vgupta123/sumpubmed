here a new parameter optimization procedure, pop, is described and applied to the problems of optimizing gap penalties and selecting substitution matrices for pair-wise global protein alignments.
the pam series is significantly worse, giving accuracies typically 2% less than vtml.
while substitution matrices can readily be computed from reference alignments, it is challenging to compute optimal or approximately optimal gap penalties.
it is also not well understood which substitution matrices are the most effective when alignment accuracy is the goal rather than homolog recognition.
blosum matrices are found to be slightly inferior, even with the marginal improvements in the bug-fixed rblosum series.
the hypothesis that more accurate alignments of distantly related sequences may be achieved using low-identity matrices is shown to be false for commonly used matrix types.
