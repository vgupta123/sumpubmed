this would be the first demonstration of fluc pca in vitro, which has a distinct advantage over other ppi assays.
when fn7- <dig> domains  that was shown to abrogate gfp mutant-based fret was inserted between split fluc and fkbp <dig> as a rigid linker, it still showed some response, suggesting less limitation in interacting partner’s size.
to date, successful applications of firefly luciferase -based pca have been reported in vivo, in cultured cells and in cell-free lysate, owing to its high sensitivity, high signal-to-background  ratio, and reversible response.
protein-fragment complementation assay  is one of the most widely used methods to detect ppi, as well as förster resonance energy transfer .
our system enables detection of direct ppis without risk of perturbation by ppi mediators in the complex cellular milieu.
fluc pca using purified components will enable a rapid and handy detection of ppis with high s/b ratio, avoiding the effects of concomitant components.
when the proteins were used for pca to detect rapamycin-dependent ppi, they enabled a rapid detection  of ppi with high s/b ratio.
