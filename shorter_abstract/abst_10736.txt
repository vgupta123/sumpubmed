phenodissim is freely available as an r package.
phenodissim is a novel analysis method for image-based high-throughput screen, relying on two parameters which can be automatically optimized without a priori knowledge.
here we propose a new analysis method, phenodissim, which computes the phenotypic dissimilarity between cell populations via support vector machine classification and cross validation.
discovering functional relationships of genes through cell-based phenotyping has become an important approach in functional genomics.
