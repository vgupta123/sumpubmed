rare variants in intergenic regions may implicate new risk loci and genes in asd and also present useful data for comparison with coming whole genome sequence datasets.
we have performed genome-wide analyses and identified rare inherited cnvs affecting non-genic intervals in  <dig> of  <dig>  of asd cases examined.
