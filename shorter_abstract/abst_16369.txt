the basic idea implemented here is to use computational geometry methods to predict and characterize ligand-binding pockets of a given protein structure.
in addition to geometrical characteristics of the protein structure, we consider some simple biochemical properties that help recognize the best candidates for pockets in a proteinâ€™s active site.
the method presented in this paper is a low-cost rapid computational method that could be used to classify proteins and other biomolecules, and furthermore could be useful in reducing the cost and time of drug discovery.
our results are shown to produce good agreement with known empirical results.
