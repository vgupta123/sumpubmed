furthermore, by mining the correlation matrices, k-means clusters and heatmaps generated by t-rex we observed interesting gene-behavior and identified sub-groups in the cody regulon.
t-rex is a parameter-free statistical analysis pipeline for rna-seq gene expression data that is dedicated for use by biologists and bioinformaticians alike.
this development has been accompanied by advances in the bioinformatics methods, tools and software packages that deal with the analysis of the large data sets resulting from rna-seq efforts.
the tables and figures produced by t-rex are in most cases sufficient to accurately mine the statistical results.
based on years of experience in analyzing transcriptome data, we developed a user-friendly webserver that performs the statistical analysis on the gene expression values generated by rna-seq.
we benchmarked our rna-seq pipeline, t-rex, using a case study of cody mutants of bacillus subtilis and show that it could easily and automatically reproduce the statistical analysis of the cognate publication.
transcriptomics analyses of bacteria  provide global as well as detailed information on gene expression levels and, consequently, on other processes in the cell.
