enzyme assays of the five heterologously expressed ugts identified ugt74s <dig> as the only one using seco as substrate, forming seco monoglucoside  and then sdg in a sequential manner.
until now, very little information was available on ugt genes that may play a role in flax sdg biosynthesis.
five ugt genes belonging to the glycosyltransferasesâ€™ family  <dig>  were cloned and characterized.
however, diversity was observed within this  <dig> amino acid sequence, especially in the two peptide sequences wapqv and hcgwns known to play a key role in the recognition and binding of diverse aglycone substrates and in the sugar donor specificity.
this study allowed us to propose a model for the missing step in sdg lignan biosynthesis.
lignans are a class of diphenolic nonsteroidal phytoestrogens often found glycosylated in planta.
here we report on the identification, structural and functional characterization of  <dig> putative ugts potentially involved in secoisolariciresinol  glucosylation in flax.
we have cloned and characterized five flax ugts and provided evidence that ugt74s <dig> uses seco as substrate to form sdg in vitro.
flax seeds are a rich source of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside  lignans.
in developing flax seeds, ugt74s <dig> and ugt94h <dig> showed a coordinated gene expression with that of pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase  and their gene expression patterns correlated with sdg biosynthesis.
