this approach may thus prove to be an elegant and rapid method for the target characterization of newly obtained scfv antibodies.
regardless of the ultimate application or type of antibody used, precise understanding of the interaction between the antibody's binding site and its specific target epitope is of great importance.
our method, utilizing the yeast two-hybrid technology and scfv as bait, is a simple yet powerful approach for the detailed characterization of antibody targets.
recombinant antibodies, including single chain variable fragments , are gaining momentum because they allow powerful in vitro selection and manipulation without loss of function.
systematic sequencing of all retained clones and statistical analysis allowed efficient ranking of the prey fragments.
it allows precise domain mapping for linear epitopes, confirmation of non-linear epitopes for conformational sensors, and detection of secondary binding partners.
for two other scfv, ta <dig> and sf <dig>  which recognize the large proteins giantin and non-muscle myosin iia, respectively, precise antibody-binding regions within the target were defined.
due to their unique ability to bind their targets with high fidelity, antibodies are used widely not only in biomedical research, but also in many clinical applications.
this strongly suggested interaction with a non-linear epitope.
it may be considered prior to any research application and particularly before any use of such recombinant antibodies in clinical medicine.
interactions between antibodies and their respective targets were characterized for several scfv.
finally, for some antibodies, secondary targets within and across species could be revealed.
