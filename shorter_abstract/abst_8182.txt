micrornas  play an important role in the regulation of phase transition and reproductive growth processes.
m. hupehensis rna libraries, one adult and one juvenile phase, were constructed using tree leaves and underwent high-throughput sequencing.
the higher expression level of mdm-mir <dig> and lower expression level of mdm-mir <dig> in the juvenile phase leaves implied that these two small mirnas regulated the phase transition.
the kegg analysis revealed that these targets were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction.
the identified mirna targets were categorized into  <dig> biological processes, and the  <dig> targets of known mirnas were associated with phase transition processes.
expression profiling of mirnas and their targets indicated multiple regulatory functions in the phase transition.
the identification of known and novel mirnas and their targets provides new information on this regulatory process in m. hupehensis, which will contribute to the understanding of mirna functions during growth, phase transition and reproduction in woody fruit trees.
the combination of srna and degradome sequencing can be used to better illustrate the profiling of hormone-regulated mirnas and mirna targets involving complex regulatory networks, which will contribute to the understanding of mirna functions during growth, phase transition and reproductive growth in perennial woody fruit trees.
we also identified  <dig> targets for  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> targets for  <dig> unique novel mirnas using degradome sequencing.
we identified  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas.
a long juvenile period between germination and flowering is a common characteristic among fruit trees, including malus hupehensis  rehd., which is an apple rootstock widely used in china.
