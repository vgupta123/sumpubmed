approximately  <dig> million sequencing reads were generated per embryo and  <dig>  known bovine genes were found to be expressed, with a high correlation of expression levels between samples .
expressed biallelic snp variants with allelic imbalances were observed in  <dig> snp, where one allele represented between 65-95% of a variantâ€™s transcripts.
this technology provides the opportunity to assay the developing embryo, but the paucity of biological material available from individual embryos has made this a challenging prospect.
we report here the first application of rna-seq for the analysis of individual blastocyst gene expression, snp detection, and characterization of allele specific expression .
transcriptomic data was analyzed to identify snp in expressed genes, and individual snp were examined to characterize allele specific expression.
rna was extracted from single bovine blastocysts , amplified, and analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.
this study represents the first application of rna-seq technology in single bovine embryos allowing a representation of the embryonic transcriptome and the analysis of transcript sequence variation to describe specific allele expression.
