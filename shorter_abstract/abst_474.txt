the lncrnas exhibit differential expression profiles across life stages and adult genders.
gambiae and assess the evolutionary conservation of lncrnas and their secondary structures across the anopheles genus.
additionally, we find that lncrna secondary structure is highly conserved within the gambiae complex, but diverges rapidly across the rest of the genus anopheles.
this study offers one of the first lncrna secondary structure analyses in vector insects.
using deep rna sequencing of multiple anopheles gambiae life stages, we have identified  <dig>  lncrnas and more than  <dig> previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes.
we find that across the genus anopheles, lncrnas display much lower sequence conservation than protein-coding genes.
