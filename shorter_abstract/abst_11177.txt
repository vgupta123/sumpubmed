the first entry library represents cloned cdna populations from both short day  and long day  grown plants, while the second library was generated from hormone treated tissues.
high quality cdna libraries that can be readily adapted for multiple downstream purposes are a needed resource.
we describe the creation of two high quality, publicly available gateway™ cdna entry libraries and their derived y2h libraries for brachypodium.
initial proof-of-concept screens demonstrated that a protein with known interaction partners could readily re-isolate those partners, as well as novel interactors.
these entry libraries were then used to create two recombination-derived y2h libraries.
the gateway™ compatible entry libraries created here will facilitate studies for multiple user-defined purposes and the derived y2h libraries can be immediately applied to large scale screening and discovery of novel protein-protein interactions.
both libraries have extensive genome coverage  and average clone lengths of ~ <dig>  kb.
all libraries are freely available for distribution to the research community.
because most of the agriculturally important grass species are difficult to study , developing genetically tractable model systems is essential.
brachypodium distachyon  is an emerging model system for the temperate grasses.
to fully realize the potential of this model system, publicly accessible discovery tools are essential.
accessible community resources are a hallmark of successful biological model systems.
brachypodium has the potential to be a broadly useful model system for the grasses, but still requires many of these resources.
