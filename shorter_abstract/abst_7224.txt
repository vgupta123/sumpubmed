with multiple sequences, mcmc-odpr achieved a lower cost per base covered of  <dig>  than programs batchprimer <dig> and pamps, which achieved  <dig>  and  <dig>  primer nucleotides, respectively.
we have implemented metropolis-hastings markov chain monte carlo for optimizing primer reuse.
we call it the markov chain monte carlo optimized degenerate primer reuse  algorithm.
we aimed to develop a system that would implement primer reuse to design degenerate primers that could be designed around snps, thus find the fewest necessary primers and the lowest cost whilst maintaining an acceptable coverage and provide a cost effective solution.
we compared mcmc-odpr with single sequence primer design programs primer <dig> and primer-blast and achieved a lower primer cost per amplicon base covered of  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  primer nucleotides on three separate gene sequences, respectively.
after repeating the program  <dig> times to assess the variance, an average of  <dig> % fewer primers were found to be necessary using mcmc-odpr for an equivalent coverage without implementing primer reuse.
by combining degeneracy with optimal primer reuse the user may increase coverage of sequences amplified by the designed primers at significantly lower costs.
