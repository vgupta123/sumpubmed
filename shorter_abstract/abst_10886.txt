as expected, our data predict that genes related to the utilisation of less preferred nutrients, such as some carbohydrates, nitrogen sources and aromatic carbon compounds are targets of crc.
finally, some virulence traits such as alginate and rhamnolipid production also appear to be regulated by crc, which links nutritional status cues with the regulation of virulence traits.
in order to predict direct targets of crc, we used a bioinformatics approach based on detection of a-rich motifs near the initiation of translation of all protein-encoding genes in twelve fully sequenced pseudomonas genomes.
catabolite repression control  is an important global control system in pseudomonas that fine tunes metabolism in order optimise growth and metabolism in a range of different environments.
catabolite repression control regulates a broad spectrum of genes in pseudomonas.
the mechanism of crc in pseudomonas spp.
despite the identification of several crc targets in pseudomonas spp.
centres on the binding of a protein, crc, to an a-rich motif on the 5' end of an mrna resulting in translational down-regulation of target genes.
the crc regulon has remained largely unexplored.
further study of these novel targets will enhance our understanding of how pseudomonas bacteria integrate nutritional status cues with the regulation of traits that are of ecological, industrial and clinical importance.
a general trend in this analysis is that the regulation of transporters is conserved across species whereas regulation of specific enzymatic steps or transcriptional activators are often conserved only within a species.
