in the previous two casp experiments, the most successful methods in the function prediction category were those which used structural superpositions of 3d models and related templates with bound ligands in order to identify putative contacting residues.
the software provides a new fully automated approach for structure based function prediction using 3d models of proteins.
the funfold method shows a significant improvement over the best available servers and is shown to be competitive with the top manual prediction groups that were tested at casp <dig>  the funfold method is also competitive with both the top server and manual methods tested at casp <dig>  when tested using common subsets of targets, the predictions from funfold are shown to achieve a significantly higher mean matthews correlation coefficient  scores and binding-site distance test  scores than all server methods that were tested at casp <dig>  testing on the casp <dig> set showed no statistically significant separation in performance between funfold and the other top server groups tested.
the software provided can easily be integrated into existing fold recognition servers, requiring only a 3d model and list of templates as inputs.
the funfold software is freely available as both a standalone package and a prediction server, providing competitive ligand binding site residue predictions for expert and non-expert users alike.
