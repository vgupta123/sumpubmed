we developed a tops++fatcat algorithm that uses an intuitive description of the proteins' structures as captured in the popular tops diagrams to limit the search space of the aligned fragment pairs  in the flexible alignment of protein structures performed by the fatcat algorithm.
such intuitions could help speed up similarity searches and make it easier to understand the results of such analyses.
the benchmark analysis results and the compressed archive of the tops++fatcat program for linux platform can be downloaded from the following web site:
despite the existence of many tools and algorithms, very few of them have managed to capture the intuitive understanding of protein structures developed in structural biology, especially in the context of rapid database searches.
tops++fatcat provides fatcat accuracy and insights into protein structural changes at a speed comparable to sequence alignments, opening up a possibility of interactive protein structure similarity searches.
the tops++fatcat algorithm is faster than fatcat by more than an order of magnitude with a minimal cost in classification and alignment accuracy.
