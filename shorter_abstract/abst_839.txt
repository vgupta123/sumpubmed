a s. gordonii abpa-deficient mutant showed greater biofilm growth under static conditions than wild-type in the presence of sucrose.
interestingly, biofilm formation by every strain was inhibited in the presence of saliva.
the presence of amylase and/or rabpa increased both the sucrase and transferase component activities of s. mutans gtf-b.
the results suggest that an extracellular protein network of abpa-amylase-gtf may influence the ecology of oral biofilms, likely during initial phases of colonization.
the alpha-amylase-binding protein a  of s. gordonii, an early colonizing bacterium in dental plaque, interacts with salivary amylase and may influence dental plaque formation by this organism.
we examined the interaction of amylase and recombinant abpa , together with gtfs of s. gordonii and s. mutans.
the addition of salivary alpha-amylase to culture supernatants of s. gordonii precipitated a protein complex containing amylase, abpa, amylase-binding protein b , and the glucosyltransferase produced by s. gordonii .
purified rabpa, along with purified amylase, interacted with and precipitated gtfs from culture supernatants of both s. gordonii and s. mutans.
glucosyltransferases , enzymes that produce extracellular glucans from dietary sucrose, contribute to dental plaque formation by streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans.
