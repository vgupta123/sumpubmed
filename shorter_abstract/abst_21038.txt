by specifying a locus of interest, chromcontact calculates contact profiles and generates links to the ucsc genome browser, enabling users to visually examine the contact information with various annotations.
hi-c analysis has revealed the three-dimensional architecture of chromosomes in the nucleus.
although hi-c data contains valuable information on long-range interactions of chromosomes, the data is not yet widely utilized by molecular biologists because of the quantity of data.
we developed a web tool, chromcontact, to utilize the information obtained by hi-c. the web tool is designed to be simple and easy to use.
this facilitates the functional interpretation of statistically significant markers identified by gwas or chip-seq peaks that are located far from any annotated genes.
chromcontact provides wide-range of molecular biologists with a user-friendly means to access high-resolution hi-c data.
