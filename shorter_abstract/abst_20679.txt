it had a compartmentalized distribution in the centromeric regions of only two acrocentric chromosomes in karyomorph a. in comparison, in karyomorph d, rex <dig> was found in  <dig> acrocentric chromosomes in females and  <dig> in males.
the fish, erythrinus erythrinus, shows an interpopulation diversity, with four karyomorphs differing by chromosomal number, chromosomal morphology and heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
karyomorph a has a diploid number of 2n =  <dig> and does not have differentiated sex chromosomes.
we detected centric fusions that were associated with the differentiation of the multiple sex chromosomes in karyomorph d, as well as a surprising increase of associated 5s rdna/rex <dig> loci, in contrast to karyomorph a. in this sense, e. erythrinus emerges as an excellent model system for better understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the huge genome diversity in fish.
our results indicate that chromosomal rearrangements and genomic modifications were significant events during the course of evolution of this fish.
we demonstrated that some repetitive dnas n telomeric repeats) were crucial for the evolutionary divergence inside e. erythrinus.
conspicuous differences in the distribution of the 5s rdna and rex <dig> non-ltr retrotransposon were found between the two karyomorphs, while no changes in the heterochromatin and 18s rdna patterns were found between them.
all 5s rdna sites co-localized with rex <dig>  suggesting that these are associated in the genome.
in addition, the origin of the large metacentric y chromosome in karyomorph d by centric fusion was highlighted by the presence of internal telomeric sites and 5s rdna/rex <dig> sites on this chromosome.
karyomorph d has 2n =  <dig> chromosomes in females and 2n =  <dig> in males, and it is most likely derived from karyomorph a by the differentiation of a multiple x1x2y sex chromosome system.
