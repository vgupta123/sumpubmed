myh7b encodes a type ii myosin, consistent with a role for cytoskeletal proteins in hearing.
additionally, a novel region on chromosome  <dig> containing part of the pdxdc <dig> gene was found to be frequently deleted in hearing loss patients .
high-resolution genome-wide cnv analysis of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls revealed deletions in genes known to be involved in hearing , supporting cnv contributions to hearing loss phenotypes.
our study also demonstrates the challenges of exome sequencing and genome-wide cnv mapping for direct clinical application, and illustrates the need for functional and clinical follow-up as well as curated open-access databases.
