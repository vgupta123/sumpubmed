bacterial pathogens often show significant intraspecific variations in ecological fitness, host preference and pathogenic potential to cause infectious disease.
the species of listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of human listeriosis, consists of at least three distinct genetic lineages.
two of these lineages predominantly cause human sporadic and epidemic infections, whereas the third lineage has never been implicated in human disease outbreaks despite its overall conservation of many known virulence factors.
we uncover  <dig> genes and  <dig> small regulatory rnas that likely make l. monocytogenes lineages differ in carbohydrate utilization and stress resistance during their residence in natural habitats and passage through the host gastrointestinal tract.
phylogenomic reconstructions based on  <dig>  homologous groups allowed robust estimation of phylogenetic relatedness among l. monocytogenes strains.
here we compare the genomes of  <dig> l. monocytogenes strains representing the three lineages based on both in silico comparative genomic analysis and high-density, pan-genomic dna array hybridizations.
we also identify  <dig>  to  <dig>  core genes that define this species along with an open pan-genome pool that contains more than  <dig>  genes.
