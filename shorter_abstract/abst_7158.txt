the inference model of atidd5-dependent positive regulation of ss <dig> gene expression was experimentally supported by decreased ss <dig> mrna accumulation in atidd <dig> mutant plants during the light period of both short and long day conditions.
with this inference method, the starch regulatory network of arabidopsis was found to be strongly associated with clock genes and tfs, of which atidd <dig> and col were evidenced to control ss <dig> gene expression and starch granule formation in chloroplasts.
starch serves as a temporal storage of carbohydrates in plant leaves during day/night cycles.
in this study, we utilized a systematic approach of microarray analysis to discover the transcriptional regulatory network of starch metabolism in arabidopsis leaves.
a starch-clock-tf gene regulation network comprising  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges was constructed by ggm from these  <dig> significant genes that are potentially related to the diurnal control of starch metabolism.
the robustness of gene-to-gene regulatory network was further analyzed by tf binding site prediction and by evaluating global co-expression of tfs and target starch metabolic enzymes.
time-series significant analysis was applied for arabidopsis leaf transcriptome data to obtain a set of genes that are highly regulated under a diurnal cycle.
furthermore, the knockout of atidd <dig> and col led to deformation of chloroplast and its contained starch granules.
this deformity also affected the number of starch granules per chloroplast, which increased significantly in both knockout mutant lines.
from this network, we found that Î²-amylase  <dig> , which participates in starch degradation in chloroplast, is the most frequently connected gene .
