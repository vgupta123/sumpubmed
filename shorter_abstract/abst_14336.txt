the generated conjugate, based on the supercharged enzyme, was feasible as a reporter molecule in a sandwich elisa and allowed the detection of epidermal growth factor with a detection limit of  <dig>  pg .
a highly soluble, supercharged variant of the enzyme human enteropeptidase light chain was created by a site-directed mutagenesis of surface amino acids, used for the production of an antibody-enzyme conjugate and compared to the wild type enzyme.
wild type and mutant enzyme could successfully be cross-coupled to an antibody to give antibody-enzyme conjugates suitable for elisa.
the highly soluble, surface supercharged, human enteropeptidase light chain mutant provided better yields in coupling the enzyme to an antibody than the wild type.

the data suggest that supercharging can be applied favourably to other proteins which have to be covalently linked to other polymers or surfaces with high yields without losses in enzyme activity or specificity.
protein cross-coupling reactions demand high yields, especially if the products are intended for bioanalytics, like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
