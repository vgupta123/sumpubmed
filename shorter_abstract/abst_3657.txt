using the pentapeptide as a unit of length, we find that in the universal proteome many pentapeptides are heavily repeated , whereas some are quite rare, and a small number do not appear at all.
in addition, we explore residue bulkiness, hydrophobicity, and codon number as factors able to modulate specific peptide frequencies.
then, the possible influence of amino acid composition is investigated in zero- and high-frequency pentapeptide sets by analysing the frequencies of the corresponding inverse-sequence pentapeptides.
to understand the physico-chemical-biological basis underlying peptide usage at the proteomic level, in this study we analyse the energetic costs for the synthesis of rare and never-expressed versus frequent pentapeptides.
we find that only dna context-dependent constraints  provide a coherent mechanistic platform to explain the occurrence of never-expressed versus frequent pentapeptides in the protein world.
