various properties have been studied in a search for the molecular basis of protein adaptation to higher growth temperature.
an exception is increased burial of alanine and proline residues and decreased burial of phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine and tryptophan in hyperthermophile proteins compared to those from mesophiles.
since an increase in the number of charged groups for hyperthermophile proteins is separable from charged group contribution to folded state stability, we hypothesise that charged group propensity is important in the context of protein solubility and the prevention of aggregation.
accordingly we find some separation between mesophile and hyperthermophile proteins when looking at the largest surface patch that does not contain a charged sidechain.
with regard to our observation that aromatic sidechains are less buried in hyperthermophile proteins, further analysis indicates that the placement of some of these groups may facilitate the reduction of folding fluctuations in proteins of the higher growth temperature organisms.
a dataset of  <dig> thermophile-derived protein structures is compared with mesophile proteins.
relative propensities of charged groups vary, such as the substitution of glutamic for aspartic acid sidechains.
most other properties studied show weak or insignificant separation of proteins from moderate thermophiles or hyperthermophiles and mesophiles, including an estimate of the difference in sidechain rotameric entropy upon protein folding.
