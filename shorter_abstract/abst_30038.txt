our results showed that  this promoter fragment is a powerful activator of the reporter gene in hela cell line,  the region spanning  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site exhibits maximal level of transcriptional activity,  progressive deletions from - <dig> gradually reduce reporter expression.
in addition, our usf <dig> and usf <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that these transcription factors bind the p <dig> promoter in vivo.
our results suggest that usf factors positively regulate the core of p <dig> promoter, and, together with our previously data, we can conclude that both sp and usf dna interaction and transcription activity are involved in the p <dig> promoter dependent expression of aah and humbug.
in the present study, we extended the functional characterization of the p <dig> promoter of the aβh-j-j locus.
alternative splicing of the locus aβh-j-j generates functionally distinct proteins: the enzyme aspartyl  β-hydroxylase , truncated homologs of aah with a role in calcium homeostasis humbug and junctate and a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes junctin.
the region responsible for maximal transcription contains an e-box site; we characterized the molecular interactions between usf1/ <dig> with this e-box element by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift analysis.
to investigate the transcription mechanism we transiently transfected hela cells with sequentially deleted reporter constructs containing different regions of the -661/+ <dig> p <dig> nucleotide sequence.
we previously demonstrated that sp transcription factors positively regulate the p <dig> promoter.
a functional role of usf1/usf <dig> in upregulating p1-directed transcription was demonstrated by analysis of the effects of  in vitro mutagenesis of the p1/e-box binding site,  rna interference targeting usf <dig> transcripts.
