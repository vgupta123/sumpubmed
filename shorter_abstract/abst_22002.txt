both proteomic data and gsea results further reveal distinct ubiquitin-mediated protein regulation in the two culture conditions.
genomic and proteomic data of hcc cells in different culture models, coupled to pathway-based analysis, can help identify hcc-related gene and pathway dysfunctions.
analysis was based on gene and protein expression data measured on a human hcc cell line  in two culture conditions: dynamic microfluidic biochips and static petri dishes.
pathways analysis, using gene and protein expression data from two cell culture models, confirmed specific human hcc phenotypes with regard to cyps and kinases, and revealed a zonation-related pattern of expression.
altogether, our results suggest that strategies aimed at inhibiting activated kinases and signaling pathways may lead to enhanced metabolism-mediated drug resistance of treated tumors.
there is currently no effective systemic chemotherapy for human hepatocellular carcinoma  and its pathogenesis is of special interest.
that, together with analysis of the published literature, leads us to propose that biochips culture conditions induce a periportal-like hepatocyte phenotype while standard plates cultures are more representative of a perivenous-like phenotype.
metabolic activity  and genetic information processing were dominant in the dynamic cultures, in contrast to kinase signaling and cancer-specific profiles in static cultures.
