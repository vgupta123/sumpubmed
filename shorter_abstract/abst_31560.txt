the testis-specific isoform pfn <dig> showed major hallmarks of the well characterized "somatic" profilin isoforms, albeit with distinct binding affinities.
multiple profilin isoforms exist in mammals; at least four are expressed in the mammalian testis.
the testis-specific isoforms profilin- <dig>  and profilin- <dig>  may have specialized roles in spermatogenic cells which are distinct from known functions fulfilled by the "somatic" profilins, profilin- <dig>  and profilin- <dig> .
immunofluorescence microscopy of pfn <dig> and pfn <dig> revealed distinct subcellular locations in differentiating spermatids.
pfn <dig>  in comparison, has lost both, polyproline and actin binding sites completely, which is well in line with the experimental data.
Î²-actin, phosphoinositides, poly-l-proline and mdia <dig>  but not vasp, were confirmed as in vitro interaction partners of pfn <dig>  in parallel experiments, pfn <dig> bound to selected phosphoinositides but not to poly-l-proline, proline-rich proteins, or actin.
