we attempted to fully activate the hh pathway by removing both receptors for the hh proteins, called patched <dig> and  <dig>  which are functioning as negative regulators in this pathway.
here we describe a splice-donor mutation in ptc <dig>  called ptc1hu <dig>  which in a homozygous state results in a subtle eye and somite phenotype.
additionally, these mutants will provide a useful system to further investigate the consequences of constitutively activated hh signaling during vertebrate development.
furthermore, a novel negative function of hh signaling is observed in the induction of the fin field, acting well before any of the previously reported function of shh in fin formation and in a way that is different from the proposed early role of gli <dig> in limb/fin bud patterning.
