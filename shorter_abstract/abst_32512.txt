the occurrence and location of histopathological changes and immunohistochemical  labelling for rabies in formalin fixed paraffin embedded  canine brain is described in samples from  <dig> rabies suspect cases from sri-lanka.
histopathological examination of the brain is essential to define the differential diagnoses of behaviour modifying conditions in rabies virus negative cases, but it is unreliable as the sole method for rabies diagnosis, particularly where artefactual change has occurred.
in  <dig> cases, a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction  testing for rabies virus rna was undertaken by extracting rna from fresh frozen tissue, and also attempted using ffpe samples.
the preservation of fresh tissue however can be difficult under field conditions and formalin fixation provides a simple alternative that may allow a confirmatory diagnosis.
although tissue degradation had no effect on ihc diagnosis, it was associated with an inability to detect negri bodies.
the pcr method from ffpe tissues was suitable for control material but unsuccessful in our field cases.
the effect of autolysis and artefactual degeneration of the tissue was also assessed.
formalin fixation and paraffin embedding does not prevent detection of rabies virus via ihc labelling even where artefactual degeneration has occurred.
the recommended screening of rabies in ‘suspect’ animal cases involves testing fresh brain tissue.
negri bodies were observed in  <dig> of  <dig>  of the positive cases.
the brain stem was shown to be the site with most viral immunoreactivity; supporting recommended sampling protocols in favour of improved necropsy safety in the field.
this could represent a pragmatic secondary assay for rabies diagnosis in the field because formalin fixation can prevent sample degeneration.
the presence of negri bodies and immunohistochemical detection of rabies virus antigen were evaluated in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem.
pcr detection using fresh frozen samples was in agreement with the ihc results.
