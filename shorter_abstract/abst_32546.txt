the behavior of these bacteria was compared to that of the well-known opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  we found that p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> are cytotoxic towards caco-2/tc <dig> cells, have low invasive capacity, induce secretion of human Î²-defensin  <dig> , alter the epithelial permeability of differentiated cells and damage the f-actin cytoskeleton.
these data bring new insights into p. mosselii virulence, since this bacterium has often been neglected due to its rare occurrence in hospital.
the best characterized bacterium is pseudomonas aeruginosa which is the primary agent of opportunistic infection in humans, causing both acute and chronic infections.
the genus pseudomonas includes a heterogeneous set of microorganisms that can be isolated from many different niches and nearly  <dig> different strains have been described.
