since free hydroxycholesterols are the biologically active form of these sterols, separating free from esterfied forms may provide a sensitive measure to identify disease-associated differences in brain sterol metabolism.
serum measurements of these biologically active oxysterols may be useful surrogate measures for brain health in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.
cholesterol metabolism is important for the maintenance of myelin and neuronal membranes in the central nervous system.
