a broad range of behaviors including vocalizations, locomotion, vigilance and flight distance, as well as the cortisol response to handling, were collected.
the results of this study using ovine snp data suggest that in domestic sheep the behavioral responses to social separation and exposure to humans are under polygenic influence.
qtl detection was performed by linkage, association and joint linkage and association analyses using the qtlmap software.
the most relevant qtls reported in the present study contain interesting candidate genes previously described to be associated with various emotional and social behaviors in mammals.
after weaning, all the lambs were individually exposed to  <dig> standardized behavioral tests combining social isolation, exposure to humans or handling, confinement and novelty .
no overlapping qtls were identified for the different traits measured in the behavioral tests, supporting the hypothesis that different genetic factors influence social reactivity and tolerance to humans.
the qtls on oar <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed significant associations with social reactivity.
five main qtl regions were identified on sheep chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> among many other qtls with small to moderate effects.
social reactivity and reactivity to humans are relevant behavioral traits in sheep, known for their strong gregariousness and weak tolerance to handling, which have previously been reported with moderate to high heritabilities.
the experiment was carried out on  <dig> male and female lambs allocated into  <dig> half-sib families  and reared outside.
to identify loci underlying such behaviors, we performed a genome study in romane lambs.
