after photoactivation, the ps produces either singlet oxygen or other reactive oxygen species  that primarily react with the pathogen cell wall, promoting permeabilization of the membrane and cell death.
we employed the invertebrate wax moth galleria mellonella as an in vivo model to study the effects of apdt against c. albicans infection.
we verified that methylene blue-mediated apdt prolonged the survival of c. albicans infected g. mellonella larvae.
a fluconazole-resistant c. albicans strain was used to test the combination of apdt and fluconazole.
the effects of apdt combined with conventional antifungal drugs were also evaluated in g. mellonella.
the fungal burden of g. mellonella hemolymph was reduced after apdt in infected larvae.
g. mellonella is a useful in vivo model to evaluate apdt as a treatment regimen for candida infections.
our study explores treatment with photodynamic therapy  as an innovative antimicrobial technology that employs a nontoxic dye, termed a photosensitizer , followed by irradiation with harmless visible light.
the data suggests that combined apdt and antifungal therapy could be an alternative approach to antifungal-resistant candida strains.
the emergence of antifungal-resistant candida strains has motivated the study of antimicrobial pdt  as an alternative treatment of these infections.
