fifty-two apoptosis-related candidate genes were identified, including five caspase family members, two tumor necrosis factor  superfamily members, one bcl- <dig> family member, four baculovirus iap  repeat  domain family members and  <dig> rhg  family member.
these results lay the foundation for further apoptosis-related study in bombyx mori.
herein we have identified apoptosis-related genes in the silkworm bombyx mori and compared them to those from insects, mammals, and nematodes.
from the newly assembled genome databases, a genome-wide analysis of apoptosis-related genes in bombyx mori was performed using both nucleotide and protein blast searches.
bombyx mori possesses potential apoptosis-related genes.
we hypothesized that the classic intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways potentially are active in bombyx mori.
apoptosis is regulated in an orderly fashion by a series of genes, and has a crucial role in important physiological processes such as growth development, immunological response and so on.
moreover, we identified a new caspase family member, bmcaspase-new, two splice variants of bmdronc, and bm <dig>  a mammalian tnf superfamily member homolog.
twenty-three of these apoptosis-related genes were cloned and sequenced using cdna templates isolated from bme-swu <dig> cells.
recently, substantial studies have been undertaken on apoptosis in model animals including humans, fruit flies, and the nematode.
