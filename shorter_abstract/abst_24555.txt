our results demonstrated that the recombinant proteins of pathogenesis-related protein  <dig>  and thioredoxin m-type, chloroplastic precursor  showed the significant inhibition on the development of larvae and pupae.
however, little is known about the mechanism of plant defense against herbivore attack at a protein level.
the expressed proteins were used to feed ostrinia furnacalis, the asian corn borer .
the expression levels of four important genes were determined by qrt-pcr analysis.
jasmonic acid  and methyl jasmonate  regulate plant development, resistance to stress, and insect attack by inducing specific gene expression.

we found meja could not only induce plant defense mechanisms to insects, it also enhanced toxic protein production that potentially can be used for bio-control of acb.
the expression levels of these proteins did not correlate well with their translation levels.
we also found eight proteins uniquely expressed in response to meja treatment.
