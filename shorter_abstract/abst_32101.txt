sexual dimorphism in brain gene expression has been recognized in several animal species.
genes located on sex chromosomes were consistently over-represented in all brain regions.
at the same time, sexually dimorphic gene expression that is common to several parts of the brain is mostly restricted to the sex chromosomes.
to investigate whether sex-biased gene expression in mammalian brain is globally regulated or locally regulated in diverse brain structures, and to study the genomic organisation of brain-expressed sex-biased genes, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of distinct brain regions in adult male and female mice.
this study demonstrated that the amount of genes with sex-biased expression varies between individual brain regions in mouse.
moreover, rna-dna combined fish experiments confirmed the biallelic expression of one such novel domain.
in addition, we identified novel coding and non-coding x-linked genes with female-biased expression in multiple tissues.
this study revealed spatial specificity in sex-biased transcription in the mouse brain, and identified  <dig> sex-biased genes in the striatum;  <dig> in the neocortex;  <dig> in the hippocampus and  <dig> in the eye.
this raises the possibility that expression of long non-coding rnas may play a role in modulating gene expression in domains that escape x-inactivation in mouse.
