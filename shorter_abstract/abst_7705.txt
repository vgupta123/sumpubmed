nearly half of the probesets in common between the two array types can produce slightly different values from the same sample.
nearly 70% of the individual probes in these probesets produced array specific differences.
at a minimum, this should add an extra level of caution when considering the direct comparison of experiments performed in two microarray formats.
there are many potential sources of variability in a microarray experiment.
more importantly, this suggests that it may not be possible to know which value is the most accurate representation of a biological sample when comparing two formats.
variation can arise from many aspects of the collection and processing of samples for gene expression analysis.
the context of the probe may also contribute some bias to the final measured value of gene expression.
