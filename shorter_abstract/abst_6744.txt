four distinct patterns were observed in srna mapping, the most unusual of which was that of ale <dig>  with very large numbers of 24nt srnas in the coding region.
sixty complete ltr-rt elements were classified into  <dig> families within four copia and three gypsy lineages.
for instance, these transposable elements may affect nearby genes by generating a diverse set of small rna's that trigger gene silencing mechanisms.
modern cultivars have polyploid, large complex genomes, with highly unequal contributions from ancestral genomes.
there is also some evidence that ancestral genomes contribute significantly different element numbers from particular ltr-rt lineages to the modern sugarcane cultivar genome.
the results presented support the conclusion that distinct small rna-regulated pathways in sugarcane target the lineages of ltr-rt elements.
our results indicate that in sugarcane individual ltr-rt families have distinct behaviors and can potentially impact the genome in diverse ways.
sugarcane is an important crop worldwide for sugar production and increasingly, as a renewable energy source.
fish analysis resulted in the expected pattern of gypsy/heterochromatin, copia/euchromatin, but in two lineages there was localized clustering on some chromosomes.
long terminal repeat retrotransposons  are the single largest components of most plant genomes and can substantially impact the genome in many ways.
individual ltr-rt sugarcane families have distinct structures, and transcriptional and regulatory signatures.
