it suggests that pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially against solid tumors, and with a single cytotoxic pathway of pro and mst- <dig> affecting chromosome segregation and leading also to cell g2/ m phase arrests, which finally reduces cell division rates.
cytotoxic activities and mechanisms of raz -steroisomer , pro and mst- <dig> against tumor cells were evaluated by mtt colorimetry, flow cytometry and karyotyping.
time-response studies showed that the cytotoxic effects of pro are increased for  <dig> days in human tumor cells, whereas vcr, dox and 5-fu showed decreased cytotoxic action after  <dig> h. cell cycle g2/m phase arrest and chromosome segregation blocking by pro and mst- <dig> were noted.
although there was similar effects of pro and mst- <dig> on chromosome segregation blocking action and cell cycle g2/m phase arrest at 1-  <dig> μm, cytotoxicity of pro against tumor cells was higher than that of mst- <dig> in vitro by a factor of 3-  <dig> folds.
high dose- and time- responses of pro, when compared with vcr, 5-fu and dox, were seen that suggest a selectivity of pro against tumor growth.
compounds of bisdioxopiperazines family may keep up their cytotoxic effects longer than many other anticancer drugs.
pro was cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines in vitro .
four human tumor cell lines  were susceptible to pro at low inhibitory concentrations .
our data show that pro may be more effective against lung cancer and leukemia while icrf- <dig> and mst- <dig> shows similar ic <dig> values only against leukemia.
