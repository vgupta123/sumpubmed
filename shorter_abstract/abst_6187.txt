these are pls <dig>  which is required for pathogenicity of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes, magnaporthe grisea, botrytis cinerea and colletotrichum lindemuthianum, and tsp <dig>  whose function is unknown.
the next challenge will be to decipher the role of tetraspanins in a range of symbiotic, saprophytic and human pathogenic fungi.
phenotypic analysis of gene replacementmutants Δtsp <dig> and Δtpl <dig> of m. grisea revealed a reduction of the pathogenicity only on rice, in contrast to Δpls <dig> mutants, which are completely non-pathogenic on barley and rice.
functional analysis by gene replacement showed that these proteins, as well as pls <dig>  are involved in the infection process of the plant pathogenic fungus m. grisea.
the exhaustive search for tetraspanins in fungal genomes reveals that higher fungi  contain three families of tetraspanins  with different distribution amongst phyla.
in this report, we describe a third family of tetraspanins  and a new family of tetraspanin-like proteins  in fungi.
we also describe expression of some of these genes in m. grisea and a basidiomycete, laccaria bicolor, and also their functional analysis in m. grisea.
transcriptional analyses in various tissues of l. bicolor and m. grisea showed that pls <dig> and tsp <dig> are expressed in all tissues in l. bicolor and that tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> are overexpressed in the sexual fruiting bodies  and mycelia of m. grisea, suggesting that these genes are not pseudogenes.
a tetraspanin-like family  was also identified in ascomycetes.
a unique copy of each of pls <dig> and tsp <dig> was found in ascomycetes in contrast to tsp <dig>  which has several paralogs in the basidiomycetes, coprinus cinereus and laccaria bicolor.
a new tetraspanin family  and a tetraspanin-like protein family  have been identified in fungi.
