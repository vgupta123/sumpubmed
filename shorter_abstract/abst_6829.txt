dpni digestion of the reaction mixture is used to eliminate template copies before amplification in e. coli; however, this process is inefficient resulting in un-mutated clones which can only be distinguished from mutant clones by sequencing.
sdm-assist also scores the primers based on factors such as tm, gc content and secondary structure allowing for simplified selection of optimal primer pairs.
we have developed a program – ‘sdm-assist’ which creates sdm primers adding a specific identifier: through additional silent mutations a restriction site is included or a previous one removed which allows for highly efficient identification of ‘mutated clones’ by a simple restriction digest.
in principle, sdm uses modified primer pairs in a pcr reaction to introduce a mutation in a cdna insert.
