the results show that our haplotype-based approach is more robust than two statistical methods based on single markers: a single snp association test  and the mann-whitney u-test .
with the availability of large-scale, high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers, substantial effort has been made in identifying disease-causing genes using linkage disequilibrium  mapping by haplotype analysis of unrelated individuals.
in addition to complex diseases, many continuously distributed quantitative traits are of primary clinical and health significance.
however the development of association mapping methods using unrelated individuals for quantitative traits has received relatively less attention.
its effectiveness further depends on other factors such as recombination rates and the density of typed snps.
the method is non-parametric in nature, and statistical significance can be obtained by a permutation test.
the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by extensive experimental studies using both simulated and real data sets.
we recently developed an association mapping method for complex diseases by mining the sharing of haplotype segments  in affected individuals that are rarely present in normal individuals.
in this paper, we extend our previous work to address the problem of quantitative trait mapping from unrelated individuals.
haplotype-based methods might provide higher power than methods based on a single snp when using tag snps selected from a small number of samples or some other sources .
