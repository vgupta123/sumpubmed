here the goal is to determine whether the performance of the c-h plot in separating structured and disordered proteins can be improved by using an alternative hydropathy scale.
using the performance of the ch-plot as the metric, we compared  <dig> alternative hydropathy scales, with the finding that the guy  hydropathy scale ) was the best of the tested hydropathy scales for separating large collections structured proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins  on the c-h plot.
applying the c-h plot to a dataset containing  <dig> idps and  <dig> non-homologous fully structured proteins, the kyte-doolittle  hydropathy scale, the guy  hydropathy scale, and the idp-hydropathy scale gave balanced two-state classification accuracies of 79%, 84%, and 90%, respectively, indicating a very substantial overall improvement is obtained by using different hydropathy scales.
a correlation study shows that idp-hydropathy is strongly correlated with other hydropathy scales, thus suggesting that idp-hydropathy probably has only minor contributions from amino acid properties other than hydropathy.
next, we developed a new scale, named idp-hydropathy, which further improves the discrimination between structured proteins and idps.
