even though cellular components of the innate immune response, such as dendritic cells, represent the first line of defense against invading pathogens, little is known about the interaction of these cells with invading c. parapsilosis.
candida parapsilosis typically is a commensal of human skin.
in addition, the lipase deficient c. parapsilosis cells induce higher gene expression and protein secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both dc types relative to the effect of co-culture with wild type yeast cells.
monocyte-derived immature and mature dendritic cells  co-cultured with live wild type or lipase deficient c. parapsilosis strains were studied to determine the phagocytic capacity and killing efficiency of host cells.
moreover, these data strongly suggest that c. parapsilosis derived lipase has a protective role during yeast:dc interactions, since lipase production in wt yeast cells decreased the phagocytic capacity and killing efficiency of host cells and downregulated the expression of host effector molecules.
thus, the aim of our study was to assess the function of dendritic cells in fighting c. parapsilosis and to determine the role that c. parapsilosis-derived lipase plays in the interaction with dendritic cells.
we determined that both idcs and mdcs efficiently phagocytosed and killed c. parapsilosis, furthermore our results show that the phagocytic and fungicidal activities of both idcs and mdcs are more potent for lipase deficient compared to wild type yeast cells.
our results show that dcs are activated by exposure to c. parapsilosis, as shown by increased phagocytosis, killing and proinflammatory protein secretion.
however, when host immune defense is compromised or the normal microflora balance is disrupted, c. parapsilosis transforms itself into an opportunistic pathogen.
