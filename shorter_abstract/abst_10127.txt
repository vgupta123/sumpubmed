unlike ma, forced swim reduced creatine in the cerebellum with no change in other brain regions while plasma creatinine was decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> h. glucose in plasma was decreased at  <dig> h.
in this experiment, the effects of a neurotoxic regimen of -ma  on brain monoamines, neostriatal gfap, plasma corticosterone, creatinine, and glucose, and brain and muscle creatine were evaluated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after the first dose.
neostriatal and hippocampal monoamines were decreased at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h, with a concurrent increase in gfap at  <dig> h. there was no effect of ma on regional brain creatine, however plasma creatinine was increased during the first  <dig> h and decreased by  <dig> h. as with ma treatment, forced swim increased corticosterone more than ma initially.
in order to compare ma's effects with stress, animals were subjected to a forced swim test in a temporal pattern similar to ma administration .
