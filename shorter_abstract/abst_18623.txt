recently, two comprehensive assemblies of cotton ests were constructed based on three gossypium species.
synthetic oligonucleotide probes were generated from exemplar sequences of a global assembly of  <dig>  cotton ests derived from > <dig> different cdna libraries representing many different tissue types and tissue treatments.
because many oligonucleotides were based on ests from fiber-specific cdna libraries, the microarray has direct application for analysis of the fiber transcriptome.
the cotton oligonucleotide microarray provides a reproducible platform for transcription profiling in cotton, and is made publicly available through http://cottonevolution.info.
to illustrate the utility of the microarray, we hybridized labeled bud and leaf cdnas from g. hirsutum and demonstrate technical consistency of results.
a total of  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes are included on the arrays, optimized to target the diversity of the transcriptome and previously studied cotton genes, transcription factors, and genes with homology to arabidopsis.
