as a non-trivial test case, the phosphate regulatory network of enterobacteria was reconstructed using in silico-generated time-series data sets on wild-type and in silico mutants.
we have previously reported a mathematical method which is exclusively data-driven, does not involve any heuristic decisions within the reconstruction process, and deliveres all possible alternative minimal networks in terms of simple place/transition petri nets that are consistent with a given discrete time series data set.
the new exact algorithm reconstructs extended petri nets from time series data sets by finding all alternative minimal networks that are consistent with the data.
the results of the reconstruction algorithm are encoded in the form of an extended petri net involving control arcs.
network inference methods reconstruct mathematical models of molecular or genetic networks directly from experimental data sets.
the algorithm is useful to combine data from wild-type and mutant cells and may potentially integrate physiological, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic data in the form of a single model.
it suggested alternative molecular mechanisms for certain reactions in the network.
