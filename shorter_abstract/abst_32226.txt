the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  mediates gene expression in response to numerous growth factors and cytokines, playing an important role in many cellular processes.
deletion of stat <dig> from type ii epithelial cells altered the expression of genes regulating diverse cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis and lipid metabolism.
pathway analysis indicates that stat <dig> regulates cellular homeostasis through a complex regulatory network that likely enhances alveolar epithelial cell survival and surfactant/lipid synthesis, necessary for the protection of the lung during injury.
deletion of stat <dig> induced genes influencing protein metabolism, transport, chemotaxis and apoptosis and decreased the expression of genes mediating lipid synthesis and metabolism.
differentially expressed genes were identified from affymetrix murine genechips analysis and subjected to gene ontology classification, promoter analysis, pathway mapping and literature mining.
expression of srebf <dig> and  <dig>  genes encoding key regulators of fatty acid and steroid biosynthesis, was decreased in type ii cells from the stat3Δ/Δ mice, consistent with the observation that lung surfactant phospholipids content was decreased.
akt, a potential transcriptional target of stat <dig>  was identified as an important participant in stat <dig> mediated pathways including jak-stat signaling, apoptosis, mapk signaling, cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis.
stat <dig> influenced both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways that determine cell death or survival.
to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which stat <dig> influences gene expression in the lung, the effect of pulmonary epithelial cell specific deletion of stat <dig> on genome wide mrna expression profiling was assessed.
