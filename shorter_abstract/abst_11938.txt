this sequence, fueled by turnover events, provides a strong case for exaptation in regulatory elements.
we compared transcription factor occupied segments  for  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse tfs in  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse cell types and tissues from the human and the mouse encode projects.
our analysis shows that tfos are under evolutionary constraint, but a substantial portion  of the tfos does not have a homologous sequence on the other species; this portion varies among cell types and tfs.
we mapped regulatory sequences from an extensive number of tfs and cell types between human and mouse using wga.
a comparative analysis of this correspondence unveiled the extent of the shared regulatory sequence across tfs and cell types under study.
despite tfos repurposing, we did not find substantial changes in their predicted target genes, suggesting that crms buffer evolutionary events allowing little or no change in the tfos – target gene associations.
however,  <dig> % and  <dig> % is repurposed such that it binds the same tf in different cells or different tfs in the same cells.
these events suggest exaptation of some functional regulatory sequences into new function.
importantly, a large part of the shared regulatory sequence is repurposed on the other species.

we based the map between human and mouse tfos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper, bnmapper, that utilizes whole genome alignments .
