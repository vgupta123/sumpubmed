the presence and activity of the er within the phylum rotifera indicates that the er structure and function is highly conserved throughout animal evolution.
we have used a suite of computational, biochemical and biological techniques to determine that the rotifer er binding site is not occluded and can bind human estradiol.
our results demonstrate that this mammalian hormone receptor plays a key role in reproduction of the ancient microinvertebrate brachinous manjavacas.
though rotifers are phylogenetically distant from humans, and have specialized reproductive physiology, this work identifies a surprising conservation in the control of reproduction between humans and rotifers through the estrogen receptor.

in this paper, we show that a ligand-activated estrogen-like receptor in rotifers binds human estradiol and regulates reproductive output in females.
