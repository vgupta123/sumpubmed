however, differentiation of the tiny chromosomes of switchgrass  and creation of a standard karyotype for this bioenergy crop has not been accomplished due to lack of distinguishing features and polyploidy.
differences observed at the 5s rdna loci between the upland and lowland ecotypes of switchgrass provided a basis for distinguishing these subpopulations.
furthermore, the karyotype structure and cytogenetic analysis of switchgrass provides a framework for future genetic and genomic studies.
collectively, these results provide a quantitative karyotype of switchgrass chromosomes.
size differences, condensation patterns, and arm-length ratios were used as identifying features and fluorescence in-situ hybridization  assigned 5s and 45s rdna loci to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.
both a maize centc and a native switchgrass centromeric repeat  that shared 73% sequence identity demonstrated a strong signal on chromosome  <dig>  however, only the pvicentc probe labeled the centromeres of all chromosomes.
fish analyses indicate genetic divergence between subgenomes and allow for the classification of switchgrass plants belonging to divergent genetic pools.
