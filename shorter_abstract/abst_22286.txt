major changes in the pac sequences are either tolerated or ameliorated by suppressor mutations in the rna sequence.
in this paper the boundaries of the Φ <dig> pac sequences have been explored by testing the in vivo packaging efficacy of transcripts containing deletions or changes in the rna sequences.
the pac sequences have been localized to the 5' untranslated regions of the viral transcripts.
Φ <dig> is a bacteriophage containing a genome of three segments of double-stranded rna inside a polyhedral capsid enveloped in a lipid-containing membrane.
unique sequences  near the 5' ends of plus strands are necessary and sufficient for Φ <dig> genomic packaging and the rna binding sites are located on p <dig>  the major structural protein of the procapsid.
changes in the genomic packaging program can be established as a result of mutations in p <dig>  the major structural protein of the procapsid and the determinant of rna binding specificity.
