the results of the comparison can be examined through detailed mass quantification tables, while chromatogram compound statistics are also calculated during the procedure.
visualization of large data sets produced from lc-ms, namely the chromatogram and the mass spectra that correspond to its compounds is the focus of this work.
the in-house developed 'brukin2d' software, built in matlab  <dig> , which is presented here, uses the compound data that are exported from the bruker 'dataanalysis' program, and depicts the mean mass spectra of all the chromatogram compounds from one lc-ms run, in one 2d contour/density plot.
two contour plots from different chromatograph runs can then be viewed in the same window and automatically compared, in order to find their similarities and differences.
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  is a commonly used technique to resolve complex protein mixtures.
