pcr amplification of βtub and roda fragments resulted in a distinctive electrophoretic pattern in a. fumigatus and n. udagawae.
a multiplex pcr was developed using prior information based on β-tubulin  and rodlet a  partial gene sequences.

new fungal species that are morphologically similar to aspergillus fumigatus were recently described and included in section fumigati.
the assay described in the present study proved to be specific and highly reproducible, representing a fast and economic way of targeting molecular identification of the relevant mould, a. fumigatus, in clinical laboratories.
misidentification of such fungal species, particularly of the human pathogens, aspergillus lentulus, neosartorya fischeri, neosartorya hiratsukae, neosartorya pseudofischeri and neosartorya udagawae, has been increasingly reported by numerous clinical labs.
a more limited number of sequences were available for roda; nevertheless, we were able to distinguish aspergillus viridinutans, n. hiratsukae and n. udagawae.
the purpose of the present study was to develop a rapid method for the molecular identification of a. fumigatus to distinguish it from other species within the section fumigati.
nevertheless, a. fumigatus still accounts for more than 90% of all invasive aspergillosis cases.
