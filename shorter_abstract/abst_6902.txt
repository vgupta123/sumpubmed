based on our dataset encompassing expression in  <dig> different murine tissues, we identified  <dig> genes with predicted 3'utr extensions.
since affymetrix 3' expression arrays were designed based on expressed sequence tags, many probesets map to intergenic regions downstream of genes.
these extensions have a similar conservation as known 3'utrs, which is distinctly higher than intergenic regions.
we show that many genes have 3'utr regions extending beyond currently known gene regions and provide a method to identify such regions based on microarray expression data.
since 3' utr contain microrna binding sites and other stability determining regions, identification of the full length 3' utr is important to elucidate posttranscriptional regulation.
