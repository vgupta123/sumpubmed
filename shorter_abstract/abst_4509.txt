among these markers, its <dig> was the most useful in terms of universality, sequence variation, and identification capability in the asteraceae family.
its <dig> is the best dna barcode for the asteraceae family.
studies evaluating these regions for species identification in the large plant taxon, which includes a large number of closely related species, have rarely been reported.
this approach significantly broadens the application of dna barcoding to resolve classification problems in the family asteraceae at the genera and species levels.
five dna regions, namely, rbcl, matk, its, its <dig>  and psba-trnh, have been recommended as primary dna barcodes for plants.
