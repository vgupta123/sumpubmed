the position, shape, and size of the starch granules are the main measurements for quantitative analysis.
in order to obtain these measurements, segmentation of starch granules from the background is very important.
however, automatic segmentation of starch granules is still a challenging task because of the limitation of imaging condition and the complex scenarios of overlapping granules.
we propose a novel method to segment starch granules in microscopic images.
in the proposed method, we first separate starch granules from background using automatic thresholding and then roughly segment the image using watershed algorithm.
we present a new scheme for starch granules segmentation.
we use the shape information and critical points of gradient vector flow  of starch granules to identify oversegments, and use fuzzy c-mean clustering based on prior knowledge to merge these oversegments to the objects.
in order to reduce the oversegmentation in watershed algorithm, we use the roundness of each segment, and analyze the gradient vector field to find the critical points so as to identify oversegments.
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can alleviate oversegmentation of watershed segmentation algorithm successfully.
experimental results on twenty microscopic starch images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

after oversegments are found, we extract the features, such as the position and intensity of the oversegments, and use fuzzy c-means clustering to merge the oversegments to the objects with similar features.
