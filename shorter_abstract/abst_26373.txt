the mutational pressure hypothesis is that different co-factors bind to rna pol ii at different phases of transcription, producing different mutational regimes.
the adaptive hypothesis is that cytidine triphosphate deficiency may lead to c-avoidance at the 3' ends of transcripts to control the flow of rna pol ii molecules and reduce their frequency of collisions.
this pattern influences the encoded proteins by generating differential usage of amino acids at the 5' and 3' ends of genes.
we propose two explanations, the mutational pressure hypothesis, and the adaptive hypothesis.
we show a consistent and highly significant pattern of gc-skew within genes of almost all unicellular fungi.
these biases also affect fourfold-degenerate positions and extend into promoters and 3' utrs, indicating that skews cannot be accounted by selection for protein function or translation.
