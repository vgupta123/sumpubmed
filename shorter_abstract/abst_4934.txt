pre-phasing the reference data only lead to a minor decrease in the imputation accuracy, but gave a large improvement in computation time.
we investigated the effect of enlarging the reference population by combining data across breeds on the accuracy of imputation, and the accuracy and speed of both impute <dig> and beagle using either genotype probability reference data or pre-phased reference data.
the highest accuracy of imputation for all three test breeds was achieved when using beagle with un-phased reference data  but impute <dig> with un-phased reference data gave similar accuracies for holsteins and nordic red.
combining reference populations across breeds is a good option to increase the size of the reference data and in turn the accuracy of imputation when only few animals are available.
pre-phasing the reference data only slightly decreases the accuracy but gives substantial improvements in speed.
the advent of low cost next generation sequencing has made it possible to sequence a large number of dairy and beef bulls which can be used as a reference for imputation of whole genome sequence data.
data contained  <dig> holstein,  <dig> jersey,  <dig> nordic red and  <dig> brown swiss bulls with whole genome sequence data;  <dig> holstein,  <dig> jersey and  <dig> nordic reds had previously been typed with the bovine high density snp panel and were used for validation.
a combined breed reference population led to higher imputation accuracies than did a single breed reference.
