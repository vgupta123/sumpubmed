mirna profiling of bananas in response to ethylene treatment compared with 1-mcp treatment showed differential expression of  <dig> mirnas.
previous studies have reported that mirnas are closely related to the ripening process in model plants.
analysis by qrt-pcr validated the contrasting expression patterns between several mirnas and their target genes.
here, we investigated the mirna populations from banana fruits in response to ethylene or 1-mcp treatment using a deep sequencing approach and bioinformatics analysis combined with quantitative rt-pcr validation.
furthermore, the differentially expressed mirnas were predicted to target a total of  <dig> target genes.
the mirna target genes encode transcription factors and other functional proteins, including spl, apetala <dig>  ein <dig>  e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, β-galactosidase, and β-glucosidase.
interestingly, some targets were annotated as transcription factors and other functional proteins closely involved in the development and the ripening process in other plant species.
these findings provide valuable information for further functional research of the mirnas involved in banana fruit ripening.
the mirnaome of the banana fruit in response to ethylene or 1-mcp treatment were identified by high-throughput sequencing.
micrornas  are a family of non-coding small rnas that play an important regulatory role in various biological processes.
a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from three libraries.
however, the mirnas that are closely involved in the banana fruit ripening process remain unknown.
