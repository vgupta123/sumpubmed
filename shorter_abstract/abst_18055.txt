the circadian rhythms of gmcol5/ <dig> and gmft1/2/4/5/ <dig> were synchronized in a day, demonstrating the complicate relationship of co-ft regulons in soybean leaves.
co and ft orthologs, belonging to the bbx and pebp family, respectively, have important and conserved roles in the photoperiod regulation of flowering time in plants.
after three recent rounds of whole genome duplications in the soybean, the paralogous genes of co-ft regulons showed subfunctionalization through expression divergence.
therefore, our results suggested that gmcol5/ <dig> and gmft1/2/3/4/5/ <dig> formed the complicate co-ft regulons in the photoperiod regulation of flowering time in soybean.
subsequent subfunctionalization is the main fate for paralogous gene pairs during the evolutionary process.
based on the collinear relationship, the soybean ancestral co ortholog experienced three wgd events, but only two paralogous gene pairs  survived in the modern soybean.
the phylogenic relationships revealed that co orthologs were widespread in the plant kingdom while ft orthologs were present only in angiosperms.
over-expression of gmcol <dig> did not rescue the flowering phenotype of the arabidopsis co mutant.
gmftl <dig> to  <dig> were derived from the same ancestor prior to the whole genome triplication  event, and after the legume wgd event the ancestor diverged into two branches, gmftl3/5/ <dig> and gmftl1/2/4/ <dig>  gmftl <dig> were truncated in the n-terminus compared to other ft-lineage genes, but ubiquitously expressed.
the paralogous gene pairs, gmcol1/ <dig> or gmcol5/ <dig>  showed similar expression patterns in pair but different between pairs, indicating that they functionally diverged.
however, ectopic expression of gmcol <dig> did rescue the co mutant phenotype.
soybean genome experienced at least three rounds of whole genome duplications , which resulted in multiple copies of about 75% of genes.
twenty-eight co homologous genes and twenty-four ft homologous genes were gained in the soybean genome.
