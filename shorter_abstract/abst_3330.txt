the concentration of several n- <dig> fatty acids in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and lysophosphatidylcholine was increased, as was unesterified aa concentration.
in animal models, the metabolic syndrome elicits a cerebral response characterized by altered phospholipid and unesterified fatty acid concentrations and increases in pro-apoptotic inflammatory mediators that may cause synaptic loss and cognitive impairment.
these findings show upregulated brain aa and dha metabolism and reduced bdnf and drebrin, but no changes in eicosanoids, in an animal model of the metabolic syndrome.
the high-sucrose compared with control diet induced insulin resistance, and increased phosphorylated-cpla <dig> protein, cpla <dig> and ipla <dig> activity and 12-lipoxygenase mrna, but decreased bdnf mrna and protein, and drebrin mrna.
brains were assayed for markers of aa metabolism , dha metabolism , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , and synaptic integrity .
these changes might contribute to altered synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in rats and humans with the metabolic syndrome.

male wistar rats were fed a control or high-sucrose diet for  <dig> weeks.
we hypothesized that these changes are associated with phospholipase  enzymes that regulate arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic  acid metabolism, major polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain.
