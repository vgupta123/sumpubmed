the latter may reflect an adaptive response of e. coli against an increasingly acidic environment due to the excretion of acidic products during anaerobic growth in a batch culture.
biochemical investigations over the last decades have elucidated an increasingly complete image of the cellular metabolism.
interpreting expression levels as pixels with grey value intensities and network topology as relationships between pixels, allows for an image-like representation of cellular metabolism.
as a case study, the response of the hetero-fermentative bacterium e. coli to oxygen deprivation was investigated.
based on microarray expression profiling data of prokaryotic cells exposed to fundamental treatment changes, our novel technique proved to extract system changes for a rather broad spectrum of the biochemical network.
while the topology of a regular image is a lattice grid, biological networks demonstrate scale-free architecture and thus advanced image processing methods such as wavelet transforms cannot directly be applied.
moreover, utilising a network topology based on gene relationships may facilitate interpreting this vast amount of information, and extracting significant patterns within the networks.
with our novel method, we detected, as expected, an up-regulation in the pathways of hexose nutrients up-take and metabolism and formate fermentation.
furthermore, our approach revealed a down-regulation in iron processing as well as the up-regulation of the histidine biosynthesis pathway.
