it has been suggested that the ectopic expression of pdx <dig>  a dominant pancreatic transcription factor, plays a critical role in the developmental programming of the pancreas even from cells of unrelated tissues such as keratinocytes and amniotic fluid stem cells.
further, we have investigated the role of epidermal growth factor  and poly-l-ornithine  on this differentiation process.
in this study we have chosen to drive pancreatic development in human amnion epithelial cells by inducing endogenous pdx <dig> expression.
pancreatic marker expression subsequent to mpdx <dig> transduction suggests that this approach may facilitate the in vitro differentiation of haecs into cells of the endocrine pancreas.
this result may have important implications in diabetes therapy.
human amnion epithelial cells expressed high levels of endogenous pdx <dig> upon transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing murine pdx <dig>  other markers of various stages of pancreatic differentiation such as nkx <dig> , sox <dig>  rfx <dig>  foxa <dig>  cftr, neurod <dig>  pax <dig> and ppy were also expressed upon pdx <dig> transduction.
