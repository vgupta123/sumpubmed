inhibition of atmyb <dig> expression results in complete male sterility.
expression patterns of myb <dig> in these species are also highly similar.
the deduced amino acid sequences possess a highly conserved myb domain, 44-amino acid region and 18-amino acid c-terminal sequence.
the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> transcription factor regulates genes involved in pollen development and controls the timing of tapetal programmed cell death .
the reversible male sterility system developed in arabidopsis by manipulating myb <dig> expression should be applicable to all major crops.
in cotton, tapetal degradation occurs at a slightly earlier stage of anther development than in arabidopsis, consistent with an earlier increase and subsequent downregulation in ghmyb <dig> expression.
two conserved myb cis-elements in the atmyb <dig> promoter are required for downregulation of myb <dig> expression in anthers, apparently via negative auto-regulation.
the myb <dig> homologs fused with the ear repressor motif have been shown to induce male sterility in arabidopsis.
constructs were designed to maximize the level of male sterility.
