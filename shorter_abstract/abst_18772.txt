the highest mrna levels were seen in central and peripheral nervous systems.
immunohistochemical analysis of  <dig> different human tissues showed that fmnl <dig> is widely expressed, in agreement with the mrna profile.
in cultured cells fmnl <dig> showed mostly a cytoplasmic localization with perinuclear accumulation consistent with the golgi apparatus.
the widest expression was detected in the central nervous system, since both neurons and glial cells expressed fmnl <dig>  strong expression was also seen in many epithelia.
fmnl <dig> is expressed in multiple human tissues, not only in the central nervous system.
the affinity-purified fmnl <dig> antibody was validated by western blotting, northern blotting, a peptide competition assay and sirna experiments.
furthermore, fmnl <dig> co-localized with f-actin to the tips of cellular protrusions in wm <dig> human melanoma cells.
this finding is in line with fmnl2's proposed function in the formation of actin filaments in cellular protrusions, during amoeboid cellular migration.
in cultured melanoma cells, fmnl <dig> co-localizes with f-actin dots at the tips of cellular protrusions.
here we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the formin family member formin -like  <dig>  in human tissues.
bioinformatics-based mrna profiling indicated that fmnl <dig> is widely expressed in human tissues.
the subcellular location of fmnl <dig> was cytoplasmic, and in some tissues a strong perinuclear dot was detected.
the expression is especially strong in gastrointestinal and mammary epithelia, lymphatic tissues, placenta, and in the reproductive tract.
