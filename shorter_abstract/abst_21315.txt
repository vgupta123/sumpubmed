in contrast, conditioned medium from sod1-g93a astrocytes does not show a similar enhancing effect.
our study indicates that conditioned medium derived from wild type astrocytes enhances the efficient generation of motor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells by enhancing motor neuron progenitors.
the efficient derivation of mature  motor neurons from embryonic stem cells is a sought-after goal in the understanding, and potential treatment, of motor neuron diseases.
conditions that promote the robust generation of motor neuron progenitors from embryonic stem cells and that promote the survival of differentiated motor neurons ex vivo are likely, therefore, to be critical in future biological/therapeutic/screening approaches.
the effect of astrocyte-conditioned medium, moreover, is specific to motor neurons: we find that interneurons generated from mouse embryonic stem cells are unaffected by conditioned media from any type of astrocyte.
previous studies have shown that astrocytes have a protective effect on differentiated motor neurons , but it remains unclear whether astrocytes also play a beneficial role in the support of motor neuron progenitors.
here we explore the effect of murine astrocyte-conditioned medium on monolayer cultures of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived motor neuron progenitors.
our data show that wild-type astrocyte-conditioned medium significantly increases the number of olig2+/hb9- progenitors, which subsequently differentiate into hb9+/islet1+ post-mitotic motor neurons.
