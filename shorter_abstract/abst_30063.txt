residues forming an active site, whether it is a catalytic center or interaction interface, are frequently distant in a protein sequence.
visualization of residue relationships is enhanced by hierarchical cluster trees, heat maps, circular diagrams, and the residue highlighting in protein sequence and 3d structure.
the tool computes three covariance metrics: mutual information, chi-square statistic, pearson correlation, and one conservation metric: joint shannon entropy.
coeviz also can serve computational biologists as a resource of coevolution matrices, e.g., for developing machine learning-based prediction models.
coeviz represents a practical resource for a quick sequence-based protein annotation for molecular biologists, e.g., for identifying putative functional clusters of residues and structural domains.

identification of coevolving residues further advances the protein structure and function annotation by revealing cooperative pairs and higher order groupings of residues.
implemented adjustments of covariance scores include phylogeny correction, corrections for sequence dissimilarity and alignment gaps, and the average product correction.
two examples are provided to illustrate the use of the tool for identification of residues  involved in enzymatic function,  forming short linear functional motifs, and  constituting a structural domain.
we present a new web-based tool  that provides a versatile analysis and visualization of pairwise coevolution of amino acid residues.
evolutionary information encoded in multiple sequence alignments is known to greatly improve sequence-based predictions.
the presented tool is integrated in the polyview-2d server  and available from resulting pages of polyview-2d.
