the recent genome-scale model of metabolism and protein expression in escherichia coli  computes the complete composition of the proteome required to perform whole cell functions.
membranes play a crucial role in cellular functions.
in addition, components embedded within the membrane participate in cell signaling, energy transduction, and other critical cellular functions.
all these processes must share the limited space in the membrane; thus it represents a notable constraint on cellular functions.
here we expand the me-model to include  a reconstruction of protein translocation pathways,  assignment of all cellular proteins to one of four compartments  and a translocation pathway,  experimentally determined translocase catalytic and porin diffusion rates, and  a novel membrane constraint that reflects cell morphology.
comparison of computations performed with this expanded me-model, named ijl1678-me, against available experimental data reveals that the model accurately describes translocation pathway expression and the functional proteome by compartmentalized mass.
membrane- and location-based processes have not yet been reconstructed and explicitly integrated into genome-scale models.
ijl1678-me takes a notable step towards the inclusion of cellular ultra-structure in genome-scale models.
