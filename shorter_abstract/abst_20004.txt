our results suggest that ischemia induces harmful effects on equine small intestine, probably due to an increase in oxidative damage and proinflammatory molecules.
this effect could be mediated, at least in part, by impairment in glutathione metabolism.
this process might be, at least in part, due to the accumulation of oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen  and reactive nitrogen species , secondary to intestinal ischemia.
ischemia induced a significant increase in lipid hydroperoxides, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and a reduction in reduced glutathione, and adenosine triphosphate  content, as well as in methionine-adenosyl-transferase and methyl-transferase activities.
