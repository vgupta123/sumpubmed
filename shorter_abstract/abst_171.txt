hypoxia plays an important role in vascular remodeling and directly affects vascular smooth muscle cells  functions.
macrophage migration inhibitory factor  is a well known proinflammatory factor, and recent evidence suggests an important role of mif in the progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis.
the up-regulation of mif expression appears to be dependent on hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1α since knockdown of hif-1α inhibits the hypoxia induction of mif gene and protein expression.
our results demonstrated that in vsmcs, hypoxia increased mif gene expression and protein production.
the current study was designed to test whether hypoxia could regulate mif expression in human vsmc.
the effect of modulating mif expression on hypoxia-induced vsmc proliferation and migration was also investigated at the same time.
under moderate hypoxia conditions , both cell proliferation and cell migration were increased in vsmc cells.
both mif and hif-1α mediated the hypoxia response of vascular smooth muscle cells, including cell migration and proliferation.
expression of mif mrna and protein was up-regulated as early as  <dig> hours in cultured human vsmcs after exposed to moderate hypoxia condition .
