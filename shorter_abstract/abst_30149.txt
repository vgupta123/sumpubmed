however, a comprehensive genetic study has not been performed in korean rp patients.
identification of the causative genes of retinitis pigmentosa  is important for the clinical care of patients with rp.
causal variants were characterised by selecting exonic and splicing variants, selecting variants with low allele frequency , and discarding the remaining variants with quality below  <dig>  the variants were additionally confirmed by an inheritance pattern and cosegregation test of the families, and the rest of the variants were prioritised using in-silico prediction tools.

compound heterozygous variants were found in four of  <dig> simplex cases.
moreover, the genetic heterogeneity found in sensorineural genetic disorders makes identification of pathogenic mutations challenging.
novel variants were detected in  <dig> of  <dig>  candidate variants.
finally, causal variants were detected from  <dig> of  <dig> familial cases  and  <dig> of  <dig> simplex cases  in total.
