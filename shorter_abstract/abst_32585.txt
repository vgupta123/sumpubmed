based on direct cloning, sequence conservation, and predicted secondary structures, a large number of mirnas have been identified in higher eukaryotic genomes but whether these rnas are simply a subset of a much larger number of noncoding rna families is unknown.
we analyzed the zebrafish genome to identify the number and location of proven and predicted mirnas resulting in the identification of  <dig> new mirnas.
based on genomic location and expression analysis, we also identified those mirnas that are likely to be encoded as part of polycistronic transcripts.
current analysis indicates the zebrafish genome encodes  <dig> mirnas which can be grouped into  <dig> families.
lastly, as a resource, we compiled existing zebrafish mirna expression data and, where possible, listed all experimentally proven mrna targets.
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas that regulate cell movement, specification, and development.
