subtraction of  <dig> bp periodicity signals reduces the number of false positives.
using both simulated tp signals and the real c. elegans sequence f56f <dig> as an example, we demonstrate that,  modified wavelet transform  can better define the boundary of tp region than the conventional short time fourier transform ;  the scale parameter  of mwt determines the precision of tp boundary localization: bigger values of a give sharper tp boundaries but result in a lower signal to noise ratio;  rna splicing sites have weaker tp signals than coding region;  tp signals in coding region can be destroyed or recovered by frame-shift mutations;   <dig> bp periodicities in introns and intergenic region can generate false positive signals and it can be removed with  <dig> bp mwt.
such periodicity is usually not observed in introns and intergenic regions.
if a dna sequence is divided into small segments and a fourier transform is applied on each segment, a strong peak at frequency 1/ <dig> is typically observed in the fourier spectrum of coding segments, but not in non-coding regions.
however, the need to compute the fourier transform across a segment  of arbitrary size affects the accuracy with which one can localize tp boundaries.
experimentally-introduced frame-shift mutations help recover tp signal that have been lost by possible ancient frame-shifts.
more importantly, tp signal has the potential to be used to detect the splice junctions in fully spliced mrna sequence.
the protein-coding regions  of a dna sequence exhibit a triplet periodicity  due to fact that coding exons contain a series of three nucleotide codons that encode specific amino acid residues.
