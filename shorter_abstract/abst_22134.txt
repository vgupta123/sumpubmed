tilt series are commonly used in electron tomography as a means of collecting three-dimensional information from two-dimensional projections.
we show our results with synthetic data as well as experimental cryo electron tomography.
these regions act as landmarks allowing the determination of the alignment parameters.
in this paper we introduce an algorithm to find regions of the tilt series which can be tracked within a subseries of the tilt series.
