moreover, we also identified genes responsible for male production .
we identified several candidate genes regulating esd which strongly suggests that these genes may be essential factors for male offspring production as an upstream regulator of mf signaling in d. pulex.
we found that genes involved in ionotropic glutamate receptors, known to mediate the vast majority of excitatory neurotransmitting processes in various organisms, were significantly activated in daphnids by the short-day condition but not by mf treatment.
we recently established an innovative system for esd studies using d. pulex wtn <dig> strain, in which the sex of the offspring can be controlled simply by changes in the photoperiod: the long-day and short-day conditions can induce female and male offspring, respectively.
these results indicate the key role of innate mf signaling as a conductor between external environmental stimuli and the endogenous male developmental pathway.
despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying up- and downstream signaling of mf have not yet been well elucidated in d. pulex.
administration of specific agonists and antagonists, especially for the n-methyl-d-aspartic acid  receptor, strongly increased or decreased, respectively, the proportion of male-producing mothers.
