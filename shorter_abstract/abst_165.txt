malic enzymes decarboxylate the tricarboxylic acid  cycle intermediate malate to the glycolytic end-product pyruvate and are well positioned to regulate metabolic flux in central carbon metabolism.
nad-malic enzyme  of s. meliloti is required for efficient metabolism of succinate via the tca cycle.
despite the wide distribution of these enzymes, their biological roles are unclear in part because the reaction catalyzed by these enzymes can be by-passed by other pathways.
the dme mutant strains incubated with succinate accumulated trehalose and hexose sugar phosphates, secreted malate, and relative to wild-type, these cells had moderately increased transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and pathways that divert metabolites away from the tca cycle.
for cells utilizing succinate, tme activity alone appeared to be insufficient to produce the levels of pyruvate required for efficient tca cycle metabolism.
putrescine was found to accumulate in tme cells growing with succinate, and whether this is related to altered levels of nadph requires further investigation.
in contrast, the dme mutants, but not tme, grew slowly on the gluconeogenic substrate succinate and this slow growth was further reduced upon the addition of glucose.
in dme mutants utilizing succinate, malate accumulates and is excreted and these cells appear to increase metabolite flow via gluconeogenesis with a resulting increase in the levels of hexose-6-phosphates and trehalose.
while tme mutant cells grew at the same rate as wild-type on succinate, they accumulated the compatible solute putrescine.
