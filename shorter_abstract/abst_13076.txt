figg then uses this information as a background to generate new sequences from a parent sequence with matching frequencies, but different actual mutations.
the background can be normal variations, known disease variations, or a theoretical frequency distribution of variations.
for normal variations we used publicly available data to determine the frequency of different mutation classes across the genome.
high-throughput sequencing has become one of the primary tools for investigation of the molecular basis of disease.
the increasing use of sequencing in investigations that aim to understand both individuals and populations is challenging our ability to develop analysis tools that scale with the data.
the advent of population scale sequencing studies requires analysis tools that are developed and tested against matching quantities of heterogeneous data.
we developed a large-scale whole genome simulation tool, figg, which generates large numbers of whole genomes with known sequence characteristics based on direct sampling of experimentally known or theorized variations.
in order to enable the creation of large numbers of genomes, figg generates simulated sequences from known genomic variation and iteratively mutates each genome separately.
