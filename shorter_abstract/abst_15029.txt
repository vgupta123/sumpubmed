weak and noisy training datasets have been collected from descriptions of tf-related concepts in mesh and go, ppi data and data representing non-protein-function descriptions.
the results of considering existing ppi data suggest that there is not as high similarity between tf and ppi contexts as we have expected.
three machine-learning methods are investigated, along with a vote-based merging of individual approaches and/or different training datasets.
we have exploited background knowledge from existing biological resources  to engineer such features.
while manual literature curation is expensive and labour intensive, the development of semi-automated text mining support is hindered by unavailability of training data.
availability of information about transcription factors  is crucial for genome biology, as tfs play a central role in the regulation of gene expression.
the system achieved highly encouraging results, with most classifiers achieving an f-measure above 90%.
the experimental results have shown that the proposed model can be used for identification of tf-related contexts  with high accuracy, with a significantly reduced set of features when compared to traditional bag-of-words approach.
there have been no studies on how existing data sources  or potentially noisy example data  could be used to provide training data for identification of tf-contexts in literature.
we have also shown that existing knowledge sources are useful both for feature engineering and for obtaining noisy positive training data.
in this paper we describe a text-classification system designed to automatically recognise contexts related to transcription factors in literature.
