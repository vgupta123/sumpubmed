tm differentiation in vitro from various stem cell types must be monitored by the expression of specific markers.
to identify robust markers of tm differentiation, we performed global transcriptome profiling using high-density oligonucleotide microarray on ex vivo tm tissue and cultured tm progenitors.
three independent cohort of expression studies have identified novel markers, fitting in identifying tm cells and in evaluating directed tm differentiation in vitro.
however, no single definitive marker of the tm has been identified.
development of primary open-angle glaucoma  is associated with the malfunctioning trabecular meshwork .

cell therapy offers great potential for the treatment of poag, but requires the generation of functional tm cells in vitro to replace the lost/dysfunctional cells.
expression analysis by qpcr verified the differential expression and immunofluorescence of the anterior segment confirmed strong expression in the tm.
corneal and scleral tissues were also used in the analysis.
