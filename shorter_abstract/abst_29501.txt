the inference is based on full posterior distribution of gene expression indices and on quantities derived from them rather than on point estimates.
we present a bayesian hierarchical model for finding differentially expressed genes between two experimental conditions, proposing an integrated statistical approach where correcting signal saturation, systematic array effects, dye effects, and finding differentially expressed genes, are all modeled jointly.
eliminating such errors does not seem feasible without completely changing the technologies, but one should nevertheless try to meet the goal of being able to realistically assess degree of the uncertainties that are involved when drawing the final conclusions from such analyses.
dna microarrays provide an efficient method for measuring activity of genes in parallel and even covering all the known transcripts of an organism on a single array.
the method presents a way of integrating various steps of microarray analysis into a single joint analysis, and thereby enables extracting information on differential expression in a manner, which properly accounts for various sources of potential error in the process.
