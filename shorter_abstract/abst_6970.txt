we conclude that sbt is usually a good proxy for the genetic lineage described by the whole genome, and therefore utility of sbt is still suitable until the technology and economics of high throughput sequencing reach the point where routine wgs of l. pneumophila isolates for outbreak investigation is feasible.
particular sequence types described by this scheme are known to exhibit specific phenotypes.
where there are exceptions and recombination has resulted in the st no longer reflecting the genetic lineage described by the whole genome sequence, the clustering technique employed detects these sequence types as being admixed, indicating their mixed inheritance.
when an outbreak of legionnairesâ€™ disease caused by l. pneumophila occurs, it is necessary to discover the source of infection.
a seven allele sequence-based typing scheme  has been very successful in providing the means to attribute outbreaks of l. pneumophila to a particular source or sources.
in order to provide a framework within which to test this hypothesis and others relating to the population biology of l. pneumophila, a set of genomes covering the known diversity of the organism is required.
firstly, this study describes a means to group l. pneumophila strains into pragmatic clusters, using a methodology that takes into consideration the genetic forces operating on the population.
secondly, the clusters generated from the first part of the study were used to select strains rationally for whole genome sequencing .
in general the sbt sequence type  accurately reflects the whole genome-based genotype.

legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic pathogen of humans where the source of infection is usually from contaminated man-made water systems.
