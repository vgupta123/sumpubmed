to address these issues we developed mexpress, a straightforward and easy-to-use web tool for the integration and visualization of the expression, dna methylation and clinical tcga data on a single-gene level .
we also used mexpress to reveal the differences in the dna methylation status of the pam <dig> marker gene mlph between the breast cancer subtypes and how these differences were linked to the expression of mplh.
in recent years, increasing amounts of genomic and clinical cancer data have become publically available through large-scale collaborative projects such as the cancer genome atlas .
in comparison to existing tools, mexpress allows researchers to quickly visualize and interpret the different tcga datasets and their relationships for a single gene, as demonstrated for gstp <dig> in prostate adenocarcinoma.
we have created a user-friendly tool for the visualization and interpretation of tcga data, offering clinical researchers a simple way to evaluate the tcga data for their genes or candidate biomarkers of interest.
