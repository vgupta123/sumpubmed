binding of pelo to cytoskeleton-associated proteins may facilitate pelo to detect and degrade aberrant mrnas, at which the ribosome is stalled during translation.
by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay , we found that protein complexes resulting from the interactions between pelo and either hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx were mainly localized to cytoskeletal filaments.
overexpression of human pelo in hep2g cells had prominent effect on cell growth, cytoskeleton organization and cell spreading.
to find proteins interacting with pelo, full-length human pelo cdna was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay.
we show here that pelo is associated with actin microfilaments of mammalian cells.
furthermore, the pelo interaction domain was mapped to residues 268- <dig> containing the c-terminal and acidic tail domain.
recent studies revealed the essential role of pelo in the no-go mrna decay, by which mrna with translational stall are endonucleotically cleaved and degraded.
we could show that pelo is subcellularly localized at the actin cytoskeleton, interacts with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx proteins and that this interaction occurs at the cytoskeleton.
