avidin transgene was stably integrated, transcribed and translated as indicated by southern blot, elisa, and dot blot analyses, with a high level of expression in transgenic wheat seeds.
however, no expression was detected in untransformed wheat seeds.
the results of bioassay using transgenic wheat plants challenged with wheat weevil revealed 100 % mortality of the insects reared on transgenic plants after 21 days.
transgenic wheat plants had improved resistance to sitophilus granarius.
giza  <dig> using a biolistic bombardment protocol.
accumulation of avidin protein was detected in transgenic plants compared to non-transgenic plants.
functional integrity of avidin was confirmed by insect bioassay.
the wheat weevil sitophilus granarius is a serious insect pests in much of the wheat growing area worldwide and is responsible for significant loss of yield.
a synthetic avidin gene was introduced into spring wheat  cv.
avidin proteins has been proposed to function as plant defense agents against insect pests.
