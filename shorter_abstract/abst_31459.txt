here we investigated the relationship between transcription and translation regulatory properties encoded in mammalian genes.
presently little is known about the links between the various gene expression stages.
we found that the tata-box, a core promoter element known to enhance transcriptional output, is associated not only with higher mrna levels but also with positive translation regulatory features and elevated translation efficiency.
specifically, translation inhibitory features such as the presence of upstream aug  and increased lengths of the 5′utr, the coding sequence and the 3′utr, are strongly associated with lower translation as well as lower transcriptional rate.
variability in protein levels is generated through intricate control of the different gene decoding phases.
further investigation revealed general association between transcription and translation regulatory trends.
our findings reveal that co-occurrence of several gene-encoded transcription and translation regulatory features with the same trend substantially contributes to the final mrna and protein expression levels and enables their coordination.
