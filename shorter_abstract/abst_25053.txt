also, we show that complex formation can produce ultrasensitivity outside the goldbeter-koshland zero-order ultrasensitivity regime through a mechanism similar to competitive inhibition between an enzyme and its inhibitor.
however, the functional significance of this type of complex formation is not clear.
also, substrate levels are changed one can obtain non-monotonic bell-shaped dose-response curves over a narrow range of parameters.
then we extend the pdc to include kinase-phosphatase complex formation.
we report the possibility of robust bell-shaped dose-response for a specific class of the model with complex formation.
we first revisit the basic pdc and show that partial asymptotic phosphorylation of substrate limits ultrasensitivity.
we discuss the relevance of this result in the context of experimental observations on pi regulation in endosomal trafficking.
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles  mediated by kinases and phosphatases are common in cellular signalling.
