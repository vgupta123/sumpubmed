the cpsp-tools package provides programs to solve exactly and completely the problems typical of studies using 3d lattice protein models.
the cpsp-tools package is the first set of exact and complete methods for extensive, high-throughput studies of non-restricted 3d-lattice protein models.
among the tasks addressed are the prediction of  globally optimal and/or suboptimal structures as well as sequence design and neutral network exploration.
