our evaluation on simulated data and real dna and protein sequences show that our algorithm consistently produces the best results compared to many well-known heuristic algorithms, and especially on large instances.
the scs problem is well-known to be np-complete.
our dr algorithm provides a partial answer to the open problem of designing efficient heuristic algorithm for scs problem on many long sequences.
the algorithm is efficient, both in running time and space complexity and our evaluation shows that it is practical even for scs problems on many long sequences.
many heuristic algorithms have been proposed.
unfortunately, most do not work well on large scs instances where there are many, long sequences.
in this paper, we present a deposition and reduction  algorithm for solving large scs instances of biological sequences.
it is a key problem in biological sequences analysis.
our algorithm has a bounded approximation ratio.
the deposition process is responsible for generating a small set of common supersequences; and the reduction process shortens these common supersequences by removing some characters while preserving the common supersequence property.
the problem of finding a shortest common supersequence  of a set of sequences is an important problem with applications in many areas.
there are two processes in our dr algorithm: deposition process, and reduction process.
some heuristics work well on a few long sequences ; others work well on many short sequences .
