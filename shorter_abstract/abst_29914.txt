based on our results, we propose that the local and global level versatility of b-dna structure may be a significant factor modulating the formation of nucleosomes in the vicinity of high-plasticity genes, and in varying the probability of binding by regulatory proteins.
in this study, we have addressed this question by analysing the variability at the dinucleotide and trinucleotide as well as longer length scales in a dataset of nucleosome x-ray crystal structures.
in addition, the multimodal distribution of dinucleotide parameters for some steps and the presence of a large number of kinks in the nucleosomal dna structure indicate that the linear elastic model, used by several algorithms to predict the energetic cost of nucleosome formation, may lead to incorrect results.
one of the key questions in this context is the role, if any, that can be played by the variability of nucleosomal dna structure.
the nucleosomal dna also incorporates a large number of kinks.
it has been shown that the positioning of a majority of nucleosomes is primarily controlled by factors other than the intrinsic preference of the dna sequence.
we observe that the nucleosome structure displays remarkable local level structural versatility within the b-dna family.
