to investigate whether these sources of information can be used to improve accuracy when mapping reads, we developed the rmap tool, which can map reads having a wide range of lengths and allows base-call quality scores to determine which positions in each read are more important when mapping.
the rmap tool we have developed will enable researchers to effectively exploit this information in targeted re-sequencing projects.
our results indicate that significant gains in solexa read mapping performance can be achieved by considering the information in 3' ends of longer reads, and appropriately using the base-call quality scores.
accurately mapping the reads back to a reference genome is a critical task in almost all applications.
two sources of information that are often ignored when mapping reads from the solexa technology are the 3' ends of longer reads, which contain a much higher frequency of sequencing errors, and the base-call quality scores.
we applied rmap to analyze data re-sequenced from two human bac regions for varying read lengths, and varying criteria for use of quality scores.
the increase in speed, sensitivity and availability of sequencing technology brings demand for advances in computational technology to perform associated analysis tasks.
