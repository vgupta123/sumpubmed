here, we provide evidence by transmission electron microscopy that phb granules are localized in close contact to the nucleoid region in r. eutropha during growth on nutrient broth.
subcellular localization of phb granules is controlled in r. eutropha and depends on the presence and concentrations of at least two phb granule associated proteins, pham and phap <dig>
binding of phb granules to the nucleoid is mediated by pham, a phb granule associated protein with phasin-like properties that is also able to bind to dna and to phasin phap <dig>  over-expression of pham resulted in formation of many small phb granules that were always attached to the nucleoid region.
association of phb granules to the nucleoid region was prevented by over-expression of phap <dig> and clusters of several phb granules were mainly localized near the cell poles.
however, contradictionary results on subcellular localization of phb granules in ralstonia eutropha were published, recently.
formation and subcellular localization of phb granules was previously assumed to occur randomly in the cytoplasm of phb accumulating bacteria.
in contrast, phb granules of âˆ†pham strains became very large and distribution of granules to daughter cells was impaired.
