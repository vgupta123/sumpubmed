the findings set the stage for more hypothesis-driven research aimed at discovering the role of variation in the genome that affect fertility and that can be used to identify molecular mechanisms of development.
in the phase ii study, we tested the four most significant snp from the phase i study in  <dig> low-fertility and  <dig> high-fertility bulls, with two snps  significantly replicated.
we performed a comprehensive genome wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for bull fertility followed by a second-stage replication in additional bulls for a restricted set of markers.
our findings suggest that the bovine sperm integrin beta  <dig> protein plays a role during fertilization and could serve as a positional or functional marker of bull fertility.
we have identified molecular markers associated with bull fertility and established that at least one of the genes harboring such variation has a role in fertility.
the findings are important in understanding mechanisms of uncompensatory infertility in bulls, and in other male mammals.
in the phase i association study, we genotyped the genomic sperm dna of  <dig> low-fertility and  <dig> high-fertility bulls using bovine snp gene chips containing approximately  <dig>  random snp markers.
