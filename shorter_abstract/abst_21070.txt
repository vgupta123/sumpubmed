vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase  genes play an important role in salt stress tolerance in multiple species.
bioinformatic analysis also revealed that there may be novel motifs in this region that are the key elements for the salt stress responsive activity of the tsvp <dig> promoter.
in transgenic arabidopsis with the tsvp <dig> promoter, the gus reporter gene had strong activity in almost all tissues except the seeds and the activity was induced in both shoots and roots, especially in the root tips, when treated with salt stress.
the tsvp <dig> promoter had strong activity in almost all tissues except the seeds.
salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant growth and productivity.
a  <dig> bp region  was finally identified as the key sequence for the salt stress response by analyzing the different mutants both with and without salt stress.
gus transient assay in tobacco leaves suggested the  <dig> bp region was sufficient for the salt stress response.
in addition, its activity was induced by salt stress in leaves and roots, especially in root tips.
a  <dig> bp region  was identified as the key region for responding to salt stress.
in this study, the promoter from the vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase from thellungiella halophila  was cloned and compared with the avp <dig> promoter from arabidopsis thaliana.
two aaatga motifs, which may be the key elements for the anther specific expression profile, in the deleted tsvp <dig> promoters  were also identified.
by analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of the tsvp <dig> promoter, an  <dig> bp region  was found to contain enhancer elements that increased gene expression levels.
such induction was not found in transgenic arabidopsis with the avp <dig> promoter.
to determine which tissues the two promoters are active in, transgenic plants were produced with expression of the gus reporter gene under the control of one of the promoters.
sequence analysis indicated that these two promoters had seven similar motifs at similar positions.
