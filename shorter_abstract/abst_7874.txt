features of the proposed method include a high running speed in challenge of a large number of genomes, and high applicability for classifying organisms with incomplete genome sequences.
for each genome, in silico translation is performed to obtained its proteome, based on which a probe-set frequency pattern is generated.
then, the probe-set frequency patterns are used to cluster the proteomes/genomes.
as modern techniques have dramatically increased sequencing rates and rapidly expanded the number of sequenced genomes, in addition to traditional taxonomic classifications which focus on the evolutionary relationships of organisms, classifications of the genomes based on alternative points of view may help advance our understanding of the delicate relationships of organisms.
microorganisms able to grow under artificial culture conditions comprise only a small proportion of the biosphere's total microbial community.
