the lbds of evolutionarily-conserved caenorhabditis nrs have diverged sharply from their drosophila and vertebrate orthologs, while the dbds have been strongly conserved.
in c. elegans, these clades are defined by nhr- <dig>  fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig>  the vertebrate orthologs of nhr- <dig> and fax- <dig> are tlx and pnr, respectively.
the lack of a requirement for a fax- <dig> lbd suggests that the relatively high level of sequence divergence for caenorhabditis lbds reflects relaxed selection on the primary sequence as opposed to divergent positive selection.
the c. elegans and c. briggsae nhr- <dig> genes have an apparently-truncated and highly-diverged lbd region.
an additional c. elegans nr2e gene, nhr- <dig>  appears to be a recently-evolved paralog of fax-1; it is present in c. elegans, but not c. briggsae or other animals with completely-sequenced genomes.
our analysis supports three conserved clades of nr2e receptors, only two of which are represented in vertebrates, indicating three ancestral nr2e genes in the urbilateria.
while the nhr- <dig> clade includes orthologs in insects , an echinoderm, and a hemichordate, the gene appears to have been lost from vertebrate lineages.
analysis of the fax- <dig> lbd in an in vivo assay revealed that it is not required for at least some developmental functions.
in this study, we explore the phylogenetics and function of the nr2e family of caenorhabditis elegans, using an in vivo assay to test lbd function.
the nuclear receptors  are an important class of transcription factors that are conserved across animal phyla.
this observation is consistent with a model in which divergence of some caenorhabditis lbds is allowed, at least in part, by the absence of a ligand requirement.
