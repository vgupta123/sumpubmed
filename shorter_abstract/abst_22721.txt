the results showed that carriers of the less common il1bâˆ’511*t allele were overrepresented in the group of tja patients with pji  in comparison with those that did not develop pji  and with healthy controls .
here we examine whether the particular genetic variants can lead to increased susceptibility to pji development.
our results should be independently replicated; studies on the functional relevance of il1b gene variants in pji are also needed.
prosthetic joint infection  is an important failure mechanism of total joint arthroplasty .
