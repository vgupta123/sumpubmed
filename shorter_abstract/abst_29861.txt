synthetic genetic array analysis of glc7-e101q revealed a broad network of  <dig> synthetic sick/lethal interactions reflecting that many processes are required when glc <dig> function is compromised such as histone modification, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, nutrient sensing and dna damage.
in addition, mitochondrial activity and inheritance and lipid metabolism were identified as new processes involved in buffering glc <dig> function.
phenotypic analysis indicates that this novel allele exhibits slow growth and defects in glucose metabolism but normal cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation.
protein kinases and phosphatases regulate protein phosphorylation, a critical means of modulating protein function, stability and localization.
the identification of functional networks for protein phosphatases has been slow due to their redundant nature and the lack of large-scale analyses.
we found  <dig> genes required for the normal growth of the glc7-e101q mutant.
we hypothesized that a genome-scale analysis of genetic interactions using the synthetic genetic array could reveal protein phosphatase functional networks.
