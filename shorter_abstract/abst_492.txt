targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a reverse genetics approach to directly identify point mutations in specific genes of interest in genomic dna from a large chemically mutagenized population.
by pooling a genomic dna library made from over  <dig>  n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenized f <dig> fish into  <dig> equal pools of  <dig> fish, each with a unique illumina barcode, we reduce the complexity of the template to a level at which we can detect mutations that occur in a single heterozygous fish in the entire library.
