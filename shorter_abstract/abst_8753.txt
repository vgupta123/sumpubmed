maintenance of energy production was found to be central in the response to flooding, as seen by up-regulation of transcripts related to glycolysis and induction of transcripts related to ethanolic fermentation.
a major limitation to production is the oomycete phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes root rot leading to branch-dieback and tree death.
the transcriptomic response of avocado to flooding and p. cinnamomi was investigated utilizing microarray analysis.
the decline of orchards infected with p. cinnamomi occurs much faster when exposed to flooding, even if flooding is only transient.
flooding is a multifactorial stress compromised of several individual stresses, making breeding and selection for tolerant varieties challenging.
