the results of qtl mapping for growth traits suggest that growth at different stages was controlled by some common qtl and some different qtl.
for body weight, two qtl intervals at two stages were overlapped while the others were mapped onto different positions.
our data supply a basis for fine mapping qtl, marker-assisted selection and further detailed analysis of the functions of the ifabp-a gene in fish growth.
the ifabp-a gene located in a significant qtl interval for growth on lg <dig> was cloned and characterized.
twelve and nine significant qtl, as well as  <dig> and  <dig> suggestive qtl were detected for growth traits at six and nine months post hatch, respectively.
positional candidate genes and association mapping suggest that the ifabp-a is a strong candidate gene for growth.
we conducted qtl mapping for growth traits in an asian seabass f <dig> family with  <dig> individuals using  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> snps, and performed association mapping in four populations with  <dig> individuals.
a snp in exon  <dig> of the gene was significantly associated with growth traits in different populations.
these qtl explained  <dig> - <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
