of the pollen-expressed sequences, about  <dig>   are also expressed in sporophytic tissues, and  <dig>  are selectively expressed in pollen.
comparative studies on pollen of other genera, particularly crop plants, are needed to understand the pollen gene networks that are subject to functional and evolutionary conservation.
the current knowledge of the pollen transcriptome is limited to the model plant systems arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa which have tri-cellular pollen grains at maturity.
compared to the sporophyte transcriptome, the soybean pollen transcriptome revealed a restricted and unique repertoire of genes, with a significantly greater proportion of specifically expressed genes than is found in the sporophyte tissue.
overall, the soybean pollen transcriptome shows an enrichment of transcription factors , signal recognition receptors, transporters, heat shock-related proteins and members of the ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic pathway.
these data extend our current knowledge regarding regulatory pathways that govern the gene regulation and development of pollen.
a comparison between transcription factors up-regulated in soybean and those in arabidopsis revealed some divergence in the numbers and kinds of regulatory proteins expressed in both species.
