environmental preferences and past climatic changes may determine the length of time during which a species range has contracted or expanded from refugia, thereby influencing levels of genetic diversification.
the relative genetic homogeneity observed across populations of this steppe raptor may be explained by a short isolation time, relatively recent population expansions and a relaxed philopatry.
we found significant genetic differentiation between two population groups, at the sw and ne parts of the species' range.
3500- <dig> years bp in the sw and ne part of the range respectively.
consistent with our hypothesis, montagu's harrier has relatively low genetic variation at the mitochondrial dna.
connectivity among populations of steppe-associated taxa might have been maximal during the long glacial periods, and interrupted only during the shorter interglacial phases, potentially resulting in low levels of genetic differentiation among populations.
we investigated this hypothesis by exploring patterns of genetic diversity, past demography and gene flow in a raptor species characteristic of steppes, the montagu's harrier , using mitochondrial dna data from  <dig> breeding populations and two wintering populations.
the highest levels of genetic diversity were found in coastal spain, france and central asia.
we highlight the importance of considering the consequence of isolation and colonization processes in order to better understand the evolutionary history of steppe species.
