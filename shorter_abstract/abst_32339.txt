the perennial species rhazya stricta  grows in arid zones and carries out typical c <dig> photosynthesis under daily extremes of heat, light intensity and low humidity.
this study shows that temporal profiling is essential to assess the significance of genes apparently responsive to abiotic stress.
we identified protein families specific to r. stricta which were found to have diverged from their homologs in other species and which were over -expressed at midday.
this revealed that in r. stricta, the circadian clock is a major regulator of de genes, even of those annotated as stress-responsive in other species.
this may be an important feature of the adaptation of r. stricta to its extreme but predictable environment.
of these, some were common to other desert species and others were distinct to r. stricta, suggesting that they are important for the adaptation of such plants to arid environments.
independent of circadian control, significant overlaps with arabidopsis genes were observed only with heat and salinity/high light stress-responsive genes.
in order to identify processes attributable to its adaptation to this harsh environment, we profiled the foliar transcriptome of apical and mature leaves harvested from the field at three time periods of the same day.
