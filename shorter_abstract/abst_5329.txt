another conserved feature is the polypyrimidine initiator, which conforms to the consensus 2c+1ty <dig>  at least  <dig> % of the rp promoters contain a largely conserved tata box or a/t-rich motif, which should theoretically have tbp-binding capability.
coordinate expression of these genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is required to ensure a roughly equimolar accumulation of ribosomal proteins.
a remarkably high proportion of the promoters contain conserved binding sites for transcription factors that were previously implicated in rp gene expression, namely upstream gabp and sp <dig> sites and downstream yy <dig> sites.
this analysis has provided some valuable insights into the general architecture of mammalian rp promoters and has identified parameters that might coordinately regulate the transcriptional activity of certain subsets of rp genes.
to elucidate the general features of rp promoter architecture, i made a detailed sequence comparison of the promoter regions of the entire set of orthologous human and mouse rp genes.
a striking evolutionarily conserved feature of most rp genes is the separation by an intron of the sequences involved in transcriptional and translational regulation from the sequences with protein encoding function.
over  <dig> % of human and mouse rp genes contain a transposable element residue within  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequence; very little sequence identity between human and mouse orthologues was evident more than  <dig> bp upstream of the transcriptional start point.
mammalian ribosomes contain  <dig> different proteins encoded by widely scattered single copy genes.
