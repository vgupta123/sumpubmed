our results suggest that there is a fundamental difference between lgt in thermophiles and halophiles.
furthermore, most hypersaline environments, as topographical minima, are natural collectors of cellular debris.
thus halophiles would in theory be exposed to a greater diversity and quantity of extracellular dna than thermophiles.
these distant transfer events offer potentially greater fitness advantages and it is for this reason that these "long distance" lgt events may have significantly impacted the evolution of microbes.
we then categorized these lgt genes as originating in thermophiles and halophiles respectively.
the role of lateral gene transfer  in the evolution of microorganisms is only beginning to be understood.
while dna degrades rapidly in thermal environments due to temperature-driven denaturization, hypersaline environments are adept at preserving dna.
we identified potential inter-class lgt events into both a thermophilic class of archaea  and a halophilic class of archaea .
theoretically, transformative events can occur between any two species provided that the dna of one enters the habitat of the other.
while most lgt events occur between closely related individuals, inter-phylum and inter-domain lgt events are not uncommon.
one mechanism driving distant lgt events is microbial transformation.
