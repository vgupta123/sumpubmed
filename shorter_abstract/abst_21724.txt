while wt cxcr <dig> was rapidly internalized following il- <dig> administration, k327r mutant remained at the plasma membrane.
finally, k327r mutant failed to promote the recruitment of Î²-arrestin <dig>  as estimated by imagery and bioluminescence resonance transfer.
overall, our results demonstrate that cxcr <dig> ubiquitination on k <dig> residue modulates agonist-activated cxcr <dig> cell sorting and intracellular signaling.
the interleukin- <dig> chemokine  g-protein coupled receptor cxcr <dig> governs pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic responses in leukocytes and endothelial cells.
