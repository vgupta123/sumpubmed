during phonological categorization, a vowel-dependent difference of n100m source location perpendicular to the main tonotopic gradient replicated previous findings.
auditory evoked fields were recorded using 148-channel magnetoencephalography , and magnetic source imaging was obtained for  <dig> subjects.
these results imply that the n100m reflects the extraction of abstract invariants from the speech signal.
the speech signal contains both information about phonological features such as place of articulation and non-phonological features such as speaker identity.
in speaker categorization, the relative mapping of vowels remained unchanged but sources were shifted towards more posterior and more superior locations.
