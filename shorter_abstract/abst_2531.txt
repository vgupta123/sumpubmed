the principal components  themselves may be used as differential features, from which relevant differential proteins may be effectively traced.
worse still, they may alter data integrity, and introduce false positives.
to address this, we introduce the concept of batch-effect resistant methods and demonstrate how such methods incorporating protein complexes are particularly resistant to batch effect without compromising data integrity.
as complex-based analyses require no prior data transformation , data integrity is protected.
individual checks on top-ranked protein complexes confirm strong association with phenotype classes and not batch.
however, neither pc-based nor existing batch effect-correction methods address well subtle batch effects, which are difficult to eradicate, and involve data transformation and/or projection which is error-prone.
in proteomics, batch effects are technical sources of variation that confounds proper analysis, preventing effective deployment in clinical and translational research.
using simulated and real data, we demonstrate existing batch effect-correction methods do not always eradicate all batch effects.
moreover, although principal component analysis  is commonly used for detecting batch effects.
batch effect are removable by identifying pcs highly correlated with batch but not class effect.
we demonstrate for the first time their innate resistance against batch effects, even subtle ones.
