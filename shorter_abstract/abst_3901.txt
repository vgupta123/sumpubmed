following foxl <dig> loss, early testis genes  and several novel ovarian genes were consistently dysregulated during embryonic development.
in animal models, foxl <dig> is required for maintenance, and possibly induction, of female sex determination independently of other critical genes, e.g., rspo <dig>  here we report expression profiling of mouse ovaries that lack foxl <dig> alone or in combination with wnt <dig> or kit/c-kit.
the results, including a comprehensive principal component analysis, 1) support the proposal of dose-dependent foxl <dig> function and anti-testis action throughout ovary differentiation; and 2) identify candidate genes for roles in sex determination independent of foxl <dig>  and in the generation of the ovarian reserve downstream of foxl <dig> .
loss of one copy of foxl <dig> revealed strong gene dosage sensitivity, with molecular anomalies that were milder but resembled ovaries lacking both foxl <dig> alleles.
in the absence of foxl <dig>  expression changes affecting a large fraction of pathways were opposite those observed in wnt4-null ovaries, reinforcing the notion that these genes have complementary actions in ovary development.
the gene inventory is a first step toward the identification of the full range of pathways with partly autonomous roles in ovary development, and thus provides a framework to analyze the genetic bases of female fertility.
partial loss of function of the transcription factor foxl <dig> leads to premature ovarian failure in women.
