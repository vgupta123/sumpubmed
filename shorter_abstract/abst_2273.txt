we have demonstrated that this high-throughput pipeline is capable of identifying binding sites for proteins, their interacting binding sites and, ultimately, their binding partners on a large scale.
we have developed a new method using a machine learning approach to detect if protein binding sites, once identified, interact with each other.
results indicate  <dig> % of the interacting binding sites and  <dig> % non-interacting binding sites were correctly identified.
the method exploits information relating to sequence and structural complementary across protein interfaces and has been tested on a non-redundant data set consisting of  <dig> homo-dimers and  <dig> hetero-dimers extracted from the pdb.
therefore, methods that are able to identify whether these binding sites interact are needed.
with the advent of increasing sequence and structural data, a number of methods have been proposed to locate putative protein binding sites from protein surfaces.
