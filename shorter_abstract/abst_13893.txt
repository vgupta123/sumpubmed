furthermore, nahs root pretreatment resulted in induction of gene expression levels of an array of protective molecules, such as enzymatic antioxidants , heat shock proteins  and aquaporins .
the present study evaluated the effect of hydroponic pretreatment of strawberry  roots with an h2s donor, sodium hydrosulfide , on the response of plants to acute heat shock treatment .
overall, we propose that h2s root pretreatment activates a coordinated network of heat shock defense-related pathways at a transcriptional level and systemically protects strawberry plants from heat shock-induced damage.

in addition, nahs pretreatment preserved ascorbate/glutathione homeostasis, as evidenced by lower asc and gsh pool redox disturbances and enhanced transcription of asc  and gsh biosynthetic enzymes , 8Â h after heat stress imposition.
temperature extremes represent an important limiting factor to plant growth and productivity.
