this resource of rubus-specific, gene-derived markers will facilitate the construction of linkage maps composed of transferable markers for studying and manipulating important traits in this economically important genus.
due to a relatively high level of codominant inheritance and transferability within and among taxonomic groups, simple sequence repeat  markers are important elements in comparative mapping and delineation of genomic regions associated with traits of economic importance.
sequence analysis revealed that the ssr-containing genes span a diversity of functions and share more sequence identity with strawberry genes than with other rosaceous species.
leaf and meristem tissue from ‘heritage’ red raspberry  and ‘bristol’ black raspberry  were utilized for rna extraction.
to accelerate development of est-ssrs in the genus rubus ,  <dig> and  <dig> cdna sequences were generated from red raspberry and black raspberry, respectively.
the cdna sequences were screened using rigorous filtering criteria which resulted in the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> ssr loci for red and black raspberry, respectively.
