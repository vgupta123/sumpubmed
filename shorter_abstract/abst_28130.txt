the transcriptome analysis revealed specific and common features of the immune responses depending on the stimulation agent that increase knowledge on pig immunity.
the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip was found to accurately decipher two distinct immune response activations of pbmcs indicating that it constitutes a valuable tool to further study immunity and resistance to disease in pig.
our results provide preliminary data suggesting that antisense transcripts mapping to the sla complex may have a role during immune response.
a long-oligonucleotide-based chip referred to as sla-ri/nrsp8-13k was produced by combining a generic set with a newly designed sla-ri set that targets all annotated loci of the pig major histocompatibility complex  region  in both orientations as well as immunity genes outside the sla complex.
in order to address questions related to immunity and resistance to disease in pig, it is necessary to increase knowledge on its immune system and to produce efficient tools dedicated to this species.
repression of mhc class ii genes was observed after both stimulations.
transcriptome analysis revealed that ten times more genes were differentially expressed after pma/ionomycin stimulation than after lps stimulation.
pma/ionomycin stimulation induced a stronger up-regulation of t cell activation than of b cell activation with dominance toward a th <dig> response, including il <dig>  cd <dig> and tnfrsf <dig>  genes.
repression of mhc class i genes was observed after pma/ionomycin stimulation despite an up-regulation of the gene cascade involved in peptide processing.
the chip was used to study the immune response of pigs following stimulation of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with lipopolysaccharide  or a mixture of phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin for  <dig> hours.
designing sustainable animal production systems that better balance productivity and resistance to disease is a major concern.
lps stimulation induced a general inflammation response with over-expression of saa <dig>  pro-inflammatory chemokines il <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> as well as genes related to oxidative processes  and calcium pathways .
