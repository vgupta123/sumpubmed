this paper represents the first report of a bifunctional regulatory enzyme catalysing an adp-dependent phosphorylation and a pi-dependent pyrophosphorylation reaction in bacteria.
this paper describes the cloning and expression of both peps and duf <dig> from e. coli and establishes that e. coli duf <dig> catalyzes both the adp-dependent inactivation and the pi-dependent activation of peps.
it also catalyses the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis.
