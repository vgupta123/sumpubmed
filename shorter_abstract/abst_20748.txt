here, we start with three human proteins, srpx, srpx <dig> and ccdc <dig>  involved in tumor suppression and progression, which possess a conserved region of similarity.
incidentally, consistent overexpression of all three human p-dudes genes in two public glioblastoma microarray gene expression datasets was discovered.
we show, using bioinformatics approaches, that the p-dudes domain, surprisingly, adopts the thioredoxin-like  fold.
this finding is discussed in the context of the tumor suppressor role that has been ascribed to p-dudes proteins in several studies.
majority of non-redundant p-dudes proteins are found in marine metagenome, and among the bacterial species possessing this domain a trend for a higher proportion of aquatic species is observed.
structure and function prediction allowed the definition of p-dudes, a phylogenetically widespread, possibly ancient protein structural domain, common to vertebrates and many bacterial species.
