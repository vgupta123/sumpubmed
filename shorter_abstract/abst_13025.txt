hpa axis plays a major role in physiological homeostasis.
microarray analysis identified  <dig> unique genes of which expression responded to the injection of acth .
a multilevel statistical analysis was used to take into account the longitudinal aspect of the data.
these genes might be candidates for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the stress response.
basal level of cortisol was correlated with birth and weaning weights.
in farm animals in general and specifically in pigs, breeding strategies have highly favored production traits such as lean growth rate, feed efficiency and prolificacy at the cost of robustness.
in particular, ddit <dig>  dusp <dig>  fkbp <dig>  il7r, nfkbia, per <dig>  rgs <dig> and rhob were shown to be connected to each other by the glucocorticoid receptor nr3c <dig>  most of the differentially expressed genes that encode transcription factors have not been described yet as being important in transcription networks involved in stress response.
we used acth injections to trigger production of cortisol in  <dig> juvenile large white  pigs from  <dig> litters and the kinetics of the response was measured with biological variables and whole blood gene expression at  <dig> time points.
cortisol level reached its peak  <dig> h after acth injection.
these genes were classified into  <dig> clusters with distinctive kinetics in response to acth injection.
we identified  <dig> genes as biological markers of hpa axis activation at the gene expression level.
their co-expression may mean co-regulation and they could thus provide new patterns of biomarkers of the individual sensitivity to cortisol.
on the hypothesis that the hpa axis could contribute to the trade-off between robustness and production traits, we have designed this experiment to explore individual variation in the biological response to the main stress hormone, cortisol, in pigs.
