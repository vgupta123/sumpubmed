these vectors are then processed and transformed to sparse feature vectors that are treated as statistical fingerprints of the query proteins.
detecting homology between remotely related protein families is an important problem in computational biology since the biological properties of uncharacterized proteins can often be inferred from those of homologous proteins.
we describe an algorithm that improves over the state of the art in homology detection by utilizing global information on the proximity of entities in the protein space.
our method relies on a vectorial representation of proteins and protein families and uses structure-specific association measures between proteins and template structures to form a high-dimensional feature vector for each query protein.
however, these methods do not exploit collective aspects of the protein space and the computed scores are often noisy and frequently fail to recognize distantly related protein families.
