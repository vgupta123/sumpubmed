we demonstrate that significant phenotype consensus  is observable for ~67% of  <dig>  omim disease-gene associations, using a combination of high quality string interactions + metabase pathways and use joubert syndrome to demonstrate the ease with which a significant result can be interrogated to highlight discriminatory traits linked to mechanistically related genes.
we advocate phenotype consensus as an intuitive and versatile method to aid disease-gene association, which naturally lends itself to the mechanistic deconvolution of diverse phenotypes.
we provide pcan to the community as an r package  to allow flexible configuration, extension and standalone use or integration to supplement existing gene prioritization workflows.
