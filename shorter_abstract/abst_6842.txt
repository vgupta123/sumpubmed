vaccine formulations of lag with alum or saponin failed to reduce parasite burden in the liver, and alum + lag immunized mice also failed to reduce parasite burden in the spleen.
mechanistically, we found that failure of alum + lag to protect mice was associated with elevated levels of il- <dig>  whereas both il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels were increased in saponin + lag immunized mice.
in contrast, mice immunized intraperitoneally with lip + lag demonstrated significant protection in both liver and spleen, as expected.
on the contrary, protection against l. donovani challenge in lip + lag immunized mice was associated with elevated levels of ifn-γ in conjunction with low levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> production.
in contrast, a robust ifn-γ response, in the absence of il- <dig> and il- <dig> production, was associated with protective immunity following administration of the lip + lag vaccine.
visceral leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite leishmania donovani complex is a potentially fatal disease if left untreated.
these findings indicate that elevated levels of il- <dig> may contribute to lag vaccine failure, whereas combined elevation of il- <dig> together with il- <dig> exacerbated the disease as observed in saponin + lag immunized mice.
we therefore evaluated whether formulation of lag in combination with two commonly used human-compatible adjuvants, alum and saponin, could improve the protective efficacy of subcutaneously administered lag, to a level comparable to that of the intraperitoneal liposomal vaccination.
previously, we reported that intraperitoneal administration of leishmanial antigens  entrapped in liposomes conferred protection to balb/c mice against l. donovani challenge infection.
interestingly, saponin + lag vaccination actually resulted in an increased l. donovani parasitic load in the spleen following l. donovani challenge, suggesting this regimen exacerbates the infection.
this outcome served to exacerbate l. donovani infection in the saponin + lag group, despite a concurrent increase in proinflammatory ifn-γ production.
