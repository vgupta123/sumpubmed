we conducted a comparative proteomic study of tylcv infection in resistant and susceptible tomato cultivars.
in this study, a proteomic approach was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in tomato leaf defense against tylcv infection.
proteins extracted from leaves of resistant tomato cultivar ‘zheza-301’ and susceptible cultivar ‘jinpeng-1’ after tylcv infection were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
a putative interaction network between tomato leaves and tylcv infection provides us with important information about the cellular activities that are involved in the response to tylcv infection.
for several of the proteins, including cdc <dig>  chi and hsc <dig>  expression patterns measured using quantitative real-time pcr differed from the results of the proteomic analysis.
the proteins identified in our work show a variety of functions and expression patterns in the process of tomato–tylcv interaction, and these results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying tylcv resistance in tomatoes at the protein level.
tomato yellow leaf curl virus  is a member of the family geminiviridae, genus begomovirus.
