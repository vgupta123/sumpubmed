no genes homologous to the a. tumefaciens ti plasmid vir genes appeared to be present in the ov <dig> genome.
unexpectedly, ov <dig> and  <dig> were found to possess homologs to chromosomal based genes cited as essential to a. tumefaciens t-dna transfer.
the sequencing and analysis of the ov <dig> genome increases our understanding of t-dna transfer by non-agrobacterium species and creates a platform for the continued improvement of ensifer-mediated transformation .
all protein coding regions in the ov <dig> genome were functionally grouped based on an eggnog database.
recently it has been shown that ensifer adhaerens can be used as a plant transformation technology, transferring genes into several plant genomes when equipped with a ti plasmid.
