transient expression assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, pull-down assays, and western blot analysis were used to demonstrate that the coactivator p <dig> and histone acetyltransferase pcaf specifically interact with the retroviral trans-activator bel1/tas in vivo.
this is the first report of a c/h <dig> domain-interacting retroviral trans-activator capable of partially blocking the strong bel1/tas-mediated activation of the c-terminal region of coactivator p <dig>  the potential mechanisms and functional roles of the three histone and factor acetyltransferases p <dig>  pcaf, and src- <dig> in bel1/tas-mediated trans-activation are discussed.
since the acetylation activities of the three coactivators reside in or bind to the c-terminal regions of p <dig>  a c/h <dig> expression plasmid was used as inhibitor.
the bel1/tas-interacting region was mapped to the c/h <dig> domain of p <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays.
cellular coactivators interacting with bel1/tas are unknown to date.
foamy virus bel1/tas trans-activators act as key regulators of gene expression and directly bind to bel <dig> response elements  in both the internal and the 5'ltr promoters leading to strong transcriptional trans-activation.
