furthermore, we use a comprehensive in silico approach that leverages encode data to identify several known tfs such as ap <dig>  ap <dig> and novel tfs  that can potentially cooperate with p <dig> to modulate its myriad biological functions in keratinocytes.
collectively, our results suggest that p <dig> might actively remodel and/or influence chromatin dynamics at its target sites and in the process dictate its own dna binding and possibly that of adjacent tfs.
furthermore, ectopic expression of p <dig> alone is sufficient to convert simple epithelium into stratified epithelial tissues in vivo and p <dig> is required for efficient transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into keratinocytes.
but, in human keratinocytes less than  <dig>  of these sites are bound in vivo suggesting that underlying chromatin architecture and cooperating tfs mediate p63-genome interactions.
we find that the chromatin architecture at p63-bound targets possess distinctive features and can be used to categorize p <dig> targets into proximal promoters , enhancers  and repressed or inactive  regulatory elements.
p <dig>  which acts both as an activator and repressor of transcription, recognizes a canonical binding motif that occurs over  <dig> million times in the human genome.
our analysis shows that p <dig> bound genomic locations in keratinocytes are accessible, marked by active histone modifications, and co-targeted by other developmentally important transcriptional regulators.
however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of p <dig> function, in particular how it selects its target sites in the genome.
