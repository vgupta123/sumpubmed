we constructed a homology model of sfii in complex with its target sequence and used it to predict residues important for dimerization, tetramerization, dna binding and catalysis.
sfii is an archetypal type iif enzyme, which functions as a tetramer and cleaves two copies of the recognition site in a concerted manner.
the bioinformatics analysis suggest that sfii, a type iif enzyme, is more closely related to bgli, an "orthodox" type iip restriction enzyme, than to any other rease, including other type iif reases with known structures, such as ngomiv.
its sequence shows no similarity to other proteins and nothing is known about the localization of its active site or residues important for oligomerization.
hence, they are extremely hard targets for structure prediction and homology-based inference of sequence-function relationships and the great majority of reases remain structurally and evolutionarily unclassified.
using the threading approach for protein fold-recognition, we identified a remote relationship between sfii and bgli, a dimeric type iip restriction enzyme from the pd-dxk superfamily of nucleases, which recognizes the 5'gccnnnn^nggc3' sequence and whose structure in complex with the substrate dna is available.
sfii is a rease which recognizes the interrupted palindromic sequence 5'ggccnnnn^nggcc3' and generates  <dig> nt long 3' overhangs upon cleavage.
the model of sfii will also serve as a convenient platform for further experimental analyses.
