kr√ºppel-like factor  <dig>  plays an important role in vessel maturation during embryonic development.
electron micrographs confirm that there are gaps in the phv endothelial layer in e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos, and show that the endothelial cells are abnormally bulbous compared to klf2-/- and wild-type .
endothelial breaks are observed in a major vessel, the primary head vein , in klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos at e <dig> .
klf <dig> and klf <dig> positively regulate the enos, vegfr <dig> and occludin genes.
this study begins to define the roles of klf <dig> and klf <dig> in the embryonic development of blood vessels.
klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos die by e <dig> , which is earlier than either single knockout.
down-regulation of these genes in klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos may result in the observed loss of vascular integrity.
in adult mice, klf <dig> regulates expression of the tight junction protein occludin, which may allow klf <dig> to maintain vascular integrity.
it indicates that the two genes interact to maintain an intact endothelial layer.
vegfr <dig>  an enos inducer, and occludin, a tight junction protein, gene expression are also reduced in e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4-/- compared to klf2-/- and wt embryos.
