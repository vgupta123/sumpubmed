this study describes a large-scale manual re-annotation of data samples in the gene expression omnibus , using variables and values derived from the national cancer institute thesaurus.
we show that it is possible to perform manual re-annotation of a large repository in a reliable manner.
the annotation structure is evaluated by measuring coverage and agreement between annotators.
there were  <dig>  samples annotated with approximately  <dig> variables, in each of six disease categories â€“ breast cancer, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and type  <dig> diabetes mellitus .
a framework is described for creating an annotation scheme for various diseases that is flexible, comprehensive, and scalable.
the annotators provided excellent variable coverage, with known values for over 98% of three critical variables: disease state, tissue, and sample type.
