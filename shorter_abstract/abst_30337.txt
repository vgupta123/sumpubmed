this study aimed to select and develop wine yeast strains that well adapt to ferment at low temperature through evolutionary engineering, and to decipher the process underlying the obtained phenotypes.
evolutionary engineering was accomplished by using the natural yeast mutation rate and mutagenesis procedures.
the evolved strains showed improved growth and low-temperature fermentation performance compared to the ancestral strain.
genome sequencing of the evolved strain revealed the presence of a snp in the gaa <dig> gene and the construction of a site-directed mutant  in a derivative haploid of the ancestral strain resulted in improved fermentation performance.
wine produced at low temperature is often considered to improve sensory qualities.
however, there are certain drawbacks to low temperature fermentations: e.g.
selection and development of new saccharomyces cerevisiae strains well adapted at low temperature is interesting for future biotechnological applications.
in this study we demonstrate the importance of inositol and mannoproteins in yeast adaptation at low temperature and the central role of the gaa <dig> gene by linking both metabolisms.
this improvement was acquired only under inositol limitation.
the transcriptomic comparison between the evolved and parental strains showed the greatest up-regulation in four mannoprotein coding genes, which belong to the dan/tir family .
low growth rate, long lag phase, and sluggish or stuck fermentations.
