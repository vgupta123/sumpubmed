stat <dig> expression is induced rapidly upon addition of dimerizer and expression levels can be regulated in a dose-dependent manner.
the functionality of the dimerizer-induced stat <dig> system is demonstrated in vitro in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells.
these results prove that the dimerizer-induced system is a powerful tool for stat <dig> analysis in vitro and provide evidence that the system is suitable for the use in transgenic mice.
stat <dig> has been mainly characterized by its role in interferon  type i and ii signaling and stat <dig> deficiency leads to high susceptibility to several pathogens.
furthermore we show that in transgenic mice stat <dig> can be induced upon stimulation with the dimerizer, although only at low levels.
reconstitution of stat <dig> deficient cells with inducible stat <dig> restores ifnÎ³-mediated gene induction, antiviral responses and stat <dig> activation remains dependent on cytokine stimulation.
to our knowledge this is the first report for inducible stat <dig> expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
