despite the advances in our understanding of aging-associated behavioral decline, relatively little is known about how aging affects neural circuits that regulate specific behaviors, particularly the expression of genes in specific neural circuits during aging.
bioinformatics analyses of these genes have identified specific biological pathways that are up or downregulated in mature and old neurons.
we find that aging is associated with bidirectional changes in gene expression.
we examined changes in gene expression in r <dig> neurons during aging by microarray analyses of rnas from two different age groups, mature and old animals.
furthermore, qpcr analysis of single r <dig> neurons to quantify expression levels of candidate regulators involved in transcription  and translation  showed that aging is associated with a decrease in expression of these regulators, and similar analysis in three other neurons  showed that gene expression change during aging could be bidirectional.
evaluation of gene expression changes in different neurons suggests specific transcriptomic signature of single neurons during aging.
we have addressed this by exploring a peptidergic neuron r <dig>  an identified neuron of the marine snail aplysia californica.
