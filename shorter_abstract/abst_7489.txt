the present study uses a transcriptomic approach to characterize the gene expression profile from the non-stimulated venom gland of tityus stigmurus scorpion.
this investigation provides the first global view of gene expression of the venom gland from tityus stigmurus under resting conditions.
this approach enables characterization of a large number of venom gland component molecules, which belong either to known or non yet described types of venom peptides and proteins from the buthidae family.
our analysis indicated that 34% of the transcripts encode “other possible venom molecules”, which correspond to anionic peptides, hypothetical secreted peptides, metalloproteinases, cystein-rich peptides and lectins.
the scorpion tityus stigmurus is widely distributed in northeastern brazil and known to cause severe human envenoming, inducing pain, hyposthesia, edema, erythema, paresthesia, headaches and vomiting.
