with respect to hiv- <dig>  the sets c∪r, d∪r, c∪d∪r infer all known interactions between hiv <dig> and human proteins mediated by linear motifs.
we have developed a method for predicting protein-protein interactions mediated by linear motifs between hiv- <dig> and human proteins.
given that viral linear motif instances of host motif regular expressions can be found by chance, it is necessary to develop filtering methods of functional linear motifs.
short linear motifs in host organisms proteins can be mimicked by viruses to create protein-protein interactions that disable or control metabolic pathways.
we conduct a systematic comparison of linear motifs filtering methods to develop a computational approach for predicting motif-mediated protein-protein interactions between human and the human immunodeficiency virus  <dig> .
the resulting sets are compared by the number of protein-protein interactions correctly inferred with them – with experimental validation.
we can extend the software developed to any other eukaryotic virus and host in order to find and rank candidate interactions.
we implemented three filtering methods to obtain linear motif sets: 1) conserved in viral proteins , 2) located in disordered regions  and 3) rare or scarce in a set of randomized viral sequences .
the method only use protein sequences as inputs.
we found that the majority of conserved linear motifs in the virus are located in disordered regions.
