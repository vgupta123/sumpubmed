importantly, immunized animals showed no signs of recurrent disease or viral shedding during a 60-days observation period after recovery from primary infection, and carried 50-fold less latent viral dna load in their dorsal root ganglia than the surviving mock-vaccinated controls .
collectively, we demonstrate that vaccination with the hsv- <dig> recombinant cj9-gd elicits strong and protective immune responses against primary and recurrent hsv- <dig> genital disease and significantly reduces the extent of latent infection.
cj9-gd is a novel dominant-negative recombinant herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  that is completely replication-defective, cannot establish detectable latent infection in vivo, and expresses high levels of the major hsv- <dig> antigen glycoprotein d immediately following infection.
in the present study, cj9-gd was evaluated as a vaccine against hsv- <dig> genital infection in guinea pigs.
after challenge with wild-type hsv- <dig>  all  <dig> control guinea pigs developed multiple genital lesions with an average of  <dig> lesions per animal.
animals immunized with cj9-gd developed at least 700-fold higher titers of hsv-2-specific neutralization antibodies than mock-immunized controls.
