we demonstrate the performance of our approach on de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of  <dig> species of apoid wasps  as well as on published genomic datasets.
additionally, we release  <dig> de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of apoid wasp species.
with orthograph, we implemented a best reciprocal hit approach to reference-based orthology prediction for coding nucleotide sequences such as rnaseq data.
orthograph applies a best reciprocal hit search strategy using profile hidden markov models and maps nucleotide sequences to the globally best matching cluster of orthologous genes, thus enabling researchers to conveniently and reliably delineate orthologs and paralogs from transcriptomic and genomic sequence data.
here, identification of orthologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be achieved using a graph-based approach that maps nucleotide sequences to genes of known orthology.
orthologous genes in two organisms can be identified by applying a so-called reciprocal search strategy, given that complete information of the organismsâ€™ gene repertoire is available.
orthology characterizes genes of different organisms that arose from a single ancestral gene via speciation, in contrast to paralogy, which is assigned to genes that arose via gene duplication.
