a decrease in paw withdrawal latency  after a heat stimulus was documented in rats that received inflammatory injections in their left hind paws on postnatal day one  and a reinflammation stimulus at postnatal 6- <dig> weeks of age, compared with normal rats.
our results indicate that peripheral inflammation in neonates can permanently alter the pain processing pathway during the subsequent sensory stimulation of the region.
we investigated neuronal sensitivity to a noxious stimulus in a rat model of neonatal hind-paw peripheral inflammation and assessed changes in pain behaviour at the physiological and molecular levels after peripheral reinflammation in adulthood.
an increase in the expression of the prodynorphin  gene was noted after reinflammation in the spinal cord ipsilateral to the afferents of the neonatally treated hind paw.
