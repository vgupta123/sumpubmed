a phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.
these peaks correlate with two major classes of cancer genes, the 'caretakers', which are involved in general functions that support genome stability and the 'gatekeepers', which are involved in cellular signalling and growth processes.
cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism.
we find two strong peaks of the emergence of cancer related protein domains, one at the time of the origin of the first cell and the other around the time of the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms.
although we find that a significant number of protein domains involved in cancer predate the origin of multicellularity, the second peak of cancer protein domain emergence is, indeed, connected to a phylogenetic level where multicellular animals have emerged.
phylostratigraphy is a method used to correlate the evolutionary origin of founder genes  of gene families with particular macroevolutionary transitions.
it is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms.
interestingly, this phylogenetic succession mirrors the ontogenetic succession of tumour progression, where mutations in caretakers are thought to precede mutations in gatekeepers.
