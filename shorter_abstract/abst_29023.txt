we propose a new approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the probability that a gene set replicates in future studies.
we show our method estimates the replication probability , the probability that a gene set will replicate as a significant result in future studies, and show in simulations that this method reflects replication better than each setâ€™s p-value.
our results suggest that gene lists based on p-values are not necessarily stable, and therefore additional steps like gene set bagging may improve biological inference on gene sets.
gene set bagging involves resampling the original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled data, and confirming that biological categories replicate in the bagged samples.
significance analysis plays a major role in identifying and ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, dna methylation regions, and other high-throughput features associated with illness.
