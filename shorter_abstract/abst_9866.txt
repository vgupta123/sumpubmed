likely positions of individual side-chains are given by a rotamer library; this library is used to derive a sample of possible mutual conformations within the patch.
we control the size of the sample by using energy criteria to eliminate unlikely configurations, and by clustering similar configurations, resulting in  <dig> candidates for a patch, a manageable number for docking.
using a database of protein dimers for which the bound and unbound structures of the monomers are known, we show that from the unbound patch we are able to generate candidates for docking that approximate the bound structure.
we enforce broad coverage of torsion space.
we divide the surfaces of each protein into local patches and describe the effect of side-chain flexibility on each patch by sampling the space of conformations of its side-chains.
the problem of determining the physical conformation of a protein dimer, given the structures of the two interacting proteins in their unbound state, is a difficult one.
