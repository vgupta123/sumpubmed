2) we predict and validate the expression level of a transcription factor involved in pluripotency.
highlighting is based on a simple formula inspired by the law of mass action.
reducing the size of gene/protein networks to the few links affected by large changes allows to screen for putative mechanistic relationships among the genes/proteins that are involved in adaptation to different experimental conditions, yielding important hypotheses, insights and suggestions for new experiments.
we can interactively modify the threshold for highlighting and instantaneously visualize results.
for example, large amounts of microarray and deep sequencing data are becoming available, describing a variety of experimental conditions such as gene knockout and knockdown, the effect of interventions, and the differences between tissues and cell lines.
we applied expressence to three scenarios describing kidney podocyte biology, pluripotency and ageing: 1) we identify putative processes involved in podocyte differentiation and validate one prediction experimentally.
as input we take a network of interaction, stimulation and/or inhibition links between genes/proteins, and differential data, such as gene expression data, tracking an intervention or development in time.
experimentalists are overwhelmed by high-throughput data and there is an urgent need to condense information into simple hypotheses.
