the w-unifrac is a weighted sum of branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree of the sequences from the communities.
vaw-unifrac can recover biological insights that cannot be revealed by other beta diversity measures, and it provides a novel alternative for comparing communities.
both simulations and applications to real data show that vaw-unifrac can satisfactorily measure differences between communities, considering not only the species composition but also abundance information.
we develop a new statistic termed variance adjusted weighted unifrac  to compare two communities based on the phylogenetic relationships of the individuals.
next, all three methods were applied to analyze three large 16s rrna sequence collections, including human skin bacteria, mouse gut microbial communities, microbial communities from hypersaline soil and sediments, and a tropical forest census data.
beta diversity, which involves the assessment of differences between communities, is an important problem in ecological studies.
many statistical methods have been developed to quantify beta diversity, and among them, unifrac and weighted-unifrac  are widely used.
