integration of the different components of the deuterator coupled with the flexibility of common data file formats allow this system to be accessible to the broadening h/d exchange community.
the system has been used successfully in a production environment for over one year and is freely available as a web tool at the project home page .
the factors that contribute to this bottleneck are the large number of data points produced in a typical experiment, each requiring manual curation and validation, and then calculation of the level of backbone amide exchange.
the results, if necessary, can then be confirmed, adjusted, re-calculated and saved.
saved results can then be used to plot deuterium buildup curves and 3d structural overlays.
existing common file formats have been leveraged to allow compatibility with the output from the myriad of ms instrument platforms and peptide sequence database search engines.
the automated calculation and presentation of h/d exchange data in a user interface enables scientists to organize and analyze data efficiently.
we have developed an integrated software system for the automated analysis and representation of h/d exchange data that has been titled "the deuterator".
the combination of mass spectrometry and solution phase amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange  experiments is an effective method for characterizing protein dynamics, and protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions.
novel approaches have been implemented that enable high throughput analysis, automated determination of deuterium incorporation, and deconvolution of overlapping peptides.
to date there is no software for the analysis of h/d exchange data that comprehensively addresses these issues.
