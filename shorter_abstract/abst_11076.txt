certain epimedium species are endangered due to commercial overexploition, while sustainable application studies, conservation genetics, systematics, and marker-assisted selection  of epimedium is less-studied due to the lack of molecular markers.
thirty-two ssr-ests are randomly selected and primer pairs are synthesized for testing the transferability across  <dig> epimedium species.
eighteen primer pairs  could be successfully transferred to epimedium species and sixteen of those show high genetic diversity with  <dig>  of observed heterozygosity  and  <dig>  of expected heterozygosity  and high number of alleles per locus .
therefore, this est dataset and est-ssrs will be a powerful resource for further studies such as taxonomy, molecular breeding, genetics, genomics, and secondary metabolism in epimedium species.
the raw reads are cleaned and assembled into a total of  <dig>  consensus sequences comprising of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets.
about  <dig> %  of the consensus sequences significantly match to the non-redundant protein database ,  <dig>  of which are further annotated using gene ontology  terms.
a large est dataset with a total of  <dig>  consensus sequences is generated, aiming to provide sequence information for deciphering secondary metabolism, especially for flavonoid pathway in epimedium.
a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs is identified from the epimedium est dataset.
the dominant repeat motif is aag/ctt  followed by ag/ct , acc/ggt , at/at , and aac/gtt .
a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs is identified from est dataset and ~ <dig> est-ssr markers are transferable.
here, we report a set of expressed sequence tags  and simple sequence repeats  identified in these ests for e. sagittatum.
cdnas of e. sagittatum are sequenced using  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing technology.
e. sagittatum est-ssr transferability to the major epimedium germplasm is up to  <dig> %.
