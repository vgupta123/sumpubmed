to perform two-color acgh experiments with multistrain microarrays, the choice of control sample can be the genomic dna of one strain or a mixture of all the strains used in the array design.
we performed a comparative study of the two control sample options with a streptococcus pneumoniae microarray designed with three fully sequenced strains.
as genomic sequences from multiple strains of the same species become available, multistrain microarrays are designed, containing spots for every unique gene in all sequenced strains.
following this analysis, the use of a mix control leads to higher accuracies .
the use of a single strain control increases the error rate in genes that are part of the accessory genome, where more variation across unsequenced strains is expected, further justifying the use of the mix control.
microarray comparative genomic hybridization  evaluates the distribution of genes of sequenced bacterial strains among unsequenced strains of the same or related species.
we separately hybridized two of these strains  as test samples using the third strain alone  or a mixture of the three strains as control.
