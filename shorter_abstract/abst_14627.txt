the method creates new variables then used in the cluster analysis indicating  <dig> clusters with  <dig> different facial types: normal, prognathia inferior and brachygnathia inferior.
molar and premolar malocclusions were revealed in two of three clusters.
craniofacial morphology of sheep with phenotypically observed mandibular distocclusion was analysed using the multivariate techniques principle component analysis and cluster analysis in order to test whether different types of craniofacial malformations can be distinguished.
the correlations to the temporomandibular joint were shown.
the results showed  <dig> principal components with a variance of  <dig> Â % in the database.
the brachygnathic facial type was mainly characterised as a shortened mandible, the upper jaw is not significantly involved.
