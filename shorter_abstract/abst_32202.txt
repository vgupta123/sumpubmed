we speculate that eps <dig> recruitment to ubiquitin-rich endosomes may reduce the level of eps <dig> at the plasma membrane, slowing endocytosis to allow time for processing of ubiquitinated cargo in endosomes.
endosomal recruitment required the uim domains, but not the n-terminal eh domains or central coiled-coil domains, of eps <dig>  silencing of the endosomal eps <dig> binding partner hrs did not affect recruitment of eps <dig> to ubiquitin-enriched endosomes.
we show that accumulation of ubiquitinated cargo can recruit eps <dig> to endosomes via uim domain interactions.
eps <dig> silencing did not affect lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated erbb2; however, gfp-fyve-ubÎ”gg overexpression inhibited internalization of egfr and transferrin receptor.
among other interactions, eps <dig> binds ubiquitin via uim domains, recruiting ubiquitinated cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles.
eps <dig> is an endocytic adaptor protein that stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
