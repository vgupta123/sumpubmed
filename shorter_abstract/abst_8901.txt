the stimulatory effect of the human replication protein a  on both wrn- and blm-dependent unwinding was also re-examined in light of its possible role in preventing re-annealing.
similarly, the addition of trap strand stimulated the ability of blm to unwind long and blunt-ended duplexes.
our investigation into the competition between annealing and unwinding demonstrates that, under standard reaction conditions, wrn- or blm-mediated annealing can partially or completely mask unwinding as measured in standard helicase assays.
interestingly, if a dna oligomer complementary to one strand of the dna substrate to be unwound is added during the helicase reaction, both wrn and blm unwinding is enhanced, presumably by preventing protein-mediated re-annealing.
our results show that hrpa influences the outcome of wrn and blm helicase assays by both inhibiting re-annealing and directly promoting unwinding, with the larger contribution from the latter mechanism.
these findings indicate that measurements of unwinding by wrn, blm, and probably other recq helicases are complicated by their annealing properties.
this strategy allowed measurement of wrn-catalyzed unwinding of long  duplex regions and fully complementary, blunt-ended duplexes, both of which were otherwise quite refractory to the helicase activity of wrn.
several strategies were employed to suppress the annealing activity so that the actual strength of wrn- or blm-dependent unwinding could be more accurately assessed.
