the polyadenylation process requires two components, the cis-elements on the mrna and a group of protein factors that recognize the cis-elements and produce the poly tail.
these results offer a roadmap for further functional characterizations of the protein factors, and for building models when testing the genetic contributions of these genes in plant growth and development.
these interactions organize into three distinct hubs involving the arabidopsis polyadenylation factors.
out of  <dig> pair-wise protein-protein interaction assays done using the yeast two-hybrid system,  <dig>  showed positive interactions.
by protein sequence homology search using human and yeast polyadenylation factors, we identified  <dig> proteins that may be components of arabidopsis polyadenylation machinery.
in recent years, it has been demonstrated that the polyadenylation process is also involved in the regulation of gene expression.
here we report a comprehensive pairwise protein-protein interaction mapping and gene expression profiling of the mrna polyadenylation protein machinery in arabidopsis.
when comparing the gene expression profiles extracted from publicly available microarray datasets, some of the polyadenylation related genes showed tissue-specific expression, suggestive of potential different polyadenylation complex configurations.
the gene expression profiles are indicative that specialized sub-complexes may be formed to carry out targeted processing of mrna in different developmental stages and tissue types.
