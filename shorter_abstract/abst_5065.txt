gene expression of il- <dig>  il-1β, tnf-α, mmp- <dig>  cd11b and gfap were semiquantitatively analyzed by rtpcr of the penumbra.
with respect to infarct volumes, neurological deficits and mortality.
<dig> hrs after reperfusion, rats were neurologically tested, euthanized and infarct volumes determined.
solulin significantly reduced mean total , cortical , and basal ganglia  infarct volumes.
hippocampal infarct volumes  were not significantly affected.
solulin reduced mean total, cortical and basal ganglia infarct volumes and regulated a subset of cytokines and proteases after tmcao suggesting the potency of this compound for therapeutic interventions.
thrombolysis after acute ischemic stroke has only proven to be beneficial in a subset of patients.
the soluble recombinant analogue of human thrombomodulin, solulin, was studied in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemic stroke.
