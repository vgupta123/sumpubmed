previous work on whole genome doubling in plants established the importance of gene functional category in provoking or suppressing duplicate gene loss, or fractionation.
other studies, particularly in paramecium have correlated levels of gene expression with vulnerability or resistance to duplicate loss.

we demonstrate function category and expression level have independent effects, though expression does not play the dominant role it does in paramecium.
