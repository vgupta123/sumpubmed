this is the first demonstration of the effectiveness of the tffbr in the inactivation of aeromonas hydrophila at high sunlight intensities, providing proof-of-concept for the application of solar photocatalysis in aquaculture systems.
in recent years, several different types of solar photocatalytic reactors coated with tio <dig> have been developed for waste water and drinking water treatment.
the level of inactivation of the aquaculture pathogen aeromonas hydrophila atcc  <dig> was determined after travelling across the tffbr under various natural sunlight conditions , at  <dig> different flow rates .
the results clearly demonstrate that high sunlight intensities  and low flow rates  provided optimum conditions for inactivation of a. hydrophila atcc  <dig>  with greater overall inactivation and fewer sub-lethally injured cells than at low sunlight intensities or high flow rates.
outbreaks of infectious diseases by microbial pathogens can cause substantial losses of stock in aquaculture systems.
low sunlight intensities resulted in reduced overall inactivation and greater sub-lethal injury at all flow rates.
titanium dioxide  is a photocatalyst that increases the effectiveness of solar disinfection.
