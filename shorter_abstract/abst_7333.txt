the phylogenetic tree is constructed from the composite distance matrix using a neighbor joining method.
with the increasing availability of whole genome sequences, it is becoming more and more important to use complete genome sequences for inferring species phylogenies.
in comparison to several other phylogenetic analysis methods, our method showed consistently better performance.
we have achieved above 90% agreement in quartet topologies between the tree created by our method and the tree from the bergey's taxonomy.
we developed a new tool comphy, 'composite distance phylogeny', based on a composite distance matrix calculated from the comparison of complete gene sets between genome pairs to produce a prokaryotic phylogeny.
the composite distance between two genomes is defined by three components: gene dispersion distance , genome breakpoint distance  and gene content distance .
