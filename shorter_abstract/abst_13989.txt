the differentially expressed mitochondrial genes were cytochrome b , cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> and  <dig>  and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

the relative abundance of these genes ranged from  <dig> to 885-fold according to the microarray results.
as expected, the array revealed differential expression of transcription factors and coregulators; however the greatest difference between the two cell lines was in genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome.
the cells may differ in mtdna copy number, number of mitochondria, or regulation of the mitochondrial genome.
it is possible that the greater expression of the mitochondrial genes in the amygdalar cells reflects higher energy requirements than in the hypothalamic cell line.
of the  <dig>  genes,  <dig>  genes in ar- <dig> were expressed at ≥ 2-fold relative to ivbs,  <dig>  genes were expressed at ≥2-fold in ivb relative to ar- <dig> and  <dig>  genes were expressed at similar levels between the two cell lines.
given that both hypothalamus and amygdala have overlapping functions, but their crh-expressing neurons may respond differently to a given perturbation, we sought to identify differentially expressed genes between two neuronal cell types, amygdalar ar- <dig> and hypothalamic ivb cells.
the greatest difference was in six mitochondrial dna-encoded genes, which were highly abundant in ar- <dig> relative to ivb cells.
our hypothesis was that we would identify differentially expressed transcription factors, coregulators and chromatin-modifying enzymes.
a total of  <dig>  genes were analyzed,  <dig>  of which were consistently expressed in both cell lines at a 95% confidence level.
differential expression of these genes was verified by rtqpcr.
