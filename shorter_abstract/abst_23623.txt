in contrast, genes involved in secondary metabolism were expressed at higher levels in tamrabta, and photosynthesis-related genes were expressed more highly in leiria.
in addition, increased levels of hormones such as abscisic acid, gibberellins, jasmonic and salicylic acid were observed in leiria.
both transcriptome platforms have proven to be useful resources, showing complementary and reliable results.
the results presented here highlight the different abilities of the two maritime pine populations to sense environmental conditions and reveal one type of regulation that can be ascribed to different genetic and epigenetic backgrounds.
in this study, we have conducted a deep analysis of the transcriptome in needles from two p. pinaster provenances, leiria  and tamrabta , which were grown in northern spain under the same conditions.
maritime pine  grows in a range of different climates in the southwestern mediterranean region and the existence of a variety of latitudinal ecotypes or provenances is well established.
