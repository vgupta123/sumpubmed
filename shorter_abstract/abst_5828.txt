in vivo imaging showed that the incs fill the gap left after the injury and can regenerate a new neuromast in the injury zone.
the potential to regenerate a neuromast after damage requires that progenitor cells  be temporarily released from an inhibitory signal produced by nearby schwann cells.
multiple cell types, both resident within the damaged tissue and recruited to the lesion site, have been shown to participate.
further, a single inc is able to divide and form all cell types in a regenerated neuromast and, during this process, it transiently expresses the sox <dig> gene, a neural progenitor cell marker.
however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation after injury, and their regulation by different cells types, are not fully understood.
regenerating damaged tissue is a complex process, requiring progenitor cells that must be stimulated to undergo proliferation, differentiation and, often, migratory behaviors and morphological changes.
the posterior lateral line  is a mechanosensory system that develops embryonically and is initially composed of seven to eight neuromasts distributed along the trunk and tail, connected by a continuous stripe of interneuromastic cells .
the incs remain in a quiescent state owing to the presence of underlying schwann cells.
this injury results in discontinuity of the incs, schwann cells, and the pll nerve.
we demonstrate a critical role for schwann cells as negative regulators of inc proliferation and neuromast regeneration, and that this inhibitory property is completely dependent on active erbb signaling.
we used electroablation in transgenic larvae expressing fluorescent proteins in pll components to completely ablate single neuromasts in larvae and adult fish.
they become activated during development to form intercalary neuromasts.
