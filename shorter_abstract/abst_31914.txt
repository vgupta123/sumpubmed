in human, Ψes are often associated with alternative splicing , and can have different parts of their sequence differentially spliced in alternative transcripts.
our results indicate the types of genes that harbour Ψes, and demonstrate that Ψes have non-random distribution within gene structures.
also, Ψes tend to be associated with some protein domains that are abundant generally, e.g., zinc-finger and immunoglobulin protein domains, but not others, e.g., egf-like domains.
here, we focus on the process of pseudogenization, but specifically for individual exons from genes.
in human, Ψes have significant over-representation for functional categories related to 'ion binding' and 'nucleic-acid binding', compared to duplicated exons in general.
it is at present unclear to what extent pseudogenization of individual exon duplications affects gene evolution, i.e., is it a random phenomenon, or is it associated with specific types of genes and encoded proteins, and positions in gene structures?
we gathered genomic evidence for pseudogenic exons , to examine for significant trends in their distribution across four mammalian genomes .
functional diversification of genes in mammalian genomes is engendered by a number of processes, e.g., gene duplication and alternative splicing.
