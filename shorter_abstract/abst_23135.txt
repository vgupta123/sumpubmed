here we have combined a large number of publically available microarray datasets derived from human primary cells and analysed large correlation graphs of these data.
we consider the regulation of genes in human primary cells and specifically in the human mononuclear phagocyte system.
of particular note is the fact that these data do not support the identity of putative markers of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, nor classification of m <dig> and m <dig> activation states, a current subject of debate within immunological field.
