many methods exist for selecting a representative topology for a set of unrooted trees, few exist for assigning branch lengths to a fixed topology, and even fewer for simultaneously setting the topology and branch lengths.
using results from a large number of simulations we assess the quality of a summary tree, measuring  how well it explains the sequence data under the model and  how close it is to the “truth”, i.e to the tree used to generate the sequences.
we empirically compare new and known methods for generating a summary tree.
using the results presented here, a user can choose the appropriate method based on the purpose of the summary tree.
however, there is very little research into locating a good representative for a set of rooted time trees like the ones obtained from a beast analysis.
