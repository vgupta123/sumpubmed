seven key stages of myogenesis  were studied in two breeds, pietrain and duroc, differing markedly in muscularity and muscle structure.
nine of the target transcripts showed higher than twofold differences in the expression between the two breeds .
in order to address this, we performed transcriptome profiling of prenatal skeletal muscle using differential display rt-pcr as on open system with the potential to detect novel transcripts.
the most frequent functional categories represented genes encoding myofibrillar proteins , genes involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling and extracellular matrix synthesis/remodeling , genes regulating gene expression , and metabolism genes .
the present study revealed several genes and novel transcripts not previously associated with myogenesis and expands our knowledge of genetic factors operating during myogenesis.
expression of thirteen transcripts along with five reference genes was further analyzed by means of real-time quantitative pcr.
postnatal muscle growth is largely depending on the number and size of muscle fibers.
genes that exhibited differences between the divergent breeds represent candidate genes for muscle growth and structure.
hence identification of genes and their networks governing prenatal development of skeletal muscles will provide insight into the control of muscle growth and facilitate finding the source of its variation.
