histopathological examination revealed severe enteritis with denudation of intestinal epithelium, severe broncho-interstitial pneumonia with macrophages within lung alveoli and extensive haemorrhages with depletion of lymphoid cells and infiltration of macrophages in the sinuses of spleen.
sequence analyses revealed closeness of bangladeshi strains with other recent asian isolates.
peste des petits ruminants , also known as goat plague, occurs in goats, sheep and related species.
field results are better indicators of pathogenicity of the circulating virus.
the striking histo-morphologic diagnosis of ppr was acute pneumonia and severe gastro-enteritis.
in lymph nodes, the cortical nodules were replaced by wide sinusoids with severe depletion of lymphocytes, infiltration of mononuclear cells and some giant cells in sub-capsular areas and medullary sinuses.
pathological investigations of natural outbreaks of ppr in balck bengal goats are very limited.
natural outbreaks of ppr in black bengal goats in bangladesh resulted in 75% and 59% flock morbidity and mortality, respectively, with a case fatality rate of 74%.
it is caused by a morbillivirus in the family paramyxoviridae.
pathology of ppr has been reported in different goat and sheep breeds from natural and experimental infections.
a detailed experimental pathological study on black bengal goats infected with recent isolates is required.
the current investigation was aimed at describing pathology and antigen localization in natural ppr infections in black bengal goats.
ppr virus antigen was found in pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages in lungs.
the severity of the disease varies with species, breed and immune status of the host.
viral rna could be detected by rt-pcr in  <dig> out of  <dig> nasal swab,  <dig> out of  <dig> blood and  <dig> out of  <dig> lymph node samples.
