to facilitate the curation and functional and evolutionary studies of cyps, we previously developed fungal cytochrome p <dig> database , which included cyps from  <dig> fungal and oomycete species.
here we present a new version of fcpd  with more data and an improved classification scheme.
updated families and clans can be accessed through the new version of the fcpd database.
although much of the extraordinary diversity of the pan-fungal cypome can be attributed to gene duplication and adaptive divergence, our analysis also suggests a few potential horizontal gene transfer events.
to augment their functional annotation, cyp clusters were mapped to david nelsonâ€™s p <dig> databases, which archive a total of  <dig>  manually curated cyps.
these features will facilitate functional annotation and classification of cyps encoded by newly sequenced fungal and oomycete genomes.
additionally, the classification system will aid in studying the roles of cyps in the evolution of fungal adaptation to specific ecological niches.
fcpd version  <dig>  provides a systematic and searchable catalogue of  <dig>  fungal cyp sequences  encoded by  <dig> fungal species and  <dig> cyp sequences  encoded by five oomycete species.
by optimizing the clustering pipeline, we were able to uncover  <dig> novel clans and to assign  <dig> orphan cyp families to specific clans.
additionally, over  <dig> clusters were functionally classified based on sequence similarity to experimentally characterized cyps.
the most dramatic expansions in fungi were observed in clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> , clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> , and family cyp <dig> .
despite the rapid growth of sequenced fungal and oomycete genomes and the resulting influx of predicted cyps, the vast majority of cyps remain functionally uncharacterized.
