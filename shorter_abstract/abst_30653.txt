we present the first comparison of the standard duplex adaptor protocol supplied by life technologies for use on the ion torrent pgm with an alternate single adaptor approach involving circligase .
a pool of small rna fragments of known composition was converted into a sequencing library using one of three protocols and sequenced on an ion torrent pgm.
a correlation between over-representation in sequenced libraries and degree of secondary structure has been reported previously, therefore we also investigated whether bias could be reduced by ligation with an enzyme that functions at a temperature not permissive for such structure.
over-represented sequences are more likely to be predicted to have secondary structure and to co-fold with adaptor sequences.
ligases that function at temperatures to remove the possible influence of secondary structure on library generation may be of value, although mth k97a is not effective in this case.
next-generation sequencing does not yield fully unbiased estimates for read abundance, which may impact on the conclusions that can be drawn from sequencing data.
the circlig protocol resulted in less over-representation of specific sequences than the standard protocol.
the ligation step in rna sequencing library generation is a known source of bias, motivating developments in enzyme technology and library construction protocols.
