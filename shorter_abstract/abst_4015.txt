measurements of codon usage in high versus low expression genes demonstrated reduced bias in both e. paniculata selfers.
we investigated patterns of nucleotide variation to assess the effect of inbreeding on the accumulation of deleterious mutations in three independently evolved selfing plants.
the effect of drift is predicted to reduce selective constraints on amino acid sequences of proteins and relax biased codon usage.
our findings are consistent with a small reduction in the efficacy of selection on protein sequences associated with transitions to selfing, and reduced selection in selfers on synonymous changes that influence codon usage.
using high-throughput sequencing, we assembled the floral transcriptomes of four individuals of eichhornia ; these included one outcrosser and two independently derived selfers of e. paniculata, and e. paradoxa, a selfing outgroup.
transitions from cross- to self-fertilization are associated with increased genetic drift rendering weakly selected mutations effectively neutral.
however, we found an elevation in the proportion of non-synonymous sites that were potentially deleterious in the e. paniculata selfers relative to the outcrosser.
