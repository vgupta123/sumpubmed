in the in vitro study, sdf-1α treatment increased da release and suppressed cell death induced by 6-ohda administration compared with the control groups.
all rats were evaluated behaviorally with cylinder test and amphetamine-induced rotation test for  <dig> month with consequent euthanasia for immunohistochemical evaluations.
rats receiving msc transplantation significantly ameliorated behaviorally both in cylinder test and amphetamine-induced rotation test compared with the control groups.
6-hydroxydopamine  was injected into the right striatum of female sd rats with subsequent administration of gfp-labeled mscs, fibroblasts,  or pbs at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda injection.
consequently, msc transplantation might exert neuroprotection on 6-ohda-exposed dopaminergic neurons at least partly through anti-apoptotic effects of sdf-1α.
the results demonstrate the potentials of intravenous msc administration for clinical applications, although further explorations are required.
correspondingly, rats with mscs displayed significant preservation in the density of tyrosine hydroxylase -positive fibers in the striatum and the number of th-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  compared to that of control rats.
