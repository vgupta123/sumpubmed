the curvature dispersion calculated by cyclically permuting the sequences revealed that the molecular bend loci were delocalized throughout the nucleosome core region and had varying degrees of intrinsic curvature.
intrinsic curvature has been shown to be dictated by the periodic recurrence of certain dinucleotides.
in the current study, these sequences have been analyzed with a view to understand their sequence-dependent structures.
the results points to the possibility of context dependent curvature of varying degrees to be associated with nucleosomal dna.
most eukaryotic dna contained in the nucleus is packaged by wrapping dna around histone octamers.
in order to achieve smooth wrapping of the dna around the histone octamer, the dna duplex should be able to deform and should possess intrinsic curvature.
the higher the stacking energy the more rigid the dna helix, thus it is natural to expect that sequences that are involved in wrapping around the histone octamer should be unstacked and possess intrinsic curvature.
higher order dna structures and the distribution of molecular bend loci associated with  <dig> base nucleosome core dna sequence from c. elegans and chicken have been analyzed using the theoretical model for dna curvature.
several genome-wide studies directed towards mapping of nucleosome positions have revealed periodicity associated with certain stretches of sequences.
the higher order structures associated with nucleosomes of c.elegans and chicken calculated from the sequences revealed heterogeneity with respect to the deviation of the dna axis.
