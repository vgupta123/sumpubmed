while bioconductorâ€™s methods and classes implemented in different packages manage individual experiments, there is not a standard class to properly manage different omic datasets from the same subjects.
we illustrate the use of multidataset in three common situations: 1) performing integration analysis with third party packages; 2) creating new methods and functions for omic data integration; 3) encapsulating new unimplemented data from any biological experiment.
to cover this need, we have developed multidataset, a new r class based on bioconductor standards, designed to encapsulate multiple data sets.
multidataset deals with the usual difficulties of managing multiple and non-complete data sets while offering a simple and general way of subsetting features and selecting samples.
in addition, most r/bioconductor packages that have been designed to integrate and visualize biological data often use basic data structures with no clear general methods, such as subsetting or selecting samples.
multidataset is a suitable class for data integration under r and bioconductor framework.
