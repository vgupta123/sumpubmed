horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in evolution because it sometimes allows recipient lineages to adapt to new ecological niches.
does horizontal gene transfer also impact phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of genomes and organisms?
are the detected transfers mainly false positives, or are they the tip of an iceberg of many transfer events most of which go undetected by current methods?
the power of detection was on average 97% using a 70% cut-off and  <dig> % with 90% cut-off for identifying conflicting bipartitions, while the rate of false positives was below  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the two cut-offs, respectively.
for the experiments performed here on average the au test at a 5% significance level detects  <dig> % of the transfers and 91% of the exchanges as significant.
the method and significance level to identify potential gene transfer events represent a trade-off between the frequency of erroneous identification  and the power to detect actual transfer events.
analyses using bipartition spectra appeared most successful in our test case.
here we explore how well some of these methods perform using in silico transfers between the terminal branches of a gamma proteobacterial, genome based phylogeny.
phylogenetic detection methods appear to be the method of choice to infer gene transfers, especially for ancient transfers and those followed by orthologous replacement.
rates of detected transfers should not be mistaken for the actual transfer rates; most analyses of gene transfers remain anecdotal.
