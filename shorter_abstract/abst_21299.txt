the functional classification of the reads was evaluated by counting the reads that correctly matched the functional data previously reported for the original genomes and calculating the number of over-represented functional categories in chimeric contigs.
however, the success is limited by the chimeric contigs occurring at all taxonomic levels.
minimo's non-chimeric contigs and genovo's long contigs excelled in taxonomy assignation and functional annotation, respectively.
additionally, the number of chimeras per contig and the lowest common ancestor were estimated in order to assess the effect of assembling on taxonomic and functional annotation.
assembling improves functional annotation by increasing accurate assignations and decreasing ambiguous hits between viruses and bacteria.

to address these issues, several bioinformatic tools have been specifically designed or adapted for metagenomics by improving read assembly and creating more sensitive methods for homology detection.
the main limitations in the analysis of viral metagenomes are perhaps the high genetic variability and the lack of information in extant databases.
we simulated two  <dig> viral metagenomes using genomes from ncbi's refseq database based on the list of actual viruses found in previously published metagenomes.
this study compares the performance of different available assemblers and taxonomic annotation software using simulated viral-metagenomic data.
tblastx stood out as the best approach for taxonomic annotation for virus identification.
the sensitivity and specificity of tblastx, phymmbl and the k-mer frequencies were measured by accurate predictions when comparing simulated reads against the ncbi virus genomes refseq database.
