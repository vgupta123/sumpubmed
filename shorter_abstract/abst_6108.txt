the historical perspective provided by a phylogenetic approach is complementary to the few studies in which ongoing mite activity has been documented.
a stowaway-like element resides within the fourth intron of a β-amylase gene in representatives of five genera in the wheat tribe, triticeae.
its presence vs. absence was examined with reference to the β-amylase gene tree topology, and in light of sequence comparisons of the β-amylase elements to triticeae stowaway elements in the entrez nucleotide database.
the β-amylase elements do not form a monophyletic group relative to other stowaway elements in entrez; most are more similar to elements from other loci in other triticeae genomes than they are to one another.
stowaway elements are short, non-autonomous dna transposons categorized as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements .
combined, the phylogenetic distribution, sequence variation, and entrez database comparisons indicate that a stowaway-like element has undergone multiple deletions from and insertions into the same site in β-amylase intron  <dig> during the history of the tribe.
while patterns of stowaway polymorphism across a phylogenetic data set do not allow evolutionary mechanisms to be inferred with certainty, they do provide insights into the dynamics of element evolution over an extended time scale.
among the sequences lacking the element, there are five distinct putative excision footprints  and two flanking deletions.
thus, a phylogenetic perspective on presence vs. absence of elements in an aligned data set can provide valuable historical insights into the dynamics of mite acquisition and loss.
the sequences that do contain elements are polyphyletic on the β-amylase tree, and their elements are divergent at the sequence level.
