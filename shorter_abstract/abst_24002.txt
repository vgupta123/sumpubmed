exercise training in thoroughbred racehorses results in coordinate changes in the gene expression of functional groups of genes related to metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and muscle structure.
among the  <dig> genes with decreased expression, mstn, a negative regulator of muscle growth, had the greatest decrease.
functional groups displaying highly significant  increased expression included mitochondrion, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism while functional groups with decreased expression were mainly associated with structural genes and included the sarcoplasm, laminin complex and cytoskeleton.
a previously unreported over-representation of genes related to rna processing, the stress response and proteolysis was observed.
digital gene expression profiling was used to characterize the assembly of genes expressed in equine skeletal muscle and to identify the subset of genes that were differentially expressed following a ten-month period of exercise training.
the most abundant mrna transcripts in the muscle transcriptome were those involved in muscle contraction, aerobic respiration and mitochondrial function.
functional analysis of all expressed genes using fatiscan revealed an asymmetric distribution of  <dig> gene ontology  groups and  <dig> kegg pathways.
