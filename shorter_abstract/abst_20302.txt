intramolecular homologous recombination occurred to the chimera when it was transformed into e.coli and produced the desired recombinant plasmids with high efficiency and fidelity.
it is rapid, and does not involve any operational nucleotides.
abi-rec was developed to precisely clone inserts into defined location in a directional manner within recipient plasmids.
the utility and advantages of abi-rec were demonstrated through a series of pig myostatin  promoter and terminator reporter plasmids, whose transcriptional activity was assessed in mammalian cells.
this paper introduces abi-rec, a novel strategy combining asymmetric bridge pcr with intramolecular homologous recombination in bacteria for native dna cloning.
we proved the reliability of abi-rec using a double-resistance reporter assay, and investigated the effects of homology and insert length upon its efficiency.
abi-rec has the following advantages:  rapid and highly efficient;  native dna cloning without introduction of extra bases;  restriction-free;  easy positioning of directional and site-specific recombination owing to formulated primer design.
abi-rec is a novel approach to dna engineering and gene functional analysis.
a rapid and reliable method of cloning native dna sequences into desired plasmids are highly desired.
