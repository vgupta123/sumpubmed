more interstitial fibrosis  and less perivascular fibrosis  was observed in the dcm group compared to the cmvd group.
parenchymal changes , degenerative changes  and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates were assessed.
moreover, less distinct vessel narrowing was observed in the dcm group than in the cmvd group .
dcm is often accompanied by rhythm disturbances .
the obtained results indicate a different nature of changes occurring in the left atrial myocardium of dogs with dcm compared to dogs with mitral valve disease, including differences in vessel narrowing, cardiomyocyte degeneration and in the distribution of connective tissue.
dilated cardiomyopathy  and chronic mitral valve disease  in dogs are associated with heart chamber enlargement, also of the left atrium.

it is still unclear whether left atrial enlargement in these diseases results from volume overload or if it is also connected with other factors .
dogs with dcm showed more strongly defined degenerative changes than the cmvd dogs .
