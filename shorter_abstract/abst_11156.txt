computational analysis of these sequences was carried out by searching for families of repetitive nucleic acid elements sharing a common secondary structure.
two thirds of the families share a common predicted secondary structure and are located within intergenic regions.
analysis of non-coding sequences in several bacterial genomes brought to the identification of families of repeated sequences, able to fold as secondary structures.
sequences selected in this way have a substantially higher aptitude to fold into a stable secondary structure than the initial set.
systematic analysis of  <dig> bacterial genomes revealed a large number of repeated sequence families, including known and novel ones.
their predicted structure and genomic location suggest that, even in compact bacterial genomes, a relatively large fraction of the genome consists of non-protein-coding sequences, possibly functioning at the rna level.
a previous systematic analysis of a representative set of  <dig> bacterial genomes produced a large collection of sequences, potentially able to fold as stem-loop structures .
the initial clustering procedure identified clusters of similar sequences in  <dig> genomes, corresponding to about 1% of the whole population.
removal of redundancies and regrouping of the selected sequences resulted in a final set of  <dig> families, defined by hmm analysis.
