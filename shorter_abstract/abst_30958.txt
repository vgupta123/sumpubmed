nkx <dig>  and pcan <dig> are both prostate-specific genes related to prostate development and prostate cancer.
in the present study, we found that nkx <dig>  upregulated pcan <dig> gene transcription in lncap prostate cancer cells.
luciferase reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and rna interference were performed to study the effects of nkx <dig>  on pcan <dig> gene expression in prostate cancer cells.
our results showed that pcan <dig> promoter activity and mrna expression were increased by transfection with the nkx <dig>  containing plasmid  and that pcan <dig> mrna expression was decreased by rna interference targeting human nkx <dig>  in lncap prostate cancer cells.
the results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that nkx <dig>  bound to nbs <dig>  and nbs <dig>  upstream of the pcan <dig> gene.
our results suggested that two functional nkx <dig>  binding sites located at - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> upstream of the pcan <dig> gene were involved in the positive regulation of pcan <dig> gene transcription by nkx <dig> .
the luciferase reporter assays showed that nbs <dig> and nbs <dig> enhanced the promoter activity in pgl3-promoter vector with cotransfection of the nkx <dig>  containing plasmid.
so far, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the expression of these two genes.
to understand the regulatory mechanisms, our work focused on identifying the functional nkx <dig>  binding sites upstream of the pcan <dig> gene, which might be involved in the positive regulation of pcan <dig> expression by nkx <dig> .
furthermore, the deletion of nbs <dig> or both nbs <dig> and nbs <dig> reduced pcan <dig> promoter activity and abolished the positive regulation of pcan <dig> expression by nkx <dig> .
