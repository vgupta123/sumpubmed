promoter methylation was more frequent than gene body methylation in all tissues except male catkins.
male catkins differed in demethylation of particular transposable element categories, in level of gene body methylation, and in expression range of genes with methylated transcribed regions.
in contrast to other studies in plants, gene body methylation had a more repressive effect on transcription than promoter methylation.
tissue-specific gene expression patterns were correlated with both gene body and promoter methylation.
we validated medip-seq results by bisulfite sequencing, and compared methylation and gene expression using published microarray data.
we found striking differences among tissues in methylation, which were apparent at the chromosomal scale and when genes and transposable elements were examined.
dna cytosine methylation is an epigenetic modification that has been implicated in many biological processes.
however, large-scale epigenomic studies have been applied to very few plant species, and variability in methylation among specialized tissues and its relationship to gene expression is poorly understood.
we surveyed dna methylation from seven distinct tissue types  in the reference tree species black cottonwood .
qualitative dna methylation differences among tissues were obvious on a chromosome scale.
methylated genes had lower expression than unmethylated genes, but genes with methylation in transcribed regions  had even lower expression than genes with promoter methylation.
