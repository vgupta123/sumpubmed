this method is applied to salmonella typhi ct <dig> genome leading to the discovery of several new pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and metabolic islands that were missed by earlier methods.
many of the available methods for detecting genomic islands  in prokaryotic genomes use markers such as transposons, proximal trnas, flanking repeats etc., or they use other supervised techniques requiring training datasets.
most of these methods are primarily based on the biases in gc content or codon and amino acid usage of the islands.
some 'putative gis' are identified in the first phase, and those are refined into smaller segments containing horizontally acquired genes in the refinement phase.
such tests are supported by precise statistical distribution theory, and consequently, the resulting p-values are quite reliable for making the decision.
however, these methods either do not use any formal statistical test of significance or use statistical tests for which the critical values and the p-values are not adequately justified.
we propose a method, which is unsupervised in nature and uses monte-carlo statistical tests based on randomly selected segments of a chromosome.
the proposed method is based on statistical tests supported by precise distribution theory and reliable p-values along with a technique for visualizing statistically significant islands.
