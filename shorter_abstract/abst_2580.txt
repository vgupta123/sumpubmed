pyhla provides functions for association analysis, zygosity tests, and interaction tests between hla alleles and diseases.
the source code, tutorial, and examples are available at https://github.com/felixfan/pyhla.
we have developed a python package called pyhla, which implements several methods for hla association analysis, to fill the gap.
therefore, tools for downstream association analysis are highly desirable.
although several tools have been designed for multi-allelic marker association analysis, they were designed only for microsatellite markers and do not scale well with increasing data volumes, or they were designed for large-scale data but provided a limited number of tests.
pyhla is a tailor-made, easy to use, and flexible tool designed specifically for the association analysis of the hla types imputed from genome-wide genotyping and ngs data.
furthermore, pyhla is applicable to small and large sample sizes and can finish the analysis in a timely manner on a personal computer with different platforms.
these tools provide high-throughput and cost-effective approaches for identifying hla types.
