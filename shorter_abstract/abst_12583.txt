transcription with the cag promoter was  <dig> -fold higher than the cmv promoter  and the level of egfp expression activity in cmar- or chs4-flanked constructs increased by two- to three-fold compared to the control cmv or cag promoter constructs.
then we transformed immortalized chicken embryonic fibroblasts with these constructs by electroporation, and after cells were expanded under g <dig> selection, analyzed mrna levels and mean fluorescence intensity  by quantitative real-time pcr and flow cytometry, respectively.
in addition, flow cytometry analysis showed that constructs having cis-acting elements decreased the level of gene silencing as well as the coefficient of variance of egfp-expressing cells .
we found that the copy number of each construct significantly decreased as the size of the construct increased .
we generated eight constructs that encode enhanced green fluorescent protein  driven by either cmv or cag promoters , containing three types of key regulatory elements: a chicken lysozyme matrix attachment region , 5'-dnase i-hypersensitive sites  <dig> , and the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element .
a significant model effect was found in the expression level among various constructs in both mrna and protein .
these results provide important information for avian transgenesis and gene function studies in poultry.
our current data show that an optimal combination of cis-acting elements and promoters/enhancers for sustaining gene expression in chicken cells is suggested.
the aim of the present study was to analyze whether various cis-acting elements can help to sustain transgene expression in chicken fibroblasts.
we investigated the optimal transcriptional regulatory elements for enhancing stable transgene expression in chicken cells.
