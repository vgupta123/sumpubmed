we report that pea- <dig> null mice exhibited impaired learning in three distinct spatial tasks, while they exhibited normal fear conditioning, passive avoidance, egocentric navigation, and odor discrimination.
to determine if pea- <dig> contributes to the function of the nervous system we tested mice lacking pea- <dig> in a series of experiments designed to measure learning, sensory/motor function, and stress reactivity.
pea- <dig> null mice also had deficient forepaw strength and in limited instances, heightened stress reactivity and/or anxiety.
