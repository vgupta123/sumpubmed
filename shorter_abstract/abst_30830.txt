we analyzed the molecular variation within the clock gene period  of these two species in five different localities in eastern brazil.
lutzomyia intermedia and lutzomyia whitmani  are important and very closely related vector species of cutaneous leishmaniasis in brazil, which are distinguishable by a few morphological differences.
there is evidence of mitochondrial introgression between the two species but it is not clear whether gene flow also occurs in nuclear genes.
two tests of gene flow, one based on linkage disequilibrium and a mcmc analysis based on coalescence, suggest that the two species might be exchanging alleles at the per locus.
this result raises the question of whether similar phenomena are occurring at other loci controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity.
introgression might be occurring between l. intermedia and l. whitmani in period, a gene controlling behavioral rhythms in drosophila.
amova and fst estimates showed no evidence for geographical differentiation within species.
