so far, only very indirect evidence suggests that cbx penetrates into the central nervous system after systemic administrations.
carbenoxolone  is a widely used gap junctional blocker.
thus, we conclude that, most likely, cbx does not penetrate the blood brain barrier and therefore recommend careful consideration in the manner of administration, when a central effect is desired.
