here, we present a simple and effective method to recognize phosphorylation sites by combining sequence patterns and evolutionary information and by applying a novel noise-reducing algorithm.
the mean accuracy, precision, and recall of our method are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, whereas those of automotif with a polynomial kernel are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.
we suggested that considering long-range region surrounding a phosphorylation site is important for recognizing phosphorylation peptides.
also, from compared results to automotif in  <dig> different kinase families, new method outperforms automotif.
also our method shows better or comparable performance in four main kinase groups, cdk, ck <dig>  pka, and pkc compared to six existing predictors.
consequently, identification of ptm sites has a significant impact on understanding protein function and revealing cellular signal transductions.
experimental methods to identify phosphorylation sites are labor-intensive and of high-cost.
with the exponentially growing protein sequence data, development of computational approaches to predict phosphorylation sites is highly desirable.
post-translational modifications  have a key role in regulating cell functions.
