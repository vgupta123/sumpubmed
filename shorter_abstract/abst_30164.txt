to detect potential ataf <dig> transcriptional targets, a genomic pull-down assay was utilized to identify ataf <dig> promoter binding sequences.
gel filtration studies of purified ataf <dig> protein and mutagenesis studies of the 30-bp binding sequence indicate ataf <dig> functions as a dimer.
computational analysis of interacting promoter sequences identified a corresponding 25-bp a/t-rich consensus sequence with repeating aaa motifs.
upon ataf <dig> induction real-time qrt-pcr studies confirmed the accumulation of select gene transcripts whose promoters contain this consensus sequence.
we report the identification of a cis-regulatory binding sequence for ataf <dig>  different from other known nac protein binding sequences, the a/t-rich ataf <dig> binding motif represents a novel binding sequence for nac family proteins.
several nac transcription factors such as ataf <dig> have been linked to plant defense responses, including those targeting viruses.
