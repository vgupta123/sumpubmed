in vertebrates, tandem duplications gave rise to a multiplicity of forms that have been classified in eight enzyme classes, according to primary structure and function.
exon-intron boundaries, position and orientation of adh genes were deduced from the amphibian and reptilian genome assemblies, thus revealing syntenic regions and gene rearrangements with respect to the human genome.
our results reveal the high complexity of the adh system in amphibians, with eleven genes, coding for seven enzyme classes in xenopus tropicalis.
class-specific signatures have been assigned to adh <dig>  and ancestral adh <dig> is predicted to be a mixed-class as the ostrich enzyme, structurally close to mammalian adh <dig> but with class-i kinetic properties.
the study of the ancient forms of adh <dig> and adh <dig> sheds new light on the evolution of the vertebrate adh system, whereas the special features showed by the novel forms point to the acquisition of new functions following the adh gene family expansion which occurred in amphibians.
xenopus cdna and genomic sequences along with expressed sequence tags  were used in phylogenetic analyses and structure-function correlations of amphibian adhs.
novel adh sequences identified in the genomes of anolis carolinensis  and pelodiscus sinensis  were also included in these studies.
this work describes the adh system of xenopus, as a model organism, and explores the first amphibian and reptilian genomes released in order to contribute towards a better knowledge of the vertebrate adh gene family.
tissue and stage-specific libraries provided expression data, which has been supported by mrna detection in xenopus laevis tissues and regulatory elements in promoter regions.
