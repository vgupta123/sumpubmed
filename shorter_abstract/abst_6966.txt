module  <dig> contained genes encoding the secreted protein esxa, and the esaab and essab components of the t7ss machinery, and module  <dig> contained two functionally uncharacterized conserved membrane proteins.
comparison of these recombination regions with each other, and with the genomes of other staphylococcal species, failed to identify evidence of intra- and inter-species recombination, however the analysis identified a novel t7ss in another pathogenic staphylococci, staphylococcus lugdunensis.
the ess loci were found to comprise of four distinct modules based on gene content and relative conservation.
rna-seq was performed on representatives of the four module  <dig> variants and demonstrated strain-specific differences in the levels of transcription in the conserved module  <dig> components and transcriptional linkage module  <dig>  and provided evidence of the expression of genes the variable regions of the ess loci.
in silico analysis of ess loci encoded hypothetical proteins identified potential novel secreted substrates for the t7ss.
the genetic diversity of the ess locus, which encodes the t7ss, and the functions of proteins encoded within it are poorly understood.
the ess locus of s. aureus exhibits modularity and organisational variation across the species and transcriptional variation.
the most diverse module of the ess locus was module  <dig> comprising a highly variable arrangement of hypothetical proteins.
we used whole genome sequence data from  <dig> isolates representative of the diversity of the species to investigate the genetic variability of t7ss across s. aureus.
modules  <dig> and  <dig>  comprising of the 5’ and 3’ modules of the ess locus, contained the most conserved clusters of genes across the species.
across the species four variants of module  <dig> were identified containing the essc gene, each of which was associated with a specific group of downstream genes.
