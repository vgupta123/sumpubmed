here, we propose camber as an approach to support comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains.
18- <dig> december  <dig> ieee international conference on bioinformatics and biomedicine  <dig> hong kong, p. r. china
we present results of our method applied to three human pathogens: escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus.
there is a large amount of inconsistency in gene structure annotations of bacterial strains.
this inconsistency is a frustrating impedance to effective comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains in promising applications such as gaining insights into bacterial drug resistance.
each multigene family reveals genes that are in one-to-one correspondence in the bacterial strains, thereby permitting their annotations to be integrated.
as a result, more accurate and more comprehensive annotations of the bacterial strains can be produced.
camber produces what we called multigene families.
