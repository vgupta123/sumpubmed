by using the p <dig> network as a test system, we used the nonlinear model to estimate the activities of transcription factor  p <dig> from the expression levels of its target genes, and to identify the activation/inhibition status of p <dig> to its target genes.
the proposed quantitative model can not only be used to infer the regulatory relationship between tf and its down-stream genes, but also be applied to estimate the protein activities of tf from the expression levels of its target genes.
the predicted top  <dig> putative p <dig> target genes were supported by dna sequence analysis.
most of the previous researches were based on an assumption that the mrna levels of a gene are consistent with its protein activities, though it is not always the case.
the availability of various "omics" datasets creates a prospect of performing the study of genome-wide genetic regulatory networks.
however, one of the major challenges of using mathematical models to infer genetic regulation from microarray datasets is the lack of information for protein concentrations and activities.
this work developed a novel approach, which is based on a nonlinear mathematical model, to infer genetic regulation from microarray gene expression data.
