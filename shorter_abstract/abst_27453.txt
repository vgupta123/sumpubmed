we suggested that the ongoing qc cut-off for call-rate should be increased, while the cut-off for genotyping error rate can be reduced properly.
we showed that mcb usually leads to power loss in association tests, and such power change is greater than what could be achieved by equivalent reduction of sample size unbiasedly.
subsequently, we showed theoretically that mcb leads to biased conclusions in the subsequent analyses, including estimation of allele/genotype frequencies, the measurement of hwe and association tests under various modes of inheritance relationships.
our results illustrated that in most cases, the bias can be greatly reduced by increasing the call-rate at the cost of genotyping error rate.
we also compared the bias in allele frequency estimation and in association tests introduced by mcb with those by genotyping errors.
the commonly used 'no-call' procedure for the observations of borderline quality should be modified.
