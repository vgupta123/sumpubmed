here we report the first systematic investigation into the influence of the phylogenetic distance between arthropod species on the potential for reproductive parasite interspecific transfer.
we employed a well characterised reproductive parasite, a coccinellid beetle male-killer, and artificially injected the bacterium into a series of novel species.
this study indicates that the natural interspecific transmission of reproductive parasites might be constrained by their ability to tolerate the physiology or genetics of novel hosts.
however, whilst transmission efficiency was perfect within the native genus, this was reduced following some transfers of greater phylogenetic distance.
genetic distances between native and novel hosts were ascertained by sequencing sections of the 16s and 12s mitochondrial rdna genes.
the bacterium's ability to distort offspring sex ratios in novel hosts was negatively correlated with the genetic distance of transfers.
this finding has applied relevance regarding selection of suitable bacteria to manipulate insect pest and vector populations by symbiont gene-drive systems.
successful bacterial transfer across large phylogenetic distances may require rapid adaptive evolution in the new species.
such parasites transmit vertically on an ecological timescale, but rare horizontal transmission events have permitted colonisation of new species.
