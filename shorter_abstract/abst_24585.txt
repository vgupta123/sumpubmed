previously, we have demonstrated that cultivation of m. tuberculosis in k+-deficient medium resulted in generation of dormant cells.
this ‘dormant transcriptome’ demonstrated considerable stability during m. tuberculosis persistence and mrna de novo synthesis arrest.
interestingly, m. tuberculosis entry into dormancy was accompanied by the cleavage of 23s ribosomal rna at a specific point located outside the ribosome catalytic center.
dormant non-culturable m. tuberculosis bacilli are characterized by a global transcriptional repression.
increased abundance of non-coding rnas on dormancy may indicate their role in the entry into and maintenance of m. tuberculosis dormant non-culturable state.
however, the analysis of persisting transcripts displayed a cohort of mrna molecules coding for biosynthetic enzymes, proteins involved in adaptation and repair processes, detoxification, and control of transcription initiation.
dormant mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are believed to play an important role in latent tuberculosis infection.
rna-seq-based analysis of the dormant non-culturable population obtained under rifampicin exposure revealed a 30–50-fold decrease of the total mrna level, indicating global transcriptional repression.
