the oxygen biosensor was used for continuous real-time monitoring of temporal changes of o <dig> levels in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli cells during batch cultivation.
flubo represents a unique fret-based oxygen biosensor which allows the non-invasive ratiometric readout of cellular oxygen.
molecular oxygen  is one of the key metabolites of all obligate and facultative aerobic pro- and eukaryotes.
since o <dig> is essential for the formation of the yfp chromophore, efficient fret from the fbfp donor domain to the yfp acceptor domain only occurs in the presence but not in the absence of oxygen.
therefore, real-time monitoring of cellular oxygen levels is basically a prerequisite for the analysis of hypoxia-induced processes in living cells and tissues.
we developed a genetically encoded f√∂rster resonance energy transfer -based biosensor allowing the observation of changing molecular oxygen concentrations inside living cells.
