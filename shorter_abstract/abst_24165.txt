our model shows that the effects are diametrically opposed in egalitarian groups versus groups with high reproductive skew.
for individuals in egalitarian groups the relative benefit of group formation increases under conditions of increasing variance in foraging success and decreasing cost of reproduction.
it shows that the individual benefits of variance reduction in egalitarian groups and variance enhancement in groups with reproductive skew depend critically on ecological and life-history parameters.
group formation and food sharing in animals may reduce variance in resource supply to breeding individuals.
the model allows analyzing how mean foraging success, inter-individual variance of foraging success, and the cost of reproduction and offspring raising influence the benefit of group formation and resource sharing.
on the other hand individuals in groups with high skew will profit from group formation under conditions of decreasing variance in individual foraging success and increasing cost of reproduction.
in such groups resources are not shared equally among the members and inter-individual variance in resource supply may be extreme.
our model of risk-sensitive foraging thus allows comparing animal societies as different as spiders and birds in a single framework.
the model clearly demonstrates that reproductive skew qualitatively changes the influence of food sharing on the reproductive output of groups.
we develop a model of individually foraging animals that share resources for reproduction.
