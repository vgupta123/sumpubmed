protein translocation across membranes is a central process in all cells.
the monocots  follow more or less a similar conservation pattern for encoding the translocon components.
in the past decades the molecular composition of the translocation systems in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, mitochondria and chloroplasts have been established based on the analysis of model organisms.
today, these results have to be transferred to other plant species.
interestingly, we traced 82% overlap in findings from both approaches though we did not find any orthologues for 27% of the factors by either procedure.
from our bioinformatic analysis , we identified orthologues in plants, which in combination yielded  <dig> and  <dig> orthologues in a. thaliana and s. lycopersicum, respectively.
moreover, our analysis revealed that the genomic composition of the translocation machineries in the bryophyte physcomitrella patens resemble more to higher plants than to single celled green algae.
we bioinformatically determined the inventory of putative translocation factors in tomato  by orthologue search and domain architecture analyses.
the orthologue search shows in most cases a clear conservation of components of the translocation pathways/machineries.
in addition, we investigated the diversity of such systems by comparing our findings to the model organisms saccharomyces cerevisiae, arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> other plant species.
further, the complexity of the translocation pathway in terms of existing orthologues seems to vary among plant species.
in contrast, a diverse pattern was observed in different eudicots.
the literature search end up in a total of  <dig> translocation components in yeast and a. thaliana, which are either experimentally confirmed or homologous to experimentally confirmed factors.
