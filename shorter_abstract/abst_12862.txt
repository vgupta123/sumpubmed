a reference transcriptome with the longest unique transcripts and putative non-redundant new transcripts was established for each species.
orthology analysis provided new clues regarding sole genome evolution indicating a divergent evolution of crystallins in flatfish.
a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptome for each species was carried out using a large set of illumina data  and  <dig> reads , providing coverages ranging from  <dig> x to  <dig> x. after a de novo assembly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  different transcripts were obtained, comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  full-length cdnas in s. senegalensis and s. solea, respectively.
although some genomic resources and tools were recently described in these species, further sequencing efforts are required to establish a complete transcriptome, and to identify new molecular markers.
senegalese sole  and common sole  are two economically and evolutionary important flatfish species both in fisheries and aquaculture.
a small subset of putative species-specific, lineage-specific and flatfish-specific transcripts were also identified.
moreover, the integration of transcriptomic data in the soleadb will facilitate the management of genomic information in these important species.
moreover, the comparative analysis of transcriptomes will be useful to understand flatfish evolution.
the design of a microarray and establishment of a reference transcriptome will be useful for large-scale gene expression studies.
transcriptomes and molecular markers identified in this study represent a valuable source for future genomic studies in these economically important species.
transcriptome information was applied to the design of a microarray tool in s. senegalensis that was successfully tested and validated by qpcr.
furthermore, transcriptome data permitted the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple-sequence repeats confirmed by fish to be used in further genetic and expression studies.
