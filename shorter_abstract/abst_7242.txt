sere can therefore serve as a straightforward and reliable statistical procedure for the global assessment of pairs or large groups of rna-seq datasets by a single statistical parameter.
cohen’s simple kappa results are also ambiguous and are highly dependent on the choice of bins.
here we present a single-parameter test procedure for count data, the simple error ratio estimate , that can determine whether two rna-seq libraries are faithful replicates or globally different.
