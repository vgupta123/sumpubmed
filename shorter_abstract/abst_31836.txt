psii complexes isolated from them produced more superoxide compared with the wild type, and psii-driven superoxide production was higher in the mutants.
time-course experiments using isolated thylakoids showed that superoxide production was the initial event, and that production of hydrogen peroxide proceeded from that.
however, we could not observe such differences either in isolated psi complexes or through psi-driven electron transport.
in studies presented here, under fluctuating high light, growth of young seedlings lacking psbs is retarded, and psii in detached leaves of the mutants is more sensitive to photoinhibitory illumination compared with the wild type.
using both histochemical and fluorescent probes, we determined the levels of reactive oxygen species, including singlet oxygen, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, in leaves and thylakoids.
rice  has two psbs genes, psbs <dig> and psbs <dig>  however, only inactivation of psbs <dig>  through a knockout  or in rnai transgenic plants, results in plants deficient in qe, the energy-dependent component of npq.
psbs is a 22-kda photosystem  ii protein involved in non-photochemical quenching  of chlorophyll fluorescence.
these results indicate that at least some of the photoprotection provided by psbs and qe is mediated by preventing production of superoxide released from psii under conditions of excess excitation energy.
the psbs-deficient plants generated more superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in their chloroplasts.
