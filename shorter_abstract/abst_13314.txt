existing evidence suggests that its expression in the embryonic forebrain of the mouse is regional and may complement that of another transcription factor that is important for forebrain development, pax <dig>  the aim of this study is to provide a more detailed description of the barhl <dig> expression pattern in the embryonic forebrain than is currently available, to relate its expression domains to those of pax <dig> and to examine the effects of pax <dig> loss on barhl <dig> expression.
the transcription factor barhl <dig> is an antiproneural transcription factor with roles in neuronal differentiation.
its expression initially overlaps that of pax <dig> in a central region of the alar diencephalon but over the following days their domains of expression become complementary in most forebrain regions.
we found that barhl <dig> expression becomes upregulated in specifically the thalamus and pretectum in pax6-null mice.
the region-specific expression pattern of barhl <dig> makes it likely to be an important player in the development of region-specific differences in embryonic mouse forebrain.
