to demonstrate the protocol, we constructed a known dna sequence and utilized our sbl variation, cyclic sbl , to resequence this region.
sbl has the advantage of being easy to implement and accessible to all because it can be performed with off-the-shelf reagents.
using our method, we were able to read thirteen contiguous bases in the 3' - 5' direction.
herein we describe a variation on traditional sbl protocols that extends the number of sequential bases that can be sequenced by using endonuclease v to nick a query primer, thus leaving a ligatable end extended into the unknown sequence for further sbl cycles.
