because most of these proteins have no known function, the task of functional analysis of these proteins and the discovery of novel pharmacologically active compounds becomes possible.
the annotated sialome of a. variegatum allows its comparison to other tick sialomes, helping to consolidate an emerging pattern in the salivary composition of metastriate ticks; novel protein families were also identified.
a previous analysis of the sialotranscriptome  of amblyomma variegatum is revisited in light of recent advances in tick sialomes and provides a database to perform a proteomic study.
