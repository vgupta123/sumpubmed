this 'before/after' difference showed a fronto-central distribution between  <dig> and  <dig> ms. from  <dig> ms onwards, a parietal distribution was observed.
during this process, referred to as linearization during conceptualization, the speaker can choose between different types of temporal connectives such as 'before' x did a, y did b' or 'after' y did b, x did a'.
brain potentials showed reliable differences between the two conditions from  <dig> ms after the onset of the vocalization prompt, with erps from the 'after' condition being more negative.
to capture the neural events of such linearization processes, event-related potentials  were measured in native speakers of german.
during speech production the planning of a description of several events requires, among other things, a verbal sequencing of these events.
the later parietal distributed variation relates to the complexity in linearization, with the non-chronological order being more demanding during the updating of the concepts in working memory.
