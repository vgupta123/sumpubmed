haplotype reconstruction is important in linkage mapping and association mapping of quantitative trait loci .
one widely used statistical approach for haplotype reconstruction is simulated annealing , implemented in simwalk <dig>  however, the algorithm needs a very large number of sequential iterations, and it does not clearly show if convergence of the likelihood is obtained.
the use of the evolutionary algorithm and the joint updating method can be a promising tool for haplotype reconstruction in linkage and association mapping of qtl.
it is feasible to use a powerful parallel-computing strategy with the ea, increasing the computational efficiency.
in addition, jointly updating dependent variables can increase the computational efficiency up to ~ <dig> times.
overall, the proposed method with  <dig> processors increases the computational efficiency up to ~ <dig> times compared to simwalk <dig>  the efficiency will increase more with a larger number of processors.
an evolutionary algorithm  is a good alternative whose convergence can be easily assessed during the process.
