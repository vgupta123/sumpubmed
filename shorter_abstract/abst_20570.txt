cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen which primarily infects the central nervous system, a region of high inositol concentration, of immunocompromised individuals.
homology modeling of the proteins encoded by these genes revealed key differences in the myo-inositol active site.
three myo-inositol oxygenase gene sequences were identified in the c. neoformans genome.
the results suggest there are two functional copies of the myo-inositol oxygenase gene in the c. neoformans genome.
through the use of myo-inositol oxygenase c. neoformans can catabolize inositol as a sole carbon source to support growth and viability.
inositol is a key cellular metabolite for many organisms.
this included examination of the upstream regulatory regions, identifying ore/tone and uasino sequences, conserved introns/exons, and in frame termination sequences.
differential regulation was suggested by computational analyses of the three gene sequences.
