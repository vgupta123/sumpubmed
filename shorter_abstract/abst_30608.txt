the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria has led to renewed interest in development of alternative antimicrobial compounds such as antimicrobial peptides , either naturally-occurring or synthetically-derived.
the binding to dna also led to inhibition of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv and caused induction of the sos response.
at mic concentrations, lp <dig> binds dna and inhibits macromolecular synthesis and growth, whereas at concentrations above the mic, lp <dig> targets the bacterial membrane leading to disruption of the membrane.
our data demonstrate that lp <dig> may have a dual mode of action against s. aureus.
these results add new information about the moa of a new synthetic amp and aid in the future design of synthetic peptides with increased therapeutic potential.
we investigated the moa of the lysine-peptoid hybrid, lp <dig>  which previously has been shown to display antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus.
knowledge of the mode of action  of synthetic compounds mimicking the function of amps is highly valuable both when developing new types of antimicrobials and when predicting resistance development.
at concentrations of lp <dig> above the minimal inhibitory concentration , the peptoid caused atp leakage from bacterial cells.
however, at concentrations close to the mic, lp <dig> inhibited the growth of s. aureus without atp leakage.
