this study was conducted to determine the effects of varying levels of don in diets on growth performance, serum biochemical profile, jejunal morphology, and the differential expression of nutrients transporter genes in growing pigs.
the mrna expression levels of excitatory amino acid transporter- <dig> , sodium-glucose transporter- <dig> , dipeptide transporter- <dig> , cationic amino acid transporter- <dig>  and y+l-type amino acid transporter- <dig>  in control were slightly or markedly higher than those in the  <dig> don treatment groups.
the relative liver weight in the 12 mg/kg don treatment group was significantly greater than that in the control , but there were no significant differences in other organs.
with regard to serum biochemistry, the values of blood urea nitrogen , alkaline phosphatase , alanine aminotransferase  and aspartate amino transferase  in the  <dig> treatment groups were higher than those in the control, and the serum concentrations of l-valine, glycine, l-serine, and l-glutamine were significantly reduced in the  <dig> treatment groups, especially in the 12 mg/kg don group .
such effects includes weight loss, live injury and oxidation stress, and malabsorption of nutrients as a result of selective regulation of nutrient transporter genes such as eaac- <dig>  sglt- <dig>  pept- <dig>  cat- <dig> and lat- <dig>
differences were observed between control and the 12 mg/kg don treatment group with regards to average daily gain , although the value for average daily feed intake  in the 3 mg/kg don treatment group was slightly higher than that in control .
fusarium infection with concurrent production of deoxynivalenol  causes an increasing safety concern with feed worldwide.
these results showed that feeds containing don cause a wide range of effects in a dose-dependent manner.
