here, new evidence for the existence of an additional hinge region in the amino-terminal portion of the bridge helix domain  is presented.
mutations that are predicted to influence its flexibility cause corresponding changes in the rate of the nucleotide addition cycle .
the properties of two distinct molecular hinges in the bridge helix of rnap determine the functional contribution of this domain to key stages of the nac by coordinating conformational changes in surrounding domains.
the nanomechanical properties of bh-hn emerge as a direct consequence of the highly conserved primary amino acid sequence.
cellular rna polymerases  are complex molecular machines that combine catalysis with concerted conformational changes in the active center.
bh-hn displays functional properties that are distinct from bh-hc, suggesting that conformational changes in the bridge helix control the nac via two independent mechanisms.
