in some cases, such as positioning nucleosomes with specific histone modifications or finding transcription factor binding specificities, the precision of the detected peak plays a significant role.
for the experiments we used three previously studied transcription factors  chip-seq datasets and identified three of the selected peak finders that returned results with high specificity and very good sensitivity compared to the remaining four.
we also ran pfms using the three selected peak finders on the same tf datasets and achieved higher specificity and sensitivity than the peak finders individually.
we present the first meta-server called peak finder metaserver  that collects results from several peak finders and produces consensus peaks.
we show that combining outputs from up to seven peak finders yields better results than individual peak finders.
in addition, three of the seven peak finders outperform the remaining four, and running pfms with these three returns even more accurate results.
benchmark studies have shown that the existing peak finders identify different peaks for the same dataset and it is not known which one is the most accurate.
sensitivity and specificity of seven widely used peak finders were examined.
another added value of pfms is a separate report of the peaks returned by each of the included peak finders.
