lentiviral vectors are well suited for gene therapy because they can mediate long-term expression in both dividing and nondividing cells.
however, lentiviral vectors seem less suitable for liver gene therapy because systemically administered lentiviral vectors are preferentially sequestered by liver macrophages.
lentiviral vectors were produced with either wild type gp <dig>  sendai-gp <dig>  or both wild type gp <dig> and sendai-gp <dig> and tested in vitro and in vivo for hepatocyte and macrophage gene transfer.
co-expression of wild type gp <dig> and sendai-gp <dig> resulted in improved viral titers while retaining increased affinity for hepg <dig> cells.
this results in a reduction of available virus and might also increase the immune response to the vector and vector products.
in vivo, the sendai-gp <dig> vectors also showed decreased transduction of murine liver macrophages.
sendai-gp <dig> pseudotyped vectors showed specific gene transfer to hepg <dig> hepatoma cells, with no detectable transduction of hela cervical carcinoma cells, and a decreased affinity for raw mouse macrophages.
