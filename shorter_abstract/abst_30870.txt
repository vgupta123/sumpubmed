specifically, leeil- <dig> overexpression resulted in increased transcript levels of the downstream gene of et signal transduction pathway  and a subset of genes for shikonin formation, excretion and/or transportation , which was consistent with the enhanced shikonin contents in the leeil-1-overexpressing hairy root lines.
the results revealed that leeil- <dig> is a positive regulator of the biosynthesis of shikonin and its derivatives in l. erythrorhizon hairy roots.
the mrna level of leeil- <dig> was significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in the leeil-1-overexpressing hairy root lines and leeil-1-rnai hairy root lines, respectively.
leeil- <dig> could be a crucial target gene for the genetic engineering of shikonin biosynthesis.
our findings gave new insights into the molecular regulatory mechanism of et in shikonin biosynthesis.
conversely, leeil-1-rnai dramatically repressed the expression of the above genes and significantly reduced shikonin production.
in this study, by targeting leeil- <dig>  at the expression level, we revealed the positive regulatory effect of leeil- <dig> on shikonin formation.
although ethylene insensitive <dig> /ein3-like proteins  are crucial transcription factors in et signal transduction pathway, the possible function of ein3/eil <dig> in shikonin biosynthesis remains unknown.
