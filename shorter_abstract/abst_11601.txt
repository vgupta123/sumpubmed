about 10% of the g. vaginalis isolates have been reported to produce sialidase, but there have not been any studies relating sialidase production and biotype.
it has been linked with bacterial vaginosis , a syndrome that has been associated with increased risk for preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease and hiv acquisition.
some isolates only grew well under anaerobic conditions.
there are  <dig> different biotypes of g. vaginalis.
other studies have demonstrated that g. vaginalis biotype  <dig> can stimulate hiv- <dig> production.
because of the discrepancies in the literature we compared the methods used to biotype g. vaginalis and investigated the relationship of biotype and sialidase production.
previous studies associating g. vaginalis biotype with bacterial vaginosis were methodologically flawed, suggesting there is not an association of g. vaginalis biotypes and bacterial vaginosis.
using 4-methylumbelliferyl-oleate to determine lipase activity, instead of egg yolk agar, resulted in erroneous biotypes and does not provide reliable results.
sialidase activity is dramatically increased in the vaginal fluid of women with bv and bacterial sialidases have been shown to increase the infectivity of hiv in vitro.
sialidase activity was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> biotypes.
