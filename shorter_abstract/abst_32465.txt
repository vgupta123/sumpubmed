iron-deficiency anemia is the most prevalent form of anemia world-wide.
to better understand how cells respond to changes in iron availability, we profiled the yeast genome with a parallel analysis of homozygous deletion mutants to identify essential components and cellular processes required for optimal growth under iron-limited conditions.
the resulting analysis provides a global perspective on the cellular processes involved in iron metabolism.
using functional profiling, we identified several genes known to be involved in high affinity iron uptake, in addition to novel genes that may play a role in iron metabolism.
to better understand this relationship, we used expression-profiling of selected mutants that exhibited slow growth in iron-deficient conditions, and as a result, obtained additional insight into the roles of cti <dig>  dap <dig>  mrs <dig> and yhr045w in iron metabolism.
our results provide support for the primary involvement in iron homeostasis of vacuolar and endosomal compartments, as well as vesicular transport to and from these compartments.
we used this and other published data to develop a molecular interaction network of iron metabolism in yeast.
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model of cellular iron deficiency, in part because many of its cellular pathways are conserved.
although these components were essential for growth in low-iron conditions, most of them were not differentially-expressed.
