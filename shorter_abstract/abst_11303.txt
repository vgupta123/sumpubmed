s. typhimurium was isolated from all host species.
the occurrence of salmonella was significantly higher in pigs than in slaughtered true ruminants  but not significantly different between cattle, sheep and goats .
the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of salmonella in food animals in ethiopia by using meta-analytical methods.
all food animals are considerable reservoirs of salmonella and pose a significant risk to public health.
s. mishmarhaemek, s. infantis and s. hadar were the predominant isolates in cattle, small ruminants and pigs respectively.
safety measures in slaughter houses and butcheries and education of the public could reduce the risk of transmission of salmonella from animals to humans.
