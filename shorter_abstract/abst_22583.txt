among these genes,  <dig> genes are new identified and two aldehyde oxidases , one aldehyde dehydrogenase , five carboxyl/cholinesterases , five udp-glycosyltransferases , eight cytochrome p <dig>  and three glutathione s-transferases  displayed more robust expression in the antennae, and thus are proposed to participate in the degradation of sex pheromone components and plant volatiles.
to understand the function of genes in the sex pheromone pathway, this study investigated the genome-wide and digital gene expression of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation genes in various adult tissues in the diamondback moth , plutella xylostella, which is a notorious vegetable pest worldwide.
a massive transcriptome data  was generated by sequencing  <dig> adult tissues including male antennae, female antennae, heads, legs, abdomen and female pheromone glands from dbm by using illumina  <dig> next-generation sequencing and mapping to a published dbm genome.
among these, seven  were mainly expressed in the pheromone glands with likely function in the three essential sex pheromone biosynthesis steps: desaturation, reduction, and esterification.
the results also provide information on the genes involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation, and may be useful to identify potential gene targets for pest control strategies by disrupting the insect-insect communication using pheromone-based behavioral antagonists.
two types of genes involved in the sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation pathways play essential roles in this important moth behavior.
bioinformatics analysis yielded a total of  <dig>  unigenes among which  <dig> transcripts were putatively related to seven gene families in the sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway.
to date, this is the most comprehensive gene data set of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation enzyme related genes in dbm created by genome- and transcriptome-wide identification, characterization and expression profiling.
female moths synthesize species-specific sex pheromone components and release them to attract male moths, which depend on precise sex pheromone chemosensory system to locate females.
