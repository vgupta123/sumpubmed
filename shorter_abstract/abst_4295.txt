by contrast, apmifs expression levels significantly increased upon challenge with a parasitoid or a gram-negative bacteria.
in silico searches for mif members in insect genomes followed by phylogenetic reconstruction suggest that evolution of mif genes in hemipteran species has been shaped both by differential losses and serial duplications, raising the question of the functional importance of these genes in aphid immune responses.
this work provides evidence that while aphidâ€™s antibacterial arsenal is reduced, other immune genes widely absent from insect genomes are present, diversified and differentially regulated during antagonistic or agonistic interactions.
in contrast to the limited antibacterial arsenal, we showed that the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum expresses  <dig> members of macrophage migration inhibitory factors , known to be key regulators of the innate immune response.
an additional possibility to avoid elimination of mutualistic symbionts is a fine-tuning of the host immune response.
however, the functioning and evolutionary history of immune-related genes remains unknown for most invertebrate species.
to explore this hypothesis we investigated the existence and potential involvement of immune regulators in aphid agonistic and antagonistic interactions.
expression analyses of apmifs revealed reduced expression levels in the presence, or during the establishment of secondary symbionts.
