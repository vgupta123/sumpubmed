dna sequences have become a primary source of information in biodiversity analysis.
for example, short standardized species-specific genomic regions, dna barcodes, are being used as a global standard for species identification and biodiversity studies.
the use of a web-based portal for barcode analysis is convenient, especially since the www is inherently platform-neutral.
in addition, we provide a number of phylogenetics tools that will allow the user to manipulate phylogenetic trees generated by other popular programs.
