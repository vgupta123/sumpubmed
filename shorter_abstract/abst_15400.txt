more in depth knowledge of the various orders of complexity of genomic dna structure has allowed the design of sophisticated bioinformatics tools for its analysis and manipulation, which, in turn, have yielded a better understanding of the genome itself.
this study represents the first systematic genome-scale analysis of dna curvature, cpg islands and tandem repeats at the dna sequence level in plant genomes, and finds that not all of the chromosomes in plants follow the same rules common to other eukaryote organisms, suggesting that some of these genomic properties might be considered as specific to plants.
cpg islands and tandem repeats also play significant roles in the dynamics and evolution of genomes.
further analysis of cpg islands shows a clear interdependence between curvature value, repeat frequencies and cpg islands.
each cpg island appears in a local minimal curvature region, and cpg islands usually do not appear in the centromere or regions with high repeat frequency.
by analyzing tandem repeats across the genome, we found that frequencies of repeats are higher in regions adjacent to those with high curvature value.
due to its overarching role in genome function, sequence-dependent dna curvature continues to attract great attention.
a genome-scale prediction of curvature distribution in rice and arabidopsis indicated that most of the chromosomes of both genomes have maximal chromosomal dna curvature adjacent to the centromeric region.
