we describe a method for building a parameterized genome-scale kinetic model of a metabolic network.
the model is available in sbml format from the biomodels database  and at http://www.mcisb.org/resources/genomescale/.
whilst requiring minimal experimental data, such methods are unable to give insight into cellular substrate concentrations.
we demonstrate our methodology by applying it to yeast metabolism.
our modelling framework may be considered a stepping-stone toward the long-term goal of a fully-parameterized model of yeast metabolism.
control analysis is used to identify key steps within the system.
the size and complexity of such networks often means that their potential behaviour can only be analysed with constraint-based methods.
instead, the long-term goal of systems biology is to use kinetic modelling to characterize fully the mechanics of each enzymatic reaction, and to combine such knowledge to predict system behaviour.
simplified linlog kinetics are used and the parameters are extracted from a kinetic model repository.
the resultant model has  <dig> metabolic reactions involving  <dig> metabolites, and, whilst approximative, has considerably broader remit than any existing models of its type.
