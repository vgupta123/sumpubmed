in silico mapping of the t-cell epitope repertoires in dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> glycoproteins revealed that the potential immunological hotspots of both target autoantigens are highly conserved, despite limited sequence identity .
a similar number of well-conserved  high-affinity binders were predicted to exist within both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  with analogous distribution of binding registers.
our data suggests that the potential t-cell epitope repertoires encoded in dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> is substantially overlapping, and it may be possible to apply a common, antigen-specific therapeutic strategy with efficacy across distinct clinical phases of disease.
however, few t-cell specificities within dsg <dig> or dsg <dig> have been reported to date, and the precise role of t-cells in disease pathogenesis and evolution remains poorly understood.
this study provides interesting new insights into the possible mechanism for pv disease progression.
pemphigus vulgaris  is an acquired autoimmune blistering disorder in which greater than 80% of active patients produce autoantibodies to the desmosomal protein desmogelin  <dig> .
