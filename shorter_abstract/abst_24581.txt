however, so far no heterologous expression system was available to yield sufficient amounts of catalytically active protein for high-throughput based inhibitor screens.
the results presented here show that a chaperone fusion system can provide high yields of proteins that are difficult to express.
high-level heterologous expression of usp <dig> was achieved by applying a chaperone-based fusion system in e. coli.
pure protein was obtained in a single-step on imac via a his6-tag.
