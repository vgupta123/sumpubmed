however, some snornas lack this sequence and often they are called orphan snornas.
u <dig> snornaguide/ orphan snornasentamoeba histolytica
u <dig> snorna is an exceptional member of c/d box snornas and is involved in early processing of pre-rrna.
our results showed the presence of snornas in e. histolytica, an early branching eukaryote, and the structural features of e. histolytica snornas were well conserved when compared with yeast and human snornas.
an antisense sequence is present in each snorna which guides the modification or processing of target rna.
small nucleolar rnas are a highly conserved group of small rnas found in eukaryotic cells.
the expected sizes were in agreement with the observed sizes for all c/d box snornas tested, while for some of the h/aca box there was indication of processing to generate shorter products.
these are located diversely in the genome, mostly in intergenic regions, while some are found in orfs of protein coding genes, intron and utrs.
we have searched snornas of entamoeba histolytica from the genome sequence using computational programmes  and we obtained  <dig> snornas  along with  <dig> copies of eh_u <dig> snornas.
this study will help in understanding the evolution of these conserved rnas in diverse phylogenetic groups.
they belong to two major categories: the c/d box and h/aca box containing snornas.
they are functionally conserved, performing post transcriptional modification  of rrna and other nuclear rnas.
