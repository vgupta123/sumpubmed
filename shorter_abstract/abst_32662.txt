their expression was monitored in plagiotropic buds, together with those of other  candidates genes.
using these data, candidate genes were selected and their differential expression profiles were confirmed by qpcr experiments in plagiotropic buds of iapar <dig> and rubi under drought conditions.

as regards the genes up-regulated under drought conditions, specifically in the drought-tolerant iapar <dig>  several corresponded to orphan genes but also to genes coding proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, as well as aba and lipid metabolism, for example.
in this study, we compared the molecular responses to drought in two commercial cultivars  of coffea arabica grown in the field under control  and drought conditions using the pyrosequencing of rna extracted from shoot apices and analysing the expression of  <dig> candidate genes.
it affects plant development, fruit production, bean development and consequently beverage quality.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of coffee plants to drought are largely unknown.
the comparison of dna libraries identified new candidate genes  presenting differential expression between iapar <dig> and rubi and/or drought conditions.
interestingly, the expression of lipid-transfer protein  genes was also highly up-regulated under drought conditions in iapar <dig>  this may have been related to the thicker cuticle observed on the abaxial leaf surface in iapar <dig> compared to rubi.
drought is a widespread limiting factor in coffee plants.
under drought conditions, up-regulated expression was observed in iapar <dig> but not in rubi for castk <dig> , casamt <dig> , caslp <dig>  and camas <dig> .
the full transcriptome assembly of c. arabica, followed by functional annotation, enabled us to identify differentially expressed genes related to drought conditions.
genetic diversity for drought tolerance exists within the coffee genus.
the identification of these genes should help advance our understanding of the genetic determinism of drought tolerance in coffee.
pyrosequencing from shoot apices generated a total of  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  reads enabling the identification of  <dig>  clusters .
