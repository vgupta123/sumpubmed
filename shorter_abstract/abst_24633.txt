however, the three-dimensional structure of the protein is unknown.
it was estimated that more than one third of the world population is infected by t. gondii, and the disease is critical in fetuses and immunosuppressed patients.
an earlier published work discovered a highly antigenic 12 kda excretory-secretory  protein of t. gondii which may potentially be used for the development of an antigen detection test for toxoplasmosis.
in this study, we constructed a three dimensional model of the 12 kda es protein.
the built structure possesses a thioredoxin backbone which consists of four α-helices flanking five β-strands at the center.
together with specific antibody design, this work could contribute towards future development of an antigen detection test for toxoplasmosis.
three potential epitopes  which can be combined into one “single” epitope have been identified from the built structure as the most potential antibody binding site.
thus, early detection is crucial for disease diagnosis and therapy.
toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular coccidian parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.
