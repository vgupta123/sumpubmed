in curaçao, we observed the spawning behavior of this species over three years and five lunar cycles.
we show that spawning times are highly predictable from year to year relative to the lunar cycle and local sunset times.
asynchronous spawning times and rapid embryonic development may have important consequences for population biology, connectivity, and management, by affecting fertilization dynamics and larval dispersal distances.
further, the settlement of d. cylindrus larvae in the laboratory now makes out-planting for restoration more feasible.
the caribbean pillar coral dendrogyra cylindrus was recently listed as a threatened species under the united states endangered species act.
we collected gametes from spawning individuals on three occasions and attempted to rear larvae and primary polyp settlers.
we describe the successful propagation of embryos to the swimming larvae stage, the first settlement of larvae in the laboratory, and the survival of primary polyp settlers for over seven months.
until recently, the reproductive behavior of d. cylindrus was uncharacterized, limiting efforts to study its early life history, identify population bottlenecks, and conduct outplanting projects with sexually-produced offspring.
together, our findings of consistent spawning times, split-spawning, rapid embryonic development, and remarkable robustness of larvae and settlers now enable expanded research on the early life history and settlement ecology of d. cylindrus.

here we describe successful fertilization methods for d. cylindrus and we document rapid embryonic development.
overall, the natural history and husbandry contributions presented here should facilitate accelerated research and conservation of this threatened coral.
we argue that a precautionary approach to conservation is warranted, given this species’ peculiar life history traits and still-unresolved population structure.
