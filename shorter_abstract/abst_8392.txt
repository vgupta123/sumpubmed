however, challenges remain for accurate differentiation of homoeoalleles and paralogs, particularly in polyploid organisms with no supporting genome sequence.
to our knowledge, this study provides the first direct performance comparison between two major assemblers in a polyploid organism.
it expands the number of oat ests 3-fold, and constitutes the first comprehensive transcriptome study in oat.
in this study, rna-seq was employed to generate and characterize the first gene expression atlas for hexaploid oat.
the software packages trinity and oases were used to produce a transcript assembly from nearly  <dig> million 100-bp paired-end reads from developing oat seeds.
to assess the robustness of dnost, we successfully identified gene transcripts associated with the biosynthetic pathways of three compounds with health-promoting properties , and quantified their expression.
the oases 67-kmer assembly, denoted dnost , is over  <dig> million nucleotides in length and the average transcript length is  <dig>  nucleotides.
based on the quality-parameters employed, oases assemblies were superior.
