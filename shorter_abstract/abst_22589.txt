to facilitate the screening of large quantities of new antimicrobial peptides , we describe a cost-effective method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of amps.
the expression system was used for high-level expression of six antimicrobial peptides with different sizes: bombinin-like peptide  <dig>  temporin g, hexapeptide, combi- <dig>  human histatin  <dig>  and human histatin  <dig>  these expressed amps were purified and evaluated for antimicrobial activity.
the released fusion partner was easily purified by ni-nta chromatography.
the cloning method, combined with bioinformatic analyses from genome and est sequence data, will also be useful for screening new amps.
each synthetic gene was then cloned into the pet30a/his-eddie-gfp vector via an in vivo recombination strategy.
eddie, an autoproteolytic mutant of the n-terminal autoprotease, npro, from classical swine fever virus, was selected as a fusion protein partner.
all recombinant amps displayed expected antimicrobial activity against e. coli, micrococcus luteus and s. cerevisia.
the method described in this report allows the fast synthesis of genes that are optimized for over-expression in e. coli and for the production of sufficiently large amounts of peptides for functional and structural characterization.
the expressed fusion proteins existed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and the expression levels of the six amps reached up to 40% of the total cell protein content.
