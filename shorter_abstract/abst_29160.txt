both new cprp genes were able to translate a mature protein in a mammalian cell-expression system.
analysis by in situ hybridization revealed the presence of both cprps mrna in the trophoblast binucleate cells.
although this study demonstrated possible roles of prps in caprine placenta, prps may regulate binucleate-cell functions like those in bovine, but their crucial roles are still unclear.
we have identified the novel prps in caprine placenta.
the data indicate that prp genes in caprine placenta have coordination functions for gestation, as they do in bovine.
this is the first study of prps function in caprine placenta.
however, their expression profiles differed from those in bovine placenta.
we examined their evolution and role in the ruminant placenta.
caprine prps are compared with known bovine prps.
localization and quantitative expression of caprine prps were compared with bovine prps.
