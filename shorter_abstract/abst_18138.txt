compared to other nuclear genes that are members of gene families of all sizes, lab effort, such as cloning, can be kept to a minimum.
they also provide regions with different phylogenetic content deriving from coding and non-coding parts of different length.
the rapidly increasing number of available plant genomes opens up almost unlimited prospects for biology in general and molecular phylogenetics in particular.
25% of aligned characters from agt <dig> intron sequence are parsimony informative.
in comparison, the introns and spacer of several common chloroplast markers  provide less than 10% parsimony informative characters.
a recent study took advantage of this data and identified a set of nuclear genes that occur in single copy in multiple sequenced angiosperms.
single  copy nuclear genes are of immense value in plant phylogenetics.
we show that the nuclear marker agt <dig>  and in particular the agt <dig> introns, provide a significantly increased phylogenetic signal compared to chloroplast markers commonly used for low level phylogenetics.
thus, they can be applied to a wide range of taxonomic levels from family down to population level.
the present study is the first to apply genomic sequence of one of these low copy genes, agt <dig>  as a phylogenetic marker for species-level phylogenetics.
the agt <dig> dataset provides a deeper resolution than the chloroplast markers in tildenia.
its utility is compared to the performance of several coding and non-coding chloroplast loci that have been suggested as most applicable for this taxonomic level.
as more plant genomes are sequenced, we will obtain increasingly precise information about which genes return to single copy most rapidly following gene duplication and may be most useful across a wide range of plant groups.
