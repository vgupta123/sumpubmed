managing dog populations is achieved through a range of interventions to suit the dog population dynamics and dog ownership characteristics of the location, with a number of potential impacts or goals in mind.
this scoping review collates  <dig> studies that have assessed the impacts of dog population management interventions.
the relatively few published examples of impact assessment in dog population management suggest this field is in its infancy; however this review highlights those notable exceptions.
impact assessment provides the opportunity for interventions to identify areas of inefficiencies for improvement and build evidence of positive change.
by describing those indicators and methods of measurement that have been reported thus far, and apparent barriers to efficient assessment, this review aims to support and direct future impact assessment.
