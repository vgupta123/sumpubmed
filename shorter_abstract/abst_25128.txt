such sperm competition is usually summarized at the level of the population or species by the parameter, p <dig>  defined as the proportion of offspring sired by the second male in double mating trials.
to fully understand the causes and consequences of sperm competition requires estimates of not only mean p <dig>  but also intra-specific variation in p <dig>  here we investigate within-population quantitative variation in p <dig> using a controlled mating experiment and microsatellite profiling of progeny in the multiply mating stalk-eyed fly, teleopsis dalmanni.
thus the population mean p <dig> value does not reflect the high underlying variance in familial p <dig>  we discuss some of the potential causes and consequences of post-copulatory sexual selection in this important model species.
when females mate with different males, competition for fertilizations occurs after insemination.
our data suggest that all modes of ejaculate competition, from extreme sperm precedence to complete sperm mixing, occur in t. dalmanni.
the mean population-wide p <dig> value of  <dig>  was not significantly different from that expected under random sperm mixing .
however, considerable variation in p <dig> may occur within populations, and such variation limits the utility of population-wide or species p <dig> estimates as descriptors of sperm usage.
however, patterns of paternity were highly variable between individual families; almost half of families displayed extreme second male biases resulting in zero or complete paternity, whereas only about one third of families had p <dig> values of  <dig> , the remainder had significant, but moderate, paternity skew.
we genotyped  <dig> offspring from  <dig> dam-sire pair families at four microsatellite loci.
