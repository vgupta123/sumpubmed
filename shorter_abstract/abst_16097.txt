investigating the effects of imepitoin upon the behaviour of dogs with recognised behavioural anxiety-related problems , in both healthy dogs and dogs with epilepsy is required to further explore any potential anxiolytic effects of this medication.
imepitoin is low-affinity partial agonist at the benzodiazepine  site of the gabaa receptor, and has been demonstrated to have both anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects in laboratory rodents.
anxiety-related behaviour was quantified before and during imepitoin treatment using a validated questionnaire tool .
a median 45% reduction in seizure frequency/month was observed following imepitoin treatment; however, imepitoin did not appear effective in reducing seizure frequency in a minority of cases.
behavioural changes associated with idiopathic epilepsy  have been identified in dogs, with fear and anxiety-related problems seen in both drug-na√Øve dogs and dogs treated with anti-epileptic drugs .
in addition, many dogs with ie are already treated with aeds to reduce their seizure frequency, which may have negative effects if used in polytherapy.
polyphagia was the most common chronic side effect, and more side effects were reported in polytherapy cases.
eighty-five valid responses were received from owners of dogs with ie currently treated with imepitoin.
