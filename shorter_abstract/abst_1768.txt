on this respect, dexamethasone  dependent protection against tnf-alpha-mediated cell death in the mcf- <dig> cell line has been demonstrated to be a useful model for the study of this type of cancer.
we evaluated their possible participation in the dex-dependent protection against tnf-alpha-mediated cell death.
expression of the pi3k dominant negative mutant did not alter the protection conferred by dex against tnf-alpha mediated cell death.
nf-kappab, but not pi3k/akt activation, is required for the dex protective effect against tnf-alpha-mediated cell death, and correlates with lack of degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-iap <dig>
cellular cultures of the mcf- <dig> cell line were exposed to either, tnf-alpha or tnf-alpha and dex, and cell viability was evaluated.
contrariwise, clones expressing the ikappab-alpha dominant negative mutant lost the dex-conferred protection against tnf-alpha.
independent inhibition of these two pathways allowed us to test their participation in dex-dependent protection against tnf-alpha-cytotoxicity in mcf- <dig> cells.
the biochemical bases for hormone dependence in breast cancer have been recognized as an important element in tumor resistance, proliferation and metastasis.
