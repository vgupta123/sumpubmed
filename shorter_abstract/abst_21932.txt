using gene-edited macrophages we demonstrate how previously unappreciated knockout effects of samhd <dig>  such as an altered oxidative stress response, have a large paracrine signaling component.
furthermore, we demonstrate single-cell pathway enrichments for cell cycle arrest and apobec3g degradation, both associated with the oxidative stress response and altered proteostasis.
by combining single-cell culture, live-cell imaging, and single-cell sequencing, we have demonstrated the ability to study cell phenotypes and microenvironmental influences.
studying the genetic  and environmental  modifiers of heterogeneity, and how cell population dynamics unfold over time in response to these modifiers is key when studying highly plastic cells such as macrophages.
as single-cell methods continue to mature, so will the ability to move beyond simple ‘snapshots’ of cell populations towards studying the determinants of population dynamics.
perhaps the most important shortfall with transcriptomic ‘snapshots’ of cell populations is that they risk being descriptive, only cataloging heterogeneity at one point in time, and without microenvironmental context.
