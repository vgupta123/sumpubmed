this stimulatory effect is mediated by mir-27b-directed silencing of several transcriptional repressors that cooperate to suppress the presynaptic transcriptome.
the strongest repressive activity appears to be mediated by bmi <dig>  a component of the polycomb repressive complex implicated in self-renewal of neural stem cells.
mir-27b influences the expression of three quarters of genes associated with presynaptic function in cortical neurons.
these results expand the repressive activity of bmi <dig> to genes involved in synaptic function and identify a unique post-transcriptional circuitry that stimulates expression of synaptic genes and promotes synapse differentiation.
we conclude that silencing of bmi <dig> by mir-27b relieves repression of the presynaptic transcriptome and supports neurotransmission in cortical networks.
the precise impact of mirnas on presynaptic function and neurotransmission remains, however, poorly understood.
mir-27b knockdown leads to reduced synaptogenesis and to a marked decrease in neural network activity, which is fully restored by rnai-mediated silencing of bmi <dig>
here, we identify mir-27b—an abundant neuronal mirna implicated in neurological disorders—as a global regulator of the presynaptic transcriptome.
