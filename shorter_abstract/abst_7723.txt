statistically independent gene expression modes  were extracted from observed gene expression signatures  through ica of different microarray experiments.
the analysis of high-throughput gene expression data sets derived from microarray experiments still is a field of extensive investigation.
in this study, we investigate the relevance of ica in gaining new insights into well characterized regulatory mechanisms of m-csf dependent macrophage differentiation.
moreover, recent research results like the involvement of proliferation associated cellular mechanisms during macrophage differentiation can be corroborated.
we show that ica is an appropriate tool to uncover underlying biological mechanisms from microarray data.
most of the well known pathways of m-csf dependent monocyte to macrophage differentiation can be identified by this unsupervised microarray data analysis.
