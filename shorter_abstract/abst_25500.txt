each isoform was expressed in the retina and showed a unique distribution in the synaptic layers of the retina, with little or no colocalization of isoforms.
in retina, syntaxins  <dig> and  <dig> are expressed at conventional and ribbon synapses, respectively, suggesting that synaptic trafficking functions differ among syntaxin isoforms.
syntaxin  <dig> was localized to horizontal cell processes in the ribbon synaptic complexes of photoreceptor terminals and in puncta in the ipl that contacted dopaminergic and cd15-positive amacrine cells.
syntaxin  <dig> was present in amacrine cells and their processes in the ipl, but showed little colocalization with syntaxin  <dig> or other presynaptic markers.
to better understand syntaxins in synaptic signaling and trafficking, we further examined the cell- and synapse-specific expression of syntaxins  <dig> through  <dig> in the mouse retina by immunolabeling and confocal microscopy.
syntaxins  <dig> through  <dig> are snap receptor  proteins that mediate vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane.
syntaxin  <dig> was found in glutamatergic photoreceptor and bipolar cell ribbon synapses, but was absent from putative conventional glutamatergic amacrine cell synapses.
syntaxins  <dig> and  <dig> mediate presynaptic transmitter release from conventional and ribbon synapses, respectively.
these results indicate that each syntaxin isoform has unique, non-redundant functions in synaptic signaling and trafficking.
syntaxin  <dig> was present in amacrine cell bodies and processes and conventional presynaptic terminals in the inner plexiform layer .
syntaxins  <dig> and  <dig> often were apposed to synaptic active zones labeled for bassoon.
