a cis-regulatory mechanism was identified that contributes to allele-specific expression, leading to differential gene expression and allelic complementary effects in f <dig> hybrids.
of the expressed genes,  <dig> % exhibited an unexpected type of monoallelic expression and  <dig> % showed preferential allelic expression that was genotype-dependent in reciprocal crosses.

however, it is not clear why yield in heterozygotes is superior to that of the homozygous parents or how degs are produced.
significant allelic complementary effects were detected in the f <dig> hybrids of rice.
analysis of the allelic expression profiles of genes at the critical stage for highest biomass production from the leaves of three different rice f <dig> hybrids identified genotype-dependent allele-specific expression genes.
global allele-specific expression analysis in hybrid rice has the potential to answer these questions.
extensive studies on heterosis in plants using transcriptome analysis have identified differentially expressed genes  in f <dig> hybrids.
