harmonic generation microscopy  allows one to image ld without the use of exogenous labels.
using specific inhibitors, we show that the velocity and dynamic behaviour of ld is dependent not only on microtubules as in other systems, but also on microfilaments.
time-lapse studies reveal that ld move continuously and collide but do not fuse, instead forming aggregates that subsequently behave as single units.
at fertilization, ld are small and uniformly distributed, but in the implanting blastocyst, ld are larger and enriched in the invading giant cells of the trophectoderm.
lipid droplets  are organelles with an important role in normal metabolism and disease.
adaptive optics can be used to correct aberrations that would otherwise degrade the quality and information content of images.
we have built a harmonic generation microscope with adaptive optics to characterise early mouse embryogenesis.
this study establishes hgm with adaptive optics as a powerful tool for the study of ld biology and provides insights into the photo-toxic effects of imaging embryos.
ld in pre-implantation mouse embryos show a previously unappreciated complexity of behaviour that is dependent not only on microtubules, but also microfilaments.
unlike ld in other systems, ld in the mouse embryo do not fuse but form aggregates.
ld in drosophila embryos and cultured cell lines have been shown to move and fuse in a microtubule dependent manner.
