this paper describes methods for making this global approach practical by constructing predictive models for many target responses to many compounds and using them to guide experimentation.
we demonstrate for the first time that by jointly modeling targets and compounds using descriptive features and using active machine learning methods, accurate models can be built by doing only a small fraction of possible experiments.
drug discovery and development has been aided by high throughput screening methods that detect compound effects on a single target.
an average of nearly 60% of all hits in the dataset were found after exploring only 3% of the experimental space which suggests that active learning can be used to enable more complete characterization of compound effects than otherwise affordable.
the methods were evaluated by computational experiments using a dataset of  <dig> assays and  <dig>  compounds constructed from the pubchem database.

however, when using focused initial screening, undesirable secondary effects are often detected late in the development process after significant investment has been made.
the methods described are also likely to find widespread application outside drug discovery, such as for characterizing the effects of a large number of compounds or inhibitory rnas on a large number of cell or tissue phenotypes.
