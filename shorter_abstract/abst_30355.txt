furthermore, whereas u <dig> splicing does not occur in caenorhabditis elegans, u <dig> introns as well as u <dig> snrnas are present in trichinella spiralis, which is deeply branching in the nematode tree.
the results show that in species or branches where u <dig> spliceosomal components are missing, also u <dig> type of introns are lacking.
examples are the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis, entamoeba histolytica, green algae, diatoms, and the fungal lineage basidiomycota.
the phylogenetic distribution of u <dig> introns and spliceosomal rnas give further support to an early origin of u <dig> dependent splicing.
a comparison of homologous genes in t. spiralis and c. elegans revealed different mechanisms whereby u <dig> introns were lost.
the phylogenetic distribution of spliceosomal rnas that are characteristic of the u <dig> spliceosome, i.e.
the u <dig>  u <dig>  u4atac and u6atac rnas, suggest that u <dig> spliceosomes were lost in many phylogenetic groups.
u <dig> and u <dig> introns were predicted by making use of available est and genomic sequences.
in addition, this distribution identifies a large number of instances during eukaryotic evolution where such splicing was lost.
