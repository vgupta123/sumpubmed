an initial de novo transcriptome assembly was generated by trinity for each species and then refined with program to assemble spliced alignments .
here we present de novo transcriptome assemblies generated from rna-seq data in four dictyostelid species: d. discoideum, p. pallidum, d. fasciculatum and d. lacteum.
putative novel genes are also identified and alternative splice isoforms were observed for the first time in p. pallidum, d. lacteum and d. fasciculatum.
annotation of gene models and transcripts is a fundamental step in genome sequencing projects.
the assemblies were incorporated with existing gene models to determine corrections and improvement on a whole-genome scale.
the final datasets of  <dig> - <dig>  transcripts contained  <dig> - <dig>  updates and corrections to >50% of existing gene models including changes to hundreds or thousands of protein products.
this is the first time this has been performed in these eukaryotic species.
in doing so we have identified updates to the majority of the gene annotations across all four species under study and found putative novel genes and transcripts which could be worthy for follow-up.
the completeness and quality were assessed with the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs  and transrate tools at each stage of the assemblies.
