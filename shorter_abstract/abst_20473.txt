it appears that the consensus prediction tool is slightly more objective than individual prediction methods alone and suggests several previously not identified amino acid stretches as potential amyloidogenic determinants, which  require further experimental studies.
utilizing molecular graphics programs, like o and pymol, as well as the algorithm dssp, it was found that nearly all experimentally verified amyloidogenic determinants , and several predicted, with the aid of the tool amylpred, but not experimentally verified amyloidogenic determinants, are located on the surface of the relevant amyloidogenic proteins.
the most significant result of this work is the observation that virtually all, to date, experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants and the majority of predicted, but not yet experimentally verified short amyloidogenic stretches, lie 'exposed' on the surface of the relevant amyloidogenic proteins, and also several of them have the ability to act as conformational 'switches'.
in an attempt to identify possible amyloidogenic regions in proteins for further experimental investigation, we have developed and present here a publicly available online tool that utilizes five different and independently published methods, to form a consensus prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins, using only protein primary structure data.
