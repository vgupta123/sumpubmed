this study provides the first standardised estimates of the distribution of suitability for asf transmission associated with domestic and sylvatic cycles in africa.
areas with high suitability for pig to pig transmission  were estimated to occur throughout sub-saharan africa, whilst areas with high suitability for introduction from wildlife reservoirs  were found predominantly in east, central and southern africa.
based on average auc ratios from the partial roc analysis, the predictive ability of suitability estimates for domestic cycles alone was considerably higher than suitability estimates for sylvatic cycles alone, or domestic and sylvatic cycles in combination.
in the absence of accurate asf outbreak data and few quantitative studies on the epidemiology of the disease in africa, we used spatial multi-criteria decision analysis  to derive predictions of the continental distribution of suitability for asf persistence in domestic pig populations as part of sylvatic or domestic transmission cycles.
outputs from the spatial mcda indicate that large areas of sub-saharan africa may be suitable for asf persistence as part of either domestic or sylvatic transmission cycles.
the predictive performance of suitability estimates was assessed via a partial roc analysis using asf outbreak data reported to the oie since  <dig>
african swine fever  is endemic in several countries of africa and may pose a risk to all pig producing areas on the continent.

in order to incorporate the uncertainty in the relative importance of different criteria in defining suitability, we modelled decisions within the mcda framework using a stochastic approach.
we provide further evidence for the utility of knowledge-driven risk mapping in animal health, particularly in data-sparse environments.
