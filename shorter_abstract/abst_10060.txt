high level of expressed sfgfp-ahr fusion protein  was recovered from the inclusion bodies of e. coli by simple solubilization with the arginine, and purified by affinity chromatography via its n-terminal 6 × his tag.
nevertheless,the detection range of sfgfp-ahr fusion was much wider and the detection limit was of about 10 ppt  of free dioxin in the tested artificial samples.
this highly expressed and functional sfgfp-ahr fusion protein provides a promising molecular tool for detecting and quantifying different congeners of dioxins.
upon cell entry, dioxins bind specifically and firmly to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , leading to the stimulation of several enzymes responsible for its detoxification.
dioxins are one of the most toxic groups of persistent organic pollutants.
in this work, the ligand binding domain  of the ahr was cloned downstream a superfolder form of the green fluorescent protein , resulting in the construct prset-sfgfp-ahr.
indirect elisa revealed the ability of the sfgfp-ahr, but not the sfgfp, to bind to the immobilized dioxin with the possibility to detect such interaction by both its 6 × his and gfp tags,competitive elisa showed that anti-dioxin antibody was more sensitive to low dioxin concentrations than sfgfp-ahr.
its purity was confirmed by sds-page analysis and immunoblotting with anti-his or anti-gfp antibodies.
