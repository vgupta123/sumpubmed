we excluded the samples that had any of the five high-confidence driver genes  reported in ccrcc to avoid their possible influence in our results.
the approach may be applied to many driver genes in various cancers.
clear cell renal cell carcinoma  is the most common type of kidney cancer.

in this study, we proposed an integrative genomics approach to explore the functional consequences of pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc by incorporating somatic mutations, mrna expression, dna methylation, and microrna  expression profiles from the cancer genome atlas .
the gene function enrichment analysis revealed that down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix organization , cell adhesion , and ion transport .
in addition, we identified  <dig> differentially methylated cpg sites  and  <dig> significantly altered micrornas  associated with truncated pbrm <dig> mutations.
however, the biological consequences of pbrm <dig> somatic mutations  that drive tumor progression in ccrcc remain unclear.
in summary, this study provided some important insights into the understanding of tumorigenesis driven by pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc.
our integrative analysis suggested that methylation and mirna alterations were likely the downstream events associated with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations.
