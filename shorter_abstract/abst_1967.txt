this represents a powerful new approach for selecting similar genes and gene products from proteome databases according to their functions.
in recent years, the development of gene ontology  has established structured, controlled vocabularies describing gene functions, which makes it possible to develop novel tools to search genes by functional similarity.
by using a statistical model to measure the functional similarity of genes based on the gene ontology directed acyclic graph, we developed a novel gene functional similarity search tool  to identify genes with related functions from annotated proteome databases.
gfsst provides functions not only for similar gene retrieval but also for gene search by one or more go terms.
increasing amounts of data about genes, gene products and their functions have been stored in databases.
an implementation of gfsst which works on the uniprot  for the human and mouse proteomes is available at gfsst web server.
to facilitate selection of candidate genes for gene-disease research, genetic association studies, biomarker and drug target selection, and animal models of human diseases, it is essential to have search engines that can retrieve genes by their functions from proteome databases.
this search engine lets users design their search targets by gene functions.
