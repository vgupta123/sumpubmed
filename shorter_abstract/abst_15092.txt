different implementations of the same client  have been deployed and are currently in use in real installations such as the national institute of bioinformatics  and the acgt-eu project.
this shows the potential utility and versatility of the software library, including the integration of novel tools in the domain and with strong evidences in the line of facilitate the automatic discovering and composition of workflows.
magallanes  is a versatile, platform-independent java library of algorithms aimed at discovering bioinformatics web services and associated data types.
a second important feature of magallanes is its ability to connect available and compatible web services into workflows that can process data sequentially to reach a desired output given a particular input.
