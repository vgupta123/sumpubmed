for the first time, we characterized gene expression profiling in pbmcs from moist snuff consumers , compared with that from consumers of cigarettes  and non-tobacco consumers .
however, we found no significant differences in gene expression between msc and ntc.
us epidemiological studies indicate that non-combustible tobacco products are less harmful than smoking and yet very limited biological and mechanistic information is available on the effects of these alternative tobacco products.
microarray analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between the smk and ntc groups and  <dig> degs between smk and msc groups.
pmbc gene expression profiles of ntc and msc are similar to each other, while smk exhibit distinct profiles with alterations in immune related pathways.
