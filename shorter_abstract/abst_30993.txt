here we identified two sequences responsible for fibrillar aggregation of mutant precursors in the er: the n-terminal vasopressin nonapeptide and the c-terminal glycopeptide.
to test their role in granule sorting, the glycopeptide was deleted and/or vasopressin mutated to inactivate er aggregation while still permitting precursor folding and er exit.
our previous finding that dominant mutations in provasopressin, which cause cell degeneration and diabetes insipidus, prevent native folding and produce fibrillar aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum  might thus reflect mislocalized amyloid formation by sequences that evolved to mediate granule sorting.
aggregation of peptide hormone precursors in the trans-golgi network is an essential process in the biogenesis of secretory granules in endocrine cells.
the same sequences — vasopressin and the glycopeptide — mediate physiological aggregation of the wild-type hormone precursor into secretory granules and the pathological fibrillar aggregation of disease mutants in the er.

it has recently been proposed that this aggregation corresponds to the formation of functional amyloids.
