finally, two gene families accounted for over 25% of the divergent genes in the core genome.
s. pratensis genomes are highly similar with exceptional levels of recombination which erase phylogenetic signal among strains of the species.
streptomyces pratensis has high rates of homologous recombination but the impact of such gene exchange on genome evolution and the evolution of natural product gene clusters remains uncharacterized.
despite disparate geographic origins, the genomes are highly similar with  <dig> % of genes present in the core genome and conservation of all natural product gene clusters.
natural products include a novel combination of carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor gene clusters.
while high intraspecies recombination rates abolish the phylogenetic signal across the genome, intraspecies recombination is suppressed in two genomic regions.
these genes have evidence for co-evolution of co-localized pairs, supporting previous assertions that these genes may function akin to a toxin-antitoxin system.

we report draft genome sequences of four s. pratensis strains and compare to the complete genome of streptomyces flavogriseus iaf-45-cd , a strain recently reclassified to s. pratensis.
streptomyces are widespread bacteria that contribute to the terrestrial carbon cycle and produce the majority of clinically useful antibiotics.
the first region is centered on an insertion/deletion polymorphism and the second on a hybrid nrps-pks gene.
this species has a large core genome and variable terminal regions that are smaller than those found in interspecies comparisons.
