amino acid and phylogeny analyses indicated the cpf3'5'h encodes a f3'5'h enzyme.
total anthocyanin concentration was reduced up to 80% in some transgenic lines and a smaller increase in flavonol concentration was recorded.
cyclamen is a popular and economically significant pot plant crop in several countries.
the results illustrate the complexity involved in modifying a biosynthetic pathway with multiple branch points to different end products and provides important information for future flower colour modification experiments in cyclamen.
molecular breeding technologies provide opportunities to metabolically engineer the well-characterized flavonoid biosynthetic pathway for altered anthocyanin profile and hence the colour of the flower.
hplc analysis showed that delphinidin-derived pigment levels were reduced in transgenic lines relative to control lines while the percentage of cyanidin-derived pigments increased.
flowers of the transgenic lines showed modified colour and this correlated positively with the loss of endogenous f3'5'h transcript.
changes in observed colour were confirmed by colorimeter measurements, with an overall loss in intensity of colour  in the transgenic lines and a shift in hue from purple to red/pink in one cultivar.
our aim in this study was to change pigment profiles and flower colours in cyclamen through the suppression of flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase, an enzyme in the flavonoid pathway that plays a determining role in the colour of anthocyanin pigments.
