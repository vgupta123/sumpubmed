a much smaller number of nitrs can be classified as activating receptors by the lack of cytoplasmic itims and presence of a positively charged residue within their transmembrane domain, which permits partnering with an activating adaptor protein.
the particularly large dataset acquired in medaka makes direct comparison possible to another complete dataset acquired in zebrafish in which nitrs are localized in two clusters on different chromosomes.
novel immune-type receptor  genes are members of diversified multigene families that are found in bony fish and encode type i transmembrane proteins containing one or two extracellular immunoglobulin  domains.
the majority of nitrs can be classified as inhibitory receptors that possess cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs .
the two largest medaka nitr gene clusters share conserved synteny with the two zebrafish nitr gene clusters.
comprehensive phylogenetic analyses between the complete datasets of nitrs from medaka and zebrafish indicate multiple species-specific expansions of different families of nitrs.
the patterns of sequence variation among gene family members are consistent with recent birth-and-death events.
