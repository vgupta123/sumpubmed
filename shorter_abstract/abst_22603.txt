the classification performance of artificial neural networks , k-nearest neighbors , linear discriminant analysis , na√Øve bayes , recursive partitioning and regression trees , and support vector machines  in the presence and absence of filter-based feature selection was analyzed using k-way cross-validation testing and independent validation on simulated in vitro assay data sets with varying levels of model complexity, number of irrelevant features and measurement noise.
we have developed a novel simulation model to evaluate machine learning methods for the analysis of data sets in which in vitro bioassay data is being used to predict in vivo chemical toxicology.
the addition of measurement noise and irrelevant features decreased the classification accuracy of all ml methods, with lda suffering the greatest performance degradation.
several public efforts are aimed at discovering patterns or classifiers in high-dimensional bioactivity space that predict tissue, organ or whole animal toxicological endpoints.
we present a novel model to simulate complex chemical-toxicology data sets and use this model to evaluate the relative performance of different machine learning  methods.
bioactivity profiling using high-throughput in vitro assays can reduce the cost and time required for toxicological screening of environmental chemicals and can also reduce the need for animal testing.
in the limit of using a large number of features, ann and svm were always in the top performing set of methods while rpart and knn  were always in the poorest performing set.
while the prediction accuracy of all ml methods decreased as non-causal  features were added, some ml methods performed better than others.
from our analysis, we can recommend that several ml methods, most notably svm and ann, are good candidates for use in real world applications in this area.
