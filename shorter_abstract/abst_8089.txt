it is a good source for estimation of the abundance of genes and regulatory structures in both known and unknown members of microbial communities.
the abundabce of riboswitches in metagenomes was highest for the tpp, b <dig> and gcvt riboswitches; the s-box, rfn, ykkc/yxkd, yybp/ykoy regulatory elements showed lower but significant abundance, while the lys, g-box, glms and ykok riboswitches were rare.
in this study we consider the distribution of rna regulatory structures, riboswitches, in the sargasso sea, minnesota soil and whale falls metagenomes.
several recently completed large-scale enviromental sequencing projects produced a large amount of genetic information about microbial communities  which is not biased towards cultured organisms.
this study demonstrates applicability of bioinformatics to the analysis of rna regulatory structures in metagenomes.
regions downstream of identified riboswitches were scanned for open reading frames.
comparative analysis of identified orfs revealed new riboswitch-regulated functions for several classes of riboswitches.
we also identified conserved riboswitches upstream of genes of unknown function: thiamine , cobalamine , and glycine .
