chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing  can locate transcription factor binding sites on genomic scale.
the model also provides a goodness-of-fit test, to screen out spurious peaks and to infer multiple binding events in a region.
we propose a rigorous statistical model, the normal-exponential two-peak  model, which parallels the physical processes generating the empirical data, and which can naturally incorporate mappability information.
the comparison study with existing programs on real chip-seq datasets  demonstrates that the next-peak model performs well both in calling peaks and locating them.
next-peak is based on rigorous statistics, so its model also provides a principled foundation for a more elaborate statistical analysis of chip-seq data.
