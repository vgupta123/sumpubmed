bp exposure activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  and causes toxic stress resulting in transcriptional changes that are not regulated through ahr.
more broadly, this study presents a strategy for distinguishing receptor-dependent responses and side effects based on expression time courses.
using random forest machine learning we classified  <dig> primary ahr responders and  <dig>  genes regulated as side effects.
using a combination of machine learning followed by extensive experimental validation, we have further expanded the known catalog of genes regulated by the environmentally sensitive transcription factor ahr.
we sought to distinguish these two types of responses based on a time course of expression changes measured after bp exposure.
small molecule ligands often have multiple effects on the transcriptional program of a cell: they trigger a receptor specific response and additional, indirect responses .
