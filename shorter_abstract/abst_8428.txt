clinical bioinformatics is currently growing and is based on the integration of clinical and omics data aiming at the development of personalized medicine.
dmet-analyzer has a simple graphical user interface that allows users  to upload and analyse dmet files produced by affymetrix dmet-console in an interactive way.
using such tool user may avoid wasting time in the manual execution of multiple statistical tests avoiding possible errors and reducing the amount of time needed for a whole experiment.
existing software tools for dmet data generally allow only the preprocessing of binary data  and simple data analysis operations, but do not allow to test the association of the presence of snps with the response to drugs.
the system is freely available for academic purposes at:
the effectiveness and easy use of dmet analyzer is demonstrated through different case studies regarding the analysis of clinical datasets produced in the university hospital of catanzaro, italy.
dmet analyzer is a novel tool able to automatically analyse data produced by the dmet-platform in case-control association studies.
for instance the affymetrix dmet platform  is able to study the relationship among the variation of the genome of patients and drug metabolism, detecting snps  on genes related to drug metabolism.
moreover annotations and the direct link to external databases may increase the biological knowledge extracted.
despite this, there is currently a lack in the development of open-source algorithms and tools for the analysis of dmet data.
