protection from fv infection requires cell mediated and humoral immunity.
the gp <dig>  ebola zaire sequence from the  <dig> outbreak was analyzed by both bimas and syfpeithi algorithms to identify potential immuno-dominant epitopes.
in sum, three immunodominant sequences of the ebola gp <dig>  have been identified using in silico methods that may confer protection against mouse adapted ebola zaire.
the present studies are focused upon identifying immunodominant epitopes using in silico methods and developing tetramers as a diagnostic reagent to detect cell mediated immune responses to gp <dig>  fc.
the development of tetramer reagents will provide unique insight into the potency and durability of medical countermeasure vaccines for known bioterrorism threat agents in preclinical models.
antigen specific cells were also detected, using tetramers.
three candidate peptides, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  were identified and, following immunization in balb/c mice, all three peptides induced ifn-γ as detected by elispot and intracellular staining.
glycoprotein gp <dig>  fc zaire, a recombinant fv human fc fusion protein, has been shown to confer protection against mouse adapted zaire ebola virus.
