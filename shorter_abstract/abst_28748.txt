we characterized the fpi mutant Δpdpc of the live vaccine strain  of f. tularensis and found that it exhibited lack of intracellular replication, incomplete phagosomal escape, and marked attenuation in the mouse model, however, unlike a phagosomally contained fpi mutant, it triggered secretion of il-1β, albeit lower than lvs, and markedly induced ldh release.
the phenotype of the Δpdpc mutant appears to be unique compared to previously described f. tularensis fpi mutants.
many components essential for the intracellular life cycle are encoded by a gene cluster, the francisella pathogenicity island , constituting a type vi secretion system.
