lymphocytes act as a major component of the adaptive immune system, taking very crucial responsibility for immunity.
blood samples were collected when the piglets were  <dig> and  <dig> days of age, respectively.
results herein lay a preliminary foundation for further identifying the causal mutations underlying swine immune capacity in follow-up studies.
<dig> snps were selected after quality control for association tests between snps and each immune trait considered based on a single-locus regression model.
differences in proportions of t-cell subpopulations in peripheral blood among individuals under same conditions provide evidence of genetic control on these traits, but little is known about the genetic mechanism of them, especially in swine.
our study demonstrated that genome-wide association studies would be a feasible way for revealing the potential genetics variants affecting t-cell subpopulations.
seven traits, including the proportions of cd4+, cd8+, cd4+cd8+, cd4+cd8−, cd4−cd8+, cd4−cd8− and the ratio of cd4+ to cd8+ t cells were measured at the two ages.
identification of the genetic control on these variants may help the genetic improvement of immune capacity through selection.
to identify genomic regions responsible for these immune traits in swine, a genome-wide association study was conducted.
all the samples were genotyped for  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  using the illumina porcinesnp60k beadchip.
<dig> significant snps were located within the immune-related qtl regions reported in previous studies.
to tackle the issue of multiple testing in gwas,  <dig>  permutations were performed to determine the chromosome-wise and genome-wise significance levels of association tests.
in total,  <dig> snps with chromosome-wise significance level and  <dig> snps with genome-wise significance level were identified.
furthermore, several significant snps fell into the regions harboring known immunity-related genes,  <dig> of them fell into the regions which harbor some known t cell-related genes.
