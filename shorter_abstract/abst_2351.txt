nextgen sequencing of haploid f <dig> progeny was used to generate a genetic map revealing a low level of conventional recombination, with an unexpectedly high frequency of short, double crossovers.
as well, the high frequency of short double crossovers is expected to greatly increase genetic diversity among progeny from genetic crosses, thereby providing an unexpected and likely important source of diversity.
as well, chria showed no evidence of being a sex chromosome, of harboring an inversion, or distorting patterns of segregation.

our findings suggest that the successful spread of the monomorphic chria in the wild has not been driven by meiotic drive or related processes, but rather is due to a fitness advantage.
notably, both the monomorphic and divergent versions of chria were isolated with equal frequency.
three clonal variants predominate in north america and europe, while south american strains are genetically diverse, and undergo more frequent recombination.
to understand the inheritance of chria, we performed a genetic cross between the northern clonal type  <dig> me <dig> strain and a divergent southern type  <dig> strain called vand, which harbors a divergent chria.
all three northern clonal variants share a monomorphic version of chromosome ia , which is also found in unrelated, but successful southern lineages.
toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite of animals that causes zoonotic disease in humans.
