neurological disorders exhibit a huge number of molecular alterations due to a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.
classical reductionist approaches are focused on a few elements, providing a narrow overview of the etiopathogenic complexity of multifactorial diseases.
our strategy allowed us to identify common known and unknown processes including dna repair, rna metabolism and glucose metabolism not detected with simple go enrichment analysis.
on the other hand, high-throughput technologies allow the evaluation of many components of biological systems and their behaviors.
in general, the same strategy can be applied to compare any pair of biological networks.
analysis of parkinson’s disease  and alzheimer’s disease  from a network perspective can highlight proteins or pathways common but differently represented that can be discriminating between the two pathological conditions, thus highlight similarities and differences.
in this work we propose a strategy that exploits network community structure identified with a state-of-the-art network community discovery algorithm called infomap, which takes advantage of information theory principles.
we built a similarity matrix to highlight similar communities and we analyzed statistically significant go terms found in clustered areas of the matrix and in network communities.
this approach allows the identification of communities present in both pathologies which highlight common biological processes.
in particular, we were able to capture the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolism .
