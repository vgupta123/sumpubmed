we partition the enriched ppi network with the novel detmod algorithm and we identify  <dig> modules.
the detection of functional modules is the first step in deciphering the apparent modularity of biological networks.
moreover, known protein complexes are largely incorporated in the assessed modules.
in the current study we integrate proteomics and microarray data of yeast, in the form of a weighted ppi graph.
the successful integration of heterogeneous data and the concept of the proposed algorithm provide confident functional modules.
we also proved that our approach is superior to methods restricted to ppi data only.
the ever-increasing flow of gene expression and protein-protein interaction  data has assisted in understanding the dynamics of the cell.
