a genome-wide screen of genes involved in ddr emphasized the key role of cell cycle control in the ddr network.
to identify novel genes involved in ddr, we screened a genome-wide s. pombe haploid deletion library against six different dna damage reagents.
flow cytometry analysis of the repair defective mutants revealed that most of them exhibited a defect in cell cycle progression, and some caused genome instability.
microarray analysis and genetic complementation assays were carried out to characterize  <dig> of the novel ddr genes in more detail.
because ddr is highly conserved in evolution, studies in lower eukaryotes can provide valuable information to elucidate the mechanism in higher organisms.
characterization of novel genes identified in the screen helps to elucidate the mechanism of the ddr network and provides valuable clues for understanding genome stability in higher eukaryotes.
fission yeast  has emerged as an excellent model for ddr research in recent years.
data suggested that spbc2a <dig>  and spac27d <dig> c were required for efficient dna replication initiation because they interacted genetically with dna replication initiation proteins abp <dig> and abp <dig>  in addition, deletion of sgf73+, meu29+, sec65+ or pab1+ caused improper cytokinesis and dna re-replication, which contributed to the diploidization in the mutants.
dna damage response  plays pivotal roles in maintaining genome integrity and stability.
the library covered  <dig> % of the nonessential genes of s. pombe.
