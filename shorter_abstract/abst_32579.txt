the method relies on current genome information and annotation, incorporation of several new features, and key improvements over alternative methods, all of which are important to determine gene expression levels more accurately.
the method provides a complete annotation of potential virtual sage tags within a genome, along with an estimation of their confidence for experimental observation that ranks tags that present multiple matches in the genome.
in this study, we present a robust and reliable computational method for tag-to-gene assignment in serial analysis of gene expression .
second, a significant fraction of experimental sage tags was found to map onto genomic regions currently annotated as intergenic.
third, a significant number of existing experimental sage tags for yeast has been derived from truncated cdnas, which are synthesized through oligo-d priming to internal poly- regions during reverse transcription.
this is supported by the results obtained here and also by the large impact that the erroneous interpretation of these data could have on downstream applications.
we conclude that an accurate and unambiguous tag mapping process is essential to increase the quality and the amount of information that can be extracted from sage experiments.
first, we found that experimental sage tags mapping onto introns, intron-exon boundaries, and non-coding rna elements are observed in all available sage data.
the usefulness of this method is exemplified by the significant reduction of ambiguous cases in existing experimental sage data.
in addition, we report new insights from the analysis of existing sage data.
