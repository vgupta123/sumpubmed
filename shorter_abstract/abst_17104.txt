we developed a computational framework for the design of complex  gene circuits by generating dynamic models of parts and pools via the joint usage of the bionetgen rule-based modeling approach and mdl.
our computational framework provides such a detailed and intuitive way to design new and complex synthetic gene circuits.
the bionetgen output is translated into an mdl file that gives a complete description of all the reactions that take place inside the part  together with a proper interface to connect it to other modules in the circuit.
rule-based modeling approaches are increasingly used to obtain compact representations of reaction networks in biological systems.
the modular design of synthetic gene circuits via composable parts  and pools of signal carriers  has been successfully applied to bacterial systems.

however, eukaryotic cells are becoming a preferential host for new synthetic biology applications.
therefore, an accurate description of the intricate network of reactions that take place inside eukaryotic parts and pools is necessary.
