we obtained  <dig>  high quality reads that showed an exact match to the chicken genome.
we have applied this approach to the identification of chicken micrornas and to the comparison of micrornas in chicken embryo fibroblasts  infected with marek's disease virus  to those present in uninfected cef.
our results have confirmed the expression of many micrornas identified by sequence similarity and identified a pool of candidate novel micrornas.
the use of new, deep sequencing technologies has greatly accelerated microrna discovery.
the majority of the reads corresponded to previously annotated chicken micrornas; however, the sequences of many potential novel microsrnas were obtained.
this approach is independent of comparative sequence analysis, which has been the primary method used to identify chicken micrornas.
