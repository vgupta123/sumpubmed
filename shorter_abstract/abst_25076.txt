pan-caspase inhibition prevented wnv-induced apoptosis without affecting virus replication.
we found that wnv infection induces cell death in the brain-derived tumour cell line t98g by apoptosis under involvement of constituents of the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
inhibition of the caspases- <dig> or - <dig> inhibited parp cleavage, demonstrating that both caspases are involved in wnv-induced apoptosis.
our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of wnv-induced neural cell death.
wnv replication decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis as indicated by the activation of the effector caspase- <dig>  the initiator caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  polypolymerase  cleavage and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
t98g cells are highly permissive for lytic wnv-infection as demonstrated by the production of infectious virus titre and the development of a characteristic cytopathic effect.
truncation of bid indicated cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
