a selected combination of programs exploring pubmed abstracts, universal gene/protein databases , and state-of-the-art pathway knowledge bases  was assembled to distinguish enzymes with hydrolytic activities that are expressed in the extracellular space of cancer cells.
our combined strategy applied to each cancer type identified a minimum of  <dig> proteins expressed within the extracellular space and/or attached to the plasma membrane.
the method led to the recognition of human cancer-related hydrolases , among which were prostatic acid phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen, and sulfatase  <dig>
the proposed data mining strategy is of a general nature and can be applied to other biological databases for understanding biological functions and diseases.
in the case of cancer-related targets, it produced a list of putative extracellular, hydrolytic enzymes that merit additional study as candidates for cancer radioimaging and radiotherapy.
