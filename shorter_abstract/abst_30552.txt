genomematcher is useful for detecting similarities in dna sequences ranging in size from a few to sub-giga bases.
as examples of graphical ability of genomematcher to show similarity in colors, we show two cases in burkholderia and vivrio strains that the nucleotide sequence of the second largest chromosome changes more rapidly than the largest chromosome.
furthermore, symbols for annotation data are displayed along the views, and the user can relate the genomic differences with annotation data.
while bl2seq allows sub-giga base comparison, three alignment programs, bl2seq, mafft and clustalw, together with a dotmatch program allow comparative analysis of single-nucleotide level resolution.
we developed genomematcher, a stand-alone software package for mac os x. genomematcher executes blast and mummer, and the detected similarities are displayed in two-dimensional and parallel views with similarity values indicated by color.
the number of available genome sequences is increasing, and easy-to-use software that enables efficient comparative analysis is needed.
genomematcher is efficient and easy-to-use stand-alone software for in-depth comparative analysis of two sequences.
