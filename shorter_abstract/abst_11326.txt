some of them that were responsive to biotic and abiotic stresses were regulated by al stress.
two small rna libraries and two degradome libraries were constructed from the roots of al-treated and al-free g. soja seedlings.
wild soybean  has undergone long-term natural selection and may have evolved special mechanisms to survive stress conditions as a result.
additionally, some genes, such as those for the auxin response factor , domain-containing disease resistance protein , leucine-rich repeat and toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor-like protein  domain protein, cation transporting atpase, myb transcription factors, and the no apical meristem  protein, that are known to be responsive to stress, were found to be cleaved under al stress conditions.
however, little information about mirnas especially mirnas responsive to aluminum  stress is available in wild soybean.
these findings provide valuable information to understand the function of mirnas in al tolerance.
micrornas  play important regulatory roles in development and stress response in plants.
gene ontology  annotations of target transcripts indicated that  <dig> target genes cleaved by conserved mirna families might play roles in the regulation of transcription.
for mirna identification, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads in al-treated and al-free small rnas libraries, respectively, were generated, and  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified.
through degradome sequencing,  <dig> genes were identified as targets of the known mirnas and five genes were found to be the targets of the novel mirnas obtained in this study.
a number of mirnas and their targets were detected in wild soybean.
