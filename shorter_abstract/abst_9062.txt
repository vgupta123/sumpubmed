the current study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a combinatorial approach to inactivating prions by exposing rml-positive brain homogenate to spc-p and sds followed by pk.
treated samples were evaluated for prpsc-immunoreactivity by western blot, and residual infectivity by mouse bioassay.
the results of this study encourage further investigation into whether consecutive or concomitant exposure to sodium percarbonate, sds, and a protease may serve as a viable and non-caustic option for prion inactivation.
we recently demonstrated that exposure of the rml scrapie agent to a commercial product containing sodium percarbonate  with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate  rendered prpsc sensitive to proteinase k , but did not eliminate infectivity.
currently accepted practices of harsh chemical treatments such as prolonged exposure to sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, or autoclaving are not suitable in many situations.
treatment of infected brain homogenate with spc-p and sds followed by pk exposure resulted in a 4â€“ <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity when bioassayed in tga <dig> mice.
this study demonstrates that exposure of the rml scrapie agent to spc-p and sds followed by pk markedly reduces, but does not eliminate infectivity.
