most of the identified genes are ubiquitously expressed in many different tissues.
pathway analysis and gene ontology demonstrated that several of the identified genes are known to be involved in vasculature development, angiogenesis, and endothelial function .
the study provides an initial catalogue of ec-restricted genes most of which are ubiquitously expressed in different endothelial cells.
these genes are enriched in cardiovascular diseases, hemorrhage and ischemia gene sets .
several interesting patterns emerged among these genes: some were expressed in all ecs and several were restricted to microvascular ecs.
while many of the identified genes are known for their regulatory role in ecs, we have also identified several novel ec-restricted genes, the function of which have yet to be fully defined.
in this study, we used a systematic bioinformatics analysis approach to elucidate genes that exhibit an endothelial cell  restricted expression pattern, and began to define their regulation, tissue distribution, and potential biological role.
