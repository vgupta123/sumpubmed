polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  is an essential regulator of gene expression that maintains genes in a repressed state by marking chromatin with trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> .
in arabidopsis, loss of prc <dig> function leads to pleiotropic effects on growth and development thought to be due to ectopic expression of seed and embryo-specific genes.
while there is some understanding of the mechanisms by which specific genes are targeted by prc <dig> in animal systems, it is still not clear how prc <dig> is recruited to specific regions of plant genomes.
the fie-ha binding sites are enriched for three sequence motifs including a putative gaga factor binding site that is also found in drosophila polycomb response elements .
our results suggest that prc <dig> binding sites in plant genomes share some sequence features with drosophila pres.
we used chip-seq to determine the genome-wide distribution of hemagglutinin -tagged fertlization independent endosperm , the extra sex combs homolog protein present in all arabidopsis prc <dig> complexes.
however, unlike drosophila pres which are located in promoters and devoid of h3k27me <dig>  arabidopsis fie binding sites tend to be in gene coding regions and co-localize with h3k27me <dig>
