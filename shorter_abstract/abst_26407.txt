as a typical geocarpic plant, peanut embryogenesis and pod development are complex processes involving many gene regulatory pathways and controlled by appropriate hormone level.
these findings provided new information on mirna-mediated regulatory pathways in peanut pod, which will contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that governing peanut embryo and early pod development.
a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families were discovered.
<dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families were differentially expressed during pod development.
in this study, small rna and degradome libraries from peanut early pod of different developmental stages were constructed and sequenced.
in addition,  <dig> target genes were identified for  <dig> mirna families by degradome sequencing.
furthermore, we performed profiling analysis of intact and total transcripts of several target genes, demonstrating that spl , nac , pprp , ap <dig>  and grf  are actively modulated during early pod development, respectively.
large numbers of mirnas and their related target genes were identified through deep sequencing.
however, whether mirnas participate in the regulation of peanut embryogenesis and pod development has yet to be explored.
several new targets that might be specific to peanut were found and further validated by rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5′ cdna ends .
