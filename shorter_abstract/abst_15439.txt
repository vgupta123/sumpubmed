however, the molecular and genomic resources currently available for the study of s. hermonthica are limited.
we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library of s. hermonthica, sequenced  <dig>  clones from the library, and obtained  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  sequences.
the s. hermonthica unigene dataset was subjected to a comparative analysis with other plant genomes or ests.
furthermore, we found  <dig>  putative simple sequence repeats  in the s. hermonthica unigene dataset.
most primer sets amplified polymorphicbands from individual plants collected at a single location, indicating high genetic diversity in s. hermonthica.
we selected  <dig> primer pairs to analyze s. hermonthica harvested in the field from different host species and geographic locations.
our data provide the first extensive set of molecular resources for studying s. hermonthica, and include est sequences, a comparative analysis with other plant genomes, and useful genetic markers.
we tested  <dig> pairs of pcr primers flanking the ssrs to develop genetic markers for the detection of polymorphisms.
a clustering analysis suggests that genetic distances are not correlated with host specificity.
we found that  <dig> unigenes are conserved in the hemiparasitic triphysaria species but not in other plant species.
these are good candidates for genes specifically involved in plant parasitism.
approximately 80% of the unigenes have homologs in other dicotyledonous plants including arabidopsis, poplar, and grape.
these resources will be useful for genome annotation, gene discovery, functional analysis, molecular breeding, epidemiological studies, and studies of plant evolution.
