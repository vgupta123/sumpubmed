maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses of the protein sequences show that myzostomida, sipuncula and annelida  form a monophyletic group, which supports a closer relationship between sipuncula and annelida than with mollusca, brachiopoda, and some other lophotrochozoan groups.
it contains thirteen protein-coding genes  with  <dig>  codons in total, twenty-two transfer rna genes, two ribosomal rna genes and a non-coding at-rich region .
firstly, sipunculans and annelids share quite similar gene order in the mitochondrial genome, with all  <dig> genes located on the same strand; secondly, phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenated protein sequences also strongly support the sipunculan + annelid clade .
in this report, we present the mitochondrial genome sequence of phascolosoma esculenta, the first complete mitochondrial genome of the phylum.
compared with the typical set of metazoan mt genomes, sipunculid lacks trnr but has an additional trnm.
although over one thousand metazoan genomes have been sequenced, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased, left with many phyla without a single representative of complete mitochondrial genome.
the mitochondrial genome of p.esculenta is  <dig>  bp in length.
this is the first report of a complete mitochondrial genome as a representative within the phylum sipuncula.
it shares many more similar features with the four known annelid and one echiuran mtdnas.
all of the  <dig> identified genes are transcribed from the same dna strand.
