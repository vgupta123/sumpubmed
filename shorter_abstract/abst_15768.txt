the use of a single pair of primers leads to significant underestimation of the true community richness at all levels of taxonomic hierarchy.
therefore, even sequencing such clone libraries to saturation would only recover that fraction, which, according to the parametric models, varies between  <dig> ± 4% to  <dig> ± 10%, depending on the set of primers.
the majority of available protistan rrna gene surveys likely sampled less than half of the target diversity, and might have completely missed the rest.
we show that each pcr primer set-specific clone library is not a sample from the community diversity but rather from a fraction of this diversity.
the degree of this bias has not been quantified, and it remains unclear whether species missed from clone libraries could be recovered by increasing sequencing efforts, or whether they cannot be detected in principle.
the main tool to discover novel microbial eukaryotes is the rrna approach.
the pooled data is thus qualitatively richer than individual libraries, even if normalized to the same sequencing effort.
