inventories of small subgraphs in biological networks have identified commonly-recurring patterns, called motifs.
our analysis of several large biological networks suggests, in contrast, that the frequencies of appearance of common subgraphs are similar in natural and corresponding random networks.
indeed, certain topological features of biological networks give rise naturally to the common appearance of the motifs.
