we recently developed a multi-step normalization method  for two-group rna-seq data with replicates and demonstrated that the statistical methods available in four r packages  together with tbt can produce a well-ranked gene list in which true differentially expressed genes  are top-ranked and non-degs are bottom ranked.
additionally, a function for generating simulation data under various conditions and alternative deges procedures consisting of functions in the existing packages are provided.
the package incorporates multi-step normalization methods, whose strategy is to remove potential degs before performing the data normalization.
moreover, the r packages did not have normalization methods based on such a multi-step strategy.
tcc  is an r package that provides a series of functions for differential expression analysis of tag count data.
bioinformatics scientists can use tcc to evaluate their methods, and biologists familiar with other r packages can easily learn what is done in tcc.
the normalization function based on this deg elimination strategy  includes  the original tbt method based on deges for two-group data with or without replicates,  much faster methods for two-group data with or without replicates, and  methods for multi-group comparison.
tcc is useful for analyzing tag count data in various scenarios ranging from unbiased to extremely biased differential expression.
differential expression analysis based on “next-generation” sequencing technologies is a fundamental means of studying rna expression.
