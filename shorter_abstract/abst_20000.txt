comparison between multiple protein datasets requires the choice of an appropriate reference system and a number of variables to describe their differences.
here we introduce an innovative approach to discriminate multiple protein datasets  and to measure enrichments in gene ontology terms  using semantic similarities.
in an intuitive way, multicm and clevergo provide accurate classifications of physico-chemical features and annotations of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, which is extremely useful for the discovery and characterization of new trends in protein datasets.
we illustrate the powerfulness of our approach by investigating the links between rna-binding ability and other protein features, such as structural disorder and aggregation, in s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, m. musculus and h. sapiens.
our results are in striking agreement with available experimental evidence and unravel features that are key to understand the mechanisms regulating cellular homeostasis.
