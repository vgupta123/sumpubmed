binders against three toxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin b , ricin, and botulinum toxin a  complex toxoid, were isolated from panning the display library.
the good solubility, excellent thermal stability and complex sequence variation of small single domain antibodies  make them attractive alternatives to conventional antibodies.
shark heavy chain antibody, also called new antigen receptor , consists of one single variable domain , containing only two complementarity-determining regions .
in this report, we construct and characterize a diversity enhanced semi-synthetic nar v display library based on naturally occurring nar v sequences.
soluble sdabs from selected binders were purified and evaluated using direct binding and thermal stability assays on the luminex  <dig>  in addition, sandwich assays using sdab as the reporter element were developed to demonstrate their utility for future sensor applications.
