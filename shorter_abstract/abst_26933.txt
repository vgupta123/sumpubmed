recent findings have revealed that tbx <dig> transcriptional activity is regulated by dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interaction with pdlim <dig>  a pdz-lim protein family member, along actin filaments.
by controlling tbx <dig> subcellular localization and transcriptional activity and possibly additional yet unknown means, pdlim <dig> is required for proper development of the heart and the fins.
this work provides the first evidence for the involvement of pdlim <dig> in pectoral fin development.
vertebrate limb development involves a reciprocal feedback loop between limb mesenchyme and the overlying apical ectodermal ridge .
during fin growth fgf <dig> is sequentially expressed in the mesenchyme and then in the apical ectodermal ridge .
knock-down of pdlim <dig> function leads to decreased pectoral fin cell proliferation resulting in a severely stunted fin phenotype.
as a consequence of perturbed aer function in the absence of pdlim <dig>  pathway components in the fin mesenchyme are misregulated or absent, indicating a breakdown of the fgf signaling feedback loop, which is ultimately responsible for the loss of fin outgrowth.
proper fin outgrowth requires fgf <dig> downregulation in the fin mesenchyme with subsequent activation in the aer, and pdlim <dig> appears to regulate this transition, potentially through tbx <dig> regulation.
several gene pathways participate in this feedback loop, including fgf signaling.
