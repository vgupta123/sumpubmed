by comparing the quail genome with that of chicken, chromosome rearrangements that have occurred in these two galliform species over  <dig> million years of evolution can be detected.
significant sequence identities of quail markers with chicken enabled the alignment of the quail linkage groups on the chicken genome sequence assembly.
ninety-two loci are resolved into  <dig> autosomal linkage groups and a z chromosome-specific linkage group, aligned with the quail aflp map.
by extending the comparative study to the microchromosomes, we suggest that a wealth of information can be mined in chicken, to be used for genome analyses in quail.
this, together with interspecific fluorescence in situ hybridization , revealed very high similarities in marker order between the two species for the eight macrochromosomes and the  <dig> microchromosomes studied.
the alignment with the chicken chromosomes confirms the high conservation of gene order that was expected between the two species for macrochromosomes.
the total map distance covers  <dig>  cm with an average spacing of  <dig>  cm between loci.
the size of linkage groups ranges from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm.
from a more practical point of view, the definition of conserved syntenies helps to predict the position of genes in quail, based on information taken from the chicken sequence, thus enhancing the utility of this species in biological studies through a better knowledge of its genome structure.
