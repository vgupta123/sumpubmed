next, we analyzed the difference in expression of three enfelv genes between control and lymphoma samples.
there is a decreased expression of enfelv genes in lymphomas versus control samples, which contradicts previous observations for the exfelv.
the possible mechanisms of lymphoma development by exfelv are insertional mutagenesis or persistent stimulation of host immune cells by viral antigens, bringing them at risk for malignant transformation.
cats infected with exogenous feline leukemia virus  have a higher chance of lymphoma development than uninfected cats.
our results suggest that a persistent stimulation of host immune cells is not an appropriate mechanism responsible for malignant transformation caused by feline endogenous retroviruses.
the results were confirmed by rt-qpcr.
we examined the felv expression in cats that have developed malignant lymphomas and discussed the possible mechanisms that could have induced malignant transformation.
