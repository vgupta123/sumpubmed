to identify epitopes, a source protein is passed through four steps: proteasome cleavage, tap transport, mhc binding and epitope selection.
epijen is based on quantitative matrices, derived by the additive method, and applied successively to select epitopes.
the final set of peptides represents no more than 5% of the whole protein sequence and will contain 85% of the true epitopes, as indicated by external validation.
epijen is a reliable multi-step algorithm for t cell epitope prediction, which belongs to the next generation of in silico t cell epitope identification methods.
the main processing pathway for mhc class i ligands involves degradation of proteins by the proteasome, followed by transport of products by the transporter associated with antigen processing  to the endoplasmic reticulum , where peptides are bound by mhc class i molecules, and then presented on the cell surface by mhcs.
these methods aim to reduce subsequent experimental work by improving the success rate of epitope prediction.
