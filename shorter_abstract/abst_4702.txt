electron microscopy of atp-treated, bcg-infected mdms revealed the presence of the bacteria within characteristic double-membraned autophagosomes.
we have previously reported that atp treatment of m bovis-bcg infected human macrophages induces p2x <dig> receptor-dependent killing of intracellular mycobacteria.
induction of cell autophagy with atp was also temporally associated with a fall in intracellular mycobacterial viability, which was suppressed by treatment with wortmannin or the selective p2x <dig> antagonist, oxidized atp .
we provide the first evidence that atp/p2x7-mediated killing of intracellular mycobacteria involves the induction of cell autophagy.
in this study we demonstrate that the atp/p2x7-mediated, mycobactericidal effect also involves the induction of cell autophagy.
using ca2+-free media and selective p2x <dig> agonists and antagonists, atp-induced cell autophagy was shown to be ca2+ and p2x <dig> receptor-dependent.
we report that  <dig> mm atp induces rapid cell autophagy in thp <dig> cells and monocyte-derived macrophages within  <dig> minutes post-treatment, as revealed by the expression of lc3-ii bands on western blot analysis.
the mechanism mediating this bactericidal effect has not been full characterized but is known to be ca2+-dependent and to promote the maturation and acidification of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes.
the findings support the hypothesis that autophagy plays a key role in the control of mycobacterial infections.
confocal analysis further confirmed that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or pre-treatment of macrophages with anti-p2x <dig> antibody blocked atp-induced phago-lysosomal fusion.
