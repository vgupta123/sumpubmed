the pharynx is encircled by a prominent stomatogastric nerve ring, with a pair of anterior and lateral proboscis neurites directly connecting it to the central nervous system.
the scaffold of the adult central nervous system, which is already established in early developmental stages of axiothella, consists of cerebral commissures that give rise to simple circumesophageal connectives with fused ventral and dorsal roots and a single ventral neurite bundle.
comparative neurodevelopmental analysis of capitellid and echiuran species reveals several common characters, including simple circumesophageal connectives, a single fused ventral nerve strand, and a stomatogastric ring nerve, that support a close relationship of both taxa, thus corroborating recent molecular phylogenetic analyses.
recent molecular studies support the position of the echiura, traditionally ranked as a separate phylum, within the capitellids.
one pair of ventral and one pair of dorsal longitudinal muscles form the earliest rudiments of the bodywall musculature in late larval stages, while a continuous layer of circular muscles is lacking throughout ontogeny.
from the latter arise segmental neurites that innervate the peripheral bodywall.
the data on myogenesis show that four longitudinal muscle bands most likely represent an ancestral character not only for the capitellida, but for the annelida in general.
numerous phylogenetic analyses on polychaete annelids suggest a taxon capitellida that comprises the three families maldanidae, arenicolidae and capitellidae.
whether or not circular muscles are part of the annelid groundpattern remains uncertain.
