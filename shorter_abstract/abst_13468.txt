together the fmri and eeg results suggest that gamma band activity in the right stg and left ifg plays an important role during perceptual learning.
the results of fmri analyses revealed significant attention and learning related activity in left and right superior temporal gyrus stg as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus ifg.
analysis of current localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus revealed gamma band activity correlated with behavioral performance.
rapid improvement in task performance is accompanied by plastic changes in the sensory cortex as well as superior areas gated by selective attention.
although fmri experiments have investigated changes in brain activity after relative to before perceptual learning, brain activity during perceptual learning has not been explored.

this work investigated brain activity related to auditory frequency discrimination learning using a variational bayesian approach for source localization, during simultaneous eeg and fmri recording.
current source localization of simultaneously recorded eeg data was estimated using a variational bayesian method.
