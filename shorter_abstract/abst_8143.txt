this method enzymatically creates a type i cap structure identical to that found in most eukaryotic mrnas, in contrast to the type  <dig> cap incorporated using the conventional co-transcriptional capping reaction.
site-directed mutagenesis of each of the first five in-frame methionine codons in the cd40l coding sequence demonstrated that dcs expressing a truncated cd40l protein initiated from the second methionine codon secreted the highest levels of il- <dig>  in addition, a post-transcriptional method of capping was utilized for final modification of the cd40l rna.
the combination of knocking out the first initiation methionine and post-transcriptional capping of the cd40l rna allowed for approximately a one log increase in il- <dig> levels by the transfected dcs.
in contrast to previous reports, this study demonstrates that the same effect can be achieved when rna encoding cd40l is electroporated into dcs as evidenced by secretion of il- <dig>  to achieve higher levels of il- <dig> secretion, a systematic approach involving modification of coding and noncoding regions was implemented to optimize protein expression in the dcs for the purpose of increasing il- <dig> secretion.
we believe this is a first report describing improved protein expression of post-transcriptionally capped rna in dcs.
the post-transcriptional capping which allows generation of a type i cap may have broad utility for optimization of protein expression from rna in dcs and other cell types.
rna transfection into dendritic cells  is widely used to achieve antigen expression as well as to modify dc properties.
