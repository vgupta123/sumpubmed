further, it demonstrates for the first time that ecotilling is a powerful method for exploring genetic diversity and allele mining in b. vulgaris.
these data provide the first genetic indication for the function of the flc homolog bvfl <dig> in beet.
currently sugar beets are sown in spring and harvested in autumn.
autumn-sown sugar beets that are grown for a full year have been regarded as a cropping system to increase the productivity of sugar beet cultivation.
however, for the development of these “winter beets” sufficient winter hardiness and a system for bolting control is needed.
further, we detected associations of nucleotide polymorphisms in bvfl <dig> with bolting before winter as well as winter hardiness.
sugar beet  is an important crop for sugar and biomass production in temperate climate regions.
we screened a diversity panel of  <dig> b. vulgaris accessions for three flowering time genes via ecotilling.
this panel had been tested in the field for bolting behaviour and winter hardiness.
