kinmut relays on a combination of sequence-derived features that describe mutations at different levels:  gene level: membership to a specific group in kinbase and the annotation with go terms;  domain level: annotated pfam domains; and  residue level: physicochemical features of amino acids, specificity determining positions, and functional annotations from swissprot and firedb.
finally, we compare kinmut with other state-of-the-art prediction methods.
most of the many mutations described in human protein kinases are tolerated without significant disruption of the corresponding structures or molecular functions, while some of them have been associated to a variety of human diseases, including cancer.
we present kinmut, a support vector machine  approach, to identify pathogenic mutations in the protein kinase superfamily.
still, current high-throughput sequencing efforts and the concomitant need for massive interpretation of protein sequence variants will demand for more efficient and/or accurate computational methods in the forthcoming years.
family-specific features appear among the most discriminative information sources, which allow us to produce accurate results in a reliable and very simple way with minimal supervision.
