the best performing models encoded kinase sequences with amino acid physico-chemical z-scale descriptors and used support vector machines or partial least- squares projections to latent structures for the correlations.
protein kinases play crucial roles in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.
abnormal function of protein kinases can lead to many serious diseases, such as cancer.
we compared six approaches for description of protein kinases and several linear and non-linear correlation methods.
we also investigated the relationship between the number of protein kinases in the dataset and the modelling results.
proteochemometrics might be used to speed-up identification and optimization of protein kinase targeted and multi-targeted inhibitors.
the best models showed high predictive ability; the squared correlation coefficient for new kinase-inhibitor pairs ranging p <dig> =  <dig> - <dig> ; for new kinases it ranged p2kin =  <dig> - <dig> .
models could also separate interacting from non-interacting inhibitor-kinase pairs with high sensitivity and specificity; the areas under the roc curves ranging auc =  <dig> - <dig> .
our results strongly support the applicability of proteochemometrics for kinome-wide interaction modelling.
kinase inhibitors have potential for treatment of these diseases.
