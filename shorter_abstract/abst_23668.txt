the expression of two novel mirnas, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  only in plants growing under the influence of seawater suggested their metabolic regulatory roles specific to saline environments, and such behavior might be mediated by alterations in the expression of certain genes, modifications of proteins leading to changes in their activity and production of secondary metabolites as revealed by the mirna target predictions.
the presence of the precursors of seven conserved mirnas was validated in s. maritima.
in addition,  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted using the ests of two mangrove plants, rhizophora mangle and heritiera littoralis, and the precursors of seven mirnas were found in s. maritima.
an expression study of the novel mirnas in plants of diverse ecological and taxonomic groups revealed that two of the mirnas, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  were also expressed in oryza sativa, whereas another two, sma-mir <dig> and sma-mir <dig>  were only expressed in plants growing under the influence of seawater, similar to s. maritima.
hence, this manuscript describes the results from the mirna profiling of the halophyte suaeda maritima, which is used worldwide to study salt tolerance in plants.
most of the mirnas considered for characterization were responsive to nacl application, indicating their importance in the regulation of metabolic activities in plants exposed to salinity.

moreover, the auxin responsive factor targeted by sma-mir <dig> could also be involved in salt tolerance because the target is conserved between species.
