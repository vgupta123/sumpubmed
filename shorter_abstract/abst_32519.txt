specifically, we identify gene triplets composed of genes whose expression profiles are found to be related by various types of logic functions.
in order to focus on complexes, we associate the members of a gene triplet with the distinct protein complexes to which they belong.
by grouping gene triplets, we are able to decipher coordinated regulation among sets of three complexes.
the analysis proposed here focuses on relationships among triplets of genes that are not evident when genes are examined in a pairwise fashion as in typical clustering methods.
we propose a new methodology that is able to detect such higher order relationships.
one notable example is the relationship between the transcription of the ribosome, rna polymerase and mannosyltransferase ii, which is involved in n-linked glycan processing in the golgi.
we detect coordinated regulation of multiple protein complexes using logic analysis of gene expression data.
in this network we find that all multi-protein complexes that belong to the same functional class are regulated in the same direction as a group .
many of the functional units in cells are multi-protein complexes such as rna polymerase, the ribosome, and the proteasome.
