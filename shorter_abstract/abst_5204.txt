the program estimates the expected fragment size of representative 16s rrna gene sequences  for a given primer and restriction enzyme and provides candidate taxonomic assignments.
furthermore, t-rfpred is useful in experimental design for the selection of primers as well as the type and number of restriction enzymes that will yield informative chromatograms from natural microbial communities.
to show the accuracy of the program, t-rflp profiles of a marine bacterial community were described using artificial bacterioplankton clone libraries of sequences obtained from public databases.
thus, large 16s rrna gene datasets from environmental studies, including metagenomes, or public databases can be used as the reference set.
t-rfpred, terminal-restriction fragment prediction, was developed to identify and assign taxonomic information to chromatogram peaks of a t-rflp fingerprint for a more comprehensive description of microbial communities.
in particular, it circumvents the need for full-length 16s rrna gene sequences during taxonomic assignments of t-rf peaks.
for all valid chromatogram peaks, a phylogenetic group could be assigned.
terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism  is a technique used to analyze complex microbial communities.
