rna-seq-based transcriptomics analysis revealed diverse expression patterns of ptlecrlk genes among leaves, stems, roots, buds and reproductive tissues and organs.
however, little is known about lecrlks in perennial woody plants.
this study offers a comprehensive view of lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus and provides a foundation for functional characterization of this important family of receptor-like kinases.
among rlks, the lectin receptor-like kinases  possess a characteristic extracellular carbohydrate-binding lectin domain and play important roles in plant development and innate immunity.

here we report the genome-wide analysis of classification, domain architecture and expression of lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus.
based on domain architecture and orientation features, we classified ptlecrlks into eight different classes.
we found that the lecrlk family has expanded in populus to a total of  <dig>  including 180 g-type, 50 l-type and  <dig> c-type lecrlks.
receptor-like kinases  belong to a large protein family with over  <dig> members in arabidopsis and over  <dig> in rice.
