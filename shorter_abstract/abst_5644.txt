stable states for discrete models are efficiently counted and identified using binary decision diagrams.
this speed-up also facilitates a much more thorough sampling of continuous state spaces which may lead to the identification of new stable states.
the high degree polynomial interpolation of boolean genetic regulatory networks  in cellular processes such as apoptosis or proliferation allows for the modeling of a wider range of node interactions than continuous activator-inhibitor models, but suffers from scaling problems for networks which contain nodes with more than ~ <dig> inputs.
as a part of our new grn simulation framework jimena we introduce and setup boolean-tree-based data structures;  corresponding algorithms greatly expedite the calculation of the polynomial interpolation in almost all cases, thereby expanding the range of networks which can be simulated by this model in reasonable time.
jimena simulates currently available grns about 10- <dig> times faster than the previous implementation of the polynomial interpolation model and even greater gains are achieved for large scale-free networks.
