use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both wzd and wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form.
when tyrosine  <dig> was mutated to phenylalanine, wzdy266f showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated wzd genes, when expressed along with wze and wzb in lactococcus lactis subsp.
cremoris mg <dig>  in order to demonstrate the importance of atp for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion wzb, wzd and wze proteins were expressed and purified from escherichia coli cultures.
the wze tyrosine kinase protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.

the modulator protein, wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status.
however, wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated wzd in the presence of 10 mm atp.
