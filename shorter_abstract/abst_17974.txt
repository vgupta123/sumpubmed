netineti performs better  compared to a popular dictionary based approach  on a 600-page biodiversity book that was manually marked by an annotator.
we evaluated netineti on legacy biodiversity texts and biomedical literature .
on a small set of pubmed centralâ€™s full text articles annotated with scientific names, the precision and recall values are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.
netineti also successfully identifies almost all of the new species names mentioned within web pages.
we present netineti , a machine learning based approach for recognition of scientific names including the discovery of new species names from text that will also handle misspellings, ocr errors and other variations in names.
the system generates candidate names using rules for scientific names and applies probabilistic machine learning methods to classify names based on structural features of candidate names and features derived from their contexts.
netineti can also disambiguate scientific names from other names using the contextual information.
we present netineti, a machine learning based approach for identification and discovery of scientific names.
a scientific name acts as an important metadata element to link biological information.
netineti found more than  <dig>  unique binomial and trinomial names in more than  <dig> , <dig> pubmed records when used on the full medline database.
a scientific name for an organism can be associated with almost all biological data.
