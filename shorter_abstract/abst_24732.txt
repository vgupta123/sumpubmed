c. jejuni adhesion may also be modulated by a bacterial capsule.
in this study we report an in vitro model for the investigation of bacterial interaction with analogs of host cell receptors.
in contrast, jlpa glycoprotein adhesin is not required for such interaction.
campylobacter jejuni  is the leading causative agent of bacterial gastrointestinal infections.
however, the role of this structure in adhesion was not clear due to conflicting results published by different research groups.
the results suggest an interfering effect of capsule on bacterial attachment.
the results will assist in better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of c. jejuni in general and the role of capsule in the process in particular.
although some putative c. jejuni adhesins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of their interaction with host cells and their role in pathogenesis remain to be elucidated.
the aim of this study was to clarify the role of capsule in bacterial interaction with host cells by using an in vitro model of adhesion and an analogue of a host cell receptor.
we demonstrate that peb <dig> is one of the cell surface glycoproteins required for bacterial interaction with an analogue of a host cell receptor.
one approach is the design of drugs preventing bacterial attachment to host cells.
we demonstrate that the production of capsule reduces bacterial attachment, and that the genes involved in capsule and peb <dig> adhesin biosynthesis are differentially regulated.
in addition, using a liquid culture, we demonstrate differential expression of a gene involved in capsule production  and a gene encoding a glycoprotein adhesin .
