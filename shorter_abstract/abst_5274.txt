although the binding affinities of il- <dig> and il- <dig> to il-4rα differ by a factor of more than  <dig>  the specificity remains high because the receptor subunit il-4rα binds exclusively to il- <dig> and il- <dig>  an interface formed by several interaction clusters/binding hot-spots allows for a broad range of affinities by selecting how many of these interaction clusters will contribute to the overall binding free energy.
for signal transduction, both cytokines can utilise the same receptor, consisting of the il-4rα and the il-13rα <dig> chain, offering an explanation for their overlapping biological functions.
since both cytokine ligands share only moderate similarity on the amino acid sequence level, molecular recognition of the ligands by both receptor subunits is of great interest.
high specificity requires high affinity and vice versa.
mutating residues thr <dig> or phe <dig> located in cluster  <dig> to aspartate results in super-agonistic il- <dig> variants.
structural determination of a number of il- <dig> variants together with in vitro binding studies show that il- <dig> and its high-affinity receptor subunit il-4rα interact via a modular protein-protein interface consisting of three independently-acting interaction clusters.
understanding how proteins generate affinity and specificity is essential as more and more growth factor receptor families show promiscuous binding to their respective ligands.
the modular architecture of the il-4-il-4rα interface suggests a possible mechanism by which proteins might be able to generate binding affinity and specificity independently.
