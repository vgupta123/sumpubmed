we employed whole-head meg to study cortical activity during self-paced volitional swallowing with and without topical oropharyngeal anesthesia in ten healthy subjects.
oropharyngeal anesthesia led to a pronounced decrease of both sensory and motor activation.
in the present study we therefore investigated effects of functional oropharyngeal disruption on the cortical control of swallowing.
the analysis of normal swallowing revealed bilateral activation of the mid-lateral primary sensorimotor cortex.
from a clinical point of view, oropharyngeal sensory deficits have been shown to be an important cause of dysphagia and aspiration in stroke patients.
apart from diminished sensory activity, a reduced activation of the primary motor cortex was found.
our results suggest that a short-term decrease in oropharyngeal sensory input impedes the cortical control of swallowing.
sensory input is crucial to the initiation and modulation of swallowing.
data were analyzed by means of synthetic aperture magnetometry  and the group analysis of the individual sam data was performed using a permutation test.
