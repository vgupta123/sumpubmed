the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of transport on live weight, physiological and haematological responses of bulls after road transport of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours .
our findings showed that live weight and some physiological and haematological responses of bulls returned to pre-transport levels within  <dig> h with animals having had access to feed and water.
under the conditions of the present study, transport of bulls on journeys by road, ranging from  <dig> h  to  <dig> h  duration, affected live weight, haematological and physiological measurements of metabolism and inflammation.
blood protein, glucose and nefa concentrations and creatine kinase activity were greater  in the bulls following transport and returned to baseline within  <dig> h.
bulls travelling for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  lost  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   percentage  live weight compared with baseline.
live weight re-gained to pre-transport levels during the  <dig> h recovery period.
