the ion ampliseqâ„¢ transcriptome human gene expression kit  was recently introduced by life technologies as a whole-transcriptome, targeted gene quantification kit to overcome these limitations of rna-seq.
we analyzed standard reference rna samples and rna samples obtained from human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes .
additionally, for genes with high abundance, ampliseq outperforms the two rna-seq methods.
all three statistical methods demonstrate ampliseq as a highly accurate method for differential gene expression analysis.
using published data from two standard rna reference samples, we observed a strong concordance of log <dig> fold change for all genes when comparing ampliseq to illumina hiseq  and ion torrent proton .
however, rna-seq carries a few limitations, e.g., the requirement of a significant amount of input rna and complications led by non-specific mapping of short reads.
thus, ampliseq stands as a very sensitive and cost-effective approach for very large scale gene expression analysis and mrna marker screening with high accuracy.
whole transcriptome sequencing  represents a powerful approach for whole transcriptome gene expression analysis.
when analyzing four closely related hipsc-cm lines, we show that both ampliseq and rna-seq capture similar global gene expression patterns consistent with known sources of variations.
