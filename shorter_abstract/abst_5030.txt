however, the manual approach for the characterisation of these fragments using blast web interfaces is not suited for larger number of sequences and so far, no user-friendly software is publicly available.
the software performs blast analyses to identify the genes represented by the sequences and suggests primers to complete the sequencing of the whole insert.
the application features an intuitive graphical interface and is designed for researchers without any bioinformatics skills.
gene-specific information as well as the protein domains encoded by the cdna fragment are retrieved from internet-based databases and included in the output.
furthermore, we identified  <dig> protein domains within our analysed clones.
it is therefore essential to the relevance of experimental results to confirm or determine the identity of the employed cdna fragments.
many genetic studies and functional assays are based on cdna fragments.
after the generation of cdna fragments from an mrna sample, their content is at first unknown and must be assigned by sequencing reactions or hybridisation experiments.
we used fragident to identify  <dig> cdna clones from a yeast two-hybrid experiment.
