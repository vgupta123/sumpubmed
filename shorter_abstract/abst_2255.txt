our vectors apply positive selection for the insert or negative selection against empty vector molecules and drive strong expression of target proteins in e.coli cells.
this position of the promoter permits positive selection and attenuated expression of fusion proteins with c-terminal tags.
our results establish co-transformation and positive/negative selection cloning in conjunction with the provided vectors and selection cassettes as an automatable alternative to commercialized high-throughput cloning systems like gatewayÂ® or ligase-independent cloning  .
we have established an automated, fast and flexible low-cost expression cloning approach requiring only vector and insert amplification by pcr and co-transformation of the products.
the target proteins were cloned, expressed and detected using an automated tecan freedom evo ii liquid handling work station.
