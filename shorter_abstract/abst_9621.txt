a time consuming phase of the methodology is the selection of tissue areas within paraffin blocks: no utilities have been developed for the identification of areas to be punched from the donor block and assembled in the recipient block.
these features are analysed using an algorithm which performs the extraction of morphological parameters from images and compares them to experimentally validated threshold values.
the presented work supports, in the specific case of a primary subtype of breast cancer , the semi-automatic discrimination and localization between normal and pathological regions within the tissues.
in particular, on a total of  <dig> sub-images showing normal and pathological areas of breast specimens, algorithm accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are respectively 89%, 84% and 94%.
results are satisfactory since in most of the cases the automatic diagnosis matches the response of the pathologists.
