in order to elucidate the function of erp we searched for erp-binding proteins from m. tuberculosis by using a bacterial two-hybrid system.
while rv <dig> is disseminated in several actinomycetales genera, orthologues of rv2617c are exclusively present in members of the m. tuberculosis complex .
we identified interactive partners of erp, an m. tuberculosis protein involved in virulence, which will be the focus of future investigation to decipher the function of the erp family protein.
the exported repetitive protein  gene encodes a secreted 36-kda protein with a central domain containing several proline-glycine-leucine-threonine-serine  repeats.
our results indicate that erp interacts specifically with two putative membrane proteins, rv <dig> and rv2617c.
immunolocalization experiments showed that rv <dig> and rv2617c are found on the cell membrane and erp on the bacterial cell wall.
erp forms from mycobacterium smegmatis and mycobacterium leprae were not able to interact with rv2617c in two-hybrid assays.
further analysis revealed that the latter two interact with each other, indicating that rv <dig>  rv2617c and erp are connected through multiple interactions.
finally, comparative genomics and expression studies revealed a possible role of rv <dig> in riboflavin metabolism.
