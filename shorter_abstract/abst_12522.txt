the classifiers used are bayesian classifiers based on markov chain models.
the proposed recursive scheme represents an interesting methodology for learning and combining classifiers.
hensbc is a recursive algorithm which constructs a hierarchical ensemble of classifiers.
the method is computationally efficient and competitive with the previously reported approaches in terms of prediction accuracies as empirical results indicate.
this study introduces an algorithm which uses only the primary sequence of a protein to predict its subcellular location.
it would be worthwhile to develop a method to predict the subcellular location for a given protein when only the amino acid sequence of the protein is known.
we tested our method on six various datasets; among them are gram-negative bacteria dataset, data for discriminating outer membrane proteins and apoptosis proteins dataset.
the subcellular location of a protein is closely related to its function.
although many efforts have been made to predict subcellular location from sequence information only, there is the need for further research to improve the accuracy of prediction.
a novel method called hensbc is introduced to predict protein subcellular location.
we observed that our method can predict the subcellular location with high accuracy.
