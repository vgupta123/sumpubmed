here we propose using a repository of published gene lists for the identification of interesting datasets to be subjected to more detailed numerical analysis.
detailed numerical analysis of these data identified two sets of genes with clearly distinct roles in the g1/s and the g2/m phases of the cell cycle, as measured by enrichment of gene ontology categories.
we identified a highly significant overlap of p <dig> and prb target genes with genes regulated by the ews/fli fusion protein.
we searched these gene lists for statistically significant overlaps with lists of genes regulated by the tumor suppressors p <dig> and prb.
