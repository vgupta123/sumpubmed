individual transcripts and gene families involved in metabolic based herbicide resistance were identified.
the combined transcriptome assembly consists of  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> and average contig length of  <dig> and 658 bp, respectively.
de novo transcriptome assembly enabled the generation of the first reference transcriptome of a. spica-venti.
compared with other grass species, a. spica-venti has 26% proteins in common to brachypodium distachyon, and 41% to lolium spp.
the lack of genetic information about this noxious weed limits its biological understanding such as growth, reproduction, genetic variation, molecular ecology and metabolic herbicide resistance.
this study produced a reference transcriptome for a. spica-venti from different tissues  and various growth stages .
the gstf <dig> and cyp89a <dig> transcripts were recovered from the majority of tissues and aligned at a maximum of  <dig> and 30% to proven herbicide resistant allele from alopecurus myosuroides and lolium rigidum, respectively.
the de novo assembly was performed on individual and combined dataset followed by functional annotations.
loose silky bentgrass  is an important weed in europe with a recent increase in herbicide resistance cases.
this can serve as stepping stone for understanding the metabolic herbicide resistance as well as the general biology of this problematic weed.
