being able to categorize new versus familiar objects would allow dolphins a rapid adaptation to novel environments.
the stimuli presented ranged from very familiar objects  to familiar objects  to unfamiliar objects .
at the group level, dolphins used their left eye to observe very familiar objects and their right eye to observe unfamiliar objects.
our experimental results pointed out some cognitive capacities of dolphins which might be crucial for their wild life given their fission-fusion social system and migratory behaviour.
the rare reports concerning visual laterality of marine mammals investigated mainly discrimination processes.
visual laterality could be a prerequisite to this adaptability.
to date, no study, to our knowledge, has analyzed the environmental factors that could influence their visual laterality.
we investigated visual laterality expressed spontaneously at the water surface by a group of five common bottlenose dolphins  in response to various stimuli.
many studies of cerebral asymmetries in different species lead, on the one hand, to a better understanding of the functions of each cerebral hemisphere and, on the other hand, to develop an evolutionary history of hemispheric laterality.
our results suggest different visual cerebral processes based either on the global shape of well-known objects or on local details of unknown objects.
however, eyes are used indifferently to observe familiar objects with intermediate valence.
as dolphins are migrant species they are confronted to a changing environment.
moreover, the manipulation of an object appears necessary for these dolphins to construct a global representation of an object enabling its immediate categorization for subsequent use.
