areas were compared for pro- and anti-angiogenic gene expression using targeted taqman microfluidity cards containing  <dig> genes and real-time pcr.
angiogenesis is critical for the development of new microvessels and leads to re-formation of collateral circulation, reperfusion, enhanced neuronal survival and improved recovery.
angiogenesis correlates with patient survival following acute ischaemic stroke, and survival of neurons is greatest in tissue undergoing angiogenesis.
here, we have isolated active  and inactive  micro-vessel rich-regions from stroke-affected and contralateral tissue of patients using laser-capture micro-dissection.
