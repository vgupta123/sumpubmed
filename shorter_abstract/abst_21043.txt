these tandem substitutions, when affecting multiple nucleotides within a single protein codon of a gene, result in a translated amino acid involving all nucleotides in that codon.
mac can identify and correct amino acid predictions that result from mnvs affecting multiple nucleotides within a single protein codon, which cannot be handled by most existing snv-based variant pipelines.
most existing variant callers report a mnv as individual single-nucleotide variants , often resulting in multiple triplet codon sequences and incorrect amino acid predictions.
using an example data set containing  <dig> snvs and the corresponding whole-genome sequencing bam files, we show that mac identified eight potentially mis-annotated snvs, and accurately updated the amino acid predictions for seven of the variant calls.
mac was designed as an application that only requires a snv file and the matching bam file as data inputs.
the mac software is freely available and represents a useful tool for the accurate translation of genomic sequence to protein function.
