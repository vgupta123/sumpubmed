in this study, we assessed whether the osteoregenerative potential of msc spheroids is greater than that of monolayer mscs.
msc spheroids were generated from rat mscs  using low-binding plates.
real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemical analysis indicated that osteogenic properties were accelerated in msc spheroids compared with monolayer rmscs when treated with an osteoblast-inducer reagent for 7 days.
moreover, increased calcium deposition was visualized in msc spheroids using alizarin red staining.
our in-vitro and in-vivo results reveal that mscs in the spheroid culture exhibit enhanced osteoregenerative efficiency compared with monolayer mscs.
mesenchymal stem cells  are a favored cell source for regenerative medicine because of their multilinage potential.
however, the conventional monolayer technique used to culture mscs, inadequately overcomes their low differentiation capacity.
in a rat calvarial defect model, micro-computed tomography and histological assays showed that msc spheroid-engrafted defects experienced enhanced bone regeneration.

culture of mscs in multicellular spheroids, more accurately mimics the in-vivo microenvironment; thus, resolving this problem.
