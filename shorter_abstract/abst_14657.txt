we observed in field-grown tomatoes that spider mites  establish larger colonies on plants already infested with the tomato russet mite .
suppression of plant defenses has been shown to benefit herbivores by boosting their growth and reproductive performance.
our results show that the benefits of suppressing plant defenses may diminish within communities with natural competitors.
using laboratory assays, we observed that spider mites have a much higher reproductive performance on russet mite-infested plants, similar to their performance on the jasmonic acid -biosynthesis mutant def- <dig>  hence, we tested if russet mites suppress ja-responses thereby facilitating spider mites.
we found that russet mites manipulate defenses: they induce those mediated by salicylic acid  but suppress those mediated by ja which would otherwise hinder growth.
the spider mite-induced ja-response in the presence of russet mites was restored on transgenic tomatoes unable to accumulate sa , but russet mites alone still did not induce ja-responses on nahg plants.
thus, indirect facilitation of spider mites by russet mites depends on the antagonistic action of sa on ja while suppression of ja-defenses by russet mites does not.
finally, while facilitating spider mites, russet mites experience reduced population growth.
in contrast, spider mites induced both ja- and sa-responses while plants infested with the two mite species together display strongly reduced ja-responses, yet a doubled sa-response.
thus, whether or not host-defense manipulation improves an herbivoreâ€™s fitness depends on interactions with other herbivores via induced-host defenses, implicating bidirectional causation of community structure of herbivores sharing a plant.
