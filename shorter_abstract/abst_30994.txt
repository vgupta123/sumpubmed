we monitored the movement of sucking lice , parasites that require direct host-host contact to be transferred, in their host population of wild mouse lemurs .
we then tested the hypotheses that 1) the frequency of louse transfers, and thus interactions, would decrease with increasing distance between paired individual lemurs; 2) due to host polygynandry, social interactions and hence louse transfers would increase during the onset of the breeding season; and 3) individual mouse lemurs would vary in their contributions to the spread of lice.
studies of host-parasite interactions have the potential to provide insights into the ecology of both organisms involved.
we show that louse transfers involved  <dig> % of the studied lemur population, exclusively males.
louse transfers peaked during the breeding season, perhaps due to increased social interactions between lemurs.
our approach demonstrates the potential to uncover otherwise inaccessible parasite-host, and host social interaction data in any trappable species parasitized by sucking lice.
this method not only provided insight into the previously unseen parasite movement between lemurs, but also allowed us to infer social interactions between them.
we developed a simple, cost effective method exploiting the intimate relationship between louse and lemur, whereby individual lice were marked, without removal from their host, with an individualized code, and tracked throughout the lemur population.
