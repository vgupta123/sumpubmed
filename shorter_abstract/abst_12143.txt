in order to screen the huge dmd gene for all types of copy number variation mutations we designed a novel custom high density comparative genomic hybridisation array which contains the full genomic region of the dmd gene and spans from  <dig> kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the  <dig>  mb dmd gene.
the commonest pathogenic dmd changes are intragenic deletions/duplications which make up to 78% of all cases and point mutations  detectable through direct sequencing.
despite the high resolution of this approach, rna studies were required to confirm the functional significance of the intronic mutations identified by cgh.
rna studies are required in order to validate the significance of the cgh array findings.
we studied  <dig> dmd/bmd patients who either had no detectable mutations or carried previously identified quantitative pathogenic changes in the dmd gene.
in addition, rna analysis identified three intronic pathogenic variations affecting splicing which had not been detected by the cgh analysis.
