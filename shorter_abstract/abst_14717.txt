we investigate whether annotation of gene function can be improved using a classification scheme that is aware that functional classes are organized in a hierarchy.
together, these results show that gene function can be predicted with higher accuracy than previously achieved, using bayesian models that incorporate suitable prior information.
we use these models to predict the functional class of open reading frames  from the e. coli genome.
the mnl model using a prior based on the hierarchy outperforms both the non-hierarchical mnl model and the nested mnl model.
in contrast to previous attempts at combining the three sources of information in this dataset, our new approach to combining data sources produces a higher accuracy rate than applying our models to each data source alone.
we discuss three bayesian models and compare their performance in terms of predictive accuracy.
the classifiers look at phylogenic descriptors, sequence based attributes, and predicted secondary structure.
these models are the ordinary multinomial logit  model, a hierarchical model based on a set of nested mnl models, and an mnl model with a prior that introduces correlations between the parameters for classes that are nearby in the hierarchy.
the results from all three models show substantial improvement over previous methods, which were based on the c <dig> decision tree algorithm.
we also provide a new scheme for combining different sources of information.
