most approaches use sequence alignment to identify antigens.
the antigenicity of a sequence may be encoded in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification by sequence alignment.
it was developed to allow antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment.
the discovery of truly novel antigens will be frustrated by their lack of similarity to antigens of known provenance.
vaxijen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens.
to overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent methods, we propose a new alignment-free approach for antigen prediction, which is based on auto cross covariance  transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties.
vaccine development in the post-genomic era often begins with the in silico screening of genome information, with the most probable protective antigens being predicted rather than requiring causative microorganisms to be grown.
the derived models were tested by internal leave-one-out cross-validation and external validation using test sets.
some proteins lack obvious sequence similarity, although they may share similar structures and biological properties.
despite the obvious advantages of this approach – such as speed and cost efficiency – its success remains dependent on the accuracy of antigen prediction.
