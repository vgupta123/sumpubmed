here we use in silico approaches to investigate the major rna degradation machinery in giardia lamblia and compare it to a broad array of other parasitic protists.
with increasing evidence for pervasive transcription in cells, rna degradation has gained recognition as a means of regulating gene expression.
rna degradation is critical to the survival of all cells.
yet, rna degradation machinery has been studied extensively in only a few eukaryotic organisms, including saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans.
we have found key constituents of the deadenylation and decapping machinery and of the 5'-3' rna degradation pathway.
we have similarly found that all of the major 3'-5' rna degradation pathways are present in giardia, including both exosome-dependent and exosome-independent machinery.
however, we observe significant loss of rna degradation machinery genes that will result in important differences in the protein composition, and potentially functionality, of the various rna degradation pathways.
these findings suggest that although the full complement of the major rna degradation mechanisms were present - and likely functional - early in eukaryotic evolution, the composition and function of the complexes is more variable than previously appreciated.
giardia lamblia is a parasitic protist with unusual genomic traits: it is binucleated and tetraploid, has a very compact genome, displays a theme of genomic minimalism with cellular machinery commonly comprised of a reduced number of protein components, and has a remarkably large population of long, stable, noncoding, antisense rnas.
