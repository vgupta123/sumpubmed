genotyped cows with phenotypes on my, fy and py  and ci  were used in a two-stage analysis.
associations between yield traits and roh4mb were found for regions on bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> for the us population and bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> for the au population.
multiple potential epistatic interactions were characterized based on the gbm analysis.
phenotypes to determine roh4mb and additive effects were residuals from the two-stage approach and yield deviations, respectively.
the objective of this study was to characterize regions that have an impact on a runs of homozygosity  metric and estimate their association with the additive genetic effect of milk , fat  and protein yield  and calving interval  using australia  and united states  jersey cows.
