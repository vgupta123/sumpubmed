zinc’s ability to protect against enteric bacterial pathogens may be the result of its combined effects on host tissues as well as inhibition of virulence in some pathogens.
the close correlation between zinc’s effects on reca/sos and on stx suggested that inhibition of the sos response is one mechanism by which zinc protects against stec infection.
zinc was more potent and more efficacious than other metals tested in inhibiting reca expression induced by hydrogen peroxide, xanthine oxidase, or the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
many articles on zinc in bacteria, however, highlight the essential nature of this metal for bacterial growth and virulence, suggesting that zinc should make infections worse, not better.
using polarized monolayers of t <dig> cells we found that zinc protected against damage induced by hydrogen peroxide, as measured by trans-epithelial electrical resistance.
the sos bacterial stress response pathway is a powerful regulator of stx production in stec.
zinc was superior to other divalent metals to  in protecting against peroxide-induced epithelial damage, while copper also showed a protective effect.
to address this paradox, we tested whether zinc might have protective effects on intestinal epithelium as well as on the pathogen.
research focused solely on the effects of zinc on pathogenic microbes may give an incomplete picture by failing to account for protective effects of zinc on host epithelia.
we examined whether zinc’s known inhibitory effects on stx might be mediated by blocking the sos response.
