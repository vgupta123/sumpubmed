the pfge profiles of the s. epidermidis strains were compared with those of  <dig> isolates from milk of healthy women.
the milk of  <dig> women was collected and bacterial growth was noted in  <dig> of them, of which staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from  <dig> patients and s. aureus from  <dig>  among the  <dig> staphylococcal isolates recovered from milk of women with mastitis,  <dig> were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis by phenotypic assays, species-specific pcr and pcr sequencing.
the aims of this work were to isolate staphylococci from milk of women with lactational mastitis, to select and characterize the cns isolates, and to compare such properties with those displayed by cns strains isolated from milk of healthy women.
the number of strains that contained the biofilm-related icad gene and that showed resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and mupirocin was significantly higher among the strains isolated from mastitic milk.
although staphylococcus aureus is considered the main etiological agent of infectious mastitis, recent studies have suggested that coagulase-negative staphylococci  may also play an important role in such infections.
s. epidermidis may be a frequent but largely underrated cause of infectious mastitis in lactating women.
