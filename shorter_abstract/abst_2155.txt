a single orthologue of fak and the related pyk <dig> was found in non-vertebrate species.
gene duplication probably occurred in deuterostomes after the echinoderma embranchment, leading to the evolution of pyk <dig> with distinct properties.
cis-regulatory elements known to regulate alternative splicing were found in conserved alternative exons of fak or in the flanking introns.
focal adhesion kinase  is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase critical for processes ranging from embryo development to cancer progression.
these exons may therefore be crucial for fak function in specific tissues or during development.
the amino acid sequence of fak and pyk <dig> is conserved in their functional domains but not in their linker regions, with the absence of autophosphorylation site in c. elegans.
several of these non-conserved exons may correspond to transposable elements.
comparison of mouse and human fak genes revealed the existence of multiple combinations of conserved and non-conserved 5'-untranslated exons in fak transcripts suggesting a complex regulation of their expression.
the inclusion of conserved alternative exons was examined by rt-pcr in mouse and human brain during development.
although isoforms with specific molecular and functional properties have been characterized in rodents and chicken, the organization of fak gene throughout phylogeny and its potential to generate multiple isoforms are not well understood.
in contrast, other reported human variant exons were restricted to homo sapiens, and, in some cases, other primates.
