guanine quadruplex  is a four-stranded structure that contributes to genome instability and site-specific recombination.
highly conserved mismatch repair factors have emerged as potential g4-responding complexes because, in addition to initiating heteroduplex correction, the human homologs bind non-b form dna with high affinity.
we find by mobility shift assay that e. coli muts binds to g <dig> dna with high affinity better than binding to g-t heteroduplexes.
association with g <dig> dna by muts is not likely to activate the mismatch repair pathway because nucleotide binding did not promote release of muts or muts f36a from g <dig> dna as it does for heteroduplexes.
g <dig> recognition activities occur under physiological conditions, and we find that m <dig> phage harboring g4-capable dna poorly infected a muts deficient strain of e. coli compared to m13mp <dig>  suggesting functional roles for mismatch repair factors in the cellular response to unstable genomic elements.
here, we asked if e. coli muts and a heteroduplex recognition mutant, muts f36a, were capable of recognizing and responding to g <dig> dna structures.
taken together, our findings demonstrate that e. coli muts has a binding activity specific for non-b form g <dig> dna, but such binding appears independent of canonical heteroduplex repair activation.
moreover, the muts homologs across species have the capacity to recognize a diverse range of dna pairing variations and damage, suggesting a conserved ability to bind non-b form dna.
in the same assay, muts f36a failed to recognize g-t mismatched oligonucleotides, as expected, but retained an ability to bind to g <dig> dna.
