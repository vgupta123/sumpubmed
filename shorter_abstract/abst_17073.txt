here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri­nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence.
in addition, spectre performs comparably to a recently published method similarly based on spectral coherence, however with reduced runtime and memory requirements.

prevailing analytical approaches applied to this technology make use of sequence fragment length profiling or reading frame occupancy enrichment to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy.
a comparison of spectre against previously published methods on existing data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high accuracy at a low false discovery rate.
