we incorporated the mapping quality of each read and the corresponding base quality on the reads into the emission probability of hmm.
snvhmm incorporated the base quality and mapping quality of all observed bases and reads, and also provides the option for users to choose the confidence of the observation for snvs prediction.
therefore, more probability power can be gained over the bayes based methods, which is very useful for snvs detection for data with low sequencing depth.
the context information of the whole observation as well as its confidence were completely utilized to infer the genotype for each position on the genome in study.
however, ngs has lower sequence coverage and poor snvs detection capability in the regulatory regions of the genome.
a new tool snvhmm basing on a discrete hidden markov model  was developed to infer the genotype for each position on the genome.
