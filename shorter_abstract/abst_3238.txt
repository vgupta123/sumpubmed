this database provides statistical results for differentially expressed mirnas in each data set.
the significance analysis of microarrays method was used to retrieve the mirnas that have dramatically different expression levels in cancers when compared to normal tissues.
their key effects on various biological processes, e.g., embryonic development, cell division, differentiation and apoptosis, are widely recognized.
micrornas  are small noncoding rnas about  <dig> nt long that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
annotations about each mirna can be queried through mirna id or mirbase accession numbers, or can be browsed by different cancer types.
here we present a database of differentially expressed mirnas in human cancers , to explore aberrantly expressed mirnas among different cancers.
this database is expected to be a valuable source for identification of cancer-related mirnas, thereby helping with the improvement of classification, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.
