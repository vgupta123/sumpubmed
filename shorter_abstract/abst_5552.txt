among the enhancements to the software is the ability to analyze the b-factor of protein regions involved in predicted disulfide bonds.
disulfide engineering is an important biotechnological tool that has advanced a wide range of research.
importantly, this feature facilitates the identification of potential disulfides that are not only likely to form but are also expected to provide improved thermal stability to the protein.
the introduction of novel disulfide bonds into proteins has been used extensively to improve protein stability, modify functional characteristics, and to assist in the study of protein dynamics.
successful use of this technology is greatly enhanced by software that can predict pairs of residues that will likely form a disulfide bond if mutated to cysteines.
