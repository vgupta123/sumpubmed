sfssclass is used for classifying multiple classes of tumors and cancer cell lines.
a judicious integration of such knowledge with effective mirna and sample selection through a biclustering approach could be an important step in improving the accuracy of tumor classification.
in this article, a novel classification technique called sfssclass is developed that judiciously integrates a biclustering technique samba for simultaneous feature  and sample  selection , a cancer-mirna network that we have developed by mining the literature of experimentally verified cancer-mirna relationships and a classifier uncorrelated shrunken centroid .
the advantage of incorporating biclustering integrated with the cancer-mirna network is evident from the consistently better performance of sfssclass  over usc .
in this article, we develop the sfssclass algorithm which judiciously integrates a biclustering technique for simultaneous feature  and sample  selection, the cancer-mirna network and a classifier.
current approaches of tumor classification using mirna expression data do not integrate the experimental knowledge available in the literature.
for example, while the best accuracy reported in the literature for classifying pdt samples is ~ <dig> %, the accuracy of sfssclass is found to be ~ <dig> %.
the novel integration of experimental knowledge with computational tools efficiently selects relevant features that have high intra-class and low inter-class similarity.
