the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the striatum, the thalamus, and the colliculi showed high intensity of labelling, suggesting its implication in topographic mapping of olfactory, retinocollicular, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and mesostriatal systems.
in the olfactory nerve, we found an early ephrina <dig> protein expression at e <dig>  suggesting its implication in the guidance of primary olfactory neurons into the olfactory bulb.
this expression pattern points out the potential sites of action of this molecule in the olfactory, retinotectal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and mesostriatal systems, during development.
using immunohistochemistry, we found that ephrina <dig> protein is highly expressed in the developing mouse brain from e <dig>  to e <dig> .
our work shows that ephrina <dig> protein is expressed in restrictive regions of the developing mouse brain.
following e <dig> , the signal faded gradually and was barely detectable at p <dig>  suggesting a main role for ephrina <dig> in primary molecular events in topographic map formation.
this study is essential to better understand the role of ephrina <dig> during developmental topographic mapping of connections and to further characterise the mechanisms involved in pathway restoration following cell transplantation in the damaged brain.
