automated predictor algorithms that compare and contrast the paired samples to each other could result in a new generation of test panels that compare to a person’s healthy reference to enhance predictive accuracy.
remarkably, these gains in accuracy are achieved by using smaller panels of genes, e.g.,  <dig> % fewer for h3n <dig> and  <dig> % fewer for h1n <dig>  the biomarkers selected by the predictors fall into two categories: 1) contrasting genes that tend to differentially express between target and reference samples over the population; 2) reinforcement genes that remain constant over the two samples, which function as housekeeping normalization genes.
using gene microarray data collected in a large scale serially sampled respiratory virus challenge study we quantify the diagnostic advantage of pairing a person’s baseline reference with his or her target sample.
many of these genes are common to all  <dig> viruses and their roles in the predictor elucidate the function that they play in differentiating the different states of host immune response.
consider the problem of designing a panel of complex biomarkers to predict a patient’s health or disease state when one can pair his or her current test sample, called a target sample, with the patient’s previously acquired healthy sample, called a reference sample.
as contrasted to a population averaged reference this reference sample is individualized.
we train  reference-aided sparse multi-class classifier algorithms on this data to show that inclusion of a subject’s reference sample can improve prediction accuracy by as much as  <dig> %, for the h3n <dig> cohort, and by at least  <dig> %, for the h1n <dig> cohort.
