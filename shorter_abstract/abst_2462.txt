here we report on changes in global gene expression of cultured mscs isolated from the bone marrow of mice at ages  <dig>   <dig>  and 26-months.
mesenchymal stem cells  are pluripotent cells, present in the bone marrow and other tissues that can differentiate into cells of all germ layers and may be involved in tissue maintenance and repair in adult organisms.
microarray analyses revealed significant changes in the expression of more than  <dig> genes with stage-specific changes of multiple differentiation, cell cycle and growth factor genes.
these changes were evident despite multiple cell divisions in vitro after bone marrow isolation.
the results suggest that mscs are subject to molecular genetic changes during aging that are conserved during passage in culture.
key markers of adipogenesis including lipoprotein lipase, fabp <dig>  and itm2a displayed age-dependent declines.
expression of the master cell cycle regulators p <dig> and p <dig> and growth factors hgf and vegf also declined significantly at  <dig> months.
age has been linked with changes in osteogenic and adipogenic potential of mscs.
