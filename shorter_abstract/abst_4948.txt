systemic inflammation was defined as present if crp > 35 mg/l.
clinicopathological changes included increased total leucocyte count, crp and troponin concentration on day  <dig>  the ctni concentration was increased in dogs with systemic inflammation, compared to dogs without systemic inflammation.
concentrations of c-reactive protein  and high sensitivity cardiac troponin i , hematology variables and prothrombin time  were determined.
the two treatment groups were compared regarding clinical status and clinicopathological test results.
the results of the present study do not support routine administration of a single dose of prednisolone 1 mg/kg subcutaneously in dogs bitten by vipera berus.
dogs were examined clinically and mental status and extent of edema were described.
the mental status was reduced in 60/ <dig>  of dogs on day  <dig>  compared to 19/ <dig>  on day  <dig>  the proportion of dogs with no or only mild edema increased significantly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  about one-third of the dogs developed gastrointestinal signs during the study period.
a single dose of prednisolone did not significantly affect any of the clinical or clinicopathological parameters studied, except for a higher monocyte count on day  <dig> in dogs that had received prednisolone treatment.

furthermore, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, cardiac arrhythmia and death were recorded.
a total of  <dig> dogs bitten by vipera berus within the previous 24 hours were included.
dogs were given prednisolone 1 mg/kg bodyweight  or saline  subcutaneously in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
none of the dogs died during the study period.
the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of prednisolone in dogs envenomated by vipera berus in a double-blind placebo-controlled study, after exclusion of dogs treated with antivenom.
