of the analysed methods, the boruta algorithm predicted the most genes as potentially important.
when the number of consistently selected genes was considered, the boruta algorithm was clearly the best.
although it was also the most computationally intensive method, the boruta algorithmâ€™s computational demands could be reduced to levels comparable to those of other algorithms by replacing the random forest importance with a comparable measure from random ferns .
despite their design assumptions, the minimal optimal selection methods, were found to select a high fraction of false positives.
gene selection is an important part of microarray data analysis because it provides information that can lead to a better mechanistic understanding of an investigated phenomenon.
at the same time, gene selection is very difficult because of the noisy nature of microarray data.
the post-selection classifier error rate, which is a frequently used measure, was found to be a potentially deceptive measure of gene selection quality.
the analysis focused on the stability of selection because, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results, it is often ignored in similar studies.
in this work, four state-of-the-art random forest-based feature selection methods were compared in a gene selection context.
as a consequence, gene selection is often performed with machine learning methods.
the random forest method is particularly well suited for this purpose.
