a type i error of  <dig>  was adjusted to correct for the multiplicity of the primary clinical endpoints.
this study thus aimed at determining the technical validity of some clinical endpoints on oa pain in dogs using the green-lipped mussel -enriched diet.
the pvfbw exhibited the best technical validity for the characterization of the beneficial effect of a glm-enriched diet.
the csom exhibited a negative relationship with the pvfbw  and ma duration .
motor activity  was continuously recorded in seven dogs using telemetered accelerometric counts.
we hypothesized that these methods would produce convergent results related to diet changes.
the kinetic gait analysis parameter , electrodermal activity , and a standardized multifactorial pain questionnaire  were performed on day   <dig> , d <dig>  and d <dig> .
changes in the pvfbw , the csom  and the ma intensity  from d <dig> to d <dig> suggested an effect of diet.
the conceptual validity of kinetic gait analysis and disability outcome assessment methods has guided their use in the assessment of pain caused by osteoarthritis .
no consensus on the best clinical methods for pain evaluation in canine oa exists, particularly, when evaluating treatments where a smaller treatment effect is anticipated than with pharmacological pain killers.
