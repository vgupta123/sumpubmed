fluorescence also increases in relative efficiency with increasing depth, which has generated speculation about its possible function as a “light organ” to detect cryptic organisms under bluish light.
we repeatedly presented  <dig> copepods to individual fish  kept under a narrow blue-green spectrum and compared their performance with that under a broad spectrum with the same overall brightness.
natural red fluorescence is particularly conspicuous in the eyes of some small, benthic, predatory fishes.
however, this effect was significant under the heavily shaded light treatment only.
