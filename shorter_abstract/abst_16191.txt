using caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a hif- <dig> loss-of-function mutation confers resistance towards the mitochondrial toxin ethidium bromide  and suppresses etbr-induced production of ros.
mitochondrial perturbations lead to adaptive mechanisms that include hif- <dig> stabilization, though the consequences of increased levels of hif- <dig> following mitochondrial stress remain poorly understood.
furthermore, our data implicates p <dig> map kinase as an indispensable factor for survival against mitochondrial stress in both hif- <dig> and djr- <dig> Â mutants.
we propose that etbr-induced hif- <dig> activates pathways that are antagonistic in conferring protection against etbr toxicity and that blocking hif- <dig> activity may promote survival in cells with compromised mitochondrial function.
mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of neurological disorders in humans.
