moreover, retaining a higher portion of the sequencing data by preserving as much of the read length as possible while maintaining the error rate within an acceptable range, will have important consequences at the level of taxonomic precision.
node was shown to be a computational efficient denoising algorithm for pyrosequencing reads, producing the lowest error rates in an extensive benchmarking study with other denoising algorithms.
the positive effect of node in 16s rrna studies was confirmed by the beneficial effect on the precision of the clustering of pyrosequencing reads in operational taxonomic units.
a benchmarking study with other denoising algorithms shows that node can detect up to 75% more errors in a large scale mock community dataset, and this with a low computational cost compared to the second best algorithm considered in this study.
