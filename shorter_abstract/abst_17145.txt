to infer the time and direction of the geographic expansion of the trichosanthes clade we employ molecular clock dating and statistical biogeographic reconstruction, and we also address the gain or loss of petal fringes.
long-fringed corollas evolved independently in hodgsonia and trichosanthes, followed by two losses in the latter coincident with shifts to other pollinators but not with long-distance dispersal events.
of six morphology-based sections in trichosanthes with more than one species, three are supported by the molecular results; two new sections appear warranted.
together with the caribbean linnaeosicyos, the madagascan ampelosicyos and the tropical african telfairia, these cucurbit lineages represent an ideal system for more detailed studies of the evolution and function of petal fringes in plant-pollinator mutualisms.
molecular dating and biogeographic analyses suggest an oligocene origin of trichosanthes in eurasia or east asia, followed by diversification and spread throughout the malesian biogeographic region and into the australian continent.
