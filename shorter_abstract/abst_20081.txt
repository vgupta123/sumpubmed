comparative analyses of the  <dig> genes demonstrated the mitochondrial genomes to be composed of variable and conserved genes.
taken together, results of the dn/ds ratios, the sliding window analyses and the bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggest that atp <dig>  atp <dig> and nadh <dig> are promising genes to be employed in phylogenetic studies involving species of the coronator group, and probably other species groups of the subgenus culex.
they are composed of the same  <dig> genes and the at-rich control region, which contains poly-t stretches that may be involved in the functional role of the mitochondrial genome.
they contained  <dig> genes  and the at-rich control region.

the coronator group currently encompasses six morphologically similar species .
the bayesian phylogenetic tree corroborated that both the coronator group and the culex pipens complex are monophyletic taxa.
bayesian topology corroborated the morphological hypothesis of the coronator group as monophyletic lineage within the subgenus culex.
the control region contained some poly-t stretch.
camposi share the same gene composition and arrangement features that match to those reported for most culicidae species.
