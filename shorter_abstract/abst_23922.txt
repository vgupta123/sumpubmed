in a world of chemical cues, smell and taste are essential senses for survival.
all together these data make heliconius butterflies one of the very few insects outside drosophila where irs have been characterized in detail.
ir60a <dig> was the only gene with an elevated dn/ds along a major phylogenetic branch associated with pupal mating.
a genome-wide comparison between  <dig> heliconius species revealed instances of pseudogenization, gene gain, and signatures of positive selection across the phylogeny.
dn/ds analysis suggests more frequent positive selection in some intronless ir genes and in particular in the sara/sapho and melpomene/cydno/timareta clades.
ir60a2b and ir60a2d are unique to the h. melpomene, h. cydno, and h. timareta clade, a group where chemosensing is likely involved in pre-zygotic isolation.
we found more ionotropic receptors in heliconius  than in bombyx mori  or in danaus plexippus .
here we focused on heliconius, a diverse group of butterflies that exhibit variation in pre- and post-zygotic isolation and chemically-mediated behaviors across their phylogeny.
ir60a2b also displayed copy number variations  in distinct populations of h. melpomene and was the only gene significantly higher expressed in legs and mouthparts than in antennae, which suggests a gustatory function.
our study examined the ionotropic receptors, a recently discovered class of receptors that are some of the most ancient chemical receptors.
