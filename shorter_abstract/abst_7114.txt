carbohydrates able to support growth as the sole carbon source negatively effected carotenoid formation in rich medium, suggesting that a catabolite repression-like mechanism controls carotenoid biosynthesis in both bacilli.
experimental results on biofilm formation confirmed genomic data on the potentials of b. indicus hu <dig> to produce a levan-based biofilm, while mucin-binding and -degradation experiments supported genomic data suggesting the ability of both bacilli to degrade mammalian glycans.
cazy analyses of the genomes of the two pigmented bacilli, compared to other bacillus species and validated by experimental data on carbohydrate utilization, biofilm formation and mucin degradation, suggests that the two pigmented bacilli are adapted to the intestinal environment and are suited to grow in and colonize the human gut.
a high number of glycoside hydrolases  and carbohydrate binding modules  were found in both isolates.
isolates of various bacillus species produce pigments, mostly carotenoids, with a putative protective role against uv irradiation and oxygen-reactive forms.
