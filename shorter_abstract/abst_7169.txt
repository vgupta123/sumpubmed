as a result, genome rearrangement data has attracted increasing attentions from both biologists and computer scientists as a new type of data for phylogenetic analysis.
the new method is named grappa-tp, with two major extensions: a heuristic method to estimate transposition distance, and a new transposition median solver for three genomes.
simulation results also suggest that model match is critical in genome rearrangement analysis: it is not accurate to simulate transpositions with other events including inversions.
it thus has become possible to represent whole genomes as ordered lists of gene identifiers and to study the rearrangement of these entities through computational means.
the new grappa-tp is available from .
the main events of genome rearrangements include inversions, transpositions and transversions.
our extensive testing using simulated datasets shows that grappa-tp is very accurate in terms of ancestor genome inference and phylogenetic reconstruction.
although grappa-tp uses a greedy approach to compute the transposition distance, it is very accurate when genomes are relatively close.
however, due to the complexity of computing transposition distance, it is very difficult to analyze datasets when transpositions are dominant.
