while using as many as possible reference organisms can improve the performance of ion.
many proteins ranked in top  <dig> by ion are both essential and belong to the complexes with certain biological functions.
differently from other methods, ion identifies essential proteins depending on not only the connections between proteins but also their orthologous properties and features of their neighbors.
moreover, ion identifies a large amount of essential proteins which have been ignored by eight other existing centrality methods because of their low-connectivity.
experimental results show that ion can achieve higher identification accuracy than eight other existing centrality methods in terms of area under the curve .
moreover, ppi data contains many false positives and false negatives.
identification of essential proteins plays a significant role in understanding minimal requirements for the cellular survival and development.
furthermore, no matter how many reference organisms were selected, ion outperforms all eight other existing centrality methods.
many computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential proteins by using the topological features of protein-protein interaction  networks.
to overcome these limitations, recently many research groups have started to focus on identification of essential proteins by integrating ppi networks with other biological information.
by considering the facts that essential proteins are more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential proteins and essential proteins frequently bind each other, we propose an iteration method for predicting essential proteins by integrating the orthology with ppi networks, named by ion.
ion is implemented to predict essential proteins in s. cerevisiae.
the accuracy of predicting essential proteins can be improved by integrating the orthology with ppi networks.
