using a training set of july  <dig>  and test sets of july  <dig>  we find that the predictive power of sps, both for true-positives  and true-negatives , depends on the coverage length of all sp matches .
we employ the novel motif method that consists of specific peptides  that are unique to specific branches of the enzyme commission  functional classification.
moreover, sifting through our predictions we find that some of them have been substantiated by swiss-prot annotations by july  <dig>  finally we extract, for production purposes, a novel sp set trained on all swiss-prot enzymes as of july  <dig>  this new set increases considerably the recall of dme.
comparing the two on an enzyme test set of july  <dig>  we find that dme has lower recall.
in our analysis, l â‰¥  <dig> has led to highly accurate results.
the outcome of these analyses can be characterized by the enzymatic profile of the metagenomes, describing the relative numbers of enzymes observed for different ec categories.
the new sp set is being applied to three metagenomes: sargasso sea with over  <dig> , <dig> proteins, producing predictions of over  <dig>  enzymes, and two human gut metagenomes.
