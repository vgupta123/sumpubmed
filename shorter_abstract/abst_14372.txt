scanning electron microscopy showed that lactobacilli expressing vhh <dig> anchored at their surface were able to bind lactococcal phages.
surface expression of vhh <dig> was confirmed by flow cytometry using an anti-e-tag antibody.
the antibody fragment vhh <dig> that is directed against the rbp, was fused to a c-myc tag and expressed in a secreted form by a lactobacillus strain.
lactobacilli were able to express functional vhh fragments in both a secreted and a cell surface form and reduced phage infection of lactococcal cells.
lactobacilli expressing llama heavy-chain antibody fragments represent a novel way to limit phage infection.
bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria  are widely acknowledged as the main cause of milk fermentation failures.
in this study, we describe the surface-expression as well as the secretion of two functional llama heavy-chain antibody fragments, one binding to the major capsid protein  and the other to the receptor-binding proteins  of the lactococcal bacteriophage p <dig>  by lactobacilli in order to neutralise lactococcal phages.
