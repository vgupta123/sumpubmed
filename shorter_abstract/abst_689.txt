next, we addressed the functional significance of bursicon signaling during development, by disrupting the expression of its receptor, rickets, in different target tissues.
significantly, we have also found that the available rickets mutants are not genetic nulls as previously believed, which necessitated the use of targeted rna interference to disrupt rickets expression.
during the molt, a new and larger cuticle is produced underneath the old cuticle.
replacement of the smaller, old cuticle culminates with ecdysis, a stereotyped sequence of shedding behaviors.
the research presented here investigates the role that bursicon has at stages of drosophila development which precede adult ecdysis.
our findings indicate that vesicle membrane proteins which are required for classical neurotransmitter release are also expressed at these peptidergic motor neuron terminals; and that these terminals secrete hormones including bursicon at the neuromuscular junction, coinciding with larval ecdysis.
importantly, we provide new evidence that bursicon release can precede the initiation of larval ecdysis, and that bursicon tans the puparium.
our results are consistent with the view that bursicon is the insect tanning hormone.
our results firmly establish bursicon signaling as essential to insect growth and development.
this release surprisingly occurs in two waves, indicating bursicon secretion preceding and following the ecdysis sequence.
following each ecdysis, the new cuticle must expand and harden.
we determined that rickets is developmentally required in the epidermis and imaginal discs for proper formation of the prepupa.
we addressed the mechanism and timing of hormonal release from bursicon-positive motor neurons at the larval neuromuscular junction.
however, genetic evidence from drosophila melanogaster only supports such a role for bursicon after the final ecdysis, when the adult fly emerges.
