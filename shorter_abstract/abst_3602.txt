in the course of evolution, biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks have developed.
biological networks of different species can be aligned by finding instances  with the same common ancestor in the evolutionary process, so-called orthologs.
for a better understanding of the evolution of biological networks, such aligned networks have to be explored.
we present a novel visualization system for aligned biological networks in 3d space that naturally embeds existing 2d layouts.
the layout algorithm includes a step of merging aligned networks into one graph, laying out the graph with respect to application-specific requirements, splitting the merged graph again into individual networks, and displaying the network alignment in layers.
protein-protein interaction  is fundamental to many biological processes.
we evaluate our system by applying it to real-world examples documenting how our system can be used to investigate the data with respect to these key questions.
in addition to displaying the intra-network connectivities, we also provide insight into how the individual networks relate to each other by placing aligned entities on top of each other in separate layers.
visualization can play a key role in making the various relationships transparent.
our system provides an intuitive global understanding of aligned ppi networks and it allows the investigation of key biological questions.
