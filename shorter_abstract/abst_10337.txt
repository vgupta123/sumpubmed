these data will be of assistance in functional studies of mirnas in t. rubripes.
longer small rnas , which were abundant in the gonads, may be putative pirnas because of their length and their origin from repetitive elements.
to identify mirna expression patterns in different organs of t. rubripes and give fundamental information to aid understanding of mirna populations in this species, we extracted small rnas from tissues and performed deep sequencing analysis to profile t. rubripes mirnas.
we elucidated mirna expression patterns in various organs of t. rubripes.
therefore, it is useful for identifying non-coding genes, including mirna genes.
most mirna sequences are conserved in vertebrates, indicating that the basic functions of vertebrate mirnas share a common evolution.
additionally, our data include possible novel classes of small rnas.
the most abundant isomirs  of many mirnas had identical sequences in the 5′ region.
the t. rubripes genome is approximately eight times smaller than the human genome, but has a similar repertoire of protein-coding genes.
however, isomirs of some mirnas, including fru-mir-462-5p, varied in the 5′ region in some tissues, suggesting that they may target different mrna transcripts.
however, some mirna families were highly abundant in the gonads, but expressed only at low levels in somatic tissue, suggesting specific function in germ cells.
after analyzing a total of  <dig> million reads, we found mirna species in nine tissues .
some mirna species exhibit different distributions of isomirs between tissues, suggesting that they have a broad range of functions.
