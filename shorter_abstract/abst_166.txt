the experiment results show that sln-srw significantly improves the performance of disease gene prediction on both the real and the synthetic data sets.
identifying the genes associated to human diseases is crucial for disease diagnosis and drug design.
meanwhile, the advance in biotechnology enables researchers to produce multi-omics data, enriching our understanding on human diseases, and revealing the complex relationships between genes and diseases.
we propose a new network-based disease gene prediction method called sln-srw  to generate and model the edge weights of a new biomedical network that integrates biomedical data from heterogeneous sources, thus far enhancing the disease related gene discovery.

the network-based approaches, have been recently developed to identify disease-related genes effectively from the existing biomedical networks.
