transgene-driven expression of dna/chromatin modifying enzymes provides one opportunity to query chromatin structures in expression-defined cell subsets.
tissue differentiation is accompanied by genome-wide changes in the underlying chromatin structure and dynamics, or epigenome.
these results are consistent with "local choreography" models in which differential gene expression is driven by intricate local rearrangements of chromatin structure rather than gross impenetrability of large chromosomal regions.
in this work we combine in vivo expression of a bacterial dna adenine methyltransferase  with high throughput sequencing to sample tissue-specific chromatin accessibility on a genome-wide scale.
this limitation has confined available knowledge of chromatin dynamics to a narrow range of biological systems  or to amalgamations of diverse cell types .
validating the dalec mapping results, we observe a strong association between observed coverage by nucleosomes and low dam accessibility.
by controlling when, where, and what regulatory factors have access to the underlying genomic dna, the epigenome influences the cell's transcriptome and ultimately its function.
