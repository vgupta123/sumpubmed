in taraxacum, diplospory results in first division restitution  nuclei, and inherits as a dominant, monogenic trait, independent from the other apomixis elements.
we postulate a locus with a minimum of two dip-genes and possibly including one or two enhancers or cis-regulatory elements on the basis of the bias towards diplosporous recombinants and incomplete penetrance of diplospory in some of them.
our results confirm the minor role of suppression of recombination and asd around dip, making it an excellent candidate to isolate via a chromosome-walking approach.
an unexpected bias towards diplosporous plants among the recombinants  was found.
here, we zoom-in to the dip-locus by largely extending our initial mapping population, and by analyzing  suppression of recombination and allele sequence divergence .
our data give interesting new insights into the structure of the diplospory locus in taraxacum.
no dominant fdr or apomixis genes have yet been isolated.
fine-mapping showed three amplified fragment length polymorphisms  closest to dip at  <dig>  cm at one flank and a single aflp at  <dig>  cm at the other flank.
one third of these diplosporous recombinants showed incomplete penetrance of 50-85% diplospory.
diplosporous  is the locus for diplospory in taraxacum, associated to unreduced female gamete formation in apomicts.
our data lacked strong evidence for asd at marker regions close to dip.
