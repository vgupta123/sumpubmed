this work addresses these shortcomings and aims to provide an automated prediction system of gene function.
we have developed a novel system called synfps to perform gene function prediction over completed genomes.
from each individual group, data are then extracted and used to train a support vector machine that makes gene function predictions.
experiments were conducted with  <dig> different gene functions over  <dig> bacteriophage genomes.
the proposed system employs genomic context to predict gene function and detect gene correspondence in whole-genome comparisons.
although our experimental focus is on bacteriophages, the method may be extended to other microbial genomes as they share a number of similar characteristics with phage genomes such as gene order conservation.
functional predictions are also made on  <dig> uncharacterized genes and  <dig> genes that cannot be identified by sequence alignment.
cross validation results gave an average prediction accuracy of ~80%, which is comparable to other genomic-context based prediction methods.
bacteriophage genomes are an example that cannot be easily analyzed by these methods.
the prediction system is initialized by clustering a large collection of weakly related genomes into groups based on their resemblance in gene distribution.
