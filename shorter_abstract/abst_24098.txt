moreover, tree comparison functionalities are dispersed between different software that mainly focus on high level single tree visualization but to the detriment of basic tree comparison features.
the web platform presented here, named compphy, intends to fill this gap by allowing collaborative work on phylogenies and by gathering simple advanced tools dedicated to tree comparison.
compphy is the first web platform devoted to the comparison of phylogenetic trees allowing real-time distant collaboration on a phylogenetic/phylogenomic project.
though a large number of studies and projects in evolutionary biology and systematics involve collaborations between scientists of different institutes, current tree comparison visualization software and websites are directed toward single-user access.
compphy thus proposes shared tree visualization, both synchronous and asynchronous tree manipulation, data exchange/storage, as well as facilities to keep track of the progress of analyses in working sessions.
it offers functionalities for tree edition, tree comparison, supertree inference and data management in a collaborative environment.

recent web technologies have helped to build such tools for jointly editing office documents and scientific data, yet none are available for handling phylogenies.
collaborative tools are of great help in conducting projects involving distant workers.
specific advanced comparison tools are also available, such as consensus and supertree inference, or automated branch swaps of compared trees.
