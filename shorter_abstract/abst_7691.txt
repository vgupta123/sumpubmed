of these hcc inventories, protein binding represents the largest proportion  from gene ontology analysis.
targeting hubs and/or disruption of the network formation might reveal novel strategy for hcc treatment.
here, we build an integrative platform, the encyclopedia of hepatocellular carcinoma genes online, dubbed ehco , to systematically collect, organize and compare the pileup of unsorted hcc-related studies by using natural language processing and softbots.
the significant advances in microarray and proteomics analyses have resulted in an exponential increase in potential new targets and have promised to shed light on the identification of disease markers and cellular pathways.
among the eight gene set collections, ranging across pubmed, sage, microarray, and proteomics data, there are  <dig>  genes in total; however, more than 77% genes are only included once, suggesting that tremendous efforts need to be exerted to characterize the relationship between hcc and these genes.
we aim to collect and decipher the hcc-related genes at the systems level.
this architectural map may represent the first step toward the attempt to decipher the hepatocarcinogenesis at the systems level.
