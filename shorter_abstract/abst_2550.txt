polyplax serrata infection explained a strikingly high proportion of the total variation in innate responses.
amongst a diverse group of macroparasites, only levels of the nematode heligmosomoides polygyrus and the louse polyplax serrata were correlated  with innate immune responsiveness .
was positively associated with innate immune responsiveness, most significantly for the endosomal receptors tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>
immunological analyses of wild populations can increase our understanding of how vertebrate immune systems respond to 'natural' levels of exposure to diverse infections.
a major recent advance in immunology has been the recognition of the central role of phylogenetically conserved toll-like receptors in triggering innate immunity and the subsequent recruitment of adaptive response programmes.
furthermore, the magnitude of the present result suggests that populations free from immunosuppressive parasites may exist at 'unnaturally' elevated levels of innate immune activation, perhaps leading to an increased risk of immunopathology.
a subset of immunomodulatory parasite species could thus have a key role in structuring other infections in natural vertebrate populations by affecting the 'upstream' innate mediators, like toll-like receptors, that are important in initiating immunity.
