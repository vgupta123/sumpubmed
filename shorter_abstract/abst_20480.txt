in this study, pde <dig> activity in the oocyte was assessed during in vitro maturation  and the possible roles of the camp-pde <dig> pathway in the resumption and progression of meiosis were investigated in terms of different models of oocyte maturation.
when measured only in the denuded oocyte, pde activity was almost completely inhibited by cilostamide, suggesting that camp-pde <dig> activity is the major camp-pde in porcine oocytes.
pde <dig> inhibition no longer maintained meiotic arrest if sustained beyond  <dig>  hours of ivm,  <dig> hours prior to resumption of meiosis.
pde3a mrna was detected by rt-pcr.
it regulates the resumption of meiosis until  <dig> hours prior to gvbd and transiently affects meiotic progression.
in cumulus-oocyte complexes, meiosis resumed after  <dig>  hours of culture.
however, no report has characterized the activity of pde <dig> in the porcine oocyte, or the implication of the camp-pde <dig> pathway in the entire nuclear maturation process.
the present investigation has demonstrated that pde3a is the major camp-degrading pde in the oocyte.
the ovulatory surge of gonadotropins triggers oocyte maturation and rupture of the ovarian follicle.
cyclic amp-degrading pde activity was detected in the cumulus-oocyte complex  and was partially inhibited by a specific pde <dig> inhibitor, cilostamide.
it has previously been shown that specific inhibition of camp degradation by pde <dig> prevents the resumption of oocyte meiosis.
however, pde <dig> inhibition in coc treated with oa for  <dig> hours significantly delayed meiosis at the intermediate stage.
the resumption of nuclear maturation in the oocyte from the prophase stage is characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown .
