methods that infer causal regulators directly from primary data have been proposed and successfully validated in some cases.
instead of investigating the co-expression level between regulators and their regulatees, we focus on coherence of regulatees of a regulator.
identification of active causal regulators is a crucial problem in understanding mechanism of diseases or finding drug targets.
using simulated datasets we show that our method performs very well at recovering even weak regulatory relationships with a low false discovery rate.
our findings demonstrate that combining co-expression analysis on regulatee sets with a literature-derived network can successfully identify causal regulators and help develop possible hypothesis to explain disease progression.
the results are represented as a rank-ordered list of regulators, and reveals both single and higher-order regulatory relationships.
these methods necessarily require very large sample sizes or a mix of different data types.
csa is an intuitive data-driven way of selecting directed perturbation experiments that are relevant to a disease population of interest and represent a starting point for further investigation.
we present a simple data-driven method, correlation set analysis , for comprehensively detecting active regulators in disease populations by integrating co-expression analysis and a specific type of literature-derived causal relationships.
using three separate real biological datasets we were able to recover well known and as yet undescribed, active regulators for each disease population.
recent studies have shown that prior biological knowledge can successfully boost a method's ability to find regulators.
