the genotyping data revealed three major clusters associated with mdr-tb, two of which are associated with xdr-tb.
in the present study we have genotyped and sequenced the genomes of 56Â mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered mostly from lisbon.
one deletion in ppe <dig>  found among lisboa <dig> isolates, is proposed to contribute to immune evasion and as a selective advantage.
whilst the genomic data contributed to elucidate the phylogenetic positioning of circulating mdr-tb strains, showing a high predominance of a single snp cluster group  <dig>  furthermore, a genome-wide phylogeny analysis from these strains, together with  <dig> publicly available genomes of mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates, revealed two major clades responsible for m/xdr-tb in the region: lisboa <dig> and q <dig> .
globally, this study contributes with novel genome-wide phylogenetic data and has led to the identification of new genomic variants that support the notion of a growing genomic diversity facing both setting and host adaptation.
insertion sequence  mapping has also demonstrated the role of is <dig> as a major driver in mycobacterial evolution by affecting gene integrity and regulation.
