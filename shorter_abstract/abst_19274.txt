the results showed that tmassb and tnessb are the most thermostable ssb proteins identified to date, offering an attractive alternative to taqssb and tthssb in molecular biology applications, especially with using high temperature e. g. polymerase chain reaction .
surprisingly, both tmassb and tnessb possess a quite low sequence similarity to escherichia coli ssb .
agarose mobility assays indicated that the ssdna-binding site for both proteins is salt independent, and fluorescence spectroscopy resulted in a size of  <dig> Â±  <dig> nucleotides.
they are the smallest known bacterial ssb proteins, consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively.
