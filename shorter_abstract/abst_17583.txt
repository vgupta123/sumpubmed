a complex network of hydrogen bonds involving well-ordered water molecules serves to position key residues participating in the recognition of substrate and subsequent catalysis.
in the absence of a complex to inform on aspects of specificity a model of the enzyme-substrate complex has been used in conjunction with previously published kinetic analyses, site-directed mutagenesis studies and comparisons with orthologues to investigate the structure and reactivity of menh.
the crystal structure of staphylococcus aureus menh has been determined at  <dig> Ã… resolution.
we propose a proton shuttle mechanism, reliant on a catalytic triad consisting of ser <dig>  asp <dig> and his <dig>  the reaction is initiated by proton abstraction from the substrate by an activated ser <dig>  the propensity to form a conjugated system provides the driving force for pyruvate elimination.
during the elimination, a methylene group is converted to a methyl and we judge it likely that his <dig> provides a proton, previously acquired from ser <dig> for that reduction.
a conformational change of the protonated his <dig> may be encouraged by the presence of an anionic intermediate in the active site.
the overall basic active site displays pronounced hydrophobic character on one side and these properties complement those of the substrate.
