motor cortex excitability was found to be changed after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  of the temporal cortex highlighting the occurrence of cross-modal plasticity in non-invasive brain stimulation.

the group of treatment responders showed a decrease of sici over the course of treatment, the group of non-responders the reverse pattern.
here, we investigated the effects of temporal low-frequency rtms on motor cortex plasticity in a large sample of tinnitus patients.
treatment response to rtms was shown to be related to changes in sici that might reflect modulation of gabaergic mechanisms directly or indirectly related to rtms treatment effects.
variables of interest were resting motor threshold , short-interval intra-cortical inhibition , intracortical facilitation , and cortical silent period .
in  <dig> patients with chronic tinnitus different parameters of cortical excitability were assessed before and after ten rtms treatment sessions.
after rtms treatment rmt was decreased by about 1% of stimulator output near-significantly in the whole group of patients.
treatment response was defined as improvement by at least five points in the tinnitus questionnaire .
sici was associated with significant changes with respect to treatment response.
patients received one of three different protocols all including 1Â hz rtms over the left temporal cortex.
minor rmt changes during rtms treatment do not necessarily suggest the need for systematic re-examination of the rmt for safety and efficacy issues.
