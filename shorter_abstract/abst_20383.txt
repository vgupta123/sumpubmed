we report the use of openbeb to combine live cell microscopy, microfluidic control and visual proteomics.
a macro-interpreter allows the automation and coordination of the different modules.
the open architecture of openbeb enables the fast integration of plug-ins, e.g., for data acquisition or visualization.
openbeb consists of two main parts: a core program and a plug-in manager.
to reduce biological noise, individual subjects, such as single cells, should be analyzed using high throughput approaches.
we have developed openbeb , a software framework for data acquisition, coordination, annotation and synchronization with database solutions such as openbis.
an update and deployment mechanism keeps the core program, the plug-ins and the metadata definition files in sync with a central repository.
the design of openbeb enables the rapid development of plug-ins, which will inherently benefit from the “house keeping” abilities of the core program.
new experimental methods must be developed to study interaction networks in systems biology.
openbeb targets three types of researcher, ideally working closely together:  engineers and scientists developing new methods and instruments, e.g., for systems-biology,  scientists performing biological experiments,  theoreticians and mathematicians analyzing data.
