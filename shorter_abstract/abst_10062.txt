the simulation results suggested that direction of cell movement responding to its neighborhood and the cell's mobility are important for this specific rearrangement.
since at least a reminiscent pattern of morphogenesis can be recapitulated in a reproducible manner in reaggregation cultures of dissociated embryonic cells, which is known as cell sorting, the cells themselves must possess some autonomous cell behaviors that assure specific and reproducible self-organization.
the model gives some insights about what cellular behaviors make an appropriate global pattern of the cell population.
we applied the model to "inside and outside" pattern of cell-sorting, in which two different embryonic cell types within a randomly mixed aggregate are sorted so that one cell type tends to gather in the central region of the aggregate and the other cell type surrounds the first cell type.
we constructed an in silico cell model that mimics autonomous cell behaviors and applied it to cell sorting, which is a simple and appropriate phenomenon exhibiting self-organization of cell population.
the model could predict directional cell movement and its mobility are important in the "inside and outside" pattern of cell sorting.
we constructed a dynamical cell model based on autonomous cell behaviors, including cell shape, growth, division, adhesion, transformation, and motility as well as cell-cell signaling.
our model can modify the above cell behaviors by varying parameters related to them.
our model is also applicable to other developmental processes beyond cell sorting.
