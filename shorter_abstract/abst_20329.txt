the structural combination of three conserved glycine residues  in the pyrophosphate-binding loop with the arg- <dig> explains the preference for nadph of azob.
our studies show the substrate specificity of azob based on structure and cofactor requirement and the phylogenetic relationship among azoreductase groups.
phylogenetic analysis shows that azob belongs to the flavin-free azoreductase group which has a key fingerprint motif gxxgxxg for nadh binding at the n-terminus of the amino acid sequences.
the apparent km values for both nadh and orange i were  <dig> and  <dig>  μm, respectively.
the ph and temperature optima for activity of the enzyme with orange i as the substrate were at ph  <dig>  and between  <dig> and 45°c.
microbial degradation of azo dyes is commonly initiated by the reduction of the azo bond by a group of nadh or nadph dependant azoreductases with many requiring flavin as a cofactor.
both nadh and nadph can be used as an electron donor for its activity with 4- benzenesulfonic acid  as substrate.
when nadph served as the electron donor, the activity of the enzyme is 63% higher than that when nadh was used.
the biochemical and structural properties of azob from p. kullae k <dig> revealed its preference for nadph over nadh and it is a member of the monomeric flavin-free azoreductase group.
