none of these strains were stimulated indirectly by the sodium present in disodium citrate, nor exhibited even partial utilization of citrate as a carbon source.
specialization for ecological niches is a balance of evolutionary adaptation and its accompanying tradeoffs.
our results are most consistent with the accumulation of mutations in iron transport genes that were obviated by abundant citrate.
the results present another example where a subtle decision in the design of an evolution experiment led to unexpected evolutionary outcomes.
the presence of citrate in the growth media selected one lineage to gain the novel ability to utilize citrate as a carbon source after  <dig>  generations.
here we focus on the lenski long-term evolution experiment, which has maintained cultures of escherichia coli in the same defined seasonal environment for  <dig>  generations.
