we show here with over-expressed proteins that the gdp-bound form of arf <dig> can bind to the spectrin repeat regions in kalirin rho family gefs thereby recruiting kalirin to membranes.
from these results, we suggest that arf <dig> can regulate through its gtpase cycle the activation of rac.
by contrast, expression of an arf <dig> mutant that cannot become activated, arf <dig> t27n, still recruits spectrin repeat  <dig> and kalirin to membranes but inhibits kalirin5-induced ruffling in hela cells.
many studies implicate arf <dig> activity in rac-mediated membrane ruffling and cytoskeletal reorganization.
although arf <dig> facilitates the trafficking of rac <dig> to the plasma membrane and in many cases arf <dig> activation leads to the activation of rac <dig>  the details of how arf <dig> influences rac function remain to be elucidated.
in cells, expression of wild type arf <dig> recruits spectrin repeat  <dig> and kalirin to the plasma membrane and leads to enhanced kalirin5-induced ruffling.
