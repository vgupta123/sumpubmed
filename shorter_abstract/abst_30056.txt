this paper performs an analysis of several existing evolutionary algorithms for quantitative gene regulatory network modelling.
presented is a comparison framework for assessment of evolutionary algorithms, used to infer gene regulatory networks.
at the moment, several methods of discovering qualitative causal relationships between genes with high accuracy from microarray data exist, but large scale quantitative analysis on real biological datasets cannot be performed, to date, as existing approaches are not suitable for real microarray data which are noisy and insufficient.
the aim is to present the techniques used and offer a comprehensive comparison of approaches, under a common framework.
