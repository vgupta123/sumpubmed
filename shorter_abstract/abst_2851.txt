we have developed a software package - "coda", for crossover distribution analyzer - which allows one to quantitatively characterize crossover patterns by fitting interference models to experimental data.
the user can specify single or two-pathways modeling, and the software package infers the model's parameters and their confidence intervals.
it will also enable users to perform analyses based on the beam-film model.
coda extends the kind of crossover data that could be analyzed so far to include gametic data  when using two-pathways modeling.
in several organisms including yeast, tomato, arabidopsis, and mouse, it is believed that crossovers form via at least two pathways, one interfering, the other not.
