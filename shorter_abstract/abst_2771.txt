this provides a solid methodical basis for the detailed elucidation of gene regulatory and metabolic networks underlying the ecological success of this group of marine bacteria.
the roseobacter clade represents one of the most abundant, metabolically versatile and ecologically important bacterial groups found in marine habitats.
conjugation and electroporation methods for the efficient and stable genetic transformation of selected roseobacter clade bacteria including dinoroseobacter shibae, oceanibulbus indolifex, phaeobacter gallaeciensis, phaeobacter inhibens, roseobacter denitrificans and roseobacter litoralis were tested.
a genetic toolbox for members of the roseobacter clade was established.
a plasmid encoded oxygen-independent fluorescent system was established using the flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein fbfp.
finally, a chromosomal gene knockout strategy was successfully employed for the inactivation of the anaerobic metabolism regulatory gene dnr from d. shibae dfl12t.
