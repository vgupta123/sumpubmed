experiments with amino acid modifying reagents revealed that histidine, cysteine and arginine residues were crucial for its function.
hplscr <dig> has five histidine residues and point mutations of histidine residues to alanine in hplscr <dig> resulted in 60 % loss in nuclease activity.
thus histidine residues could play a critical role in the nuclease activity of hplscr <dig>
recombinant hplscr <dig> exhibits mg2+ dependent nuclease activity with an optimum ph and temperature of  <dig>  and 37 °c respectively.
this is the first report on the novel nuclease activity of the multi-functional hplscr <dig>  hplscr <dig> shows a metal dependent nuclease activity which could play a role in key cellular processes that needs to be further investigated.
point mutations were generated to identify the critical region responsible for the nuclease activity.
in this study, the nuclease activity of recombinant hplscr <dig> and its biochemical properties have been determined.
