we also conclude that pparα plays a very important role in hibernation as hibernators have more pparα target genes than non-hibernators, and pparα in hibernators has a higher binding affinity for its target genes than in non-hibernators.
pparα expression was found to be increased at both mrna and protein levels in distantly related bats  during their torpid episodes.
evolutionary analyses revealed that the ω value of pparα of the ancestral lineage of hibernating bats in both yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera was lower than that of non-hibernating bats in yinpterochiroptera, suggesting that a higher selective pressure acts on pparα in hibernating bats.
we conclude that pparα is adapted to hibernation in bats based on the observations that pparα has a more stringent functional constraint in the ancestral lineage of hibernating bats and a higher level of expression in hibernating than in non-hibernating bats.
many genes involved in lipid metabolism are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha .
genome-wide bioinformatic analyses of  <dig> mammalian species showed that pparα has more potential target genes and higher binding affinity to these genes in hibernating than in non-hibernating mammals.
transcription factors such as foxl <dig>  nfya, nfyb, sp <dig>  tbp, and erg were bioinformatically determined to have a higher binding affinity to the potential regulatory regions of pparα in hibernating than in non-hibernating mammals.
