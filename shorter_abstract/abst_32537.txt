to identify associations between biofilm phenotype, pilus profile and lineage,  <dig> strains from asymptomatic carriers, invasive disease cases, and bovine mastitis cases, were assessed for biofilm production using an in vitro assay.
strains from invasive disease cases and/or belonging to the st- <dig> and st- <dig> lineages were significantly more likely to form weak biofilms, whereas strains producing strong biofilms were recovered more frequently from individuals with asymptomatic colonization.
biofilm production has been suggested to be important for gbs pathogenesis alongside many other elements, including phylogenetic lineage and virulence factors, such as pili and capsule type.
multilocus sequence type  profile, pilus island profile, and isolate source were associated with biofilm production.
these data suggest that biofilm production is a lineage-specific trait in gbs and may promote colonization of strains representing lineages other than sts  <dig> and  <dig>  the findings herein also demonstrate that biofilms must be considered in the treatment of pregnant women, particularly for women with heavy gbs colonization.
group b streptococcus  is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis and an important factor in premature and stillbirths.
