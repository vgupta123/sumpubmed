the use of factors to characterize simple patterns of heterogeneity is first demonstrated on illustrative gene expression data sets.
significance analyses of transcriptomic data ignore the gene dependence structure.
as biological information and technological biases are identified in what was before simply considered as statistical noise, analyzing heterogeneity in gene expression yields a new point of view on transcriptomic data.
this leads to correlation among test statistics which affects a strong control of the false discovery proportion.
microarray technology allows the simultaneous analysis of thousands of genes within a single experiment.
in the subsequent analyses aiming at a functional characterization of the differentially expressed genes, our study shows how these factors can be used both to identify the components of expression heterogeneity and to give more insight into the underlying biological processes.
contrarily to the analysis based on the raw data, a relevant functional information about a qtl region is revealed by factor-adjustment of the gene expressions.
additionally, the interpretation of the independent factors regarding known information about both experimental design and genes shows that some factors may have different and complex origins.
a recent method called famt allows capturing the gene dependence into factors in order to improve high-dimensional multiple testing procedures.
an expression data set primarily generated to map qtl for fatness in chickens is then analyzed.
