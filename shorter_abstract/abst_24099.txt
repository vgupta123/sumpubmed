we examined linkage between rb <dig>  ets <dig> and zeb <dig>  we found that an rb1-e2f complex binds the ets <dig> promoter and constitutively limits ets <dig> expression.
taken together, our results provide evidence of an rb1-dependent ets1-zeb <dig> amplification loop in thymocyte differentiation and tumor invasion.
these findings suggest that ets <dig> and zeb <dig> comprise an amplification loop that is dependent upon mir- <dig> and regulated by rb <dig>  thus, induction of ets <dig> when the rb <dig> pathway is lost may contribute to deregulated cell cycle progression through ets <dig> induction of cyclin e and cdk <dig>  consistent with such an amplification loop, we correlate expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in mouse and human lung adenocarcinoma.
but, rb <dig> repression of zeb <dig> provides the major impact of rb <dig> on ets <dig> expression.
ras pathway mutation leads to induction and erk phosphorylation and activation of the ets <dig> transcription factor.
ets <dig> in turn induces cyclin e and cyclin dependent kinase   <dig> to drive cell cycle progression.
ets <dig> also induces expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  transcription factor zeb <dig>  and thereby links ras mutation to emt, which is thought to drive tumor invasion.
