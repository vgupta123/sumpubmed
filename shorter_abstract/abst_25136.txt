a simulation of a fictive taxonomic study indicated that for the mitochondrial d-loop the minimum required number of individuals sampled per location is  <dig> in order to avoid false positives via paa.
several recently described lemur species are based solely on evidence of genetic distance and diagnostic characters of mitochondrial dna sequences sampled from a few individuals per location.
the results of our study also indicate that several of the recently described lemur species should be reevaluated with additional data and that the number of good species among the currently known taxa is probably lower than currently assumed.
here we explore the validity of this procedure for species delimitation in lemurs using published sequence data.
we show that genetic distance estimates and population aggregation analysis  are inappropriate for species delimitation in this group of primates.
genetic distances estimates and paa alone should not be used for species delimitation in lemurs.
independent of the data source, sampling should be done in a way to ensure a quantitative comparison of intra- and interspecific variation of the taxa in question.
intra- and interspecific genetic distances overlapped in  <dig> of  <dig> cases independent of the genetic marker used.
