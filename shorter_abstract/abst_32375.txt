an estimator that was a compound of three basic distance estimators was found to be robust across all spatial patterns for sample sizes of  <dig> or greater.
monte carlo simulations were applied to sample the data sets, and in all cases the error of the estimate  was reduced with increasing sample size.
the same field methodology can be used either with the basic distance formula or the formula used with the kendall-moran estimator in which case a reduction in error may be gained for sample sizes less than  <dig>  however, there is no improvement for larger sample sizes.
estimators were evaluated in their original published forms, although the variable area transect  and ordered distance methods have been the subjects of optimization studies.
the variable area transect  method performed moderately well, is easy to use in the field, and its calculations easy to undertake.
plotless density estimators are those that are based on distance measures rather than counts per unit area  to estimate the density of some usually stationary event, e.g.
these estimators typically use distance measures between events and from random points to events to derive an estimate of density.
burrow openings, damage to plant stems, etc.
in this study we investigated eight plotless density estimators to determine which were robust across a wide range of data sets from fully mapped field sites.
plotless density estimators can provide an estimate of density in situations where it would not be practical to layout a plot or quadrat and can in many cases reduce the workload in the field.
they covered a wide range of situations including animal damage to rice and corn, nest locations, active rodent burrows and distribution of plants.
the error and bias of these estimators for the various spatial patterns found in nature have been examined using simulated populations only.
