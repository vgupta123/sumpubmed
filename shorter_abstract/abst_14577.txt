a key to unraveling the functions of these ubiquitin receptors is to identify their cellular substrates and biological circuits they are involved in.
although many strategies have been developed for substrate isolation, the identification of physiological targets of proteolytic pathways has proven to be quite challenging.
in conclusion, as proof-of-concept, we show that a synthetic dosage lethality screen, which is based on the toxicity induced by gene overexpression, offers an effective, complementary method to elucidating biological functions of proteolytic pathways.
two proteins identified by the screen are shown to be proteolytic substrates of dsk <dig>  validating the large scale synthetic dosage lethality screen as a new strategy for identifying substrates of a specific degradation pathway.
using a genome-wide functional screen, we have identified  <dig> yeast genes that cause slower growth upon their overexpression in cells lacking two ubiquitin-binding proteins rad <dig> and dsk <dig>  our results suggest that proper functioning of rad <dig> and dsk <dig> is required for efficient pheromone response, transcription, amino acid metabolism, and dna damage response.
however, the specific role of these ubiquitin receptors remains poorly defined.
