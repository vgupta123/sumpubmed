palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> experienced a shift to an alternative patchwork of virulence and fitness determinants that might play a significant role in its host pathoadaptation and successful worldwide dissemination.
in contrast, low pathogenic y. enterocolitica ssp.
genomes of three y. enterocolitica ssp.
palearctica serobiotype o:3/ <dig> human isolates  were compared to the high-pathogenic y. enterocolitica ssp.
most high-pathogenicity-associated determinants of y. enterocolitica ssp.
enterocolitica  are absent in y. enterocolitica ssp.
horizontal acquisition of two prophages and a trna-asn-associated giyep- <dig> genomic island might also influence the y. enterocolitica ssp.
we demonstrated recombination activity of the phiyep- <dig> prophage and the giyep- <dig> island and the ability of the aga-operon to support the growth of the y. enterocolitica ssp.
