less work has focused on using these models to examine how tf networks respond to changes in the cellular environment.
much progress has been made on understanding and reverse-engineering tf network topologies using a range of experimental and theoretical methodologies.
in this paper, we have developed a simple, pragmatic methodology, tigeri , to model the response of an inferred tf network to changes in cellular environment.
using the model, we have examined changes in the tf network resulting from the presence or absence of p38α.
a part of this network was confirmed by experimental work in the original paper.
fxr and myc were also discovered in our analysis as two novel links of p38α.
transcription factor  networks play a key role in controlling the transfer of genetic information from gene to mrna.
