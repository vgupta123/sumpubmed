we illustrate its application to a case study about the identification of modules from gene expression data mapped on protein interaction networks, and a second one focused on building logic models from more complex signed-directed reference signaling networks and phosphoproteomic data.
building on our previous work about rewiring bipartite networks, we propose a method for rewiring any type of unweighted networks.
in particular we formally demonstrate that the problem of rewiring a signed and directed network preserving its functional connectivity  reduces to the problem of rewiring two induced bipartite networks.
many of these methods assess resultsâ€™ significance against null distributions of randomized networks.
birewire <dig> it is freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/birewire/, and it should have a broad application as it allows an efficient and analytically derived statistical assessment of results from any network biology tool.
however, these standard unconstrained randomizations do not preserve the functional characterization of the nodes in the reference networks , hence including potential biases in the assessment.
additionally, a wide range of tools has been developed to map experimental data onto reference biological networks, in order to extract meaningful modules.
