a computational strategy was developed for unbiased conserved motif discovery in nbs and lrr domains in r-genes and homologues in monocotyledonous plant species.
rflp-rga markers were developed, with  <dig> displaying distinct polymorphisms in parentals and f <dig> progeny of a diploid m. acuminata mapping population.
the developed rflp-rga markers are applicable for genetic map development and marker assisted selection for defined traits such as pest and disease resistance.
this is the first large scale analysis of nbs-lrr rgas in m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  contig sequences were deposited in genbank and assigned numbers er <dig> â€“ er <dig>  rga sequences and isolated bacs are a valuable resource for r-gene discovery, and in future applications will provide insight into the organization and evolution of nbs-lrr r-genes in the musa a and b genome.
calcutta  <dig>  which is resistant to a number of fungal pathogens and nematodes.
multiple copy rgas were common within bac clones, potentially representing variation reservoirs for evolution of new r-gene specificities.
many commercial banana varieties lack sources of resistance to pests and diseases, as a consequence of sterility and narrow genetic background.
a phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino-acid sequences for  <dig> rgas with contiguous open reading frames , together with rgas from arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa, grouped most musa rgas within monocotyledon-specific clades.
eighty eight bac clones were identified in m. acuminata calcutta  <dig>  m. acuminata grande naine, and m. balbisiana pisang klutuk wulung bac libraries when hybridized to two rga probes.
conserved motifs in such genes in diverse plant species offer a means for isolation of candidate genes in banana which may be involved in plant defence.
fertile wild relatives, by contrast, possess greater variability and represent potential sources of disease resistance genes .
