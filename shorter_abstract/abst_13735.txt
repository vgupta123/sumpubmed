both amc and rmc respond to cns inflammation, and they become hypertrophic when activated by trauma, infection or neurodegenerative stimuli.
microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system , have two distinct phenotypes in the developing brain: amoeboid form, known to be amoeboid microglial cells  and ramified form, known to be ramified microglial cells .
the molecular mechanisms and functional significance of morphological transformation of microglia during normal development and in disease conditions is not clear.
the global gene expression profiles of both microglial phenotypes were compared and the differentially expressed genes in amc and rmc were clustered based on their functional annotations.
it is hypothesized that amc and rmc are functionally regulated by a specific set of genes encoding various signaling molecules and transcription factors.
to address this, we carried out cdna microarray analysis using lectin-labeled amc and rmc isolated from frozen tissue sections of the corpus callosum of 5-day and 4-week old rat brain respectively, by laser capture microdissection.
the novel and specific molecules identified from the trancriptome explains the quiescent state functioning of microglia in its two distinct morphological states.
