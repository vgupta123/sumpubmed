serial computerized electrocardiography was performed in  <dig> male and  <dig> female neonates on the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, and 35th days of age.
consequently, the number of ovine species used as experimental animals has increased to date.
the information assimilated in this study is anticipated to enhance the diagnosis of multiple congenital heart defects in bergamasca lambs and could be implemented in studies that use ovine species as experimental models.
the following parameters were analyzed: heart rate and rhythm, duration and amplitude of waves, duration of intervals, and heart electrical axis.
during the first 35Â days of life,  the sinusal heart rhythm was predominant,  there was a progressive decrease in the heart rate and r and t wave amplitude, and  a progressive increase in the pr, qt, and rr intervals.
