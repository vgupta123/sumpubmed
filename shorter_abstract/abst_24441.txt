interestingly, resistance genes associated with several antibiotics and toxic compounds were identified.
we therefore isolated living amoebae with symbiotic chlamydiae from hospital environments.
one hundred smear samples were collected from hokkaido university hospital, sapporo, japan;  <dig> in winter  and  <dig> in summer , and used for the study.
acanthamoebae were isolated from the smear samples, and endosymbiotic chlamydial traits were assessed by infectivity, cytokine induction, and draft genomic analysis.
however, whether amoebae harboring environmental chlamydiae actually survive in hospital environments is unknown.
morphological assessment of cysts revealed  <dig> amoebae  to be acanthamoeba, and cultures in pyg medium were established for  <dig> of these amoebae.
while protochlamydia w- <dig> could infect c <dig> amoeba, it failed to replicate in immortal human epithelial, although exposure of hep- <dig> cells to living bacteria induced the proinflammatory cytokine, il- <dig>  comparative genome analysis with kegg revealed similar genomic features compared with other protochlamydia genomes , except for a lack of genes encoding the type iv secretion system.
environmental chlamydiae belonging to the parachlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular bacteria that infect acanthamoeba, a free-living amoeba, and are a risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
three amoebae contained environmental chlamydiae; however, only one amoeba  with an environmental chlamydia  was shown the infectious ability to acanthamoeba c <dig> .

from these,  <dig> amoebae were enriched on agar plates spread with heat-killed escherichia coli.
amoeba prevalence was greater in the summer-collected samples  than those of the winter season , possibly indicating a seasonal variation .
