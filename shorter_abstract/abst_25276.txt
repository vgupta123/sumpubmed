only axonal profiles showed hcrt1/oxa-immunoreactivity in vta.
in the present study, we used retrograde tracing from the medial prefrontal cortex  to examine whether hcrt1/oxa neurons target vta neurons that could sustain behavioral wakefulness through their projections to mpfc.
our results provide ultrastructural evidence that hcrt1/oxa neurons may exert a direct synaptic influence on mesocortical neurons that would facilitate arousal and wakefulness.
the hcrt/ox neurons are maximally active during wakefulness and project widely to the ventral tegmental area .
in addition, hcrt1/oxa could modulate the postsynaptic excitatory responses of vta neurons with cortical projections to a co-released excitatory transmitter from hcrt1/oxa axons.
most vta neurons projecting to the mpfc were located in the parabrachial nucleus of the ipsilateral vta and were non-dopaminergic.
the paucity of synapses, however, suggest that the activity of vta neurons with cortical projections might also be modulated by hcrt1/oxa non-synaptic actions.
deficiency in hcrt/ox neurotransmission results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy, which is characterized by an inability to maintain wakefulness.
hcrt1/oxa reactivity was observed in axonal boutons and many unmyelinated axons.
our observation of hcrt1/oxa targeting of mesocortical neurons supports hcrt1/oxa wakefulness enhancement in the vta and could help explain the characteristic hypersomnia present in narcoleptic patients.
a dopamine-containing nucleus projecting extensively to the cerebral cortex, the vta enhances wakefulness.
