it exploits the dynamic response of a system after external perturbation for network reconstruction.
on simulated data, we show that the approach outperforms current state of the art methods.
we then use our method to study egf-mediated signaling in the erbb pathway.
on the erbb data, our approach recovers a significant fraction of the known interactions, and predicts novel mechanisms in the erbb pathway.
we utilize dynamic bayesian networks with probabilistic boolean threshold functions to describe protein activation.
dynamic probabilistic threshold networks is a new method to infer signaling networks from time-series perturbation data.
we present a novel method to infer signaling networks from time-course perturbation data.
network inference deals with the reconstruction of molecular networks from experimental data.
the model posterior distribution is analyzed using evolutionary mcmc sampling and subsequent clustering, resulting in probability distributions over alternative networks.
due to data limitations, this typically is an ill-posed problem, and requires the integration of prior biological knowledge or strong regularization.
