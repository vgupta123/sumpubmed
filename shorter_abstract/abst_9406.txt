the flame algorithm has intrinsic advantages, such as the ability to capture non-linear relationships and non-globular clusters, the automated definition of the number of clusters, and the identification of cluster outliers, i.e.
comparative analysis with k-means, hierarchical, fuzzy c-means and fuzzy self-organizing maps  showed that data partitions generated by flame are not superimposable to those of other methods and, although different types of datasets are better partitioned by different algorithms, flame displays the best overall performance.
flame is implemented, together with all the above-mentioned algorithms, in a c++ software with graphical interface for linux and windows, capable of handling very large datasets, named gene expression data analysis studio , freely available under gnu general public license.
however, previous studies revealed that microarray datasets have very diverse structures, some of which may not be correctly captured by current clustering methods.
to this aim, existing clustering approaches, mainly developed in computer science, have been adapted to microarray data analysis.
we therefore approached the problem from a new starting point, and developed a clustering algorithm designed to capture dataset-specific structures at the beginning of the process.
the clustering algorithm is named fuzzy clustering by local approximation of membership .
data clustering analysis has been extensively applied to extract information from gene expression profiles obtained with dna microarrays.
