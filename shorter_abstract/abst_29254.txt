we have therefore developed sasi-seq; a process whereby a set of uniquely barcoded dna fragments are added to samples destined for sequencing.
by adding a mixture of three uniquely barcoded amplicons, of different sizes spanning the range of insert sizes one would normally use for illumina sequencing, at a spike-in level of approximately  <dig> %, we demonstrate that these fragments remain intimately associated with the sample.
sasi-seq is a simple, inexpensive and flexible tool that enables sample assurance, allows deconvolution of sample mix-ups and reports levels of cross-contamination between samples throughout ngs workflows.

these events can lead to false or inconclusive results.
they can be detected following even the tightest size selection regimes or exome enrichment and can report the occurrence of sample mix-ups and cross-contamination.
from the final sequencing data, one can verify that all the reads derive from the original sample and not from contaminants or other samples.
