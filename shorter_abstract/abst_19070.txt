in two independent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex datasets, it finds three overlapping clusters that are either enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia, genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia, or both.
the results are compared on speed, gene coverage and go enrichment.
k-means outperforms the other methods, with 100% gene coverage and go enrichments only slightly exceeded by memisa and isa.
those two methods produce greater go enrichments on the datasets used, but at the cost of much lower gene coverage, fewer clusters produced, and speed.
combining clusters produced by k-means and memisa or isa leads to increased go enrichment and number of clusters produced , without negatively impacting gene coverage.
however, the volume of data they produce can be an obstacle to interpretation of the results.
dna microarrays, which determine the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes from a sample, are an important research tool.
clustering the genes on the basis of similarity of their expression profiles can simplify the data, and potentially provides an important source of biological inference, but these methods have not been tested systematically on datasets from complex human tissues.
