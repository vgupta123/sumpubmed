the data presented here demonstrate that pkc express various transporters including pmrp <dig> , pmrp <dig> , poat <dig>  and poat <dig> , whereas pmdr <dig>  and poatp1a <dig>  mrna could not be detected in either the pkcs or in the porcine cortical tissue.
regarding renal physiology of different species, humans are more closely related to pigs than to rodents, therefore primary porcine kidney cells  and their subsequent cell strain could be a valid alternative to primary human cells for renal in vitro toxicology.
we carried out a comprehensive characterization of pkc and their subsequent cell strain, including morphology and growth as well as transporter expression and functionality.
on the basis of the presented results it can be concluded that pkc and to some extent their subsequent cell strain represent a valuable model for in vitro toxicology, which might be used as an alternative to human primary cells.

for this pkc must display inherent characteristics  and functions  as observed under in vivo conditions within the respective part of the kidney.
a good in vitro model should approximate an in vivo-like behavior as closely as possible in order to reflect most likely the in vivo situation.
