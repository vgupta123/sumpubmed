class xi myosins exhibit strikingly fast velocities and may have extraordinary roles in cellular motility.
potential roles of mya <dig> may also exist in the cell nucleus.
furthermore, co-expression of the gfp-mya2-head6iq with other f-actin markers disrupted its attachment to f-actin.
in nuclei, the gfp-myosin associated with short bundles of f-actin.
acto-myosin also powers vigorous cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells.
the localization of the head of mya <dig> in living plant cells, as investigated here for the first time, suggests a close linkage between this myosin xi and cytoplasmic microfilaments that support the rapid streaming of organelles such as peroxisomes.
by comparison to other markers such as fimbrin and talin, we revealed that the myosin-labeled f-actin was of a lower quality and absent from the fine microfilament arrays at the cell cortex.
the cytoskeletal mechanisms that underlie organelle transport in plants are intimately linked to acto-myosin function.
whether the low quality of the f-actin-labeling by mya2-head6iq compared to other f-actin-binding proteins  signifies a weak association of the myosin with actin filaments remains to be proven by other means than in vivo.
we expressed the gfp-fused head-neck domain of mya <dig> in epidermal cells of various plant species and found that it associated with f-actin.
studies of the structural basis of organelle transport have focused on the cargo-binding tails of myosin xi, revealing a close relationship with the transport of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and golgi-vesicles.
to address this function, we performed localization studies using the head-neck domain of atmya <dig>  a myosin xi from arabidopsis.
this observation correlates well with the proposed function of myosin xi in organelle trafficking.
