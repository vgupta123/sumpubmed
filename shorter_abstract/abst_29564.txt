the presence of a resolvase gene upstream of chria <dig>  an arsenic resistance operon and a gene encoding tn7-like transposition proteins abbcccd downstream of chria <dig> in b. cereus sj <dig> implied the possibility of recent horizontal gene transfer.
however, knowledge of the genetic determinants for chromate resistance and reduction has been limited so far.
our main aim was to investigate chromate resistance and reduction by bacillus cereus sj <dig>  and to further study the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level using the obtained genome sequence.
a complete bacterial reduction of  <dig> mm cr was achieved within  <dig> h. by genome sequence analysis, a putative chromate transport operon, chria <dig>  and two additional chra genes encoding putative chromate transporters that likely confer chromate resistance were identified.
our results indicate that expression of the chromate transporter gene chra <dig> was inducible by cr and most likely regulated by the putative transcriptional regulator chri.
the presence of an adjacent arsenic resistance gene cluster nearby the chria <dig> suggested that strong selective pressure by chromium and arsenic could cause bacterial horizontal gene transfer.
chromium is a toxic heavy metal, which primarily exists in two inorganic forms, cr and cr.
furthermore, we also found an azoreductase gene azor and four nitroreductase genes nitr possibly involved in chromate reduction.
in contrast, chromate reduction was constitutive in both phenotypic and gene expression analyses.
bacillus cereus sj <dig> isolated from chromium-contaminated wastewater of a metal electroplating factory displayed high cr resistance with a minimal inhibitory concentration  of  <dig> mm when induced with cr.
