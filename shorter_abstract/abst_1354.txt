using markers developed based on the reference genome ‘02–12’, the bopr gene was preliminarily mapped to a 280-kb interval of chromosome c <dig>  with flanking markers m <dig> and boid <dig> at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively.
seven annotated genes are located within the  <dig>  kb genomic region, of which only bo9g <dig> shows high homology to at5g <dig> , which was identified as a candidate gene for bopr.
this study identified a candidate gene for bopr and lays a foundation for the cloning and functional analysis of this gene.
in this study, we report the fine mapping and analysis of a candidate purple leaf gene using a backcross population and an f <dig> population derived from two parental lines: w <dig>  and p <dig> .
the recombination rate within this interval is almost  <dig> times higher than the usual level, which could be caused by assembly error for reference genome ‘02–12’ at this interval.
blast analysis revealed that this  <dig>  kb interval is located on an unanchored scaffold  of ‘02–12’, confirming the existence of assembly error at the interval between m <dig> and boid <dig> for reference genome ‘02–12’.
genetic analysis indicated that the purple leaf trait is controlled by a single dominant gene, which we named bopr.
due to its variegated and colorful leaves, ornamental kale  has become a popular ornamental plant.
among the newly designed indel markers, brid <dig> and brid <dig> were found to be the closest to bopr, flanking the gene at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively; the interval between the two markers is  <dig>  kb .
