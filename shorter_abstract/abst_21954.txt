we demonstrate this with example queries discovering "interologs" of yeast protein interactions in the worm and exploring the relationship between gene essentiality and pseudogene content.
we have built a software system called linkhub using semantic web rdf that manages the graph of identifier relationships and allows exploration with a variety of interfaces.
a key abstraction in representing proteomics knowledge is the notion of unique identifiers for individual entities  and the massive graph of relationships among them.
linkhub leverages semantic web standards-based integrated data to provide novel information retrieval to identifier-related documents through relational graph queries, simplifies and manages connections to major hubs such as uniprot, and provides useful interactive and query interfaces for exploring the integrated data.
linkhub is practically useful in creating small, local hubs on common topics and then connecting these to major portals in a federated architecture; we have used linkhub to establish such a relationship between uniprot and the north east structural genomics consortium.
