the broad range of disease severity may be influenced by bacterial genetic variation.
while all  <dig> isolates shared remarkable genetic similarity, we found greater overall time-dependent sequence diversity among ssti isolates.
in addition, pathway analysis of non-synonymous variations revealed increased sequence diversity in the putative virulence genes of ssti isolates.
the majority of the ca-mrsa disease burden consists of skin and soft tissue infections  not associated with significant morbidity; however, ca-mrsa also causes severe, invasive infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
the results demonstrate the close relatedness of clinically independent ca-mrsa isolates, which carry implications for understanding ca-mrsa epidemiology and combating its spread.
we sequenced the complete genomes of  <dig> ca-mrsa clinical isolates from the predominant north american community acquired clonal type usa <dig> .
