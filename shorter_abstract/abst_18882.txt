est data can be browsed using different dedicated web resources, which allow to investigate library specific gene expression levels and to make comparisons among libraries, highlighting significant differences in gene expression.
in this work we present the human est ontology explorer  , a web facility for comparison of expression levels among libraries from several healthy and diseased tissues.
the heoe provides an alternative and complementary way to inspect est expression levels with respect to approaches currently offered by other resources.
statistically significant differences in go categories among user selected libraries can also be computed.
est processing steps were integrated in a semi-automatic procedure that relies on perl scripts and stores results in a mysql database.
nonetheless, no tool is available to examine distributions of quantitative est collections in gene ontology  categories, nor to retrieve information concerning library-dependent est involvement in metabolic pathways.
a pathway-based search interface was also implemented, for a quick evaluation of the representation of libraries in metabolic pathways.
a php-based web interface offers the possibility to simultaneously visualize, retrieve and compare data from the different libraries.
this wide collection represents an important source of information for gene expression studies, provided it can be inspected according to biologically relevant criteria.
