through domain conservation  in addition to sequence
our method based on integrating domain conservation and sequence similarity to
interactions many of which are false positives, thereby improving complex
conservation might throw further light on conservation patterns between yeast and
and map these clusters back to the original ppi networks to identify complexes
noise and errors  in currently available datasets.
we identify conserved complexes by constructing an interolog network
we employ 'state-of-the-art' methods to cluster the interolog network,
construct interolog networks helps to identify considerably more conserved
such as synthetic lethality from yeast to human, for example in the identification
that much of the functionalities of yeast complexes have been conserved in human
leveraging on the functional conservation of proteins between species
using human and yeast ppi networks revealed that these methods missed several
complexes between the ppi networks from two species compared to direct complex
protein complexes conserved across species indicate processes that are
