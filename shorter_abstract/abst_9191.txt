analysis of expression quantitative trait loci  aims to identify the genetic loci associated with the expression level of genes.
penalized regression with a proper penalty is suitable for the high-dimensional biological data.
by grouping markers, complex joint activity of multiple snps can be considered and the dimensionality of eqtl problem is reduced dramatically.
furthermore, we observed several possible sex-dependent loci and interactions of multiple snps.
introduction of proper gene expression and loci correlation information makes detecting causal markers more accurate.
we considered the gene co-expression network, grouped markers into marker sets and treated the additive and dominant effect of each locus as a group: as a consequence, we were able to replicate results previously obtained on the mouse linkage dataset.
the proposed ngvs method is appropriate for problems with high-dimensional data and high-noise background.
its performance should be enhanced when we incorporate biological knowledge of gene expression network and linkage disequilibrium  structure between loci in high-noise background.
on eqtl problem it outperforms the classical lasso method, which does not consider biological knowledge.
our method simultaneously maps highly correlated expression traits sharing the same biological function to marker sets formed by ld.
