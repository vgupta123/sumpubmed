a simulation study was conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the rank test method.
from the simulation study the rank test out performed global and gsea.
microarray experiments examine the change in transcript levels of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously.
the greatest gain in performance was for the sample size case which makes the application of the rank test ideal for microarray experiments.
in this paper, we propose a non-parametric rank test for analyzing pathways that takes into account the correlation among the genes and compared two existing methods, global and gene set enrichment analysis , using two publicly available data sets.
the data indicate the advantages of the rank test.
