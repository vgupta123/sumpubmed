in this scenario, the gene ontology has provided the means to standardize the annotation classification with a structured vocabulary which can be easily exploited by computational methods.
the weighted go terms are processed according to both their semantic similarity relations described by the gene ontology and their associated score.
the algorithm is based on the original idea developed in a previous tool called argot.
it accepts as input a list of sequences in fasta format, which are processed using blast and hmmer searches vs uniprokb and pfam databases respectively; these sequences are then annotated with go terms retrieved from the uniprotkb-goa database and the terms are weighted using the e-values from blast and hmmer.
