a higher diversity was found among the chilean isolates compared to those from norway, which suggests a more homogenous reservoir in norway.
future studies on vntrs of f. psychrophilum should include isolates from more host species from a wider geographical area.
future studies of isolates with high and low virulence should focus on identifying virulence markers using vtnrs and mlst.
a selection of eight vntrs from 53â€‰f. psychrophilum isolates from norway, chile, denmark and scotland were analyzed.
the vntr analysis gave a separation between the f. psychrophilum isolates supporting the results of previous mlst work.
transgenerational transmission of f. psychrophilum from other countries, exporting salmon embryos to chile, may explain the differences in diversity.
these vntrs are important additions for genotyping of f. psychrophilum isolates.
the selected vntrs are stable genetic markers and no variation was observed after several passages on agar plates at different temperatures.
the results were compared with previous work on the same pathogen using mlst for genetic differentiation.
commercial vaccines are not available and control of the disease depends on the use of antibiotics.
the same transmission mechanisms could also explain the wide geographical distribution of identical isolates in norway.
