we performed a gwas analyzing the association between  <dig>  autosomal snps and serum alp in  <dig>  subjects, and replicated the top snps in an additional  <dig>  healthy chinese han individuals.
the association between abo locus and serum alp levels was replicated .
our findings indicate that abo locus is a major determinant for serum alp levels in chinese han population.
overweight and obesity modifies the effect of abo locus on serum alp concentrations.
the interactions between significant locus and environmental factors on serum alp levels were further investigated.
snp rs <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the total variance of serum alp levels independently of the other  <dig> snps.
a significant interaction between abo rs <dig> and overweight and obesity was observed ; for individuals with gg genotype, those with normal weight and those who were overweight or obese have similar serum alp concentrations; minor allele a of rs <dig> remarkably reduced serum alp levels, but this effect was attenuated in overweight and obese individuals.
recent genome-wide association studies  have identified several loci affecting alp levels; however, such studies in chinese populations are limited.
when comparing our findings with previously published studies, ethnic differences were observed across populations.
serum alkaline phosphatase  is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.
