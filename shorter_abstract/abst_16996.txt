we tested nine of the most often used protein alignment programs and compared their results using sequences generated with the simulation software simprot which creates known alignments under realistic and controlled evolutionary scenarios.
we found that alignment accuracy is extremely dependent on the number of insertions and deletions in the sequences, and that indel size has a weaker effect.
we also considered benchmark alignments from the latest version of balibase and the results relative to balibase- and simprot-generated data sets were consistent in most cases.
our results indicate that employing simprot's simulated sequences allows the creation of a more flexible and broader range of alignment classes than the usual methods for alignment accuracy assessment.
