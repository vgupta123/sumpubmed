in this paper, we characterized the complete mitochondrial genome of the atlantic awning clam solemya velum: a-t content, gene arrangement and other features are more similar to putative ancestral mollusks than to other bivalves.
we show that s. velum mitogenome retains most of the ancestral conchiferan features, which is unusual among bivalve mollusks, and we discuss main peculiarities of this first example of an organellar genome coming from the subclass opponobranchia.
despite opponobranchia are central in bivalve phylogeny, being considered the sister group of all autobranchia, a complete mitochondrial genome has not been sequenced yet.
bivalve mitochondrial genomes exhibit a wide array of uncommon features, like extensive gene rearrangements, large sizes, and unusual ways of inheritance.
mitochondrial genomes of solemya  and haliotis  seem to retain the original condition of mollusks, as most probably exemplified by katharina.
