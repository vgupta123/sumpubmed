based on a combinatorial notion of conflict between deletions, we show that in the tumor data, more deletions are predicted than there could actually be in a diploid genome.
structural variations in human genomes, such as insertions, deletion, or rearrangements, play an important role in cancer development.
we designed and applied a method, specific to the analysis of such pooled and contaminated data sets, to detect potential tumor-specific deletions.
a combined analysis of both data sets based on this model allowed a consistent explanation of almost all data, providing a detailed picture of candidate patient- and tumor-specific deletions.
we present a framework based on a rigorous definition of consistency between deletions and the assumption that the tumor sample also contains normal cells.
in that context, the goal is to detect variations that are specific to exactly one of the genomes, for example to differentiate between patient-specific and tumor-specific variations.

our method takes the deletion calls from both data sets and assigns reads from the mixed tumor/normal data to the normal one with the goal to minimize the number of reads that need to be discarded to obtain a set of conflict-free deletion clusters.
this is a difficult task, especially when facing the additional challenge of the possible contamination of healthy tissues by tumor cells and conversely.
in the current work, we analyzed a data set of paired-end short-reads, obtained by sequencing tumor tissues and healthy tissues, both from the same cancer patient.
we observed that, on the specific data set we analyze, only a very small fraction of the reads needs to be discarded to obtain a set of consistent deletions.
