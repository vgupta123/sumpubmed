conserved crms control more essential genes and genes involved in fundamental cellular activities such as transcription.
in contrast, non-conserved crms, in general, regulate more non-essential genes, such as genes related to neural activity.
interestingly, some genes appear to be regulated by different crms in different tissues.
the conservation-independent approach is based on an empirical potential energy between interacting transcription factors .
in this analysis, the potential energy is defined as a function of the number of tf interactions in a genomic region and the strength of the interactions.
these results demonstrate that identifying relevant sets of binding motifs can help in the mapping of dna regulatory regions, and suggest that non-conserved crms play an important role in gene regulation.
evolutionary conservation has been used successfully to help identify cis-acting dna regions that are important in regulating tissue-specific gene expression.
in addition, dnase i hypersensitive sites, which tend to be associated with active regulatory regions, significantly overlap with the predicted crms, but not with more conserved regions.
motivated by increasing evidence that some dna regulatory regions are not evolutionary conserved, we have developed an approach for cis-regulatory region identification that does not rely upon evolutionary sequence conservation.
known regulatory regions are highly enriched in our predicted crms.
