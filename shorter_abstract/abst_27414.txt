there is thus a need for developing countries in general to produce their own pandemic and possibly seasonal influenza vaccines.
here we describe the development of a plant-based platform for producing influenza vaccines locally, in south africa.
plant-produced influenza vaccine candidates are quicker to develop and potentially cheaper than egg-produced influenza vaccines, and their production can be rapidly upscaled.
this is a proof of principle of the potential of plant-produced influenza vaccines as a feasible pandemic response strategy for south africa and other developing countries.
two variants of the haemagglutinin  surface glycoprotein gene were synthesised for optimum expression in plants: these were the full-length ha gene  and a truncated form lacking the transmembrane domain .
for both transient and transgenic expression systems the highest accumulation of full-length h <dig> protein occurred in the apoplastic spaces, while the highest accumulation of h5tr was in the endoplasmic reticulum.
