our results support the hypothesis that there is a dystrophin and dystroglycan dependent circuitry of processes linking stress response, dystrophic conditions and cellular signaling and that micrornas play an important role in this network.
our data imply that dystroglycan-dystrophin-syntrophin signaling through control of multiple micrornas is involved in highly managed regulation of gene expression required to adapt cellular homeostasis that is compromised under stress and dystrophic conditions.
the dystrophin glycoprotein complex  is at the center of significant inheritable diseases, such as muscular dystrophies that can be fatal and impair neuronal function in addition to muscle degeneration.
since we have recently found that dystrophic symptoms can be caused by stress even in wild type animals and are enhanced in mutants, we screened stressed animals for microrna misregulation as well.
the results presented in this study support the hypothesis that there is a dystrophin and dystroglycan dependent circuitry of processes that includes regulation of micrornas.
verification of a subset of our results was conducted via q-pcr and revealed that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are regulated via a dystroglycan-dystrophin-syntrophin dependent pathway.
recent evidence has shown that it can control cellular homeostasis and work via dystrophin signaling to regulate microrna gene expression which implies that disease phenotypes hide an entourage of regulatory and homeostatic anomalies.
