we show that changing the tag order to myc/his improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display.
for several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scfvs were lower compared to lambda scfvs, probably due to a lower kappa scfv or fab expression rate.
the hal libraries and  <dig> antibodies selected against  <dig> targets were analyzed regarding the used germline v-genes, used v-gene combinations and cdr-h3/-l <dig> length and composition.
the naive antibody gene libraries hal <dig> and hal <dig>  with a combined theoretical diversity of  <dig> Ã— <dig> independent clones, were constructed from  <dig> healthy donors using improved phage display vectors.
deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the cl linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scfv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly.
antibody phage display is a proven key technology that allows the generation of human antibodies for diagnostics and therapy.
here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.
in detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined his/myc tag for detection and purification.
the highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries hal9/ <dig> were constructed using an optimized scfv phagemid vector design.
the amino acid diversity and distribution in the cdr-h <dig> of the initial library was retrieved in the cdr-h <dig> of selected antibodies showing that all cdr-h <dig> amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by e. coli expression or phage selection.
