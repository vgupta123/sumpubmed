a critical aspect of migration is cell polarization and the extension of pseudopodia in the direction of movement.
the present studies were undertaken to examine the role of gmfg in lymphocyte migration.
the present studies demonstrate that gmfg is a component of human t cell pseudopodia required for migration.
inhibition of gmfg expression in t cell lines and il- <dig> dependent human peripheral blood t cells with shrnamir reduced cellular basal and chemokine induced migration responses.
the reduction in migration and increased adherence properties associated with inhibition of gmfg expression suggest that gmfg activity influences the regulation of integrin mediated adhesion.
lymphocyte migration and chemotaxis are essential for effective immune surveillance.
