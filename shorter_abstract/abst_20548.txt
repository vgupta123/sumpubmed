we developed an efficient search algorithm to scan the target proteome for potential domain targets and to increase the accuracy of each hit by integrating a variety of pre-computed features, such as conservation, surface propensity, and disorder.
the integration is performed using na√Øve bayes and a training set of validated experiments.
one straightforward way of identifying these interactions is by scanning for matches to the motif against all the sequences in a target proteome.
however, predicting domain targets by motif sequence alone without considering other genomic and structural information has been shown to be lacking in accuracy.
by integrating a variety of biologically relevant features to predict domain targets, we demonstrated a notably improved prediction of modular protein domain targets.
