their expression patterns in different tissues were analyzed by qrt-pcr to explore their putative functions.
this transcriptome dataset will provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular genetics research of c. lanceolata.
a substantial fraction of transcript sequences was obtained from the deep sequencing of chinese fir.
chinese fir  is an important timber species that accounts for 20–30% of the total commercial timber production in china.
recently, major advances in transcriptome sequencing have provided fast and cost-effective approaches to generate large expression datasets that have proven to be powerful tools to profile the transcriptomes of non-model organisms with undetermined genomes.
these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences  with an average length of  <dig> bp, amounting to  <dig>  mb.
eighteen genes related to cellulose and lignin biosynthesis were cloned for experimental validating of transcriptome data.
the assembled unigene dataset was used to discover candidate genes of cellulose and lignin biosynthesis.

overall  <dig> unigenes, covering different regions of these selected genes, were found by alignment.
a total of  <dig>   were mapped to  <dig> pathways by blast comparison against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database.
however, the available genomic information of chinese fir is limited, and this severely encumbers functional genomic analysis and molecular breeding in chinese fir.
in this study, the transcriptomes of nine tissues from chinese fir were analyzed using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing platform.
and a number of candidate chinese fir genes in the two metabolic pathways were discovered firstly.
