these results have important implications for understanding how the rag proteins can introduce a dna double-strand break at dna sequences that do not contain an obvious heptamer-like motif.
whether hmgb1/ <dig> can promote rag-mediated dna cleavage at sites lacking a canonical rss by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious rss-like element.
we find that rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage is promoted by hmgb1/ <dig>  requiring both hmg-box domains to be intact to facilitate rag-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss.
here we identify a novel dna breakpoint site in the plasmid vj recombination substrate pgg <dig>  that is cleaved by the rag proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism.
efficient rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage requires the presence of hmgb1/ <dig>  is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the dna cleavage site.
vj recombination is initiated in antigen receptor loci by the pairwise cleavage of recombination signal sequences  by the rag <dig> and rag <dig> proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism.
we have identified a novel dna sequence, called bps <dig>  that supports standard vj-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif.
the bps <dig> sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint  but contains a nonamer-like element   <dig> base pairs from the cleavage site.
hmgb1/ <dig> are known to recognize distorted dna structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified dna.
a dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for hmgb1/ <dig> activity.
