critical features for model building were then analysed by comparing the two packages' algorithmic choices and parameters.
the relative sequence weighting schemes are different in the two packages but performed equivalently.
the weighting between prior probabilities and multiple alignment counts held the primary explanation why sam's model building was superior.
using default settings, sam was overall more sensitive.
