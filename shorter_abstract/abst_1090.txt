we propose a mixture model based normalization method that adaptively identifies non-differentially expressed genes and thereby substantially improves normalization for dual-labeled arrays in settings where the assumptions of global normalization are problematic.
the new normalization method is effective for general microarray platforms when samples with very different expression profile are co-hybridized and for custom arrays where the majority of genes are likely to be differentially expressed.
the new method is evaluated using both simulated and real data.
these assumptions can be inappropriate for custom arrays or arrays in which the reference rna is very different from the experimental samples.
