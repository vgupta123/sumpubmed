other lineage-specific evolutionary events included a three-fold expansion of the otop genes in xenopus tropicalis and of ush1g in teleostei fish.
the results presented here clarify the evolutionary history of the vertebrate otop and ush1g families, and establish a framework for studying the possible interaction of ush1g and otop in developmental pathways.
the encoded protein, otop <dig>  is the only functionally characterized member of the otopetrin domain protein  family; the extended sequence and structural preservation of odp proteins in metazoans suggest a conserved functional role.
we established that otop <dig> is the boundary gene of an inversion polymorphism on human chromosome 4p <dig> that originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage more than  <dig> million years ago.
we extend our evolutionary study to include the gene mutated in usher syndrome  subtype 1g , both because of the head-to-tail clustering of ush1g with otop <dig> and because otop <dig> and ush1g mutations result in inner ear phenotypes.
to further understand the functional organization of the ushg1-otop <dig> locus, we deduced a putative map of binding sites for ccctc-binding factor , a mammalian insulator transcription factor, from genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  data in mouse and human embryonic stem  cells combined with detection of ctcf-binding motifs.
here, we use the tools of sequence- and cytogenetic-based comparative genomics to study the otop <dig> and the otop2-otop <dig> genes and to establish their genomic context in  <dig> vertebrates.
