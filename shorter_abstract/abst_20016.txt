this work contributes to a better understanding of the landscape of tes present in the mosquito genome.
transposable elements  are dna sequences, present in the genome of most eukaryotic organisms that hold the key characteristic of being able to mobilize and increase their copy number within chromosomes.
here we present the spreadsheet named anotexcel that constitutes a database with detailed information on most of the repetitive elements present in the genome of the mosquito.
the aim of this work was to catalog the diversity and abundance of tes within the anopheles gambiae genome using the piler tool and to consolidate a database in the form of a hyperlinked spreadsheet containing detailed and readily available information about the tes present in the genome of an.
