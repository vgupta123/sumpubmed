principal components are obtained using robust covariance estimates and retained only if they exceed threshold amounts of explanatory power, before model-based clustering is performed on the dimension-reduced space.
here, we discuss four key steps that utilize statistical thresholds to describe the morphological variability within a sample and hence assess whether there is evidence for one or multiple species.
once the initial set of biologically relevant traits on comparable individuals has been identified, there is no need for the investigator to hypothesise how specimens might be divided among groups, nor the traits on which groups might be separated.
we apply these steps in an attempt to resolve ongoing debates among taxonomists working on the extinct eocene planktonic foraminifera turborotalia, providing statistical evidence for two species shortly before the lineage's extinction near the eocene/oligocene boundary.
