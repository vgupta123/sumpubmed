dapunpv , presented in this report, belongs to alphabaculovirus group ib.
baculovirus dapunpv is a natural limiter of pale tussock moth dasychira pudibunda l. , which can occur in a form of an outbreak on many species of deciduous trees and may cause significant economic losses in the forests.
the predicted number of encoded putative open reading frames  is  <dig> and six of them demonstrate low or no homology to orfs previously found in baculoviruses.
its full, newly sequenced genome shows close relationship to baculovirus opmnpv isolated from douglas-fir tussock moth orgyia pseudotsugata.
dapunpv genome shows very high similarity to opmnpv in a nucleotide sequence  and gene content , though some major differences  have also been noted.
similarly to other members of the baculoviridae family, dapunpv baculovirus possesses highly conserved core genes.
among them, there is a second copy of occluded derived virus envelope  <dig> protein , which was previously found only in a member of alphabaculovirus group ii â€“ lyxymnpv .
the ubiquitin like family gene , which has not been described until now, is another characteristic component of dapunpv genome.
