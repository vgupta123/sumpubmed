aproximately 5â€“10% of cases of mental retardation in males are due to copy number variations  on the x chromosome.
novel technologies, such as array comparative genomic hybridization , may help to uncover cryptic rearrangements in x-linked mental retardation  patients.
we have studied  <dig> patients with idiopathic mental retardation and  <dig> controls subjects.
known genomic aberrations were reliably detected on the array and eight novel submicroscopic imbalances, likely causative for the mental retardation  phenotype, were detected.
we have constructed an x-chromosome tiling path array using bacterial artificial chromosomes  and validated it using samples with cytogenetically defined copy number changes.
this tiling path array of the human x chromosome has proven successful for the detection and characterization of known rearrangements and novel cnvs in xlmr patients.
additionally, we describe different cnv regions with significant different frequencies in xlmr and control subjects .
