the experimental results showed that this sirna can simultaneously silence tf <dig> and tf <dig>  and application of our strategy successfully confirmed that tf <dig> is involved in plant defense responses.
interestingly, our second-round analysis, which used an sirna specific to tf <dig>  indicated that tf <dig> is a previously unidentified transcription factor that is related to plant defense responses.
to verify the efficacy of our strategy, we used the orchid expressed sequence tag data as a case study to screen the putative transcription factors that are involved in plant disease responses.
according to our computation,  <dig> qualified sirnas were sufficient to examine all of the predicated  <dig> transcription factors.
we propose a strategy that is combined with a heuristic algorithm to design suitable sirnas that can target multiple genes and a group testing method that would reduce the number of required rnai experiments in a large-scale rnai analysis.
rna interference  is commonly applied in genome-scale gene functional screens.

previous studies have indicated that sirnas can also affect rnas that are near-perfectly complementary, and this phenomenon has been termed an off-target effect.
our computational results showed that it is possible to screen all genes with fewer experiments than would be required for the traditional one-on-one rnai screening.
we also verified that our strategy is capable of identifying genes that are involved in a specific phenotype.
