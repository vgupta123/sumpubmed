the system detected abstracts mentioning protein-protein interactions in a standard test  with a precision of  <dig> - <dig>  and a recall of  <dig> - <dig> .
such bioentities are often related to biological concepts of interest that are specific of a determined research field.
we created a text mining system  that analyses co-occurrences of bioentities, biointeractions, and other biological terms in medline abstracts.
biological knowledge is represented in scientific literature that often describes the function of genes/proteins  in terms of their interactions .
text mining tools combining the extraction of interacting bioentities and biological concepts with network displays can be helpful in developing reasonable hypotheses in different scientific backgrounds.
