there were no significant differences in pain scores  during the study, although the number of rescue analgesia was significantly higher  at pet group  than tra  <dig> group , whereas in tra  <dig>  two animals  required additional analgesia.
the serum cortisol values of pet group were significantly higher at t1h t3h  and t6h  when compared to baseline , also it was noticed a significant difference among the groups at t6h .
tramadol provided adequate analgesia and it was more effective than pethidine to at least six hours for the studied animals.
changes in cardiovascular system were not clinically relevant.
no significant changes were observed physiological parameter that could contraindicate the use of these opioid in described doses, for the feline species.
the aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effect provided by the administration of tramadol or pethidine on early postoperative pain of cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy in a double-blind prospective study.
at the higher dose  tramadol is probably more effective, since rescue analgesia was not necessary.
