previous data demonstrated that lad and xdh not only differ in the activity on their biological substrate, but also that only xdh has significant activity on d-sorbitol and may therefore be more closely related to d-sorbitol dehydrogenases .
while introduction of the mutation m70f in lada of a. niger resulted in a nearly complete enzyme inactivation, the y318f resulted in increased activity for l-arabitol and xylitol.
l-arabitol dehydrogenase  and xylitol dehydrogenase  are involved in the degradation of l-arabinose and d-xylose, which are among the most abundant monosaccharides on earth.
in this study we aimed to identify residues involved in the difference in substrate specificity.
these data demonstrates that y <dig> of lada contributes significantly to the substrate specificity difference between lad and xdh/sdh.
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that lad, xdh and sdh form  <dig> distinct groups of the family of dehydrogenases containing an alcohol dehydrogenase groes-like domain  and likely have evolved from a common ancestor.
