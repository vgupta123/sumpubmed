one hypothesis is that biofilm formation facilitates persistence by protecting bacteria against environmental stress, e.g.
the results indicate a correlation between persistence and biofilm formation which suggests that biofilm forming ability may be an important factor for persistence of salmonella in the factory environment.
the study included  <dig> salmonella strains isolated from norwegian feed and fish meal factories in the period 1991â€“ <dig> of serovar agona, serovar montevideo, serovar senftenberg and serovar typhimurium.
strains of the serovar typhimurium were relatively poor biofilm producers.
when classifying strains according to persistence or presumed non-persistence, persistent strains produced more biofilm than presumed non-persisting strains.
most serovar senftenberg clones appear to persist for a shorter period, and strains of this serovar were medium biofilm producers in our test systems.
significant differences were found between serovars regarding the abilities to form biofilm on polystyrene  and in the air-liquid interface of nutrient broth .
strains of serovar agona and serovar montevideo were good biofilm producers.
the aim of this study was to investigate the biofilm forming potential of salmonella strains from feed- and fishmeal factories.
in norwegian factories, clones of these serovars have been observed to persist for several years.
salmonella are occasionally isolated from the feed factory environment and some clones of salmonella persist in the factory environment for several years.
