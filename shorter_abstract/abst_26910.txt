gonadal rspo <dig> gene expression is female up-regulated in the embryonic gonads in each species at the onset of sexual differentiation.
these results indicate that rspo <dig> is up-regulated in the embryonic gonads of female vertebrates with different sex-determining mechanisms.
in the mouse gonad, rspo <dig> mrna is expressed in the somatic cell lineage at the time of ovarian differentiation , with little expression in germ cells.
however, the protein is localised in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface of both somatic  and germ cells.
in the red-eared slider turtle, which exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination, up-regulation of rspo <dig> occurs during the temperature-sensitive period, when gonadal development is responsive to temperature.
inhibition of estrogen synthesis with a specific aromatase inhibitor results in a decline in chicken rspo <dig> expression, indicating that rspo <dig> is influenced by estrogen.
here we report the cloning and comparative expression analysis of r-spondin <dig> orthologues in the mouse, chicken and red-eared slider turtle, three species with different sex-determining mechanisms.
rspo <dig> protein in chicken is localised in the outer cortical zone of the developing ovary, the site of primordial follicle formation and germ cell differentiation.
in the chicken embryo, rspo <dig> expression becomes elevated in females at the time of ovarian differentiation, coinciding with female-specific activation of the foxl <dig> gene and estrogen synthesis.
loss-of-function mutations in human rspo <dig> cause testicular differentiation in  <dig>  xx females, pointing to a role in ovarian development.
