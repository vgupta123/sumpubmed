we document several cryptic lineages within the currently recognized h. japonica populations, including two main clades of late miocene divergence .
phylogenetic reconstructions further supported genetic homogeneity between the korean h. suweonensis and chinese h. immaculata, suggesting the former to be a relic population of the latter that arose when the yellow sea formed, at the end of the last glaciation.
first, they support the synonymy of h. suweonensis  and h. immaculata .
in east asia, tectonic events, along with pleistocene climatic conditions, likely affected species distribution and diversity, especially through their impact on sea levels and the consequent opening and closing of land-bridges between eurasia and the japanese archipelago.
combined with paleo-climate-based distribution models, the molecular data allowed the identification of pleistocene glacial refugia and continental routes of postglacial recolonization.
to better understand these effects, we sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear markers to determine phylogeographic patterns in east-asian tree frogs, with a particular focus on the widespread h. japonica.
second, the nominal h. japonica  represents at least two species: an eastern  on the northern japanese and russian far east islands, and a southwestern species  on southern japanese islands and possibly also forming continental populations.
our findings urge for important taxonomic revisions in east-asian tree frogs.
one occurs on the northeastern japanese archipelago  and the russian far-east islands , and the second one inhabits the remaining range, comprising southwestern japan, the korean peninsula, transiberian china, russia and mongolia.
overall, this resulted in a ring-like diversification of h. japonica around the sea of japan.
