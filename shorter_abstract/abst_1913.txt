hevea brasiliensis, a member of the euphorbiaceae family, is the major commercial source of natural rubber .
most of the key genes associated with rubber biosynthesis, rubberwood formation, disease resistance, and allergenicity have been identified.
nr is a latex polymer with high elasticity, flexibility, and resilience that has played a critical role in the world economy since  <dig>
here, we report the draft genome sequence of h. brasiliensis.
the knowledge gained from this genome sequence will aid in the future development of high-yielding clones to keep up with the ever increasing need for natural rubber.
overall, ~78% of the genome was identified as repetitive dna.
