quinoline aminopurine compound  <dig>  inhibited topoisomerase ii atpase activity and decatenation reaction at sub-micromolar concentrations, targeted both topoisomerase ii alpha and beta in cell free assays and, using a quantitative cell-based assay and a chromosome segregation assay, displayed catalytic enzyme inhibition in cells.
topoisomerase ii poisons are in clinical use as anti-cancer therapy for decades and work by stabilizing the enzyme-induced dna breaks.
the results obtained with qap  <dig> demonstrate that potent and selective catalytic inhibition of human topoisomerase ii function with an atp-competitive inhibitor is feasible.
here we describe the discovery and characterization of a novel purine diamine analogue as a potent atp-competitive catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase ii.
topoisomerase ii is an atpase and uses the energy derived from atp hydrolysis to orchestrate the movement of the dna double strands along the enzyme.
although several catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii have been described, preclinical concepts for exploiting their anti-proliferative activity based on molecular characteristics of the tumor cell have only recently started to emerge.
our data suggest that further drug discovery efforts on atp-competitive catalytic inhibitors are warranted and that such drugs could potentially be developed as anti-cancer therapy for tumors that bear the appropriate combination of molecular alterations.
in contrast, catalytic inhibitors block the enzyme before dna scission.
