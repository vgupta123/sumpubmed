in drosophila, there are seven ligands that function through combinations of three type i receptors and two type ii receptors.
these signals can be roughly grouped into two major tgfβ pathways, the dpp/bmp and activin pathways, which signal primarily through thick veins  and baboon .
in these experiments, we compare the similarities of target genes of these two pathways in the brain.
many of these genes are novel and several genes are implicated in growth control.
these regulated genes cluster into various functional groups such as dna/rna binding, signal transducers, enzymes, transcription regulators, and neuronal regulators.
few downstream targets are known for either pathway, especially targets expressed in the drosophila brain.
our genomic-wide microarray analysis has revealed common targets for the tkv and babo pathways and provided new insights into downstream effectors of two distinct tgfβ like pathways.
we have identified targets for the tkv and babo pathways by employing microarray techniques using activated forms of the receptors expressed in the brain.
twenty-seven genes are co-regulated  <dig>  fold by both the tkv and babo pathways.
