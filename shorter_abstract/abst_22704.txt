in the development of a diagnostic gene-expression profile for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, we identified  <dig> genes which are unchanging in all normal tissue samples, yet exhibit a random pattern indicative of the genetic instability and heterogeneity of malignant cells.
we introduce approximate entropy as a mathematical method of analysis for microarray data.
approximate entropy is applied here as a method to classify the complex gene expression patterns resultant of a clinical sample set.
since entropy is a measure of disorder in a system, we believe that by choosing genes which display minimum entropy in normal controls and maximum entropy in the cancerous sample set we will be able to distinguish those genes which display the greatest variability in the cancerous set.
