we present three illustrative data analyses using surrogate variable analysis  and describe how to perform artifact discovery in light of natural heterogeneity within biological groups, secondary biological questions of interest, and non-linear treatment effects in a dataset profiling differentiating pluripotent cells  and another from human brain tissue .
similarly, we demonstrate how to preserve major non-linear effects of age across the lifespan in the brain dataset.
however, caution should be exercised to avoid removing biological signal of interest.
our analyses indicate that data “cleaning” can be an important component of high-throughput genomic data analysis when interrogating explicitly defined effects in the context of data affected by robust technical artifacts.
however, the gains in precisely defining known effects of interest come at the cost of much other information in the “cleaned” data, including sex, common copy number effects and sample or cell line-specific molecular behavior.
here we explore the consequences of “batch” correction for biological discovery in two publicly available expression datasets.
