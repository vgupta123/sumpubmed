beast, a bayesian statistical framework that focuses on reconstructing time-calibrated molecular evolutionary processes, supports a wide array of evolutionary models, but lacked matching machinery for simulation of character evolution along phylogenies.
we present a flexible monte carlo simulation tool, called πbuss, that employs the beagle high performance library for phylogenetic computations to rapidly generate large sequence alignments under complex evolutionary models.
the connection with beast is further strengthened through the use of a common extensible markup language , allowing to specify also more advanced evolutionary models.
πbuss may serve as an easy-to-use, standard sequence simulation tool, but the available models and data types are particularly useful to assess the performance of complex beast inferences.
πbuss sports a user-friendly graphical user interface  that allows combining a rich array of models across an arbitrary number of partitions.
applications are not restricted to the beast framework, or even time-measured evolutionary histories, and πbuss can be connected to various other programs using standard input and output format.
πbuss offers a unique combination of flexibility and ease-of-use for sequence simulation under realistic evolutionary scenarios.
