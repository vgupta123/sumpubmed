during follicle assembly oocyte nests break down and a layer of pre-granulosa cells surrounds individual oocytes to form primordial follicles.
primordial follicle assembly is the process by which ovarian primordial follicles are formed.
the pool of primordial follicles formed is the source of oocytes for ovulation during a femaleâ€™s reproductive life.
a gene bionetwork analysis identified gene modules of coordinately expressed interconnected genes and it was found that different gene modules appear to accomplish distinct tasks during primordial follicle assembly.
the different growth factor and hormone treatments were all found to affect similar physiological pathways, but each treatment affected a unique set of differentially expressed genes .
predictions of physiological pathways important to follicle assembly were validated using ovary culture experiments in which erk1/ <dig>  activity was increased.
a number of the highly interconnected genes in these gene networks have previously been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency  and polycystic ovarian disease syndrome .
this systems biology approach has helped elucidate the molecular control of primordial follicle assembly and provided potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ovarian disease.
the current study utilized a systems approach to detect all genes that are differentially expressed in response to seven different growth factor and hormone treatments known to influence  primordial follicle assembly in a neonatal rat ovary culture system.
one novel factor, basic fibroblast growth factor , was experimentally determined to inhibit follicle assembly.
observations have identified novel factors and gene networks that regulate primordial follicle assembly.
