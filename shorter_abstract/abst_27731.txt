fifty-eight genes were expressed at over  <dig> % of the total population and represented  <dig> % of the mrna population identified.
a serial analysis of gene expression  was carried out in parallel with proteomic analysis on fully-grown ovarian follicles from zebrafish .
all the proteins identified by proteomic analysis of fully-grown zebrafish follicles had at least one transcript counterpart, with two exceptions: eosinophil chemotactic cytokine and nothepsin.
the molecular phenotype described provides groundwork for future experimental approaches aimed at identifying functionally important stored maternal transcripts and proteins involved in oogenesis and early stages of embryo development.
comparison of transcriptome and proteome data revealed that transcript levels provide little predictive value with respect to the extent of protein abundance.
this catalogue contains highly-expressed transcripts that are part of a vertebrate ovarian expressed gene signature.
comparison of transcriptome and proteome data identified downregulated transcripts or proteins potentially incorporated in the oocyte by endocytosis.
comparison with the large-scale expressed sequence tags sequencing approach revealed highly expressed transcripts that were not previously known to be expressed at high levels in fish ovaries, like the short-sized polarized metallothionein  <dig> transcript.
a higher sensitivity for the detection of transcripts with a characterized maternal genetic contribution was also demonstrated compared to large-scale sequencing of cdna libraries.
this study provides a complete sequence data set of maternal mrna stored in zebrafish germ cells at the end of oogenesis.
the three most expressed transcripts were a rhamnose-binding lectin, beta-actin  <dig>  and a transcribed locus similar to the h2b histone family.
the data obtained were compared with ovary/follicle/egg molecular phenotypes of other animals, published or available in public sequence databases.
