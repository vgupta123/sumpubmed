the four transcription factors uniquely up-regulated in tps <dig> transgenic leaves are good candidates for future functional analyses aimed at understanding the regulation of the  <dig> genes with differential expression in tps <dig> transgenic leaves.
we previously demonstrated that strains of the white lady potato cultivar that express the yeast trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  gene exhibit improved drought tolerance.
the development of drought-tolerant, elite varieties of potato  is a challenging task, which might be achieved by introducing transgenic lines into breeding.
we investigated the responses of the drought-sensitive potato cultivar white lady and the drought-tolerant tps <dig> transgenic variant to prolonged drought stress at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels.
the substantial increases in proline, inositol and raffinose contents detected in both the wild-type and tps <dig> transgenic leaves appears to be a general response of potatoes to drought stress.
the majority of the genes with altered expression that have been implicated in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism were down-regulated in both the wild-type and tps <dig> transgenic plants.
at the metabolic level, the contents of fructose, galactose and glucose were increased and decreased in the wild-type and tps <dig> transgenic leaves, respectively, while the amounts of proline, inositol and raffinose were highly increased in both the wild-type and tps <dig> transgenic leaves under drought conditions.
