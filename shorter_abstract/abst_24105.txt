to validate multi-car, we have tested it on a real dataset composed of several prokaryotic genomes and also compared its accuracy performance with other multiple reference-based scaffolding tools ragout and medusa.
a draft genome assembled by current next-generation sequencing techniques from short reads is just a collection of contigs, whose relative positions and orientations along the genome being sequenced are unknown.
to further obtain its complete sequence, a contig scaffolding process is usually applied to order and orient the contigs in the draft genome.
this may suggest that a single reference genome may not be sufficient to produce correct scaffolds of a draft genome.
in this study, we design a simple heuristic method to further revise our single reference-based scaffolding tool car into a new one called multi-car such that it can utilize multiple complete genomes of related organisms as references to more accurately order and orient the contigs of a draft genome.
multi-car serves as an efficient tool that can more accurately order and orient the contigs of a draft genome based on multiple reference genomes.
in practical usage, our multi-car does not require prior knowledge concerning phylogenetic relationships among the draft and reference genomes and libraries of paired-end reads.
our experimental results have finally shown that multi-car indeed outperforms ragout and medusa in terms of sensitivity, precision, genome coverage, scaffold number and scaffold n <dig> size.
although several single reference-based scaffolding tools have been proposed, they may produce erroneous scaffolds if there are rearrangements between the target and reference genomes or their phylogenetic relationship is distant.
