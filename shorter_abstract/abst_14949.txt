the characterization of cellular genes required for virus infection and/or cell killing will be essential for understanding viral life cycles, and may provide cellular targets for new antiviral therapies.
a gene entrapment approach was used to identify candidate cellular genes that affect reovirus infection or virus induced cell lysis.
this report represents the first use of gene entrapment to identify host factors affecting virus infection.
forced igf-ii expression results in a block in virus disassembly.
these results indicate that igf-ii, and by inference other components of the igf-ii signalling pathway, can confer resistance to lytic reovirus infection.
in addition, ctcf disruption and forced igf <dig> expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth in vivo.
viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and rely upon the host cell for different steps in their life cycles.
plasmids expressing either the igf-ii pro-hormone or igf-ii without the carboxy terminal extension -peptide sequence independently conferred high levels of cellular resistance to reovirus infection.
concomitant transformation observed in some virus resistant cells illustrates a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis associated with chronic virus infection.
four of the  <dig> genes disrupted in clones selected for resistance to infection by reovirus type  <dig> involved the insulin growth factor- <dig>  pathway, including: the mannose-6-phosphate/igf <dig> receptor , a protease associated with insulin growth factor binding protein  <dig> , and the ctcf transcriptional regulator .
