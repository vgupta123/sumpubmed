by employing a stringent cut-off threshold of âˆ’ <dig>  and  <dig>  log2-fold changes in gene expression, a subset of  <dig> unique genes were found to be modulated in t. rubrum in response to acriflavine exposure.
interestingly, genes putatively involved in the pathogenicity of dermatophytoses were down-regulated suggesting that this drug interferes with the virulence of t. rubrum.
the results provide insights into the molecular events underlying the stress responses of t. rubrum to acriflavine, revealing that this drug interfered with important molecular events involved in the establishment and maintenance of fungal infection in the host.
the clinical treatment of these infections is challenging because only few antifungal drugs are commercially available.
in addition, the identification of novel transcripts will further enable the improvement of gene annotation and open reading frame prediction of t. rubrum and other dermatophyte genomes.
moreover, we identified  <dig> novel putative transcripts in intergenic regions and two transcripts in intron regions of t. rubrum genome.

functional categorization indicated the putative involvement of these genes in various cellular processes such as oxidation-reduction reaction, transmembrane transport, and metal ion binding.
rna-seq analysis generated approximately  <dig> million short reads that were mapped to the broad institute's dermatophyte comparative database before differential gene expression analysis was performed.
to understand the mode of action of cytotoxic drugs against fungi, we evaluated the time-dependent effects of acriflavine on t. rubrum transcriptome using high-throughput rna-sequencing  technology.
