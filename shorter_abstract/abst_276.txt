the number and complexity of repetitive elements varies between species, being in general most represented in those with larger genomes.
n/n was the most abundant ssr except for 4dli where the most frequently identified ssr was n. retrotransposons followed by dna transposons were the most highly represented sequence repeats, mainly composed of cacta/en-spm and gypsy superfamilies, respectively.
the presented work is the first deep report of wheat repetitive sequences analyzed at the chromosome arm level, revealing the first insight into the repeatome of t. aestivum chromosomes of homeologous group  <dig>
transposable elements, small rna, satellites, simple repeats and low complexity sequences were analyzed.
repetitive sequences content varied from 55% to 63% for all chromosome arm assemblies except for 4dli, in which the repeat content was 38%.
ssr frequency was found one per  <dig> to 27Â kb for all chromosome assemblies except 4dli, where it was three times higher.
repetitive sequences were identified with the repeatmasker software using the interspersed repeat database mips-redat_v <dig> p. the input sequences consisted of our 4ds <dig> and 4dl <dig> scaffolds and 4asi, 4ali, 4bsi, 4bli, 4dsi and 4dli contigs, downloaded from the international wheat genome sequencing consortium .
in this work we analyze and characterize the repetitive sequences of triticum aestivum cv.
this whole chromosome sequence analysis allowed identification of three new ltr retrotransposon families belonging to the copia superfamily, one belonging to the gypsy superfamily and two trim retrotransposon families.
their physical distribution in wheat genome was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization  and one of them, the carmen retrotransposon, was found specific for centromeric regions of all wheat chromosomes.
