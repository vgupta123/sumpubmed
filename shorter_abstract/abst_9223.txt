our results provide a basis for further functional correlations between gene expression and histone modifications in monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs.
we also report that h3k4me <dig> levels on clustered chemokine and surface marker genes often correlate with transcriptional activity.
to study the chromatin modifications associated with this differentiation, we performed a genome wide analysis of histone h <dig> trimethylation on lysine  <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as acetylation of h <dig> lysines  in promoter regions.
blood monocytes can be differentiated into macrophages and dcs, which is accompanied with transcriptional changes in many genes, including chemokines and cell surface markers.
monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells  are important in inflammatory processes and are often used for immunotherapeutic approaches.
genes associated with phagocytosis and antigen presentation were marked by h3k4me <dig> modifications.
