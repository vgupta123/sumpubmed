we found that dehydrogenase activity and circulating ketone body levels were drastically reduced by the neurotoxin mptp, whereas treatment with pantethine overcame these adverse effects.
in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the protection was associated with enhancement of glutathione  production as well as restoration of respiratory chain complex i activity and mitochondrial atp levels.
since the active moiety of coa is pantetheine, mice were treated with pantethine, its naturally-occurring form.
remarkably, pantethine treatment boosted the circulating ketone body levels in mptp-intoxicated mice, but not in normal animals.
we determined changes in enzyme activity and in circulating ketone body levels in the mptp mouse model of parkinson's disease.
the administration of the ketone bodies hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate is known to exert a protective effect against metabolic disorders associated with cerebral pathologies.
ketone bodies are generated by fatty acid beta-oxidation, a process involving a mitochondrial oxido-reductase superfamily, with fatty acid-coa thioesters as substrates.
