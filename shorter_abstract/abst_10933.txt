a phylogenetic tree of the analysed specimens was constructed based on one mitochondrial  and two nuclear  genes.
we suggest an important role for pericentric inversions, tandem and centric fusions in nemacheilid karyotype differentiation.
only schistura fasciolata showed morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes with a multiple system of the xy1y <dig> type.
short repetitive sequences, genetic drift, founder effect, as well as the involvement of transposable elements in the dispersion of ribosomal dna sites, might also have played a role in evolutionary processes such as reproductive isolation.
these remarkable dynamics of their genomes qualify river loaches as a model for the study of the cytogenetic background of major evolutionary processes such as radiation, endemism and colonization of a wide range of habitats.
a high number of 5s rdna sites was present in species with small effective population sizes.
chromomycin a <dig> - fluorescence revealed interspecific heterogeneity in the distribution of gc-rich heterochromatin including its otherwise very rare association with 5s rdna sites.
the 45s rdna sites were mostly located on a single chromosome pair contrasting markedly with a pattern of two  to  <dig> sites  of 5s rdna.
the cytogenetic changes did not follow the phylogenetic relationships between the samples.
nemachilichthys ruppelli  and schistura notostigma  displayed reduced 2n with an elevated number of large metacentric chromosomes.
