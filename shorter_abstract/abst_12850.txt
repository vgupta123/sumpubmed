the numerical distance effect was found over posterior sites during a  <dig> ms long interval  but appeared independently of the amn.
the first question was whether the amn was sensitive to the incongruity in numerical information per se, or rather, to the violation of strategic expectations.
it was not the incongruity in numerical information per se, but rather, the violation of strategic expectations that elicited the amn.
the second question was whether the numerical distance effect could appear independently of the amn.
the numerical distance effect might only temporally coincide with the amn and did not form an inherent part of it.
event-related potentials  were recorded while participants decided whether two digits were matching or non-matching in terms of physical similarity.
this study examined the relationship of the arithmetic mismatch negativity  and the semantic evaluation of numerical magnitude.
