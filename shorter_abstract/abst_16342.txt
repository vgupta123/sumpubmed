the screening yielded  <dig> positive genetic materials that were phylogenetically related to ehrlichia sequences obtained from genbank, while no positive result was obtained for anaplasma.
the obtained ehrlichia sequences were closely related to e. chaffeensis, e. canis, e. muris and the incompletely described ehrlichia sp.
the presence of anaplasma and ehrlichia species were demonstrated by pcr in ticks collected from domestic ruminants at some selected communities in the eastern cape of south africa.
the findings showed that ticks in the studied areas were infected with ehrlichia spp.
anaplasma and ehrlichia are emerging tick-borne pathogens that cause anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis in humans and other animals worldwide.
the ticks were identified by morphological characteristics and thereafter processed to extract bacterial dna, which was analyzed for the presence of genetic materials of anaplasma and ehrlichia.
