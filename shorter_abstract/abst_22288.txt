we apply the formalism to ontologies of mouse anatomy and mammalian phenotypes in order to demonstrate the approach.
the obo foundry principles, as applied to a number of biomedical ontologies, are designed to facilitate this interoperability.
however, semantic extensions are required to meet the obo foundry interoperability goals.
we have developed a methodology for accurately representing canonical domain ontologies within the obo foundry.
conclusions drawn from default knowledge may be revoked when additional information becomes available.
biomedical ontologies require a new class of relations that can be used in conjunction with default knowledge, thereby extending those currently in use.
the inclusion of default knowledge is necessary in order to ensure interoperability between ontologies.
currently, there is no support for a correct and consistent integration of such ontologies.
current efforts within the biomedical ontology community focus on achieving interoperability between various biomedical ontologies that cover a range of diverse domains.
this is achieved by adding an extension to the semantics for relationships in the biomedical ontologies that allows for treating canonical information as default.
