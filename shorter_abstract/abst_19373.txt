compared to rrna analysis, the selected gene region of the trna nucleotidyltransferase revealed a seven to 30-fold higher distinction potential between closely related vibrio or aspergillus species, respectively.
besides identifying microbial pathogens in infections, further possible applications of this new marker are food hygiene controls or metagenome analyses.
even in the presence of a  <dig> -fold excess of human genomic dna, no unspecific amplicons were produced.
as prominent examples for pro- and eukaryotic pathogens, several vibrio and aspergillus species were used for genotyping and identification in a multiplex pcr approach followed by gel electrophoresis and fluorescence-based product detection.
these results indicate that a relatively short segment of the coding region for trna nucleotidyltransferase has a higher discriminatory potential than most established diagnostic dna markers.
to overcome such limitations, we identified a new genomic target sequence located in the single copy gene for trna nucleotidyltransferase fulfilling the requirements for a ubiquitous, yet highly specific dna marker.
based on phylogenetic analyses, a region within the gene for trna nucleotidyltransferase  was identified as highly heterogeneous.
