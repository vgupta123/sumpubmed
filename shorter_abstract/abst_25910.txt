we found concordant geographic distributions of nuclear and mitochondrial gene pools, and replicated narrow transitions  across two independent transects, indicating an advanced state of reproductive isolation and potential local barriers to dispersal.
hybridization between incipient species is expected to become progressively limited as their genetic divergence increases and reproductive isolation proceeds.
our findings corroborate the negative relationship between hybridizability and divergence time in european tree frogs, where  <dig> my are necessary to achieve almost complete reproductive isolation.
this result parallels the situation between h. arborea and h. intermedia, which share the same amount of divergence with h. orientalis.
speciation seems to progress homogeneously in this radiation, and might thus be driven by gradual genome-wide changes rather than single speciation genes.
in contrast, younger lineages show much stronger admixture at secondary contacts.
here we follow this approach in the european radiation of tree frogs .
we investigated a natural hybrid zone between two lineages  of mio-pliocene divergence  for comparison with other hybrid systems from this group.
