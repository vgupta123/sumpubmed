in addition, antibodies were generated against proteins encoded by some of the genes to facilitate their identification and characterization in spermatogenic cells and sperm.
northern blot analysis disclosed various transcript characteristics, such as expression level, size and the presence of isoform.
our data suggest that a number of the gene products are implicated in transcriptional regulation, nuclear integrity, sperm structure and motility, and fertilization.
we analyzed the mouse spermatocyte unigene library containing  <dig> gene-oriented transcript clusters.
our findings establish a new basis for future investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying male reproduction.
we further analyzed the genes at the protein and cellular levels.
transfection assays performed using gc- <dig> cells provided information on the cellular characteristics of the gene products.
we identify  <dig> authentic genes with spermatogenic cell-specific expression, and provide comprehensive information about the genes.
<dig>  predicted to contain a trypsin-like serine protease domain, is a sperm acrosomal protein.
