austronesian is a linguistic family spread in most areas of the southeast asia, the pacific ocean, and the indian ocean.
it is well accepted that the eastern austronesians  derived from the western austronesians , and that the daic populations on the mainland are supposed to be the headstream of all the austronesian populations.
we show that, in contrast to the taiwan homeland hypothesis, the island southeast asians do not have a taiwan origin based on their paternal lineages.
admixture analyses demonstrated that the daic populations are hardly influenced by han chinese genetically, and that they make up the largest proportion of indonesians.
our results indicate that a super-phylum, which includes taiwan aborigines, daic, and malayo-polynesians, is genetically educible.
based on their linguistic similarity, this linguistic family included malayo-polynesians and taiwan aborigines.
the str network of haplogroup o1a* illustrated that indonesian lineages did not derive from taiwan aborigines as linguistic studies suggest, but from daic populations.
furthermore, we show that both taiwan aborigines and indonesians likely derived from the daic populations based on their paternal lineages.
these three groups show many resemblances in paternal lineages.
in this report, we studied  <dig> snps and  <dig> strs in the non-recombining region of the  <dig>  y chromosomes from  <dig> china daic populations,  <dig> indonesian and vietnam malayo-polynesian populations, and  <dig> taiwan aboriginal populations.
