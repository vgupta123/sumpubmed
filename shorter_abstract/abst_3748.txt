existing methodologies differ widely in throughput, complexity, cost efficiency, and sensitivity of heteroplasmy detection.
we successfully identified  <dig> known heteroplasmic mutations and  <dig> other potential heteroplasmic mutations across  <dig> samples that passed quality control.
we used this custom pipeline to analyze mitochip v <dig>  data from  <dig> dna samples representing a broad range of tissue types , mutations , and haplogroup origins.
however, the relatively low call rate achieved using existing software tools has limited the wide adoption of this platform for either clinical or research applications.
affymetrix mitochip v <dig>  analysis using our optimized mitochip filtering protocol  bioinformatics pipeline now offers the high sensitivity and accuracy needed for reliable, high-throughput and cost-efficient whole mitochondrial genome sequencing.
this approach provides a viable alternative of potential utility for both clinical diagnostic and research applications to traditional sanger and other emerging sequencing technologies for whole mitochondrial genome analysis.
all results were compared to those obtained by at least one other mitochondrial dna sequence analysis method, including sanger sequencing, denaturing hplc-based heteroduplex analysis, and/or the illumina genome analyzer ii next generation sequencing platform.
mitochondrial genome sequence analysis is critical to the diagnostic evaluation of mitochondrial disease.
an average call rate of  <dig> % was achieved across all samples with our custom pipeline.
affymetrix mitochip v <dig> , which uses a sequencing-by-genotyping technology, allows potentially accurate and high-throughput sequencing of the entire human mitochondrial genome to be completed in a cost-effective fashion.
