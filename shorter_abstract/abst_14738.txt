this can hamper interpretability of the models and ease of translation to other assay platforms.
we applied our model development algorithm to eleven cancer gene expression datasets and compared classification accuracy to that for standard methods including diagonal linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and random forest.
for most of the datasets examined, the single-gene classification methods appear to work as well as more standard methods, suggesting that simple models could perform well in microarray-based cancer prediction.
the single gene classifiers provided classification accuracy comparable to or better than those obtained by existing methods in most cases.
