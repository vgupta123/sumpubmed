the finding of cell wall synthesis and aquaporin genes as targets of asr <dig> is consistent with their suggested role in the physiological adaptation of plants to water loss.
identifying the target genes of transcription factors is important for unraveling regulatory networks in all types of organisms.
as its target genes are still unknown despite the original cloning of asr <dig> cdna  <dig> years ago, we examined the tomato genome for specific loci interacting in vivo with this conspicuous protein.
in this way, we unraveled a novel repertoire of target genes, some of which are clearly involved in the response to drought stress.
our interest was precisely to uncover the spectrum of loci regulated by a widespread plant transcription factor involved in physiological adaptation to drought, a type of stress that plants have encountered since the colonization of land habitats  <dig> mya.
the results gain insight into the environmental stress-sensing pathways leading to plant tolerance of drought.
we performed chip followed by high throughput dna sequencing  on leaves from stressed tomato plants, using a high-quality anti-asr <dig> antibody.
in addition, we were able to determine a robust consensus asr1-binding dna motif.
the regulator under study, named asr <dig>  is exclusive to the plant kingdom  and known to alleviate the stress caused by restricted water availability.
