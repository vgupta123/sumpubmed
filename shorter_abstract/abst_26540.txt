rhodococcosis is present in poland however information about molecular characterization of r. equi isolates is scarce.
this study describes molecular characterization of rhodococcus equi infection on  <dig> horse breeding farms in poland between  <dig> and  <dig>  samples were collected by tracheobronchial aspiration from pneumonic foals or during necropsy.
one isolate  had a unique restriction cleavage pattern and the 2nd fragment of ecori digests of this plasmid dna was about  <dig> bases smaller than that of the 85 kb type i. this new plasmid variant was designated as the “85-kb type v”.
rhodococcus equi is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens affecting foals up to 6 months of age worldwide.
the r. equi isolates were genotyped by plasmid profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
totally,  <dig> r. equi isolates were investigated.
most of clinical isolates of r. equi from foals in poland contain pvapa 85-kb type i and 87-kb type i similarly to the other european countries and the united states.
among the  <dig> vapa-positive isolates,  <dig> contained 85-kb type i plasmid ,  <dig> contained 87-kb type i plasmid .
among the  <dig> isolates typeable with vspi-pfge, ten pfge clusters were detected.
the chromosomal variability was detected among some of the investigated isolates and the presence of farm-specific isolates might be possible.
however, the new variant of pvapa 85-kb type v was identified.
the majority of foals were infected mostly with isolates of low genetic diversity.
