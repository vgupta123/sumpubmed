we present mlpastats, an r package designed to integrate the methods for exploring different analysis scenarios in a reliable way.
however, there is no single framework from which the results of each method and possible combinations at each step can be assessed.
multiplex-dependent probe amplification  is a cost-effective experimental method for candidate gene studies, aimed at the identification of copy number alterations.
second, the statistical significance of peak alteration between case and control samples is estimated.
first, peak normalization for each probe is required to remove the contribution of probe size to peak intensity.
