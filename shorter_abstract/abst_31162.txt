the pathway-pdt method is implemented in c++ with posix threads and is computationally feasible for pathway analysis with large scale family gwas datasets.
pathway analysis based on genome-wide association studies  data has become popular as a secondary analysis strategy.
although many pathway analysis tools have been developed for caseâ€“control studies, there is no tool that can use all information from raw genotypes in general nuclear families.
we developed pathway-pdt, which uses the framework of pedigree disequilibrium test  for general family data, to perform pathway analysis based on raw genotypes in family-based gwas.
simulation results showed that pathway-pdt is more powerful than the p-value based method, aligator.
additionally, pathway-pdt has a flexible and convenient user interface, which allows users to modify their analysis parameters as well as to apply various types of gene and pathway definitions.
pathway-pdt also can be more powerful than the plink set-based test when analyzing general nuclear families with multiple siblings or missing parents.
