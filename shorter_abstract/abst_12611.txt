an interesting feature of both mouse and rat sfmbt <dig> genes is the presence of a large block of mirnas in intron  <dig>  other mammals, including the bovine, lack this block of mirnas.
no imprinted gene had been identified from this region until our study demonstrated that the pcg gene sfmbt <dig> is expressed from the paternally inherited allele in early embryos and extraembryonic tissues.
our results are discussed in the context of ncrnas at other imprinted loci.
the proximal region of murine chr  <dig> has long been known to harbour one or more imprinted genes from classic genetic studies involving reciprocal translocations.
we analyzed allelic expression of approximately  <dig> genes within a  <dig>  mb domain and found that sfmbt <dig> and an overlapping non-coding antisense transcript are the only imprinted genes in this region.
we also demonstrate that rat sfmbt <dig> is imprinted in extraembryonic tissues.
