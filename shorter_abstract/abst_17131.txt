functionally, tap <dig> acts similarly to p <dig> in tumor suppression.
also, ips cells generated with dnp <dig> expression are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation.
specifically, that the involvement of dnp <dig> generates ips cells that are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation.
in the same family as p <dig> is p <dig>  which shares sequence similarities with p <dig>  however, p <dig> also has distinct properties of its own, such as two alternative promoters to express transactivation of p <dig>  and n terminal deleted p <dig> .
therefore, how can p <dig> have opposing roles in human ips cell generation?
the experiment found that the addition of dnp <dig> gene increases human ips cell generation efficiency by  <dig>  folds in comparison to human fibroblast cells transduced with only the basal conditions.
this study found dnp <dig>  a family member of p <dig>  is also involved in the human ips cell generation.
transcription factors, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and cmyc  are used as basal conditions to generate ips cells.
in addition, the factor of dnp <dig> is used to generate ips cells.
