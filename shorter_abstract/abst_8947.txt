in addition, the proposed method can provide further characterization of each annotator that can help in developing more accurate classifiers by identifying the most competent annotators for each data instance.
in many biomedical applications, there is a need for developing classification models based on noisy annotations.
the proposed method is applicable for meta-learning from multiple existing classification models and noisy annotations obtained by humans.
the new algorithm is capable of eliminating annotations provided by novice labellers and of providing a more accurate estimate of the ground truth by consensus labelling according to higher quality annotations.
our study suggests that the higher levels of accuracy, effectiveness and performance can be achieved by the new method as compared to alternatives.
it is particularly beneficial when many annotations are obtained by novice labellers.
the approach is evaluated on text classification and prediction of protein disorder.
