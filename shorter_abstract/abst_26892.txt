our findings indicate that chilling process has a limited effect in the final products campylobacter contamination because poultry enter the slaughter processing with high counts of contamination.
thermotolerant campylobacter is among the more prevalent bacterial pathogens that cause foodborne diseases.
this study aimed at evaluating the occurrence of thermotolerant campylobacter contamination in chicken carcasses and processing plant stations  in two of the chilean main slaughterhouses.
in addition, the isolation rates of thermotolerant campylobacter during evisceration and following chiller processing were compared.
the overall slaughterhouse contamination with thermotolerant campylobacter was 54%.
the decrease of thermotolerant campylobacter contamination after chilling was significant .
differences were evident when the results from each plant were compared .
the sampling points with the greatest contamination rates in both plants were after evisceration .
