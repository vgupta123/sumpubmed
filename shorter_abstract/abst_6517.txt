the gene most strongly induced by salmonella infection was pancreatitis associated protein , showing >100-fold induction at day  <dig> after oral infection.
salmonella enteritidis is suggested to translocate in the small intestine.
for this, rats were orally infected with salmonella enteritidis to mimic a foodborne infection and colonic gene expression was determined at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-infection .
stimulation of salmonella translocation by dietary prebiotics fermented in colon suggests involvement of the colon as well.
furthermore, salmonella translocation increased serum ifnÎ³ and many interferon-related genes in colonic mucosa.
stimulation of salmonella translocation by dietary fos was accompanied by enhancement of the salmonella-induced mucosal processes, not by induction of other processes.
results were confirmed by q-pcr in individual rats.
salmonella affected transport , antimicrobial defense , inflammation , oxidative stress related genes  and proteolysis .
we aimed to characterize time dependent salmonella-induced changes of colonic mucosal gene expression in rats using whole genome microarrays.
as fructo-oligosaccharides  affect colonic physiology, we analyzed colonic mucosal gene expression of fos-fed versus cellulose-fed rats infected with salmonella in a separate experiment.
colonic mucosal samples were isolated at day  <dig> post-infection.
in vivo it induces gene expression changes in the ileal mucosa and peyer's patches.
