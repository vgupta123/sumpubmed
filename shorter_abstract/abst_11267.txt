the purified peptides were characterized by nmr, circular dichroism, sds-page and size exclusion chromatography, and their aggregation propensities were assessed by thioflavin t fluorescence and electron microscopy.
the method does not rely on a protein-fusion or -tag and thus does not require a cleavage reaction.
aβe22g is obtained in predominantly monomeric form and suitable, e.g., for nmr studies.
the characterization of aβ assemblies is essential for the elucidation of the mechanisms of aβ neurotoxicity, but requires large quantities of pure peptide.
here we describe a novel approach to the recombinant production of aβ.
zaβ <dig> binds to the amyloidogenic central and c-terminal part of aβ with nanomolar affinity and consequently inhibits aggregation.
the coexpression of an engineered aggregation-inhibiting binding protein offers a novel route to the recombinant production of amyloidogenic aβ peptides that can be advantageously employed to study the molecular basis of ad.
zaβ <dig> coexpression moreover permits the recombinant production of aβ carrying the arctic  mutation, which causes early onset familial ad.
