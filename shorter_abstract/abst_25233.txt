la-a and la-b showed insecticidal activities when fed to larvae of the model insect drosophila melanogaster.
lectin rca <dig> indicated that, unlike common plant chitinases, la-a and la-b are glycosylated.
la-a and la-b have molecular masses of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, and are abundant in the soluble fraction of latex.
plant latex is the cytoplasm of highly specialized cells known as laticifers, and is thought to have a critical role in defense against herbivorous insects.
our results suggest that the two la proteins have a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects, possibly by hydrolyzing their chitin.
these proteins showed small but significant chitinase and chitosanase activities.
western blotting analysis suggested that they share sequence similarity with each other.
the sequences of la-a and la-b, as determined by edman degradation, showed chitin-binding domains of plant chitinases at the n termini.
