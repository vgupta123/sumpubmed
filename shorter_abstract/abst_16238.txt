we then genotyped a diverse collection of  <dig> brucella strains at these snp loci and generated a phylogenetic tree of relationships.
first, we developed a microarray-based assay based on  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  that were identified from whole genome comparisons of two b. abortus isolates , one b. melitensis, and one b. suis.
our  <dig> snp microarray readily distinguished b. abortus, b. melitensis, and b. suis, differentiating b. melitensis and b. suis into two clades each.
our assays represent snp genotyping approaches that can reliably determine the evolutionary relationships of bacterial isolates without the need for whole genome sequencing of all isolates.
second, we developed a selective primer-extension assay system using capillary electrophoresis that targeted  <dig> high value snps across  <dig> major branches of the phylogeny and determined their genotypes in a large collection  of diverse isolates.
we have identified clade-specific snps in brucella that can be used for rapid assignment into major groups below the species level in the three main brucella species.
brucella abortus was divided into four major clades.
