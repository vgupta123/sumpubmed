this tool can be useful for biologists to identify genes commonly found by intersected statistical methods, for further experimental validation.
analysis of large-scale omics data has become more and more challenging due to high dimensionality.
we developed gracomics to provide instantaneous results , corresponding to user-defined threshold values, since there are yet no other up-to-date omics data visualization tools that provide such features.
in our analysis, we successfully employed two types of omics data: transcriptomic data  and genomic data .
gracomics is a graphical user interface -based program written in java for cross-platform computing environments, and can be applied to compare analysis results for any type of large-scale omics data.
while many methods already exist, those methods often produce different results.
to help users obtain more appropriate results , we propose a tool, gracomics that compares numerous analysis results visually in a more systematic way; this enables the users to easily interpret the results more comfortably.
gracomics has the ability to visualize multiple analysis results interactively.
