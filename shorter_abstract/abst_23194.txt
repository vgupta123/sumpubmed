thus ppl potentially engages in cellular movement al least partly via the pi3k/akt axis.
ppl knockdown is related to reduced cellular movement and attachment activity in association with pi3k/akt axis suppression, rather than malignant progression in pharyngeal cancer cells.
however, the extent of cell growth suppression, evaluated by the number of cells attached to the culture dish, was too distinctive to be explained only by cell cycle delay.
to investigate ppl involvement in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, cellular movement or attachment activity, sirnas against ppl were transfected into pharyngeal squamous cancer cell lines and their effects on cellular behaviours were examined.
importantly, ppl knockdown suppressed cellular movement and attachment to the culture dish accompanied by decreased paktser <dig> phosphorylation.
additionally, ly <dig>  a pi3k inhibitor that dephosphorylates paktser <dig>  significantly suppressed d <dig> cell migration.
ppl knockdown appeared to decrease tumor cell growth together with g2/m phase accumulation in cells attached to a culture dish.
