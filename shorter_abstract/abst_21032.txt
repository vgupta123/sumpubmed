lip <dig> shares sequence similarity with many bacterial lipoproteins, and the structural prediction of lip <dig> suggests that it is similar to a. pleuropneumoniae tbpb.
because current vaccines confer limited protection against a. pleuropneumoniae infection, the development of more effective vaccines is urgently required.
sixty putative lipoproteins were predicted from the genomic sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae using multiple algorithms.
here, we focused on the characteristics of the putative lipoprotein lip <dig> from a. pleuropneumoniae strain slw <dig> .
recombinant lip <dig>  produced in escherichia coli bl <dig> was specifically recognized by porcine convalescent serum directed against a. pleuropneumoniae.
lip <dig> was confirmed to localize at the bacterial outer membrane, and its expression was significantly stimulated when a. pleuropneumoniae was cultured under various stress conditions.
lip <dig> also protected 75 % of mice from fatal virulent a. pleuropneumoniae infection.
further investigation of lip <dig> should expedite vaccine development and provide insight into the pathogenesis of a. pleuropneumoniae.
real-time rt–pcr indicated that the expression of lip <dig> was significantly upregulated at 42 °c, at 16 °c, and under anaerobic conditions.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious and often fatal disease.
