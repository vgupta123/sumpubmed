experimental screening of large sets of peptides with respect to their mhc binding capabilities is still very demanding due to the large number of possible peptide sequences and the extensive polymorphism of the mhc proteins.
until the development of iedb, such an analysis was not possible, as the available peptide sequence datasets were small and spread out over many separate efforts.
therefore, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for predicting the binding capability of peptides to mhc molecules, as a first step towards selecting peptides for actual screening.
the chosen methods span a representative cross-section of available methodology for mhc binding predictions.
we have examined the performance of four diverse mhc class i prediction methods on comparatively large hla-a and hla-b allele peptide binding datasets extracted from the immune epitope database and analysis resource .
however, all methods show pronounced difficulties in correctly categorizing intermediate binders.
the best performance was achieved when predictions were performed on the dataset consisting only of strong binders  and clear non-binders .
all four methods show good to excellent performance on the comprehensive datasets, with the artificial neural networks based method outperforming the other methods.
