here we propose a novel measure of genome repetitiveness, the index of repetitiveness, ir, which can be computed in time proportional to the length of the sequences analyzed.
mouse chromosomes have a significantly higher ir than human chromosomes and within each genome the y chromosome is most repetitive.
a sliding window analysis reveals that the human hoxa cluster and two surrounding genes are characterized by local minima in ir.
a sliding window analysis helps to analyze the intragenomic distribution of repeats.
this reveals a broad spectrum of repetitiveness among diverse genomes which agrees qualitatively with previous studies of repeat content.
the expected value of ir is zero for random sequences of any g/c content and greater than zero for sequences with excess repeats.
