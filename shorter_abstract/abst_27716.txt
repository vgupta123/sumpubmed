our result provided a comprehensively transcriptomic atlas of human hepatocytes using mpss technique, which could be served as an available resource for an in-depth understanding of human liver biology and diseases.
apart from a large number of protein-coding genes, some of the antisense transcripts expressed in hepatocytes could play important roles in transcriptional interference via a cis-/trans-regulation mechanism.
to discover the molecular basis of hepatocyte function, we employed massively parallel signature sequencing  to determine the transcriptomic profile of adult human hepatocytes obtained by laser capture microdissection .
the liver is the largest human internal organ â€“ it is composed of multiple cell types and plays a vital role in fulfilling the body's metabolic needs and maintaining homeostasis.
<dig>  unigene clusters, representing  <dig>  known genes, were detected in human hepatocytes.
of these cell types the hepatocytes, which account for three-quarters of the liver's volume, perform its main functions.
