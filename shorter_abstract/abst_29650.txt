the divergence of t. alpinus during this time period provides additional evidence that pleistocene glacial cycles played an important role in diversification of species in sierra nevada and north america in general.
these range dynamics are particularly pronounced in the sierra nevada, california, given the complex topography and climatic history of the area, thus providing a natural laboratory to examine evolutionary processes that have led to the diversity patterns observed today.
here we examined the role of late pleistocene climate fluctuations on the divergence of the sierra nevada endemic alpine chipmunk  from its sister taxon, western populations of the least chipmunk  from the great basin.
in contrast, range expansions during interglacial periods may have had homogenizing effects via increased gene flow following secondary contact.
coalescent analysis of the divergence history indicated a late pleistocene splitting time  and subsequent, though limited, gene flow between the two lineages.
our results suggest that the two species are distinct and there is no contemporary introgression along their geographic boundary.
similarly, a morphological analysis of voucher specimens confirmed known differences in morphological characters between species providing no evidence of recent hybridization.
we used one mitochondrial gene  and  <dig> microsatellite loci to examine the evolutionary relationship between these species.
in contrast, the microsatellite analysis showed that populations of the same species are more similar to each other than they are to members of the other species.
mitochondrial sequence data revealed that t. alpinus and t. minimus populations share mitochondrial haplotypes with no overall geneaological separation, and that diversity at this locus is better explained by geography than by speciesâ€™ boundaries.
