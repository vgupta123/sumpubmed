sperm cells from frozen thawed semen samples of  <dig> bulls were successfully separated in two fractions.
to validate our method, two populations of spermatozoa isolated from high and low motile fractions separated by percoll were sequenced, and their small rnas content characterized.
at present, quality parameters routinely used in semen evaluation are not fully reliable to predict bull fertility.
specific mirnas are differentially represented in low versus high motile sperm, suggesting an alteration of cell functions and increased germ cell apoptosis in the low motile fraction.
small rnas present in bovine ejaculate can be linked to sperm abnormalities and fertility disorders.
small rnas sequencing data obtained from single bulls are consistent with previous findings.
