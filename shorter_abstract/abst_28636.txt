in gts we detected a cluster of decreased gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus , but no regions demonstrating volume increases.
a volume reduction in this brain region that has been previously identified as a key region in ocd and was associated with the active inhibition of attentional processes may reflect the failure to control behavior.
here we sought to address the question of gray matter abnormalities in gts patients with co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder  and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  using voxel-based morphometry  in twenty-nine adult actually unmedicated gts patients and twenty-five healthy control subjects.
by comparing subgroups of gts with comorbid adhd to the subgroup with comorbid ocd, we found a left-sided amygdalar volume increase.
from our results it is suggested that the left ifg may constitute a common underlying structural correlate of gts with co-morbid ocd/adhd.
correlations with clinical data revealed gray matter volume changes in specific brain areas that have been described in these conditions each.
structural changes have been found predominantly in the frontal cortex and in the striatum in children and adolescents with gilles de la tourette syndrome .
amygdala volume increase is discussed on the background of a linkage of this structure with adhd symptomatology.
