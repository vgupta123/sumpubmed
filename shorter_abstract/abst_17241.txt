composition-based statistics improve the statistical accuracy, and therefore the reliability, of tblastn results.
we present the first description of the modern implementation of tblastn, focusing on new techniques that were used to implement composition-based statistics for translated nucleotide searches.
we evaluate the statistical and retrieval accuracy of the e-values reported by a baseline version of tblastn and by two variants that use different types of composition-based statistics.
to test retrieval accuracy, we modernize and adapt to translated searches a test set previously used to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of protein-protein searches.
we show that composition-based statistics greatly improve the statistical accuracy of tblastn, at a small cost to the retrieval accuracy.
tblastn is a mode of operation for blast that aligns protein sequences to a nucleotide database translated in all six frames.
they are now available as a command line option for recent versions of tblastn and as an option for tblastn on the ncbi blast web server.
to test the statistical accuracy of tblastn, we ran  <dig> searches using scrambled proteins from the mouse genome and a database of human chromosomes.
