the outputs of the base classifiers are used to train a meta-classifier, which provides the final assignment of go terms.
to meet the increasing need for high throughput, automated annotation of fungal genomes, we have developed a tool for annotating fungal protein sequences with terms from the gene ontology.
we describe a classifier called pogo  that uses statistical pattern recognition methods to assign gene ontology  terms to proteins from filamentous fungi.
we also provide a web server where users can submit protein sequences to be annotated.
automated protein function prediction methods are the only practical approach for assigning functions to genes obtained from model organisms.
