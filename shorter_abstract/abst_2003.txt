here, we present a kinematic model of the dynamic system of iron pools and fluxes.
the analysis permits calculation of absolute flux rates in the steady-state, of iron distribution into different organs, of tracer-accessible pool sizes and of residence times of iron in the different compartments in response to three states of iron-repletion induced by the dietary regime.
the quantitative results reflect systemic properties of iron metabolism: dynamic closedness, hierarchy of time scales, switch-over response and dynamics of iron storage in parenchymal organs.
this mathematical model presents a comprehensive physiological picture of mice under three different diets with varying iron contents.
the evaluation resulted in a whole-body model of fractional clearance rates.
