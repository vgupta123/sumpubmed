hdx mass spectrometry is confounded by deuterium exchange-associated peaks overlapping with peaks of heavy, natural abundance isotopes, such as carbon- <dig>  recent studies demonstrated that high-performance mass spectrometers could resolve isotopic fine structure and eliminate this peak overlap, allowing direct detection and quantification of deuterium incorporation.
here, we present a graphical tool that allows for a rapid and automated estimation of deuterium incorporation from a spectrum with isotopic fine structure.
isotopic fine structure hdx-ms offers the potential to increase sequence coverage of proteins being analyzed through mass accuracy and deconvolution of overlapping ion signals.
as previously demonstrated, however, the data analysis workflow for hdx-ms data with resolved isotopic fine structure is distinct.
qudex-ms we hope will aid in the adoption of isotopic fine structure hdx-ms by providing an intuitive workflow and interface for data analysis.

deuterium incorporation can also be detected for ion signals without a priori specification of an elemental formula, permitting detection of exchange in complex samples of unidentified material such as natural organic matter.
hydrogen/deuterium exchange  coupled to mass spectrometry permits analysis of structure, dynamics, and molecular interactions of proteins.
a theoretical spectrum can then be calculated based on the estimated distribution of deuterium exchange to confirm interpretation of the spectrum.
a tool is also incorporated into qudex-ms to help in assigning ion signals from peptides arising from enzymatic digestion of proteins.
given a peptide sequence  and charge state, the mass-to-charge ratios of deuterium-associated peaks of the specified ion is determined.
