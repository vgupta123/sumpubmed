genome-wide gene expression profiling of mammalian cells is becoming a staple of many published biomedical and biological research studies.
in a second case study, we collected  <dig> signatures from treatment of human cells with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor  agonist.
each tagged collection of signatures is presented in a report that consists of heatmaps of the differentially expressed genes; principal component analysis of all signatures; enrichment analysis with several gene set libraries across all signatures, which we term enrichment vector analysis; and global mapping of small molecules that are predicted to reverse or mimic each signature in the aggregate.
such integrative analyses can be used to address concerns about data reproducibility, confirm results across labs, and discover new collective knowledge by data reuse.
our analysis confirms consensus gr target genes and predicts potential drug mimickers.
here we present gene expression and enrichment vector analyzer , a web-based system that enables the integrative analysis of aggregated collections of tagged gene expression signatures identified and extracted from geo.
gen3va can be used to identify, aggregate, and analyze themed collections of gene expression signatures from diverse but related studies.
we demonstrate how gen3va can be used to identify common molecular mechanisms of aging by analyzing tagged signatures from  <dig> studies that compared young vs. old tissues in mammalian systems.
