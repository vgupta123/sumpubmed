consequently, p. bursaria is an excellent model for studying cell–cell interaction and the evolution of eukaryotic cells through secondary endosymbiosis between different protists.
we identified p. bursaria genes that are differentially expressed in symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free conditions.
we identified differentially expressed genes in the symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells relative to the symbiont-free cells, including heat shock 70 kda protein and glutathione s-transferase.
results provide some keys for the elucidation of secondary endosymbiosis in p. bursaria.
this is the first reported comprehensive sequence resource of paramecium – chlorella endosymbiosis.
irrespective of the mutual relation between p. bursaria and the symbiotic algae, both cells retain the ability to grow without the partner.
despite the importance of this organism, no genomic resources have been identified for p. bursaria to date.
to expedite the process of gene discovery related to the endosymbiosis, we have undertaken illumina deep sequencing of mrnas prepared from symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free p. bursaria cells.
this investigation compared gene expressions through rna-seq analysis and de novo transcriptome assembly of symbiont-free and symbiont-bearing host cells.
