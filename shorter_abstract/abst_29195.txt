our findings demonstrate that multi-item ades are present and can be extracted from the fdaâ€™s adverse effect reporting system using our methodology, suggesting that our method is a valid approach for the initial identification of multi-item ades.
the current standard in pharmacovigilance is bivariate association analysis, where each single drug-adverse effect combination is studied separately.
the importance and difficulty in the detection of multi-item ade associations was noted in several prominent pharmacovigilance studies.
based on a set of  <dig>  reports of suspected ades reported to aers and published in the year  <dig>  our method identified  <dig> multi-item ade associations.
a significant number  of potential multi-item ade associations identified were characterized and clinically validated by a domain expert as previously recognized ade associations.
a smaller proportion  of associations were characterized and validated as known drug-drug interactions.
the method was applied to the fdas spontaneous adverse event reporting system  with minimal restrictions and expectations on its output, an experiment that has not been previously done on the scale and generality proposed in this work.
in this paper we examine the application of a well established data mining method known as association rule mining, which we tailored to the above problem, and demonstrate its value.
