among some compounds with higher activity , decreased ergosterol content in the total lipid fraction of f. verticillioides was demonstrated.
mi- <dig> reduced the ergosterol content approximately 40% and 80% at concentrations of  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively, and mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> decreased the content by 30% and 50%, respectively, when at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml.
among the evaluated compounds, mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> presented higher antifungal effects against f. verticillioides, with mic values of  <dig>  μg/ml, and mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> followed, with mics of  <dig>  μg/ml.
in this work, the antifungal activities of  <dig> mesoionic compounds  were evaluated against mycotoxigenic fungi, including aspergillus spp., fusarium verticillioides and penicillium citrinum.

f. verticillioides was the most sensitive fungus to the mesoionic compounds.
these findings indicate that mesoionic compounds have significant antifungal activity against f. verticillioides.
furthermore, the decreased ergosterol in the total lipid content of fusarium verticillioides was investigated.
