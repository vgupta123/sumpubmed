our efforts focused on the molecular characterization of endothelial cells  in the search for selective markers of tumor vasculature that might be helpful for the development of effective therapeutic approaches.
evidence suggests that tumor vasculature expresses unique markers that distinguish it from normal vasculature.
we investigated by microarray analysis the gene expression profiles of ec purified and cultured from tumor  and normal  tissue specimens.
comparative transcriptomic analysis allowed us to determine molecular differences of tumor and normal tissue-derived endothelium and to identify novel markers that might be exploited to selectively target tumor vasculature.
we found distinct transcriptional features characterizing the ec of different origin, and identified  <dig> transcripts highly expressed by hoc-ec.
these findings elucidate some of the molecular features of the tumor endothelium.
in vivo investigation by in situ hybridization established that adam <dig>  gpnmb and prss <dig> expression is localized on blood vessels of human cancer specimens.
targeting tumor angiogenesis and vasculature is a promising strategy for the inhibition of tumor growth and dissemination.
in vitro experiments confirmed the higher expression of the selected genes in tumor-derived endothelium with no expression in tumor cells.
