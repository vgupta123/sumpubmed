these results indicate the existence of at least one general cancer marker set whose predictive value spans several tumor types and classification types.
we also identify the previously published pomeroy- <dig> list as another general cancer marker set.
gene expression data are a rich source of information about the transcriptional dis-regulation of genes in cancer.
strikingly, pomeroy- <dig> has  <dig> genes in common with hm <dig>  our data suggest that a core set of genes are responsive to the deregulation of pathways involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of tumor types and that these genes could serve as transcriptional cancer markers in applications of clinical interest.
finally, our study suggests new strategies to select and evaluate cancer biomarkers in microarray studies.
indeed, when compared to  <dig> published cancer marker gene lists, hm <dig> achieves the best or second best classification performance in 79% of the classifications considered.
genes that display differential regulation in cancer are a subtype of cancer biomarkers.
we present an approach to mine expressed sequence tags to discover cancer biomarkers.
