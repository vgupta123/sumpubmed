our data suggests that pan- <dig> promotes developmental progression of multiple tissues during the transition from a larva to a reproductive adult.
rnai experiments reveal that pan- <dig> is required for developmental processes that occur during the mid to late larval stages.
pan- <dig> encodes both transmembrane and cytoplasmic isoforms that vary in the presence and number of leucine-rich repeats.
in the membrane-associated elrr proteins, the leucine-rich repeat motifs interact with the extracellular matrix and other ligands.
in this study, we identify pan- <dig> as a critical regulator of c. elegans larval development.
we show that pan- <dig> is a critical regulator of larval development.
pan- <dig> is also required for early larval ecdysis and execution of the molting cycle at the adult molt.
characterizing their functions in animal model systems is key to deciphering their activities in various developmental processes.
