the versatility of the current method comes from the ability that sds-page can separate proteins and small molecules according to different parameters.
as examples, we present the assays for recombinant human chst <dig>  tpst <dig>  chst <dig> and hs6st <dig>  in order to assess whether a small molecule can be applicable to this type of assay, a method to estimate the relative mobility of a molecule to paps is also presented.
the predicted relative mobility of a product to paps is a good indicator of whether a sulfotransferase can be assayed with sds-page.
the estimated relative mobilities of various sulfated small molecules generated by sult1a <dig>  sult1e <dig>  sult2a <dig> and chst <dig> are in the range of Â±  <dig>  of the actual relative mobilities.
while mobilities of proteins during sds-page are inversely related to their sizes, mobilities of small molecules are positively related to their charge/mass ratios.
sulfotransferases are a large group of enzymes that regulate the biological activity or availability of a wide spectrum of substrates through sulfation with the sulfur donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate .
