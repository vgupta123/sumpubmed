additionally, mΦs cultured in hyperglycemic conditions were less adept at macropinocytosis than those cultured in low glucose.
these results demonstrate a previously unrealized role for ampk in mΦs and suggest that increasing ampk activity in diabetic mΦs could improve innate immunity and decrease susceptibility to infection.
notably, amp-activated protein kinase  activity was decreased in mΦs cultured in hyperglycemic conditions.
taken together, these findings indicate that mΦs from diabetic mice have decreased macropinocytosis.
diabetes is characterized by metabolic abnormalities and altered immune function.
activation of ampk with leptin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-riboside  increased macropinocytosis and inhibition of ampk with compound c decreased macropinocytosis.
