although senx <dig> and regx <dig> were each dispensable for mtb growth in nutrient-rich broth, disruption of senx <dig> or regx <dig> caused a similar growth defect during phosphate depletion.
in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that regx <dig> has a senx3-independent role in mtb virulence.
the gene expression patterns, growth, and survival of mutants containing transposon insertions in senx <dig>  and regx <dig>  were compared to those of their respective complemented strains and the isogenic wild-type parent strain during axenic growth in nutrient-rich broth, phosphate depletion, nutrient starvation, and in the lungs of balb/c mice.
regx <dig> expression was reduced in senx3::tn during phosphate depletion and nutrient starvation, and expression of the phosphate-specific transport gene pstc <dig> was reduced similarly in senx3::tn and regx3::tn during phosphate depletion.
interestingly, senx3::tn, in which monocistronic regx <dig> expression is preserved, showed significantly higher survival relative to regx3::tn after 7Â days of nutrient starvation , and in mouse lungs at day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day  <dig>  after aerosol infection.
mycobacterium tuberculosis  must adapt to various stress conditions during host infection.
the two-component regulatory system  senx3-regx <dig> is required for mtb virulence.
