furthermore, the cr <dig> regulator domain containing the distal enhancer  was responsible for stem cell-specific expression.
by using the xyclone laser system the inner cell mass  and trophoblast portions of embryos were microdissected and examined separately and pou5f <dig> mrna was detected in both cell types.
notably, we are the first to report that the rabbit pou5f <dig> is not restricted to icm cells only, but it is expressed in trophoblast cells as well.
also, bac library screen revealed the existence of a processed pseudogene of rabbit pou5f <dig>  the results of quantitative real-time pcr experiments showed that pou5f <dig> mrna was abundantly present in oocytes and zygotes, but it was gradually reduced until the activation of the embryonic genome, thereafter a continuous increase in pou5f <dig> mrna level was observed until blastocyst stage.
our data suggest that the pou5f <dig> gene is strictly regulated during early mammalian development.
the upstream region of rabbit pou5f <dig> was subcloned sequenced and four highly conserved promoter regions  were identified.
in this study we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the regulatory region of rabbit pou5f <dig> gene.
the objective of this study was to identify and to analyse the promoter region of rabbit pou5f <dig> gene; furthermore to examine its expression pattern in preimplantation stage rabbit embryos.
