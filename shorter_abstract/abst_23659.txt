we also characterized clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  in oral streptococci, as their profiles provide clues to the viruses that oral bacteria may be able to counteract.
many crispr spacers matched viruses present in plaque, suggesting that the evolution of crispr loci may have been specific to plaque-derived viruses.
we sampled the saliva and dental plaque from  <dig> healthy human subjects to determine whether plaque was populated by viral communities, and whether there were differences in viral communities specific to subject or sample type.
dental plaque is home to a diverse and complex community of bacteria, but has generally been believed to be inhabited by relatively few viruses.
while there were some crispr spacers specific to each sample type, many more were shared across sites and were highly subject specific.
there was a significant proportion of viral homologues shared between plaque and salivary viromes within each subject, suggesting that some oral viruses were present in both sites.
