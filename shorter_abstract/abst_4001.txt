the overall structure of cpn <dig> resembles the groel allosteric intermediate state.
here, we report the first crystal structure of chlamydomonas chloroplast chaperonin homo-oligomer  at  <dig>  Å, which shares structural topology with typical type i chaperonins but with looser compaction, and possesses a larger central cavity, less contact sites and an enlarged atp binding pocket compared to groel.
the first crystal structure of chlamydomonas chloroplast chaperonin homo-oligomer  is reported.
the entire equatorial domain and at least one part of the intermediate domain from cpn60α are indispensable for functional cooperation with cpn60β <dig>  and this functional cooperation is strictly dependent on a conserved aa residue  in the cpn60α subunit.
domain swapping analysis revealed that the monomeric state of cpn60α is controlled by its equatorial domain.
the equatorial domain maintained the monomeric state of cpn60α and the c-terminus of cpn60β affected oligomer disassembly driven by atp.
moreover, two amino acid  residues  conserved among cpn60s are involved in atpase activity regulated by co-chaperonins.
furthermore, the c-terminal segment  of cpn60β influenced oligomer disassembly and allosteric rearrangement driven by atp hydrolysis.
atp hydrolysis drives the chaperonin allosteric cycle to assist substrate folding and promotes disassembly of chloroplast chaperonin.
chloroplast chaperonin, consisting of multiple subunits, mediates folding of the highly abundant protein rubisco with the assistance of co-chaperonins.
