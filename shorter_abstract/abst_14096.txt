like many other pathogens, enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic strains of escherichia coli employ a type-iii secretion system to translocate bacterial effector proteins into host cells, where they then disrupt a range of cellular functions.
many of the genes within this locus have been assigned names and functions through homology with the better characterised ysc-yop system from yersinia spp.
we conclude that the vast majority of lee-encoded proteins do indeed possess homologues and that homology data can be used in combination with experimental data to make fresh functional predictions.
however, the functions and homologies of many lee genes remain obscure.
we have performed a fresh bioinformatics analysis of the lee.
