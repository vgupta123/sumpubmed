the structure is highly similar to those described for z. mobilis  and a. pasteurianus pdc  with a rmsd value of  <dig>  Å for cα when comparing gdpdc to that of appdc.
the crystal structure of gdpdc indicates the enzyme to be evolutionarily closely related to homologues from z. mobilis and a. pasteurianus and suggests strong selective pressure to keep the enzyme characteristics in a narrow range.
this study reports the kinetic characterization and the crystal structure of a pdc from gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus .
their role in ethanol production and in bacterially mediated ethanologenic processes has, however, ensured a continued and growing interest.
pdcs from zymomonas mobilis , zymobacter palmae  and sarcina ventriculi  have been characterized and zmpdc has been produced successfully in a range of heterologous hosts.
examples include gluconobacter oxydans , g. diazotrophicus  and acetobacter pasteutrianus .
this is the first study of the pdc from g. diazotrophicus  and lays the groundwork for future research into its role in this endosymbiont.
the lack of activity on indole-3-pyruvate excludes this decarboxylase as the enzyme responsible for indole acetic acid production in g. diazotrophicus.
the ph optimum together with reduced thermostability likely reflect the host organisms niche and conditions under which these properties have been naturally selected for.
structural differences occur in two loci, involving the regions thr <dig> to thr <dig> and asn <dig> to asp <dig>
