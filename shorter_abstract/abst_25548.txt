after determining the set of genes that are semantically related to input genes, grank would use microarray experiment to rank these genes based on their degree of relativity to the input genes.
we evaluated grank experimentally and compared it with a comparable gene prediction tool called dyngo, which retrieves the genes and gene products that are relatives of input genes.
we propose in this paper a search engine called grank, which overcomes the limitations of the current gene similarity measures outlined above as follows.
the experimental results demonstrated that grank overcomes the limitations of current gene similarity measures.
it employs the concept of existence dependency to determine the structural dependencies among the go terms annotating a given set of gene.
we attribute this performance to grankâ€™s use of existence dependency concept for determining the semantic relationships among gene annotations.
the recall and precision values for two benchmarking datasets showed that grank outperforms dyngo tool, which does not employ the concept of existence dependency.
most of these gene similarity measures determine the semantic similarities among the genes based solely on the proximity to each other of the go terms annotating the genes, while overlook the structural dependencies among these go terms, which may lead to low recall and precision of results.
