using this method, four genomewide suggestive regions were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and a borderline suggestive region on chromosome  <dig>  seven additional regions with at least nominal evidence were observed.
our analyses have provided several loci of interest to pursue in these high-risk pedigrees and illustrate the utility of the weighted psgs method and extended pedigrees for gene mapping in complex diseases.
of particular note among these total twelve regions were three regions that were identified in two pedigrees each; chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  follow-up two-pedigree psgs analyses further indicated excessive genomic sharing across the pedigrees in all three regions, suggesting that the underlying susceptibility alleles in those regions may be shared in common.
