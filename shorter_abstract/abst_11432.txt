in addition, we found that m <dig> gas was the most common m type in the population studied, and is consistent with a previous study of thai gas isolates.
to overcome this problem, we have developed a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism -based assay for molecular typing the m protein gene  of gas.
using one pair of primers,  <dig> known gas m types showed one to four bands of pcr products and after digestion with alu i, they gave different rflp patterns.
although dna sequencing is the most conclusive method for m protein typing, this is not a feasible approach especially in developing countries.
pcr-rflp analysis has the potential for the rapid screening of different gas m types and is therefore considerably advantageous as an alternative m typing approach in developing countries in which gas is endemic.
of  <dig> gas isolates examined from the normal thai population and from patients with gas-associated complications including rhd,  <dig> isolates gave rflp patterns that corresponded to the  <dig> known m types.
only  <dig> isolates gave rflp patterns that differed from the  <dig> known m types.
these were then analyzed by dna sequencing and six additional m types were identified.
the majority of gas isolates are m protein-nontypeable  by standard serotyping.
