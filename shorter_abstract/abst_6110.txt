besides being essential for plant structure and metabolism, soluble carbohydrates play important roles in stress responses.
in conclusion, sucrose protection was in part due to activation of specific ros scavenging systems with consequent reduction of oxidative damages.
sucrose has been shown to confer to arabidopsis seedlings a high level of tolerance to the herbicide atrazine, which causes reactive oxygen species  production and oxidative stress.
the effects of atrazine and of exogenous sucrose on ros patterns and ros-scavenging systems were studied.
toxicity of atrazine could be related to inefficient activation of singlet oxygen  quenching pathways leading to 1o <dig> accumulation.
atrazine treatment also increased hydrogen peroxide  content, while reducing gene expressions and enzymatic activities related to two major h2o2-detoxification pathways.
importance of ros combination and potential interferences of sucrose, xenobiotic and ros signalling pathways are discussed.
