a metagene correlation network, constructed based on the results of nmf analysis, revealed many new interactions between the metagenes.
we applied the non-negative matrix factorization  algorithm to the atgenexpress dataset which consists of  <dig> microarray samples  conducted on the model plant arabidopsis thaliana.
comparison of these metagenes with an earlier large-scale clustering analysis indicates many statistically significant overlaps.
this study identifies a network of correlated metagenes composed of arabidopsis genes acting in a highly correlated fashion across a broad spectrum of experimental stimuli, which may shed some light on the function of many of the un-annotated genes.
