for apoptosis analysis the annexin v and propidium iodide dual staining was applied whereas cell proliferation was evaluated by mtt assay and brdu incorporation test.
they are often co-expressed in multiple human tumors and related cancer cell lines what can indicate that the ghrelin/ghs-r axis may have an important role in tumor growth and progression.
higher expression of ghrelin and its receptor was detected in cancer cell lines isolated from metastases than in cell lines isolated from primary tumors.
ghrelin is a natural ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor .
growth hormone secretagogue receptor inhibitor  as well as rna interference enhances early apoptosis.

however, a role of ghrelin in canine tumors remains unknown.
the expression of ghrelin and its receptor in canine mammary cancer tissues and cell lines  was examined using real-time qpcr and immunohistochemistry.
in vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to low doses of ghrelin stimulates cellular proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and promotes motility and invasion of canine mammary cancer cells.
the presence of ghrelin and ghs-r in all of the examined canine mammary tumors may indicate their biological role in cancer growth and development.
the influence of ghrelin on cancer cells migration and invasion was assessed using boyden chamber assays and wound healing assay.
