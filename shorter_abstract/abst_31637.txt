however, co-activator complexes that interact with nr2e <dig> have not yet been identified.
two of these proteins, p <dig> and androgen receptor , were further validated by reciprocal pull-down assays.
we found that nr2e <dig> binds strongly to an atrophin- <dig> peptide  used as positive control and to  <dig> other peptides that constitute candidate nr2e <dig> partners.
nr2e <dig> functions mainly as a repressor of gene transcription in association with the co-repressors atrophin- <dig>  lsd <dig>  hdac and bcl11a.
recent evidence suggests that nr2e <dig> also acts as an activator of gene transcription.
this assay was sensitive to point mutations in nr2e <dig> ligand binding domain making it useful to identify mutations and/or small molecules that alter binding of nr2e <dig> to protein partners.
despite the high conservation of arginine  <dig> in vertebrates, its reduced interactions with co-regulators were not significant in vivo as determined by retinal phenotype analysis in single-copy nr2e1-null mice carrying the variant r274g.
in order to find potential novel co-regulators for nr2e <dig>  we used a microarray assay for real-time analysis of co-regulator–nuclear receptor interaction  that contains peptides representing interaction motifs from potential co-regulatory proteins, including known co-activator nuclear receptor box sequences .
the specificity of nr2e <dig> binding to peptides in the array was evaluated using two single amino acid variants, r274g and r276q, which disrupted the majority of the binding interactions observed with wild-type nr2e <dig>  the decreased binding affinity of these variants to co-regulators was further validated by pull-down assays using atrophin <dig> as bait.
nr2e <dig>  is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates the maintenance and self-renewal of neural stem cells, and promotes tumourigenesis.
