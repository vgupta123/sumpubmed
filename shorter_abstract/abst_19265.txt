we implemented the new alignment-free measures, as well as traditional ones, in a software called ep-sim that is freely available: http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ciompin/main/ep-sim.html.
as a byproduct we provide a formula to compute the exact variance of variable length word counts, a result that can be of general interest also in other applications.
however, alignment-free measures are generally tied to a fixed resolution k. here we propose an alignment-free statistic, called ep2∗, that is based on multiple resolution patterns derived from the entropic profiles .

it has been recently shown that in high-level eukaryotes enhancers rarely work alone, instead they collaborate by forming clusters of cis-regulatory modules .
the use of fast similarity measures, like alignment-free measures, to detect related regulatory sequences is crucial to understand functional correlation between two enhancers.
enhancers are stretches of dna  that play a major role in development gene expression, evolution and disease.
the entropic profile is a function of the genomic location that captures the importance of that region with respect to the whole genome.
although the binding of transcription factors is sequence-specific, the identification of functionally similar enhancers is very difficult and it cannot be carried out with traditional alignment-based techniques.
in this paper we study the use of alignment-free measures for the classification of crms.
we evaluate several alignment-free statistics on simulated data and real mouse chip-seq sequences.
