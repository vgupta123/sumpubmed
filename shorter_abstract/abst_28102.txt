analysis of ion fluxes revealed that capacitative ca2+-entry was fully operative in the mutant.
moreover, capacitative and agonist-activated ion fluxes are regulated by separate pathways that are mediated either by two types of channels in the plasma membrane or by distinct mechanisms coupling ca2+-release from stores to ca2+-entry in dictyostelium.
the ipla- strain retains the capacitative ca2+-entry pathway and an impaired agonist-activated pathway that operates with reduced efficiency or at higher ionic pressure.
differentiation was altered as compared to wild type amoebae and sensitive towards manipulation of the level of stored ca2+.
in addition, basal i was significantly lower in ipla- than in wild type amoebae.
these results support the view that i-transients are essential for chemotaxis and differentiation.
mn2+-quenching of fura <dig> fluorescence allows to study ca2+-influx indirectly and revealed that the responsiveness of mutant cells was shifted to higher concentrations: roughly  <dig> times more mn2+ was necessary to observe agonist-induced mn2+-influx.
yet, the ipla- mutant disrupted in a gene bearing similarity to ip3-receptors of higher eukaryotes aggregates despite the absence of a camp-induced i-transient which favours the view that i-changes are insignificant for chemotaxis.
in suspensions of intact and permeabilized cells camp elicited extracellular ca2+-influx and liberation of stored ca2+, respectively, yet to a lesser extent than in wild type.
in suspensions of partially purified storage vesicles atp-induced ca2+-uptake and ca2+-release activated by fatty acids or ca2+-atpase inhibitors were similar to wild type.
we investigated ca2+-fluxes and the effect of their disturbance on chemotaxis and development of ipla- cells.
