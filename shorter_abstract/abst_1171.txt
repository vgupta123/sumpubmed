furthermore, most studies in cattle have used relatively small sample sizes and, consequently, may have had biased estimates of measures commonly used to describe ld.
we examine minimum sample sizes required to estimate ld without bias and loss in accuracy.
for unbiased and accurate estimates of ld across marker intervals spanning <  <dig> kb to >  <dig> mb, minimum sample sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are required.
for estimation of ld by d' and dvol with sufficient precision, a sample size of at least  <dig> is required, whereas for r <dig> a minimum sample of  <dig> is adequate.
this is the first comprehensive study on the extent of ld in cattle by analyzing data on  <dig>  holstein-friesian bulls genotyped for  <dig>  snp markers covering all regions of all autosomes.
we computed three ld estimates, d', dvol and r <dig>  for  <dig> , <dig> syntenic snp pairs and a sample of  <dig>  non-syntenic pairs.
ld in cattle is much less extensive than in a mouse population created from crossing inbred lines, and more extensive than in humans.
most studies on ld in cattle reported to date are based on microsatellite markers or small numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms  covering one or only a few chromosomes.
mean d' is  <dig>  among syntenic snps, and  <dig>  among non-syntenic snps; mean r <dig> is  <dig>  among syntenic snps and  <dig>  among non-syntenic snps.
the mean values for ld at large physical distances are close to those for non-syntenic snps.
all three measures of ld for syntenic pairs decline with distance; the decline is much steeper for r <dig> than for d' and dvol.
the extent of linkage disequilibrium  within a population determines the number of markers that will be required for successful association mapping and marker-assisted selection.
