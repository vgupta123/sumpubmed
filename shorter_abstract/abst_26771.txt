the exalt online program is uniquely suited for discovering relationships among transcriptional profiles and searching gene expression patterns derived from diverse physiological and pathological settings.
the exalt online program is freely available for non-commercial users from http://seq.mc.vanderbilt.edu/exalt/.
searches can be executed online against two large databases currently containing more than  <dig>  gene expression signatures derived from geo  and published expression profiles of human cancer.
comparisons among gene expression signatures can be performed with homology analysis and co-expression analysis.
results can be visualized instantly in a plot or a heat map.
the exalt  online program enables meta-analysis of gene expression profiles derived from publically accessible sources.
