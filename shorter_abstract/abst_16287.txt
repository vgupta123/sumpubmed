the first measure  describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure  characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network.
network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information.
these measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.
rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that h2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.
quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry.
they are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links.
analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches.
here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory.
