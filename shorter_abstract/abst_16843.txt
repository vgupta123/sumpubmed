flix and flbd form stable complexes, which can stand the interference of  <dig>  m nacl.
mutations in highly conserved regions of flix could severely affect the recognition between flix and flbd and hence interrupt the normal progression of flagellar synthesis and other developmental events in caulobacter.
this study is to characterize the interaction of the two proteins and the consequences of the interaction on their regulatory activity.
flix interacts with flbd and thereby directly regulates the activity of flbd in response to flagellar assembly.
five flix mutants  were created by site-directed mutagenesis in conserved regions of the protein.
the temporal and spatial expression of late flagellar genes in caulobacter crescentus is activated by the transcription factor flbd and its partner trans-acting factor flix.
the physical interaction of these two proteins represents an alternative mechanism for regulating the activity of Ïƒ <dig> transcription factors.
