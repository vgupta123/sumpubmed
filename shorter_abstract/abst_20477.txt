the different responses indicate that light impacts fungi like h. jecorina at several cellular processes, and that it has both positive and negative effects.
the cellular functions of the detected light responsive genes comprised a variety of roles in transcription, translation, signal transduction, metabolism, and transport.
envoy was found to be crucial for normal growth in light on various carbon sources and is not able to execute its regulatory function if overexpressed in the darkness.
in order to expand the knowledge on the effect of light in fungi and to determine the role of the light regulatory protein envoy in the implementation of this effect, we performed a global screen for genes, which are specifically effected by light in the fungus hypocrea jecorina  using rapid subtraction hybridization .
the data also emphasize that envoy has an apparently more widespread cellular role in this process than only in modulating the response to light.
