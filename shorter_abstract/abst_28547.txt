this study has provided the complete genome sequence of a novel isolated aquareovirus from marine fish.
amino acids comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggested that smrev was a new aquareovirus in the species group aquareovirus a. phylogenetic analysis among aquareoviruses revealed that vp <dig> could be used as a reference to divide the aquareovirus from hosts in fresh water or marine.
to the best of our knowledge, no complete sequence of an aquareovirus from marine fish has been determined.
these results provide new insights into the virus-host and virus-environment interactions.
members in aquareovirus were clustered in two groups, one from fresh water fish and the other from marine fish.
biophysical and biochemical assays, electron microscopy, and genome electrophoresis revealed that the virus belonged to the genus aquareovirus, and was named scophthalmus maximus reovirus .
the encoded amino acid sequences share the highest sequence identities with the respective proteins of aquareoviruses in species group aquareovirus a. phylogenetic analysis based on the major outer capsid protein vp <dig> and rna-dependent rna polymerase were performed.
in addition, a fast protein with a non-aug start site was identified, which partially contributed to the cytopathic effect caused by the virus infection.
therefore, the complete characterization and analysis of the genome of this novel aquareovirus will facilitate further understanding of the taxonomic distribution of aquareovirus species and the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis.
sequence analysis showed that all of the segments contained six conserved nucleotides at the 5' end and five conserved nucleotides at the 3' end .
