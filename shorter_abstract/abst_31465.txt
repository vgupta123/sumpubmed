the formation of acyl-coa by the action of acyl-coa synthetases plays a crucial role in membrane lipid turnover, including the plasma membrane of erythrocytes.
they encode a slightly different short motif which contains a conserved structural domain, the fatty acid gate domain.
we propose that a phe to tyr substitution or deletion of the gate domain, is the structural reason for the conserved alternative splicing that affects these motifs.
in human, five acyl-coa synthetase long-chain  genes have been identified with as many as  <dig> different transcript variants for each.
we report the expression in reticulocytes of two new variants and of the one isolated from brain.
based on homology, two new isoforms for the closely related acsl <dig> were predicted and characterized.
one represented a switch of the phe- to the tyr-gate domain motif, the other resulted from the exclusion of both.
