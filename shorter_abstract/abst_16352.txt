the ilf <dig> esc gene, which was previously reported in poorly differentiated breast cancers and bladder carcinomas, was also present in yhccs.
this study revealed the molecular makeup of yhcc and the link between esc traits and hcc subtypes.
esc genes were also more enriched in advanced hccs from elderly patients.
we therefore compared the gene expression profiles between yhccs and hccs from elderly patients.
hepatocellular carcinoma  in young subjects is rare but more devastating.
comparative genomics analysis was further performed for elucidating enriched or suppressed biological activities in different hcc subtypes.
