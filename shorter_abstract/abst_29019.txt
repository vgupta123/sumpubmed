the ssr survey results, and the primer pairs designed for all ssrs from the three species, were deposited in a public database.
this information represents a valuable source of molecular markers for use in population genetics, genetic mapping and strain fingerprinting studies of oomycetes, and illustrates how genomic databases can be exploited to generate data-mining filters for ssrs before experimental validation.
we compared the occurrence, relative abundance, relative density and cross-species transferability of the ssrs in these oomycetes.
in order to develop molecular methods for routinely characterizing their populations and to gain a better insight into the organization and evolution of their genomes, we used an in silico approach to survey and compare simple sequence repeats  in transcript sequences from these three species.
the in silico transferability of ssrs among the phytophthora species was analyzed for all sets generated, and primers were selected on the basis of similarity as possible candidates for transferability to other phytophthora species.
sequences encoding putative pathogenicity factors from all three phytophthora species were also surveyed for presence of ssrs.
the most devastating species include p. infestans, p. ramorum and p. sojae.
in all cases the most common ssrs were trinucleotide repeat units with low repeat numbers.
the number of ssrs in oomycetes transcribed sequences is low and long ssrs are rare.
however, no correlation between gene function and ssr abundance was observed.
