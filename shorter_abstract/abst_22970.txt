the subjective haptic vertical  task requires subjects to adjust the roll orientation of an object, mostly in the roll plane, in such a way that it is parallel to perceived direction of gravity.
short-term adaptation that shifts attention towards previous adjustment positions may provide an explanation for such biases of spatial orientation in both the horizontal and frontal plane.
no effects of grip and handedness  on accuracy were observed, however, shv precision was significantly  better in right-handed subjects compared to left-handed subjects and in male subjects.
previously we found a tendency for clockwise rod rotations to deviate counter-clockwise and vice versa, indicating hysteresis.
for both shv and psa significant effects of the hand used and the direction of rod/plate rotation were found.
the effect of hand used, however, was opposite in the two tasks: while the shv showed a counter-clockwise bias when the right hand was used and no bias for the left hand, in the psa a counter-clockwise bias was obtained for the left hand without a bias for the right hand.
healthy subjects repetitively performed adjustments along shv  and psa  in complete darkness.
unimanual haptic tasks require control for the hand used and the type of grip as these factors significantly affect task performance.
