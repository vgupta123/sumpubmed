western blot analysis showed that the his6-tagged heterologous gene product ribm was present in the cytoplasmic membrane.
riboflavin synthesis by a model riboflavin b. subtilis production strain overproducing ribm was increased significantly depending on the amount of the inducer iptg.
the energy independent flavin facilitator ribm could in principle catalyze riboflavin export and thus may be useful to increase the riboflavin yield in a riboflavin production process using a recombinant ribm overproducing b. subtilis strain .
the bacterium bacillus subtilis, which is not a natural riboflavin overproducer, has been converted into an excellent production strain by classical mutagenesis and metabolic engineering.
the gene ribmopt was functionally introduced into b. subtilis using the isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible expression plasmid pht01: northern-blot analysis of total rna from iptg treated recombinant b. subtilis cells revealed a ribmopt specific transcript.
the gene ribm from s. davawensis, coding for a putative facilitator of riboflavin uptake, was codon optimized  for expression in b. subtilis.
expression of ribm in escherichia coli increased riboflavin uptake, which was not affected by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone .
expression of ribmopt supported growth of a b. subtilis Δribb::ermr Δribu::kanr double mutant deficient in riboflavin synthesis  and also deficient with respect to riboflavin uptake .
expression of ribmopt increased roseoflavin  sensitivity of a b. subtilis Δribu::kanr strain.
