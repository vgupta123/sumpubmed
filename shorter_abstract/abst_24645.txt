insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  is a polypeptide growth factor with a variety of functions in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.
igf- <dig> plays anti-apoptotic and other functions by activating multiple signaling pathways including akt kinase, a serine/threonine kinase essential for cell survival.
the nuclear transcription factor camp response element-binding protein  may also be involved although relationships between these two proteins in igf- <dig> receptor signaling and protection is not clear, especially in neuronal cells.
these data suggest that igf- <dig> induced the activation of akt and creb using distinct pathways in pc <dig> cells.
survival assays with various kinase inhibitors suggested that the activation/phosphorylation of both akt and creb contributes to igf- <dig> mediated cell survival in pc <dig> cells.
the phosphorylation of akt is mediated by the pi <dig> kinase pathway while that of creb is dependent on the activation of both mapk kinase and p <dig> mapk.
