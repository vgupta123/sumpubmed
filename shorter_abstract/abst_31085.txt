treatment began when tumor thickness had reached  <dig>  mm, by subcutaneous implantation of  <dig> recombinant encapsulated or non-encapsulated endostatin producer cells.
the treatment of mice bearing melanoma tumor with encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells was decreased by  <dig> %, whereas a decrease of  <dig> % in tumor thickness was obtained for mice treated with non-encapsulated cells.
treatment of ehrlich tumor-bearing mice with non-encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells reduced tumor thickness by  <dig> %, whereas lower tumor growth inhibition was obtained for mice treated with encapsulated endostatin-expressing cells:  <dig> %.
theracyte is a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane macroencapsulation system designed to induce neovascularization at the tissue interface, protecting the cells from host's immune rejection, thereby circumventing the problem of limited half-life and variation in circulating levels.
the purpose of this study was to determine whether recombinant fibroblasts expressing endostatin encapsulated in theracyte immunoisolation devices can be used for delivery of this therapeutic protein for treatment of mice bearing b16f <dig> melanoma and ehrlich tumors.
this study indicates that immunoisolation devices containing endostatin-expressing cells are effective for the inhibition of the growth of melanoma and ehrlich tumors.
decrease in vascular structures, functional vessels and extension of the vascular area were observed in melanoma microenvironments.
endostatin is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth.
