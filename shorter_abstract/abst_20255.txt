wrky proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors and play important regulatory roles in plant development and defense response.
these results provide insights into functional conservation and diversification of smwrkys and are useful information for further elucidating smwrky functions.
each group of wrky domains contains characteristic conserved sequences, and group-specific motifs might attribute to functional divergence of wrkys.
a total of  <dig> pairs of orthologous smwrky and atwrky genes and  <dig> pairs of paralogous smwrky genes were identified.
analysis of published rna-seq data showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> identified smwrkys were yeast extract and ag+-responsive.
the wrky gene family in salvia miltiorrhiza has not been characterized.
a total of 61â€‰smwrkys were cloned from s. miltiorrhiza.
in s. miltiorrhiza roots treated with meja, significant changes of gene expression were observed for  <dig> smwrkys, of which  <dig> were up-regulated,  <dig> were down-regulated, while the other  <dig> were either up-regulated or down-regulated at different time-points of treatment.
functional divergence analysis suggested that the smwrky subgroup genes and many paralogous smwrky gene pairs were divergent in functions.
through a systematic analysis, smwrkys potentially involved in tanshinone biosynthesis were predicted.
multiple sequence alignment showed that smwrkys could be classified into  <dig> groups and  <dig> subgroups.
various critical amino acids contributed to functional divergence among subgroups were detected.
sequence features, the wrky domain and other motifs of smwrkys are largely conserved with arabidopsis atwrkys.
