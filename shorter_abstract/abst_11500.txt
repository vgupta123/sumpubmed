in this regard, a single molecule approach to methylation profiling offers several unique advantages that include elimination of chemical dna modification steps and pcr amplification.
a single molecule approach is presented for the discernment of methylation profiles, based on optical mapping.
optical mapping was used to discern the methylation profile from both an engineered and wild type escherichia coli.
methylation of cpg dinucleotides is a fundamental mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic genomes.
we report results from a series of pilot studies demonstrating the capabilities of optical mapping as a platform for methylation profiling of whole genomes.
furthermore, the methylation status of selected loci within the genome of human embryonic stem cells was profiled using optical mapping.
this advantage stems from obviation of dna modification steps, such as bisulfite treatment, and the ability of the platform to assay repeat dense regions within mammalian genomes inaccessible to techniques using array-hybridization technologies.
