five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis.
this suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation.
genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target.
uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy.
these proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners.
the strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins.
five of the  <dig> examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.
