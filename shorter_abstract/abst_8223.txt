data locality and model performance can also be improved by storing person attributes separately instead of using person objects.
we recommend that future studies evaluate the impact of data management, algorithmic procedures and parallelization on model performance.
depending of the clinical attack rate, target population and computer hardware, the introduction of the sort phase decreased the run time from  <dig> % up to more than  <dig> %.
we believe these conclusions to be valid for a wide range of infectious disease abms.
next, decreasing the number of operations by sorting people by health status before processing disease transmission has also a large impact on model performance.
we have found large performance differences with a discrete-time abm for close-contact disease transmission due to data locality.
sorting the population according to the social contact clusters reduced simulation time by a factor of two.
investment in performance optimization of abm simulator code can lead to significant run time reductions.
we observed that the effect of scheduling and workload chunk size is model specific and can make a large difference.
the key steps are straightforward: the data structure for the population and sorting people on health status before effecting disease propagation.
