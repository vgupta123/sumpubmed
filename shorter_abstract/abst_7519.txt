using an integrative approach that combines primary transcription, genome-wide dna methylation and h3k9ac marks with microrna  expression, we identified mirna genes that were epigenetically modified in cancer.
cancer is commonly associated with widespread disruption of dna methylation, chromatin modification and mirna expression.
we find mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-196b to be epigenetically repressed, and mir- <dig> epigenetically activated in prostate cancer cells.
we show that detecting changes in primary mirna transcription levels is a valuable method for detection of local epigenetic modifications that are associated with changes in mature mirna expression.
