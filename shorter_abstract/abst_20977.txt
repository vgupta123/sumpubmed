we examined activity changes in the human tectum and the lateral geniculate nuclei  in a visual search task using functional magnetic resonance imaging  and anatomically defined regions of interest .
evidence for corresponding functions of the sc in humans is still rare.
in contrast to the results of previous studies, signal changes could not be seen to be driven by either visual stimulation or oculomotor control on their own.
corresponding to findings in non-human primates, our data support a dependency of sc activity on functions beyond oculomotor control and visual processing.
however, while the ic revealed no signal increase from the baseline, bold signal changes at the lgn were consistently positive in all experimental conditions.
healthy subjects conducted a free visual search task and two voluntary eye movement tasks with and without irrelevant visual distracters.
our data demonstrate the involvement of the sc in a visual search task.
saccade frequency did not exert a significant effect on bold signal changes.
further, we can exclude the influence of any nearby neural structures  or of typical artefacts at the brainstem on the observed signal changes at the sc.
blood oxygen level dependent  signals in the sc were compared to activity in the inferior colliculi  and lgn.
visual, oculomotor, and – recently – cognitive functions of the superior colliculi  have been documented in detail in non-human primates in the past.
