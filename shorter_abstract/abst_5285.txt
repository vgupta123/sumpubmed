these could be assigned predicted gene products, and  <dig> were annotated using gene ontology  terms for molecular function, biological process and/or cellular component, employing an annotation transfer procedure.
the dramatic change of habitat requires physiological, morphological and behavioural changes to prepare the salmon for its new environment.
in all,  <dig> unique sequences, consisting of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, were generated for atlantic salmon from two cdna libraries constructed from the gills and the intestine, accession numbers .
these changes are called the parr-smolt transformation or smoltification, and pre-adapt the salmon for survival and growth in the marine environment.
a knowledge of which genes are expressed prior to the smoltification process is an important basis for further studies.
the atlantic salmon is an important aquaculture species and a very interesting species biologically, since it spawns in fresh water and develops through several stages before becoming a smolt, the stage at which it migrates to the sea to feed.
this paper describes the construction of two cdna libraries from pre-smolt atlantic salmon  and the subsequent est sequencing, clustering and assigning of putative function to  <dig> genes expressed in the gills and/or intestine.
the swiss-prot database returned significant hits for  <dig> sequences.
