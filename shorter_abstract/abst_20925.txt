dajumin-gfp labeled contractile vacuoles were purified 7-fold by anti-gfp-antibodies in a magnetic field.
camp-induced ca2+-influx in dictyostelium is controlled by at least two non-mitochondrial ca2+-stores: acidic stores and the endoplasmic reticulum .
the acidic stores may comprise the contractile vacuole network , the endosomal compartment and acidocalcisomes.
release of ca2+ was elicited by arachidonic acid or the calmodulin antagonist w <dig>  the latter due to inhibition of the pump.
we found a severe reduction of camp-induced ca2+-influx into whole cells.
