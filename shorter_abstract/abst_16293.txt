our results demonstrate that dlk <dig> can regulate the notch receptor despite its atypical structure.
in addition, cells expressing an alternative dlk <dig> isoform exhibit alterations in cell size, functions previously not attributed to notch suggesting that dlk <dig> might also act via an alternative target.
the resulting adult phenotypes are indicative of reduced notch function and are enhanced by notch mutations, confirming that dlk <dig> action is antagonistic.
mammalian delta-like  <dig>  protein shares homology with notch ligands but lacks a critical receptor-binding domain.
here we show that membrane-bound dlk <dig> can regulate notch leading to altered cellular distribution of notch itself and inhibiting expression of notch target genes.
