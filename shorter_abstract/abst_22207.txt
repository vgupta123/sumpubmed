the increased lignin biosynthesis might play an important role in nh4+ toxicity resistance.
however, our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of nh4+ toxicity is still largely unknown.
the nh4+ toxicity could inhibit the growth of l. minor.
most degs were down-regulated under nh4+ toxicity.
ros oxidative-related genes and programmed cell death -related genes were also analyzed and indicated oxidative damage and pcd occurring under nh4+ toxicity.
the first large transcriptome study in l. minor responses to nh4+ toxicity was reported in this work.
nh4+ toxicity could induce ros accumulation that causes oxidative damage and thus induce cell death in l. minor.
the antioxidant enzyme system was activated under nh4+ toxicity for ros scavenging.
the phenylpropanoid pathway was stimulated under nh4+ toxicity.

the l. minor cultured in the hoagland solution were used as the control , and in two nh4+ concentrations , 84 mg/l  and 840 mg/l  were used as stress treatments.
the malondialdehyde content and the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase increased from nc to a <dig>  rather than catalase and ascorbate peroxidase.
the transcriptomic and physiological analysis of l. minor responding to high nh4+ may provide us some interesting and useful information not only in toxic processes, but also in tolerance mechanisms.
the genes required for lignin biosynthesis in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated.
lemna minor, a model duckweed species, can grow well in high nh4+ environment but to some extent can also suffer toxic effects.
reactive oxygen species  and cell death were studied using stained fronds under toxic levels of nh4+.
