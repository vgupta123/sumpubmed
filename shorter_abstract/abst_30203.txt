the structure further suggests a physical model in which asf <dig> contributes to interpretation of a "histone h <dig> barcode" for sorting h <dig> isoforms into different deposition pathways.
the histone h3/h <dig> chaperone asf <dig>  is required for the establishment and maintenance of proper chromatin structure, as well as for genome stability in eukaryotes.
the structure defines a histone-binding patch on asf <dig> consisting of both conserved and yeast-specific residues; mutation of these residues abrogates h3/h <dig> binding affinity.
we have solved the  <dig>  Ã… crystal structure of the conserved n-terminal immunoglobulin fold domain of yeast asf <dig>  bound to the c-terminal helix of yeast histone h <dig> .
