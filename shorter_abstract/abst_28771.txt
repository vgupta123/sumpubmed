to evaluate performance, we compare the functional similarity of rank-ordered lists of protein pairs that share similar phylogenetic profiles by assessing significance of overlap in their gene ontology annotations.
as the number of fully sequenced genomes increases, it becomes more important to account for evolutionary relationships among organisms in comparative analyses.
furthermore, the networks that result from our approach tend to have smaller clusters of co-evolving proteins than networks computed using previous approaches and are thus more useful for inferring functional relationships.
the method allows us to more accurately and efficiently infer functional relationships between proteins based on these profiles than other published approaches.
phylogenetic profiles record the occurrence of homologs of genes across fully sequenced organisms.
we have developed an improved method for analyzing phylogenetic profiles.
some methods ignore phylogenetic relationships between organisms while others account for such with metrics that explicitly model the likelihood of two proteins co-evolving on a tree.
here we propose a novel heuristic to improve phylogenetic profile analysis that accounts for phylogenetic relationships between genomes in a computationally efficient fashion.
various existing methods measure similarity between two profiles and, hence, the likelihood that the two proteins co-evolve.
