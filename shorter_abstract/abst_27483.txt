a subset of  <dig> bt 1a strains, selected based on their varying lps patterns, were subjected to detailed genetic analyses.
further comparison of the 16s rrna genes of the bt 1a strains indicated that altogether  <dig> of the  <dig> strains belong to genetic group  <dig>  on the 16s rrna analysis, these  <dig> strains were only 98% similar to the previously identified subspecies of y. enterocolitica.
especially the bt 1a strains in our genetic group  <dig> commonly showed resistance to human serum complement killing, which may indicate pathogenic potential for these strains.
by bayesian analysis of the population structure  the strains clustered conclusively into two distinct lineages, i.e.

the results of the present study strengthen the assertion that strains classified as y. enterocolitica bt 1a represent more than one subspecies.
we used multi-locus sequence typing , 16s rrna gene sequencing, pcr for ysta and ystb, lipopolysaccharide analysis, phage typing, human serum complement killing assay and analysis of the symptoms of the patients to characterize  <dig> clinical y. enterocolitica bt 1a isolates in order to evaluate their relatedness and pathogenic potential.
the most commonly detected lps types were similar to the lps types of reference strains with serotypes o: <dig>  and o: <dig>  , o: <dig>   and o: <dig> .
variation and the population structure among the clinical y. enterocolitica bt 1a isolates have been poorly characterized.
y. enterocolitica biotype  1a strains are often isolated from human clinical samples but their contribution to disease has remained a controversial topic.
the strains of genetic group  <dig> were uniform in their pathogenecity-related properties: they lacked the ystb gene, belonged to the same lps subtype or were of rough type, were all resistant to the five tested yersiniophages, were largely resistant to serum complement and did not ferment fucose.
