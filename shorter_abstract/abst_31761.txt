the method we present may be employed for better annotation of inactive members in other gene families as well.
while most of these inactive genes are identified via coding frame  disruptions, seemingly intact genes may also be inactive due to other deleterious  mutations.
we used a logistic regression analysis to assign appropriate coefficients to the conserved position and thus achieving maximal separation between active and inactive ors.
to characterize inactive ors with intact open reading frame, we have developed a probabilistic classifier for olfactory receptor pseudogenes .
this algorithm is based on deviations from a functionally crucial consensus, constituting sixty highly conserved positions identified by a comparison of two evolutionarily-constrained or repertoires  with a small pseudogene fraction.
we demonstrated that the corp algorithm is capable to distinguish between functional and non-functional or genes with high precision even when the encoded protein would differ by a single amino acid.
using the corp algorithm, we predict that ~70% of human or genes are likely non-functional pseudogenes, a much higher number than hitherto suspected.
