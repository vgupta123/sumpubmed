in this way, we find cn alterations that show strong correspondence with ge changes.
then, we perform a correlation analysis and a frequency analysis of the gene loci in the segmented cn regions and the segmented ge regions; selecting in both cases the statistically significant loci.
however, it has been proposed that these data can be used to identify key genomic regions, which may enclose causal genes under the assumption that disease-associated gene expression changes are caused by genomic alterations.
these driver genes can be found in regions that show high correlation in copy number alterations and expression changes.

analysis of dna copy number alterations and gene expression changes in human samples have been used to find potential target genes in complex diseases.
identification of key altered genomic loci constitutes a first step to find the genes that drive the alteration in a malignant state.
to achieve this we apply a segmentation algorithm to both types of data using paired samples.
