our work highlights the functional link between aggregation of protein-dna complexes and dna unwinding in rad <dig> system.
rad <dig> itself being a highly aggregated protein perhaps acts as scaffold to bring together rad <dig> and dna molecules into large co-aggregates of rad52-rad51-dna complexes to promote rad <dig> mediated dna unwinding reaction, when appropriate nucleotide cofactors are available, presumably through macromolecular crowding effects.
interestingly, salt at low concentration can substitute the role of rad <dig>  in facilitating aggregation of rad51-dsdna complexes, that concomitantly also leads to better unwinding.
atp hydrolysis is not required for this process, because even atp non hydrolysable analogs like amp-pnp and atpÎ³s, support dna unwinding.
even adp, the product of atp hydrolysis, feebly supports dna unwinding.
we find that human rad <dig>  stimulates rad <dig> mediated dna unwinding in the presence of all adenine nucleotide cofactors,  while enhancing aggregation of rad51-dsdna complexes in parallel.
