the experimental study on several real ms/ms data sets shows that this re-ranking method improves the identification performance.
peptide identification from tandem mass spectrometry  data is one of the most important problems in computational proteomics.
the score regularization method can be used as a general post-processing step for improving peptide identifications.
in this paper, we present a consistency-based psm re-ranking method to improve the initial identification results.
we formulate an optimization problem that embraces two objectives through regularization: the smoothing consistency among scores of correlated peptides and the fitting consistency between new scores and initial scores.
this optimization problem can be solved analytically.
