our findings provided strong evidence on the causal association of hcy level with the development of t2dm.
the meta-analysis and mendelian randomization analysis were performed among  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls.
the absolute pooled mean hcy concentration in subjects with mthfr 677tt was  <dig>  μmol/l  greater than that in subjects with mthfr 677cc in t2dm.
the random effect  pooled or associated with t2dm for mthfr 677tt relative to the 677cc was .
overall, the t allele of the mthfr  <dig> c > t conferred a greater risk for t2dm .
the absolute pooled mean hcy concentration in individuals with t2dm was  <dig>  μmol/l  greater than that in control subjects.
