gene ontology analysis showed an increase in biological processes related with signaling and differentiation at early time points after bmp <dig> induction.
we assessed differences in the phosphorylation status of different cellular proteins upon bmp- <dig> osteogenic induction of isolated murine skin mesenchymal stem cells using triplex stable isotope dimethyl labeling coupled with lc/ms.
cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnfα, secreted by inflammatory cells at the lesion site, at the very beginning of the repair process, act as chemotactic factors for mesenchymal stem cells, which proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts through the autocrine and paracrine action of bone morphogenetic proteins , mainly bmp- <dig>  although it is known that bmp- <dig> binds to actri/bmpr and activates the smad 1/5/ <dig> downstream effectors, little is known about the intracellular mechanisms participating in osteoblastic differentiation.
taken together, these data, allow new insights on the intracellular substrates which are phosphorylated early on during differentiation to bmp2-driven osteoblastic differentiation of skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
