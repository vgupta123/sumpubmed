whereas temporal gene expression in mammalian herpesviruses has been studied extensively, little is known about gene expression in fish herpesviruses.
most early genes encode enzymes and proteins involved in dna replication, most late genes encode structural proteins, and early-late genes encode non-structural as well as structural proteins.
all of these genes are located within or near the terminal direct repeats.
expression of these genes was also studied in the presence of a viral dna polymerase inhibitor, enabling classification into early, early-late and late genes.
here we report a genome-wide transcription analysis of a fish herpesvirus, anguillid herpesvirus  <dig>  in cell culture, studied during the first  <dig> hours of infection using reverse transcription quantitative pcr.
overall, anguillid herpesvirus  <dig> gene expression was shown to be regulated in a temporal fashion, comparable to that of mammalian herpesviruses.
four immediate-early genes – open reading frames  <dig>  6a,  <dig> and  <dig> – were identified on the basis of expression in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor and unique expression profiles during infection in the absence of inhibitor.
the remaining  <dig> open reading frames were clustered into groups on the basis of transcription profiles during infection.
