lesion studies in human and non-human primates have linked several different regions of prefrontal cortex  with the ability to inhibit inappropriate motor responses.
the present results indicate that the integrity of left ifg is also critical for successful implementation of inhibitory control over motor responses.
controls showed the predicted pattern of faster reaction times and more false alarm errors in the hard condition.
left ifg patients had higher error rates than controls in both conditions, but were more impaired in the hard condition, when a greater degree of inhibitory control was required.
recent neuroimaging studies have focused on a highly specific association between right ifg and inhibitory control.
our findings demonstrate the importance of obtaining converging evidence from multiple methodologies in cognitive neuroscience.
to investigate whether the left inferior frontal gyrus  is critical for response inhibition, we used neuropsychological methodology with carefully characterized brain lesions in neurological patients.
however, recent functional neuroimaging studies have specifically implicated right inferior pfc in response inhibition.
twelve individuals with damage in the left ifg and the insula were tested in a go/nogo response inhibition task.
in alternating blocks, the difficulty of response inhibition was easy  or hard .
