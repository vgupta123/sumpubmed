single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common form of genetic variation in human dna.
the haplotype assembly problem is defined as follows: given a set of fragments sequenced from the two copies of a chromosome of a single individual, and their locations in the chromosome, which can be pre-determined by aligning the fragments to a reference dna sequence, the goal here is to reconstruct two haplotypes  from the input fragments.
haplotype information has many applications such as gene disease diagnoses, drug design, etc.
it outperforms most of the existing programs when the error rate of the input fragments is high.
we first give a dynamic programming algorithm that can give exact solutions to the haplotype assembly problem.
to solve the problem when t is large, we further propose a heuristic algorithm on the basis of the dynamic programming algorithm.
experiments show that our heuristic algorithm can give very accurate solutions.
the time complexity of the algorithm is o, where n is the number of snps, and t is the maximum coverage of a snp site.
existing algorithms do not work well when the error rate of fragments is high.
here we design an algorithm that can give accurate solutions, even if the error rate of fragments is high.
we have tested our algorithm on a set of benchmark datasets.
