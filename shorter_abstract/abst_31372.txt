several individual studies have suggested that autosomal cpg methylation differs by sex both in terms of individual cpg sites and global autosomal cpg methylation.
in line with previous studies, average beta differences were small.
of note was differential cpg methylation in the promoters of genes thought to be involved in spermatogenesis and male fertility, such as slc9a <dig>  spesp <dig>  crisp <dig>  and nupl <dig>  pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of genes differentially methylated by sex in several broad gene ontology biological processes, including rna splicing and dna repair.
however, these findings have been inconsistent and plagued by spurious associations due to the cross reactivity of cpg probes on commercial microarrays.
many of the most significantly associated cpg probes were new.
this study represents a comprehensive analysis of sex-specific methylation patterns.
after excluding non-specific probes, we found  <dig> autosomal cpg sites differentially methylated by sex after correction for multiple testing.
we demonstrate the existence of sex-specific methylation profiles and report a large number of novel dna methylation differences in autosomal cpg sites between sexes.
