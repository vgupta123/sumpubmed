systematic analysis of sequence, structural and positional features was carried out for two different data sets.
differing from previous approaches, this study focused on systematic analysis of all types of features.
statistically significant features were identified and used to construct models that yield similar accuracy to previous studies in a shorter computation time.
with increasing experimental data becoming available, research interest has shifted from higher prediction performance to uncovering the mechanism of microrna-mrna interactions.
microrna , which is short non-coding rna, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological processes and affects the stability and/or translation of mrna.
hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved auc of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for two different data sets.
recently, machine learning algorithms were developed to predict potential mirna targets.
