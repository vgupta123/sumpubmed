as a proof of concept, we performed a reanalysis of conus marmoreus venom duct transcriptome and  correctly classified all sequences previously annotated,  identified  <dig> novel precursor conopeptide transcripts,  <dig> of which were confirmed by protein mass spectrometry, and  identified another  <dig> novel conotoxin gene superfamilies.
when applied to conoserver and uniprotkb/swiss-prot databases, conosorter is able to recognize 100% of known conotoxin superfamilies and classes with a minimum species specificity of 99%.
conosorter also catalogues key sequence characteristics  and automatically searches the conoserver database for known precursor sequences, facilitating identification of known and novel conopeptides.
these molecules are highly stable and are able to efficiently and selectively interact with a wide variety of heterologous receptors and channels, making them valuable pharmacological probes and potential drug leads.
here we describe conosorter, an algorithm that categorizes cdna or protein sequences into conopeptide superfamilies and classes based on their signal, pro- and mature region sequence composition.
