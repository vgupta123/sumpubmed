the small-subunit ribosomal rna gene, also known as  <dig> s rrna, is encoded by ribosomal dna,  <dig> s rdna, and has provided a powerful comparative tool to microbial ecologists.
the "toolkit" includes sequence alignment, chimera removal, otu determination, taxonomy assignment, phylogentic tree construction as well as a host of ecological analysis and visualization tools.
in addition, waters, like some of the newer comprehensive rrna analysis tools, allows researchers to minimize the time dedicated to carrying out tedious informatics steps and to focus their attention instead on the biological interpretation of the results.
