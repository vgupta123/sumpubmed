statistically significant over-representation of ap- <dig> response elements notably suggested an important role for this transcription factor, which was experimentally verified.
ap- <dig> and sulfiredoxin are sequentially induced also in primary cells from rat islets of langerhans.
both iegs and targets were involved in a large panel of functions, including those important to beta cell physiology .
the identity of these target genes has not been determined, and the sequence of events occurring during beta cell adaptation is still unclear.
many of these iegs code for transcription factors and have the potential to control the transcription of downstream target genes likely involved in long term cellular adaptation.
by identifying iegs and their downstream targets, this study brings a comprehensive description of the transcriptional response occurring after beta cell stimulation, as well as new mechanistic insights concerning the ap- <dig> transcription factor.
physiological long term adaptation of pancreatic beta cells is driven by stimuli such as glucose and incretin hormones acting via camp  and involves regulated gene expression.
nearly  <dig> iegs were involved in signaling and transcriptional regulation.
to find specific examples of the regulatory link between iegs and targets, target promoter sequences were analyzed in silico.
several rapidly inducible immediate-early genes  have been identified in beta cells.
