also, such inhibitors would be directed to regions at/close to the active site of the enzyme.
also, the scfvs bound to the active site and denied the access to the substrate.
the selection strategy could generate specific anti-enzyme antibodies to plap that can potentially be used for targeting, for modulating enzyme activity in in vitro and in vivo and as probes for the active site.
several uncompetitive inhibitors have varying degrees of isozyme specificity for human alkaline phosphatase isozymes.
the scfvs were then studied with regard to the biochemical modulation of their binding, isozyme specificity and effect on enzyme activity.
the results demonstrate the biochemical modulation of scfv binding.
this strategy also has a general application in selecting antibodies from combinatorial libraries to closely related molecules and conformations.
cell elisa could demonstrate binding of the specific scfvs to the cell surface expressed plap.
three scfv clones, having an accessible his6-tag, were purified and studied for their modulation of enzyme activity.
the isozymes of alkaline phosphatase, the tissue non-specific, intestinal and placental, have similar properties and a high degree of identity.
the placental isozyme  is an oncofetal antigen expressed in several malignancies including choriocarcinoma, seminoma and ovarian carcinoma.
in this work, we have employed a plap-specific uncompetitive inhibitor, l-phe-gly-gly, to select isozyme specific scfvs.
an uncompetitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme in the presence of substrate and stabilizes the enzyme-substrate complex.
all the three scfvs inhibited plap activity with the kinetics of competitive inhibition.
