jcft was expressed in all tissues of adult plants except young leaves, with the highest expression level in female flowers.
to better understand the genetic control of flowering in jatropha, an ft homolog was isolated from jatropha and designated as jcft.
sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationship of jcft revealed a high sequence similarity with the ft genes of litchi chinensis, populus nigra and other perennial plants.
physic nut  is a potential feedstock for biofuel production because jatropha oil is highly suitable for the production of the biodiesel and bio-jet fuels.
this study is the first to functionally characterize a flowering gene, namely, jcft, in the biofuel plant jatropha.
