i then provide a collection of patterns for interface design based on the atlases and databases surveyed.
this collection of patterns for interface design will assist biologists and software developers in planning the interfaces of new atlases and databases or enhancing existing ones.
these patterns include methods for displaying graphics, integrating semantic and spatial representations, organizing information, and querying databases to find genes expressed in anatomical structures.
a large number of online atlases and databases have been developed to mange the rapidly growing amount of data describing embryogenesis.
i first present a survey of online atlases and gene expression resources for model organisms, with a focus on methods of semantic and spatial representation of anatomy.
they also show the benefits of standardizing semantic and spatial representations of anatomy by demonstrating how interfaces can use standardization to provide enhanced functionality.
this survey demonstrates how choices in semantic representation, in the form of ontologies, can enhance interface search functions and provide links between relevant information.
in addition, attention to the design of the interfaces is critical to make online resources useful and usable.
this survey also reviews methods for spatially representing anatomy in online resources.
a total of  <dig> anatomical atlases and  <dig> gene expression resources are included.
