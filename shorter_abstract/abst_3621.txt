comparison of the dimer interfaces of pffesod with the human manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase reveals a number of differences, which may underpin the design of parasite-selective superoxide dismutase inhibitors.
as a step towards their development we have determined the crystal structure of the parasite's cytosolic iron superoxide dismutase.
its crystal structure has been solved by molecular replacement and refined against data extending to  <dig>  Ã… resolution.
thus, inhibitors of p. falciparum sods have potential as anti-malarial compounds.
the cytosolic iron superoxide dismutase from p. falciparum  has been overexpressed in e. coli in a catalytically active form.
the tertiary structure of pffesod is very similar to those of a number of other iron-and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutases, moreover the active site residues are conserved suggesting a common mechanism of action.
superoxide dismutases  are important enzymes in defence against oxidative stress.
