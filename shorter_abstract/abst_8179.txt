about  <dig>  g xanthan per g biomass were produced by the xcc mutant h <dig> , as compared to the wild type production of approximately 5 g xanthan per g biomass.
we analyzed the lipopolysaccharide  of three mutant strains of the xcc wild type b <dig> to distinguish if the xanthan production can be increased when lps biosynthesis is affected.
in both of them no fucnac could be detected in the lps fraction, while the rhamnose moieties were more abundant than in wild type lps.
the measurements were carried out by gc and confirmed by maldi-tof-ms analyses that indicated an altered oa in which the branches are missing, while the rhamnan main chain seemed longer than in the wild type.
the data suggests an elongation of the linear rhamnan main chain of the lps oa in both the xcc h <dig>  and xcc h <dig>  mutant strains.
in the two mutant strains with modified oa however, xcc h <dig>  and xcc h <dig> , the xanthan production of  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g, respectively, was not significantly increased.
however, only complete inhibition of the oa resulted in increased xanthan production.
mutations affecting lps biosynthesis can be beneficial for the production of the extracellular polysaccharide xanthan.
the xcc b <dig> o-antigen  is composed of a linear main chain of rhamnose residues with n-acetylfucosamine  side branches at every second rhamnose.
the exopolysaccharide xanthan is a natural product which is extensively used in industry.
the inhibition of the fucnac side branches did not lead to increased production, but provoked a novel lps phenotype.
the o-antigen was missing completely in the mutant strain h <dig> , since neither rhamnose nor fucnac could be detected as part of the lps by maldi-tof-ms, and only a slight amount of rhamnose and no fucnac was found by gc analysis.
