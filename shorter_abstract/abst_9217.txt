nucleolus is the most prominent mammalian organelle within the nucleus which is also the site for ribosomal biogenesis.
in this study, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to map the flux of proteins into and out of the nucleolus during the induction of senescence in cultured mammalian cells.
biochemically, we have validated the proteomic results and confirmed that b <dig>  protein was down-regulated, while poly  polymerase  and nuclear dna helicase ii  were up-regulated in the nucleolus upon treatment with sodium butyrate.
changes in the abundance of  <dig> nucleolar proteins in sodium butyrate-induced senescence in nih3t <dig> cells were studied by silac -based mass spectrometry.
accumulation of chromatin in the nucleolus was also observed, by both proteomics and microscopy, in sodium butyrate-treated cells.
similar observations were found in other models of senescence, namely, in mitoxantrone-  treated cells and primary fibroblasts from the lamin a knockout mice.
