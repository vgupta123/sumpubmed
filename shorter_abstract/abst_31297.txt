here, we use somatic embryos and reverse genetics for studying expression and function of pawox <dig>  the corresponding homolog of atwox <dig> in the gymnosperm picea abies .

in addition, the aberrant early embryos lacked a distinct border between the embryonal mass, and the suspensor and the length of the suspensor cells was reduced.
distinct expression domains of wuschel-related homeobox  gene family members are involved in patterning and morphogenesis of the early embryo in arabidopsis.
down-regulation of pawox <dig> during development of early embryos resulted in aberrant early embryos, which failed to form a proper protoderm.
down-regulation of pawox <dig> in the beginning of embryo development, before late embryos were formed, caused a significant decrease in the yield of mature embryos.
on the contrary, down-regulation of pawox <dig> after late embryos were formed had no effect on further embryo development and maturation.
our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of wox <dig> in protoderm formation early during embryo development among seed plants.
however, the role of wox genes in other taxa, including gymnosperms, remains elusive.
cells on the surface layer of the embryonal mass became vacuolated, and new embryogenic tissue differentiated from the embryonal mass.
pawox <dig> mrna in early and early late embryos was detected both in the embryonal mass and in the upper part of the suspensor.
in addition, pawox <dig> might exert a unique function in suspensor expansion in gymnosperms.
the mrna level of pawox <dig> was transiently up-regulated during early and late embryogeny.
