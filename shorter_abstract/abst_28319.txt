the results presented here provide important information for the future development and use of serum tk <dig> as a diagnostic biomarker in human and veterinary medicine.
therefore, dog and human tk <dig> cdna were cloned and expressed, and the recombinant enzymes characterized.
these results suggest that the serum tk <dig> protein differs from cellular or recombinant forms, is more active in high molecular weight complexes, and is sensitive to reducing agents.
cellular tk <dig> was predominantly seen in dimeric and tetrameric forms, in the case of both dog tk <dig> from mdck cells and human tk <dig> from cem cells.
the serum and cellular forms of canine and human tk <dig> were studied by size-exclusion chromatography and the level of tk <dig> protein was determined using polyclonal and monoclonal anti-tk <dig> antibodies.
thymidine kinase  <dig>  is a salvage enzyme involved in dna precursor synthesis, and its expression is proliferation dependent.
active serum tk <dig> was found mainly in a high molecular weight form, and treatment with a reducing agent shifted the high molecular weight complex to lower molecular weight forms with reduced total activity.
western blot analysis demonstrated a polypeptide of 26 kda  and 25 kda  for cellular and serum tk <dig>  there was no direct correlation between serum tk <dig> activity and protein level.
oligomeric forms were observed with both enzymes in addition to the tetrameric and dimeric forms.
