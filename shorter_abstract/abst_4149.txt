we surveyed both the proximal promoter and 3' untranslated regions  of our top-ranking genes in each expression group to test whether common sequence elements may contribute to the observed expression patterns.
many of the genes identified as overexpressed in er- tumors were previously identified as expression markers for neoplastic transformation in multiple human cancers.
this allows one to compare expression data from a diverse collection of breast tumor array datasets generated on either cdna or oligonucleotide arrays.
we gathered expression data from  <dig> published microarray studies examining estrogen receptor positive  and estrogen receptor negative  brca tumor cases from the oncomine database.
utilizing a combination of known transcription factor binding sites , evolutionarily conserved mammalian promoter and 3'utr motifs, and microrna  seed sequences, we identified numerous motifs that were disproportionately represented between the two gene classes suggesting a common regulatory network for the observed gene expression patterns.
moreover, our motif analysis identified a collection of specific cis-acting target sites which may collectively play a role in the differential gene expression patterns observed in er+ versus er- breast cancer tumors.
importantly, the gene sets and associated dna motifs provide a starting point with which to explore the mechanistic basis for the observed expression patterns in breast tumors.
