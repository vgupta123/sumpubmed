the glands were best visualized in contrast-enhanced ct images.
forty-two dogs were imaged, and the length, width, and height were measured and the volume calculated for the lgs & tegs.
disease affecting these glands can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca, corneal ulcers, and loss of vision.
due to their location in the orbit, these small structures are difficult to evaluate and measure, making cross-sectional imaging an important diagnostic tool.
lg and teg volume were positively correlated with body weight .
the canine lacrimal gland  and accessory lacrimal gland of the third eyelid  are responsible for production of the aqueous portion of the precorneal tear film.
contrast-enhanced ct is a valuable tool for noninvasive assessment of canine lacrimal glands.
