thus, mrnas may contain different 5'utrs and encode different protein isoforms.
the fu gene was identified on chromosome 2q <dig> at  <dig>  mb and its exon-intron organization determined.
this also suggests the existence of at least two additional protein isoforms besides the fu protein that has previously been described.
fu is a candidate gene for sd <dig>  but we have not identified a pathogenic mutation in the fu coding region in a family with sd <dig>  the sequence information and expression analyses show that transcripts of different sizes are expressed and subjected to alternative splicing.
the fu gene and its genomic structure was identified.
it is also clear that different tissues express transcripts of different sizes and some tissues express more than one transcript.
the human developmental disorder syndactyly type  <dig>  maps to this region on chromosome  <dig> and the fu coding region was sequenced using genomic dna from an affected individual in a linked family.
fu is the human homologue of the drosophila gene fused whose product fused is a positive regulator of the transcription factor cubitus interruptus .
this long fu and a much shorter isoform were compared for the ability to regulate gli <dig> and gli <dig>  none of the fu isoforms showed any effects on gli <dig> induced transcription but the long form can enhance gli <dig> activity.
while no fu mutations were found, three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified.
thus, fu may act as a regulator of the human counterparts of ci, the gli transcription factors.
