given that truncation at the vcd motif alters endolysosomal trafficking of pcdhs, the vcd interaction described here may provide new insights into the dynamic nature of pcdh mediated cell-cell interactions.
clustered protocadherins  are a large family of neural cadherin-like proteins encoded by individual exons located within three gene clusters.
pcdh extracellular domains mediate homophilic cell-cell binding but their cytoplasmic domains cause intracellular retention and may negatively regulate pcdh cell-cell binding.
internal deletions within this vcd region  that disrupt the association altered trafficking of pcdh-Î³a <dig> in the endolysosomal system while deletions outside vcd motif did not affect trafficking.
the results show that pcdhs associate cytoplasmically via a motif within the vcd and that this is critical for pcdh trafficking.
pcdhs can be found at the cell surface in neurons and other cells but are also, unlike classical cadherins, prominently trafficked to the endolysosome system.
