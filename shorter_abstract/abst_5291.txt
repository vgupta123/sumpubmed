secondly, the probability distribution that solves the equation is parametrised with a small number of coefficients using collocation on gaussian radial basis functions.
the proposed method is a new numerical approach permitting to approximately solve a wide range of problems that have been hard to tackle until now.
a full representation of multi-dimensional distributions is recovered.
in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we consider four application examples: a) the self-regulating gene model, b) the 2-dimensional bistable toggle switch, c) a generalisation of the bistable switch to a 3-dimensional tristable problem, and d) a 3-dimensional cell differentiation model that, depending on parameter values, may operate in bistable or tristable modes.
this differential-difference equation describes temporal evolution of the probability density function for states of a chemical system.
the system of basis functions is chosen in such a way that the solution is approximated only on the essential support instead of the whole state space.
firstly, when performing time integration, the algorithm keeps track of the subset of states with significant probabilities .
in all multidimensional examples the manifold containing the system states with significant probabilities undergoes drastic transformations over time.
the method is especially attractive when dealing with models that yield solutions of a complex structure, for instance, featuring multi-stability.
the chemical master equation is the fundamental equation of stochastic chemical kinetics.
a state of the system, usually encoded as a vector, represents the number of entities or copy numbers of interacting species, which are changing according to a list of possible reactions.
