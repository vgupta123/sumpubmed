the sortin <dig> phenotype was tested in arabidopsis thaliana and found to be reversible upon drug removal, demonstrating the ability of chemical genomics to induce reversible phenotypes that would be difficult to achieve using conventional genetics  <cit> .
chemical, genomic and genetics approaches were used to understand the mode of action of sortin <dig>  a bioactive chemical that affects the delivery of a vacuolar protein.
using bioinformatics approaches, we highlighted functional information about the cellular pathways affected by drug treatment which included protein sorting and other endomembrane system-related processes.
the results show the key roles of sulphite substitution and a benzoic acid group.
this approach allowed us to assign putative functions in protein sorting for fifteen genes of previously unknown function.
critical features of sortin <dig> structure necessary for bioactivity suggest a binding pocket that may recognize two ends of sortin <dig>  the genome-wide screen shows that sortin <dig> treatment in yeast affects primarily components within the endomembrane system.
