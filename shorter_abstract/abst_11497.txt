four key signalling cascades triggered early-on in the innate immune response are the toll-like receptor, interferon, nf-Îºb and apoptotic pathways, which co-operate to defend cells against a given pathogen.
here we describe the construction of a logically represented pathway diagram which attempts to integrate these four pathways central to innate immunity using a modified version of the edinburgh pathway notation.
the map presents a powerful visual aid for interpreting the available pathway interaction knowledge and underscores the valuable contribution well constructed pathway diagrams make to communicating large amounts of molecular interaction data.
the pathway map is available in a number of electronic formats and editing is supported by yed graph editor software.
however, these pathways are commonly viewed as separate entities rather than an integrated network of molecular interactions.
