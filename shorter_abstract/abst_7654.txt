the results demonstrate that the ic <dig>  values were notably lower than the ic <dig>  values.
feline herpesvirus  <dig>  is a common cause of respiratory and ocular disease in cats.
the most remarkable effect was observed for cidofovir and ganciclovir.
especially in young kittens that have not yet reached the age of vaccination, but already lost maternal immunity, severe disease may occur.
therefore, they may be valuable candidates for the treatment of fhv- <dig> infection in cats.
by using these parameters for six selected antiviral drugs, we found that ganciclovir, pmedap, and cidofovir are the most potent inhibitors of fhv- <dig> replication in crfk cells.
in the present study, the efficacy of six antiviral drugs, i.e.
all antiviral drugs were able to significantly reduce plaque size when compared with the untreated control.
in conclusion, measuring reduction in plaque number and plaque size are two valuable and complementary means of assessing the efficacy of an antiviral drug.
none of the products were toxic for crfk cells at antiviral concentrations.
acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, adefovir and 9-- <dig>  6-diaminopurine , against fhv- <dig> was compared in crandell-rees feline kidney  cells using reduction in plaque number and plaque size as parameters.
as observed for the reduction in plaque number, ganciclovir, pmedap and cidofovir were most potent in reducing plaque size.
