we therefore systematically investigated global gene expression profiles in peripheral blood from six individuals collected during two visits by comparing five of the following cell and rna isolation methods: whole blood , peripheral blood mononuclear cells , lymphoblastoid cell lines , cd <dig> and cd <dig> specific b-cell subsets.
however, cell and rna isolation procedures and the variety of cell types that make up whole blood can affect gene expression measurements.
gene expression measurements were clearly discriminated by isolation method although the reproducibility was high for all methods .
it is crucial to understand the differences and variability of gene expression measurements between cell and rna isolation procedures, and their relevance to disease processes, before application in large clinical studies.
gene ontology analysis of detected genes showed that genes involved in inflammatory responses are enriched in b-cells cd <dig> and cd <dig> whereas genes involved in alcohol metabolic process and the cell cycle were enriched in lcls.
readily accessible samples such as peripheral blood or cell lines are increasingly being used in large cohorts to characterise gene expression differences between a patient group and healthy controls.
gene expression profiles in blood-based samples are strongly dependent on the predominant constituent cell type and rna isolation method.
the correlations  of the expression levels of detected probes between lcls and b-cell subsets were much lower compared to the two b-cell isolation methods .
