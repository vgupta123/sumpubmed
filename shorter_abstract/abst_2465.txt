the complex responses of plants to dna damage are incompletely understood and the role of members of the serpin protein family has not been investigated.
atsrp <dig> was induced 5-fold and atsrp <dig> 100-fold after exposure of seedlings to low concentrations of methyl methanesulfonate , a model alkylating reagent that causes dna damage.
induction of cell cycle- and dna damage-related genes atbrca <dig>  atbard <dig>  atrad <dig>  atcycb1; <dig> and atcycd1; <dig>  but not atatm, was reduced relative to wild-type in atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants exposed to mms.
in contrast, atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> plants exhibited greater root length, leaf number and overall size than wild-type plants when exposed to mms.
basal levels of atsrp <dig>  and atsrp <dig>  transcripts were highest in reproductive tissues.
plant serpins are also potent proteinase inhibitors, but their physiological roles are largely unknown.
homozygous t-dna insertion mutants atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> exhibited no differential growth when mutant and wild-type plants were left untreated or exposed to Î³-radiation or ultraviolet light.
six arabidopsis genes encoding full-length serpins were differentially expressed in developing seedlings and mature tissues.
