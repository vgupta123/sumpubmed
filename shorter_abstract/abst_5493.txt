in this paper we report on a study running over a period of 15â€‰years, in which - for the first time to our knowledge - two disease-detector dogs were trained to follow the scent of sarcoptes-infected animals and to find carcasses, even under the snow, and apparently no false positives were detected in fieldwork.
sarcoptic mange-detector dogs were used to collect the carcasses of  <dig> mangy wild animals and to identify, separate from their herd, and capture  <dig> mange-infected wild animals in the italian alps.
the rapid removal and treatment of infected carcasses and/or sick animals is a key task in the management of infectious diseases, but it is usually difficult or impractical to carry out in the wild.
properly trained disease-detector dogs are an efficient and straightforward tool for surveillance and control of sarcoptic mange in affected wild animal populations.
