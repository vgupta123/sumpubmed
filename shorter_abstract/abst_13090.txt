the identification of representative and manageable subset of accessions would facilitate access to the diversity available in large collections.
despite the large number of putative duplicates and extensive clonal relationships among the accessions, we observed high level of genetic variation.
however, although a large number of clonally propagated accessions are maintained in grape germplasm collections worldwide, their use for crop improvement is limited by the scarcity of information on genetic diversity, population structure and proper phenotypic assessment.
in the total germplasm collection the average genetic diversity, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity, was higher for ssr loci  than for snps .
the comparison of a phenological core collection and genetic core collections showed that the latter retained more genetic diversity, while maintaining a similar phenotypic variability.
the comprehensive molecular characterization of our grape germplasm collection contributes to the knowledge about levels and distribution of genetic diversity in the existing resources of vitis and provides insights into genetic subdivision within the european germplasm.
the analysis of the genetic structure in the grape germplasm collection revealed several levels of stratification.
we investigated patterns of molecular diversity at  <dig> common microsatellite loci and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> accessions of domesticated grapevine v. vinifera ssp.
sativa, its wild relative v. vinifera ssp.
the primary division was between accessions of v. vinifera and non-vinifera, followed by the distinction between wild and domesticated grapevine.
a genome-wide germplasm characterization using molecular markers can offer reliable tools for adjusting the quality and representativeness of such core samples.
