elviz  is an interactive web-based tool for the visual exploration of assembled metagenomes and their complex metadata.
current genomics applications cannot effectively integrate sequence data, assembly metadata, and annotation to support both genome and community-level inquiry.
elviz allows scientists to navigate metagenome assemblies across multiple dimensions and scales, plotting parameters such as gc content, relative abundance, phylogenetic affiliation and assembled contig length.
metagenomics studies produce huge volumes of data, including both the sequences themselves and metadata describing their abundance, assembly, predicted functional characteristics and environmental parameters.
furthermore elviz enables interactive exploration using real-time plot navigation, search, filters, axis selection, and the ability to drill from a whole-community profile down to individual gene annotations.
elviz can be used to explore both user-submitted datasets and numerous metagenome studies publicly available at the joint genome institute .
