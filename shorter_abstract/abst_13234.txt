in total, the libraries generated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million raw reads, and the clean tags of each library were mapped to 18547â€“ <dig> genes of b. rapa genome.
methyltransferase genes showed differential expression pattern in brassica species.
the non-additive genes in brassica amphidiploids were analyzed, and the results indicated that orthologous genes in polyploids are frequently expressed in a non-additive pattern.
brassica includes many successfully cultivated crop species of polyploid origin, either by ancestral genome triplication or by hybridization between two diploid progenitors, displaying complex repetitive sequences and transposons.
our results provided an understanding of the transcriptome complexity of natural brassica species.
the gene expression changes in diploids and allopolyploids may help elucidate the morphological and physiological differences among brassica species.
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis was performed to assign these degs into approximately  <dig> pathways, among which the metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and peroxisomal pathway were enriched.
