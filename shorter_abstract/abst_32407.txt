interferon-τ  plays an important role in stable fertilization, and is produced from the fetal side following embryo growth at 15– <dig> days of pregnancy.
to understand the embryo growth and maternal reaction during early pregnancy in cows with bodv- <dig> infection, we aimed to assess the gene expression of isg <dig> and mx <dig> from pbmcs in bodv-1-seropositive cows.
borna disease virus is a neurotropic pathogen and infects the central nervous system.
the most of cows infected with borna disease virus  <dig>  exhibit subclinical infection without any neurological symptoms throughout their lifetime.

the expression of isg <dig> and mx <dig> genes during early pregnancy significantly increased in the bodv-1-seropositive cows and may be important for the maintenance of stable pregnancy in bodv-1-infected cows.
in contrast, the gene expression levels of isg <dig> and mx <dig> did not significantly increase during early pregnancy in bodv-1-seronegative cows.
thus, bodv- <dig> infection may lead to instability in the maintenance of early pregnancy by interfering with inf-τ production.
none of the cows showed any clinical and neurological symptoms.
