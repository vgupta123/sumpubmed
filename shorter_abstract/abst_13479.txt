the observed events consist of canonical vj or v-j rearrangements, non-canonical rearrangements, and putatively oncogenic reciprocal chromosome translocations.
the process, termed vj recombination, juxtaposes modular coding sequences for antigen binding.
here we show a hybridization based method for sequence enrichment can be used to efficiently and selectively capture genomic dna adjacent to vj recombination breakpoints for massively parallel sequencing.
erroneous recombination events causing chromosomal translocations are recognized causes of lymphoid malignancies.
our results demonstrate the ability of next generation sequencing to describe human vj recombinase activity and provide a scalable means to chronicle off-target, unexpressed, and non-amplifiable recombinations occurring in the development of lymphoid cancers.
lymphocytes achieve diversity in antigen recognition in part by rearranging genomic dna at loci encoding antibodies and cell surface receptors.
using tailored informatics analyses to resolve alignment and assembly issues in these repetitive regions, we were able to detect numerous recombination events across a panel of cancer cell lines and primary lymphoid tumors, and an ebv transformed lymphoblast line.
