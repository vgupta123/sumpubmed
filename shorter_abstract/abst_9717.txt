the two best-characterized pcg complexes are the pcg repressive complex  <dig>  and  <dig>  that respectively possess histone 2a lysine  <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> methyltransferase activities.
these prc <dig> proteins have an n-terminally located ring finger domain associated to a poorly characterized conserved c-terminal region.
we obtained statistically significant evidences of sequence similarity between the c-terminal region of the prc <dig> ring finger proteins and the ubiquitin -like family proteins, thus defining a new ubq-like domain, the rawul domain.
in addition, our analysis revealed the existence of plant and worm proteins that display the conserved combination of a ring finger domain at the n-terminus and a rawul domain at the c-terminus.
analysis of the conserved domain architecture among prc <dig> ring finger proteins revealed the existence of long sought prc <dig> protein orthologs in these organisms, suggesting the functional conservation of prc <dig> throughout higher eukaryotes.
