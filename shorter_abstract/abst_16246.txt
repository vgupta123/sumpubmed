combined analysis of multiple experiments can be a powerful way to distil coherent conclusions.
microarray studies of the same phenomenon in different labs often appear at variance because the published lists of regulated transcripts have disproportionately small intersections.
carefully reanalyzing all three together from the raw data we detect  <dig> genes upregulated and  <dig> downregulated in all three studies.
we demonstrate that comparing studies by intersecting lists in this manner is methodologically flawed by reanalyzing three studies of the molecular signature of "stemness" in human embryonic stem cells.
our findings show that the three studies have a substantial core of common genes, which is missed if only the published lists are examined.
