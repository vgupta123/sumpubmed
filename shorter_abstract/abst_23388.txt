using the negative binomial distribution and a random-effects model, we develop an omnibus test that overcomes both difficulties.
the proposed test can detect genetic and epigenetic alterations that affect gene expression.
testing for association between rna-seq and other genomic data is challenging due to high variability of the former and high dimensionality of the latter.
it can examine complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.
