the genera scotocerca and erythrocercus are closely related to cettiidae, but separated by relatively long internodes.
we propose new family names for the genera scotocerca and erythrocercus, scotocercidae and erythrocercidae, respectively, rather than including these in cettiidae, and we formally propose the name macrosphenidae, which has been in informal use for some time.
our data do not support the inclusion of hylia in cettiidae, but do not strongly reject a close relationship with cettiidae either.
the families paridae, remizidae and stenostiridae clustered among the outgroup taxa and not within sylvioidea.
although the phylogenetic position of hylia is uncertain, we tentatively support the recognition of the family hyliidae bannerman,  <dig> for this genus and pholidornis.
we here present a phylogenetic hypothesis for sylvioidea based on one mitochondrial and six nuclear markers, in total ~ <dig>  kbp, for  <dig> ingroup species representing all currently recognised families and some species with uncertain affinities, making this the most comprehensive analysis of this taxon.
the resolution, especially of the deeper nodes, is much improved compared to previous studies.
