in our study, we evaluated the hyplex® tbc pcr test , a novel assay using a nucleic acid amplification technique  with reverse hybridisation and elisa read out for the rapid detection of m. tuberculosis directly in clinical samples.
the hyplex® tbc pcr test is an accurate naat assay for a rapid and reliable detection of m. tuberculosis in various respiratory and non-respiratory specimens.
of these,  <dig> were classified as tb samples and  <dig> as non-tb samples based on the results of the tb cultures as reference method.
in smear-positive tb samples, the sensitivity of the hyplex® tbc pcr test was estimated to  <dig> % versus  <dig> % in smear-negative samples.
based on the assumption of a prevalence of 8% tb positives among the samples in our diagnostic tb laboratory, the positive and negative predictive values were estimated to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
the overall sensitivity of the assay was determined to be  <dig> %.
of the two specimens  with false-positive pcr results, one yielded a culture positive for non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
a total of  <dig> respiratory and non-respiratory specimens from our pneumological hospital and the national tb institute of uzbekistan were used for the evaluation of the pcr assay.
the pcr results were initially used to optimise the cut-off value of the hyplex® tbc test system by means of a roc analysis.
compared to many other conventional naat assays, the hyplex® tbc pcr test is in a low price segment which makes it an attractive option for developing and emerging countries with high tb burdens.
