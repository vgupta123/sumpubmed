the mitogenomic data strongly supported monophyly of all families and subfamilies  and sister-group relationships of balistidae + monacanthidae and tetraodontidae + diodontidae, confirming the results of previous studies.
despite extensive studies based on both morphology and molecules, there has been no clear resolution except for monophyly of each family and sister-group relationships of diodontidae + tetraodontidae and balistidae + monacanthidae.
partitioned maximum likelihood  and bayesian analyses were performed on two data sets comprising concatenated nucleotide sequences from  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> transfer rna and two ribosomal rna genes .
this suggests that the basal split between the two clades led to subsequent radiation into the two different habitats.
however, we also found two unexpected basal splits into tetraodontoidei  and triacanthodoidei .
members of the order exhibit striking morphological diversity and radiated into various habitats such as freshwater, brackish and coastal waters, open seas, and deep waters along continental shelves and slopes.
it is likely that the basal split had involved ecological diversification, because most members of tetraodontoidei exclusively occur in shallow waters , while those of triacanthodoidei occur mainly in relatively deep waters along continental shelves and slopes except for more derived ostraciids.
to address phylogenetic questions of tetraodontiform fishes, we used whole mitochondrial genome  sequences from  <dig> selected species  that fully represent all families and subfamilies of tetraodontiformes .
