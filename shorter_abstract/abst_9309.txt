mutacin h-29b, produced by s. mutans strain 29b, was purified by successive hydrophobic chromatography from a liquid preparation consisting of cheese whey permeate  supplemented with yeast extract  and caco <dig> .
our results show that the amino acid sequence of mutacin h-29b is identical to the already known mutacin ii  over the first  <dig> residues.
edman degradation revealed  <dig> amino acids identical to those of mutacin ii .
s. mutans strains of widely different origins may thus produce very similar bacteriocins.
the molecular mass of the purified peptide was evaluated at  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  da by maldi-tof ms.
a simple procedure for production and purification of mutacins along with its characterization is presented.
