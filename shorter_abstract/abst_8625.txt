the lycophytes are an ancient lineage of vascular plants that diverged from the seed plant lineage about  <dig> myr ago.
based on cell flow cytometry, this species has the smallest genome size among the different lycophytes tested, including huperzia lucidula, diphaiastrum digita, isoetes engelmanii and s. kraussiana.
although the lycophytes occupy an important phylogenetic position for understanding the evolution of plants and their genomes, no genomic resources exist for this group of plants.
the arrayed bac library consists of  <dig> clones; the average insert size is estimated to be  <dig> kb.
the s. moellenforffii bac library, the first to be constructed from a lycophyte, will be useful to the scientific community as a resource for comparative plant genomics and evolution.
the bac library contains an estimated ten genome-equivalents based on dna hybridizations using five single-copy and two duplicated s. moellendorffii genes as probes.
