flux analysis methods lie at the core of metabolic engineering , providing methods for phenotype simulation that allow the determination of flux distributions under different conditions.
although many constraint-based modeling software tools have been developed and published, none provides a free user-friendly application that makes available the full portfolio of flux analysis methods.
the integration of cbfa within the optflux framework for me enables the utilization of different model formats and standards and the integration with complementary methods for phenotype simulation and visualization of results.
this work presents constraint-based flux analysis , an open-source software application for flux analysis in metabolic models that implements several methods for phenotype prediction, allowing users to define constraints associated with measured fluxes and/or flux ratios, together with environmental conditions  and reaction/gene knockouts.
