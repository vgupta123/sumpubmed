further, genes found to be sex-biased are associated with hormone biosynthesis, suggesting that sex steroid hormones may be key contributors to sexual behavioral plasticity seen in teleosts.
several of these genes are associated with steroid hormone biosynthesis.
we subsequently conducted systems level analyses by examining gene network dynamics between the sexes using weighted gene coexpression network analysis.
intriguingly, comparing intermodule dynamics between the sexes revealed only moderate preservation.
however, sex differences in gene expression profiles in the brains of vertebrates are only beginning to be understood.
fishes provide a unique complement to studies of sex differences in mammals and birds given that fish show extreme plasticity and lability of sexually dimorphic characters and behaviors during development and even adulthood.
the goal of this study is to identify neurotranscriptomic mechanisms for sex differences in the brain.
despite sex differences in a display of stress-related behaviors, basal transcript levels did not predict the intensity of the behavioral display.
in this study we examined whole-brain sex-biased gene expression through rna-sequencing across four strains of zebrafish.
despite differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior, there is limited sex-biased neural gene expression in zebrafish.
