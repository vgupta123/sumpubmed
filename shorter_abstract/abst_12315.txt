mhc class ii proteins bind oligopeptide fragments derived from proteolysis of pathogen antigens, presenting them at the cell surface for recognition by cd4+ t cells.
quite recently, the x-ray structure of the hla-dp <dig> molecule  in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr Î±-chain has been determined.
the predictive ability of the ds-qms was tested using a set of  <dig> known binders to hla-dp <dig>  originating from  <dig> proteins.
the sensitivities of the predictions at five different thresholds  were calculated and compared to the predictions made by the netmhcii and iedb servers.
human mhc class ii alleles are grouped into three loci: hla-dp, hla-dq and hla-dr. in contrast to hla-dr and hla-dq, hla-dp proteins have not been studied extensively, as they have been viewed as less important in immune responses than drs and dqs.
in the present study, we applied a validated molecular docking protocol to a library of  <dig> modelled peptide-dp <dig> complexes, seeking to assess the contribution made by each of the  <dig> naturally occurred amino acids at each of the nine binding core peptide positions and the four flanking residues .
apart from the leading role of anchor positions p <dig> and p <dig>  the binding to hla-dp <dig> depends on the preferences at p <dig>  no effect of the flanking residues was found on the peptide binding predictions to dp <dig>  although all four of them show strong preferences for particular amino acids.
they reveal the amino acid preferences at each of the  <dig> positions considered in the study.
the free binding energies  derived from the docking experiments were normalized on a position-dependent  and on an overall basis , and two docking score-based quantitative matrices  were derived: qmnpp and qmnap.
the molecular docking protocol, as applied to a combinatorial library of peptides, models the peptide-hla-dp <dig> protein interaction effectively, generating reliable predictions in a quantitative assessment.
