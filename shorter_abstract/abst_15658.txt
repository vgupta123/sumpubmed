the assembled illumina sequence permitted not only the correction of omissions found in gc homopolymers in the pacbio assembly  but it also allowed us to obtain the sequences of the termini of the chromosome and of a linear plasmid that were not assembled by pacbio.
streptomyces leeuwenhoekii  was isolated from the hyper-arid high-altitude atacama desert in chile and shown to produce novel polyketide antibiotics.
we identified the biosynthetic gene clusters for chaxamycin, chaxalactin, hygromycin a and desferrioxamine e, metabolites all previously shown to be produced by this strain  and an additional  <dig> putative gene clusters for specialised metabolites.
as well as gene clusters for polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, we also identified three gene clusters encoding novel lasso-peptides.
the s. leeuwenhoekii genome contains  <dig> gene clusters apparently encoding the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites, most of them completely novel and uncharacterised.
this approach also allows rapid insights into the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms isolated from unexploited habitats and ecosystems, which in many cases may prove difficult to culture and manipulate in the laboratory.
