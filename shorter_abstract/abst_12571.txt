approximately one-half of the genes were found to be always expressed, including more than  <dig> predicted conserved hypotheticals, in the genome of m. tuberculosis during the log phase of in vitro growth.
however, the full potential of genome-wide microarray analysis in configuring interrelationships among all genes in m. tuberculosis has yet to be realized.
broad patterns derived from genome-wide expression experiments in this study have provided insight into the interrelationships among genes in the basic cellular processes of m. tuberculosis.
the gene expression profiles were analyzed and visualized through cluster analysis to epitomize the full details of genomic behavior.
our results have confirmed several known gene clusters in energy production, information pathways, and lipid metabolism, and also hinted at potential roles of hypothetical and regulatory proteins.
with the completion of the genome sequence of the etiologic bacterium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, it is now feasible to search for new drug targets by sieving through a large number of gene products and conduct genome-scale experiments based on microarray technology.
