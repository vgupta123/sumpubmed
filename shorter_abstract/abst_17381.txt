optical biosensor provides an alternative readout for examining receptor activation under physiologically relevant conditions, and differentiates the signaling of endogenous par <dig> and par <dig> in a <dig>
the biosensor directly measures dynamic mass redistribution  resulted from ligand-induced receptor activation in adherent cells.
furthermore, both trypsin- and thrombin-induced ca2+ flux signals show almost identical dependence on cell surface cholesterol level, but their corresponding dmr signals present different sensitivities.
in a <dig>  both par <dig> and par <dig> agonists, but neither par <dig> nor par <dig> agonists, trigger dose-dependent ca2+ mobilization as well as gq-type dmr signals.
many types of cells express several pars, whose physiological significance is mostly unknown.
here, we show that non-invasive resonant waveguide grating  biosensor differentiates signaling of endogenous protease activated receptor subtype  <dig>  and  <dig>  in human epidermoid carcinoma a <dig> cells.
both ca2+ flux and dmr signals display comparable desensitization patterns upon repeated stimulation with different combinations of agonists.
however, par <dig> and par <dig> exhibit distinct kinetics of receptor re-sensitization.
