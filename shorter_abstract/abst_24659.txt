cysbgn adds support for cytoscape users to visualize any of the three complementary sbgn languages: process description, entity relationship, and activity flow.
the plug-in was tested using a suite of  <dig> different test cases that covers almost all possible entities, shapes, and connections.
the interoperability with other tools  was also established allowing an automated generation of sbgn diagrams based on previously imported sbml models.
we have developed cysbgn, a cytoscape plug-in that extends the use of cytoscape visualisation and analysis features to sbgn maps.
however, support for sbgn in cytoscape, one of the most widely used platforms in biology to visualise and analyse networks, is limited, and in particular it is not possible to import sbgn diagrams.
cysbgn imports, modifies and analyzes sbgn diagrams in cytoscape, and thus allows the application of the large palette of tools and plug-ins in this platform to networks and pathways in sbgn format.
a standard graphical notation is essential to facilitate exchange of network representations of biological processes.
