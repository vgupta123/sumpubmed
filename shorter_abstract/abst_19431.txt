furthermore, the discovery of icesppn <dig> demonstrates the dynamic variability of pneumococcal genetic elements and is contrasted with the evidence for tn <dig> stability.
two tn916-like, tet-containing, elements were identified among pneumococci dated  <dig> and  <dig>  the former element was highly similar to that of the pmen <dig> multidrug-resistant, globally-distributed pneumococcal reference strain, which was isolated in  <dig>  the latter element was associated with a streptococcal phage.
antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci has greatly increased over the past two to three decades.

a third, novel genetic element, designated icesppn <dig>  was identified in the genome of an isolate dated  <dig>  icesppn <dig> contained a region of similarity to tn <dig>  a region of similarity to a pneumococcal pathogenicity island and novel lantibiotic synthesis/export-associated genes.
