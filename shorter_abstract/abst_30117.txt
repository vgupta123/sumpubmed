during gene expression analysis by serial analysis of gene expression , duplicate ditags are routinely removed from the data analysis, because they are suspected to stem from artifacts during sage library construction.
this may also be the case for other longsage datasets already present in databases.
the removal of all duplicate ditags was unfounded for the datasets analyzed and led to large errors.
on the contrary, while the error introduced in original sage by removal of naturally occurring duplicate ditags is insignificant, it leads to an error of up to  <dig> fold in longsage.
however, the algorithm developed for the analysis of duplicate ditags was able to identify individual artifact ditags that originated from rare nucleotide variations of tags and vector contamination.
as a consequence, naturally occurring duplicate ditags are also removed from the analysis leading to an error of measurement.
analysis of a pancreatic acinar cell longsage library showed no sign of a general amplification bias that justified the removal of all duplicate ditags.
extending the analysis to  <dig> additional longsage libraries showed no justification for removal of all duplicate ditags either.
