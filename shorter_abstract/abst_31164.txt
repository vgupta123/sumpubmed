understanding the adaptive evolution of hsf genes in the grass family will provide potentially useful information for the genetic improvement of modern crops to handle increasing global temperatures.
in this work, we performed a genome-wide survey of hsf genes in  <dig> grass species, including rice, maize, sorghum, setaria, and brachypodium, by describing their phylogenetic relationships, adaptive evolution, and expression patterns under abiotic stresses.
the hsf genes in grasses were divided into  <dig> orthologous gene clusters  based on phylogeneitc relationship and synteny, suggesting that  <dig> hsf genes were present in the ancestral grass genome.
we also investigated the expression patterns of rice and maize hsf genes under heat, salt, drought, and cold stresses.
this study demonstrates that neofunctionalization by changes in expression pattern and function following gene duplication has been an important factor in the maintenance and divergence of grass hsf genes.
the results revealed divergent expression patterns between the duplicated genes.

a maximum-likelihood analysis revealed the effects of positive selection in the evolution of  <dig> ogcs and suggested that ogcs with duplicated or lost genes were more readily influenced by positive selection than other ogcs.
further investigation revealed that positive selection acted on only one of the duplicated genes in  <dig> of  <dig> paralogous pairs, suggesting that neofunctionalization contributed to the evolution of these duplicated pairs.
