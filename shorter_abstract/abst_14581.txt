in this work we assayed the capacity of junin z protein to produce vlps carrying the green fluorescent protein , as a model antigen.
budding induction and vesicle formation properties can be exploited to generate enveloped vlps platform.
in these vlps, z protein is associated to the plasma membrane inner surface by its myristoyl residue.
in this report the junin z protein ability to produce vlps from 293t cells and its capacity to deliver a specific antigen  fused to z was evaluated.
it was proved that vlps can be generated from cells transfected with a fusion junin virus z-egfp protein in absence of any other viral protein, and the capacity of z protein to support fusions at the c-terminal, without impairing its budding activity, allowing vehiculization of specific antigens into vlps.
vaccines based on vlps are a highly effective type of subunit vaccines that mimic the overall structure of virus particles in absence of viral nucleic acid, being noninfectious.
confocal microscopy showed a particular membrane bending in cells expressing z and a spot welded distribution in the cytoplasm.
