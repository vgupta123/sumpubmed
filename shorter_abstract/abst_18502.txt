postpartum endometritis in cattle is a multifactorial disease with high economic impact.
the corresponding combinations of sensitivity and specificity of the determined predictor cut points were not satisfactory for practical use.
at wk - <dig>  at wk + <dig>  and at wk + <dig> relative to calving, are unsatisfactory for disease prediction.
results from in vitro studies led to the implication that non-esterified fatty acids , beta-hydroxybutyric acid , bilirubin, and urea could be used as predictors for endometritis in veterinary practice.
in this field study, we set out to establish optimal predictor cut points of these metabolic parameters for the detection of ce and sce.
further research is required to clarify the questions raised by the current study.
both, clinical endometritis  and subclinical endometritis  result in decreased reproductive performance.
