the fitting by the mibs model was clearly superior and indicated that complete activity is observed at a one metal to one protein ratio.
considering different scenarios of metap activation by one or two metal ions, it is concluded that e. coli metap is fully active as a monometalated enzyme.
e. coli metap was shown to be fully active with one equivalent of metal by graphical analysis, but it was inferred to require at least two metals by a hill equation model.
because of diverging results with significant implications in drug discovery, the experimental titration curve for co2+ activating metap was analyzed by fitting with a multiple independent binding sites  model, and the quality of the fitting was compared to that of the hill equation.
herein, we report a mathematical model and detailed analysis of the stoichiometric activation of metap by metal cofactors.
the shape of the titration curve was also examined for activation of metalloenzymes in general by one or two metals.
