furthermore  <dig> neonates were co-infected with c. sakazakii from two different genotype clusters.
it also indicated that c. sakazakii isolates from different genotype clusters have the ability to co-infect neonates.
cronobacter sakazakii is a member of the genus cronobacter that has frequently been isolated from powdered infant formula  and linked with rare but fatal neonatal infections such as meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis.
whole genome sequencing data was generated for  <dig> c. sakazakii isolates on the illumina miseq platform.
the whole genome phylogeny suggested  <dig> distant clusters of c. sakazakii isolates were associated with the outbreak.
the genomic investigation revealed the outbreak consisted of an heterogeneous population of c. sakazakii isolates.
the present study used whole genome sequencing data of  <dig> isolates obtained from this outbreak to reveal their relatedness.
this study is first of its kind to use whole genome sequencing data to analyse a cronobacter outbreak.
the whole genome phylogeny was determined using mugsy and raxml.
snp calls were determined using smalt and samtools, and filtered using vcftools.

snp typing and phylogeny indicate the source of the c. sakazakii could have been from extrinsic contamination of reconstituted infant formula from the nicu environment and personnel.
the cronobacter mlst scheme has reported over  <dig> sequence types and  <dig> clonal complexes; however c. sakazakii clonal complex  <dig>  has been linked strongly with neonatal infections, especially meningitis.
the largest outbreak of c. sakazakii was in a neonatal intensive care unit  in france  that lasted over  <dig> months and claimed the lives of three neonates.
