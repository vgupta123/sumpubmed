remarkably, we observed that the identified cell cycle specific common network played an important role in replicative senescence as a key regulator.
as a result, it was confirmed that the difference of average perturbation scores of common networks at both two time points could explain the phenotypic alteration.
cellular senescence irreversibly arrests growth of human diploid cells.
it is necessary to reveal the genotypic mechanism inferred by affected genes and their interaction underlying the senescence process.
then, the selected genes were integrated with protein-protein interactions to construct time point specific network.
we also performed functional enrichment on the common network and identified high association with phenotypic alteration.
we suggested a novel computational approach to identify an integrative network which profiles an underlying genotypic signature from time-series gene expression data.
from these constructed networks, the conserved edges across time point were extracted for the common network and statistical test was performed to demonstrate that the network could explain the phenotypic alteration.
the relatively perturbed genes were selected for each time point based on the proposed scoring measure denominated as perturbation scores.
heretofore, the network analysis from time series gene expression data has been focused on what topological structure was changed over time point.
conversely, we focused on the conserved structure but its context was changed in course of time and showed it was available to explain the phenotypic changes.
