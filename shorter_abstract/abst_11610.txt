the precise timing of flowering is fundamental to successful reproduction, and has dramatic significance for crop yields.
quantitative real-time pcr analysis revealed that transcript levels of flower repressor flowering locus c , and fd decreased significantly in transgenic arabidopsis compared with wild-type col- <dig>  while the expression of vernalization insensitive  <dig>  and flowering locus t  noticeably increased.
glyma11g <dig> expression was higher in leaves and pods than in shoot apexes and stems.
although prolonged low temperatures are not required for flowering induction in soybean, vernalization pathway genes have been retained during the evolution of this species.
glyma11g <dig>  which is responsive to photoperiod and low temperature in soybean, may participate in the vernalization pathway in arabidopsis and help regulate flowering time.
our results suggest that glyma11g <dig>  a homolog of arabidopsis vrn <dig>  is a functional protein.
we were able to detect the expression of glyma11g <dig> in different organs at all monitored developmental stages in soybean.
over-expression of glyma11g <dig> in an arabidopsis columbia- <dig>  background resulted in early flowering.
