to search for novel targets that affect brain aβ without causing toxicity, we screened mouse brain samples from  <dig> novel gene knock-out  strains, representing  <dig> genes, using aβ elisa assays.
however, significantly increased aβ was observed in brain samples from two ko strains, corresponding to genes encoding the glycosylphosphatidylinositol mannosyl transferase pigz and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase .
thus, gene ablations that are permissive for mouse survival and that also have a robust effect on aβ levels in the brain are rare.
although robust aβ lowering was readily apparent in brains from a bace <dig> ko strain, none of the novel strains exhibited robust decreases in brain aβ, including a gpr <dig> ko strain, which had previously been proposed as an aβ target.
