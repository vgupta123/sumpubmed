correctly identifying genomic regions enriched with histone modifications and transcription factors is key to understanding their regulatory and developmental roles.
the output from the programs was compared to qpcr-validated enriched and depleted sites, predicted transcription factor binding sites, and highly-transcribed gene bodies.
conceptually, these regions are divided into two categories, narrow peaks and broad domains, and different algorithms are used to identify each one.
