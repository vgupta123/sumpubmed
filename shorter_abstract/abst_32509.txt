in addition, using artificial data sets we identified that a minimal probe set size of  <dig> is necessary for reliable statistical summarization.
redefinitions introduce probe sets whose sizes may not support reliable statistical summarization; therefore, we advocate using our transcript-level mapping redefinition in a secondary analysis step rather than as a replacement.
we conclude that our transcript-level reannotation and redefinition of probe sets complement the original affymetrix design.
knowing which specific transcripts are differentially expressed is important to properly design probe/primer pairs for validation purposes.
for convenience, we have created custom chip-description-files  and annotation files for our new probe set definitions that are compatible with bioconductor, affymetrix expression console or third party software.
we further demonstrate that applying the new probe set definition can detect specific transcript variants contributing to differential expression and it also improves cross-platform concordance.
based on this transcript-level annotation, a new probe set definition was created in which every probe in a probe set maps to a common set of aceview gene transcripts.
shortfalls in the original affymetrix probe annotation have been described; however, few studies have provided rigorous solutions for routine data analysis.
