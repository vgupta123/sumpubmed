xylan is a major component of plant cells and the most abundant hemicellulose.
the xyna gene from t. fusca yx was successfully cloned and expressed using p. pastoris x- <dig>  we produced a recombinant native form of the protein  and a c-terminal his-tagged form of the desired protein 6).
the purpose of our study was to clone and express the endoxylanase gene xyna of thermobifida fusca yx in its native form and with a c-terminal histidine  tag in pichia pastoris x- <dig>  we analyzed and compared these two forms of the protein and examined their potential applications in various industries.
the products of beechwood xylan hydrolyzed by both xylanases included xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose and xylopentaose.
they exhibited similar ph stability, while rxyn11a exhibited better thermostability; n-glycosylation enhanced the thermostability of both recombinant xylanases.
the specific activity of rxyn11a was 8% higher than that of rxyn11a- <dig>  both recombinant xylanases were optimally active at 80°c and ph  <dig> , and exhibited greater than 60% activity between ph 6– <dig> and 60–80°c.
the thermostability of both recombinant xylanases was enhanced by n-glycosylation.
the c-terminal his tag had adverse effects when added to the xyn11a protein.
xylanases degrade xylan into monomers by randomly cleaving β- <dig> -glycosidic bonds in the xylan backbone, and have widespread potential applications in various industries.
