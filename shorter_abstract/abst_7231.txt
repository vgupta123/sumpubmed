these data reveal how pks module and domain differences affecting mlsb correlate with the production of mycolactones e and f. for mycolactone e these differences from mlsb in m. ulcerans agy <dig> include replacement of the at domain of the loading module  and the absence of an entire extension module.
we report here comparative genomic analysis of pmum <dig>  the complete dna sequence of a  <dig> kb megaplasmid  from mycobacterium liflandii 128fxt and partial sequence of two additional pmum replicons, combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric  analysis.
this work has shed light on the evolution of mycolactone biosynthesis among an unusual group of mycobacteria and highlights the potential of the mls locus to become a toolbox for combinatorial pks biochemistry.
the mycolactone pks locus on pmum <dig> revealed the same large, three-gene structure and extraordinary pattern of near-identical pks domain sequence repetition as observed in pmum <dig> with greater than  <dig> % nucleotide identity among domains of the same function.
for mycolactone f there is also a reduction of one extension module but also a swap of ketoreductase domains that explains the characteristic stereochemistry of the two terminal side-chain hydroxyls, an arrangement unique to mycolactone f
