patients with mtle showed decreases of iron levels in the subcortical structures such as substantia nigra, red nucleus, and basal ganglia.
our swi findings suggest a redistribution of iron between subcortical and cortical structures in mtle.
investigation on brain iron redistribution offers new insights into the pathogenesis of mtle, and may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the clinical progression of epilepsy.
this study aims to demonstrate whole-brain iron alterations and its clinical relevancies in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy  in vivo, using susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging .

moreover, cortical and basal ganglia iron levels were related to clinical variables including epilepsy duration, age at seizures onset, and histories of precipitating factors.
brain iron concentration was quantified using swi phase values.
