taken together our analyses suggest a novel role for taf <dig> in repression and derepression of stress induced genes, most probably as part of a regulatory network which includes cyc8-tup <dig>  srb <dig> and histone modifying enzymes.
in this report we survey published genome-wide transcriptome and occupancy data to define regulatory properties associated with taf14-dependent genes.
regulation of gene transcription in response to stress is central to a cellâ€™s ability to cope with environmental challenges.
we show that taf14-repressed genes tend to be extensively regulated, positively by saga complex and the stress dependent activators, msn2/ <dig> and negatively by a wide number of repressors that act upon promoter chromatin and tbp.
our transcriptome analysis reveals that stress related, tata-containing and saga-dependent genes were much more affected by taf <dig> deletion than were tfiid-dependent genes.
taf <dig> is a yeats domain protein in s.cerevisiae that physically associates with several transcriptionally relevant multisubunit complexes including the general transcription factors tfiid and tfiif and the chromatin-modifying complexes swi/snf, ino <dig>  rsc and nua <dig>  taf <dig> deletion strains are sensitive to a variety of stresses suggesting that it plays a role in the transcriptional stress response.
