the package contributes to the cytometry community by offering an efficient, automated analysis platform which facilitates the active, ongoing technological advancement.
flowclust implements a robust model-based clustering approach based on multivariate t mixture models with the box-cox transformation.
nevertheless, there is an increasing concern about the lack of appropriate software tools to provide an automated analysis platform to parallelize the high-throughput data-generation platform.
as a high-throughput technology that offers rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells, flow cytometry  is widely used in health research, medical diagnosis and treatment, and vaccine development.
it offers various tools to summarize and visualize a wealth of features of the clustering results.
it tends to give reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in fcm analysis.
currently, to a large extent, fcm data analysis relies on the manual selection of sequential regions in 2-d graphical projections to extract the cell populations of interest.
the package provides the functionality to identify cell populations whilst simultaneously handling the commonly encountered issues of outlier identification and data transformation.
in addition, to ensure its convenience of use, flowclust has been adapted for the current fcm data format, and integrated with existing bioconductor packages dedicated to fcm analysis.
in view of the aforementioned issues, we have developed an r package called flowclust to automate fcm analysis.
flowclust addresses the issue of a dearth of software that helps automate fcm analysis with a sound theoretical foundation.
this is a time-consuming task that ignores the high-dimensionality of fcm data.
