hepatic glycogen was decreased due to a decrease in synthesis, and plasma triglycerides were decreased due to an increase in fatty acid uptake by the liver.
hepatic succinate was increased and this was associated with increased heme biosynthesis.
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry demonstrated a remodeling of lipid species, possibly resulting from proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
the data fusion of metabolomic and transcriptomic changes proved to be a highly sensitive approach for monitoring early stage changes in altered hepatic metabolism, oxidative stress and cytochrome p <dig> induction simultaneously.
non-genotoxic carcinogens are notoriously difficult to identify as they do not damage dna directly and have diverse modes of action, necessitating long term in vivo studies.
glutathione synthesis was also increased, presumably in response to oxidative stress.
