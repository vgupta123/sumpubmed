the discrepancy observed in the number of putative pcwdes between transcriptome and proteome analyses could be partially explained by differences in transcriptional level.
here, we combined a proteomics approach and transcriptome sequencing to identify pcwdes present in larval gut contents of the mustard leaf beetle, phaedon cochleariae.
the primary plant cell wall is a complex mixture of polysaccharides and proteins encasing living plant cells.
using a two-dimensional proteomics approach, we recovered  <dig> protein bands, isolated using activity assays targeting cellulose-, pectin- and xylan-degrading enzymes.
our data represent the starting point of an in-depth functional and evolutionary characterization of pcwde gene families in phytophagous beetles and their contribution to the adaptation of these highly successful herbivores to their host plants.
a growing body of evidence suggests that phytophagous beetles, mainly species from the superfamilies chrysomeloidea and curculionoidea, possess endogenous genes encoding complex and diverse families of so-called plant cell wall degrading enzymes .
all of these were specifically expressed in the insect gut rather than the rest of the body, and in adults as well as larvae.
the presence of these genes in phytophagous beetles may have been a key element in their success as herbivores.
after mass spectrometry analyses, a total of  <dig> proteins putatively responsible for degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides were identified; these proteins belong to three glycoside hydrolase  families: gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and gh <dig> .
