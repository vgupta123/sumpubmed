a tool such as ours can serve to explore the reticulated dimensionality of molecular evolution, by dissecting vertical and lateral inheritance at high resolution.
indeed, even when the true history is a mixture of vertical descent for some genes and lateral gene transfer  for others, such methods produce unique topologies.
this evidence is then displayed as a synthesis showing support over the tree for vertical inheritance, overlaid with explicit lateral gene transfer  events inferred to have occurred over the history of the tree.
we assert that our tools will facilitate the comparison of phylogenetic trees, and the interpretation of conflicting data.
when organismal phylogenies based on sequences of single marker genes are poorly resolved, a logical approach is to add more markers, on the assumption that weak but congruent phylogenetic signal will be reinforced in such multigene trees.
we have developed software that aims to extract evidence for vertical and lateral inheritance from a set of gene trees compared against an arbitrary reference tree.
