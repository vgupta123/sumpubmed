we found that 5-ht signaling in c. elegans facilitates efficient exploitation in complex environments by mediating a rapid response upon encountering food.
our results implicate 5-ht in a novel form of decision-making, demonstrate its fitness consequences, suggest that nsm and adf act in concert to modulate locomotion in complex environments, and identify the synergistic action of a channel and a metabotropic receptor in accelerating c. elegans decision-making.
the serotonin-gated chloride channel mod- <dig> and the ortholog of mammalian 5-ht <dig> metabotropic serotonin receptors ser- <dig> acted in synergy to accelerate decision-making.
in contrast, the onset of responses of adf serotonergic neurons preceded the physical encounter with the food.
fast responses can provide a competitive advantage when resources are inhomogeneously distributed.
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans was shown to modulate locomotion on a lawn of bacterial food in serotonin -dependent manners.
the relevance of responding rapidly was demonstrated in patchy environments, where the absence of 5-ht signaling was detrimental to exploitation.

physiological imaging revealed that the nsm serotonergic neurons responded acutely upon encounter with newly discovered food and were key to rapid responses.
