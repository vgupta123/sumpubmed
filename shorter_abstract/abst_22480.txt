using stochastic simulations we show that throughout the parameter range, selection favors fad over uniform dispersal .
we show that fad evolves under a very wide parameter range, regardless of its effects on the population mean fitness.
we predict that individuals of low quality will have an increased tendency for dispersal, even when the environment is homogeneous, there is no direct competition with neighbors, and dispersal carries significant costs.
previous theoretical studies have shown that condition-dependent dispersal may evolve as a means to move to a different environment when environments are heterogeneous in space or in time.

dispersal is a major factor in ecological and evolutionary dynamics.
