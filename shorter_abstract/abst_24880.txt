a subset of these two categories was checked using pcr amplification, and 86% of the tested clusters were validated.
this study identified a large number of genes that are expressed during h. annuus/p.
this work therefore provides valuable tools for further discoveries regarding the h. annuus/p.
using a  <dig> sequencing method, expressed sequence tags  during the interaction between h. annuus and p. halstedii have been generated and a search was performed for sites in putative effectors to show polymorphisms between the different races of p. halstedii.
snps discovered in crn effector sequences were used to determine the genetic distances between the four races of p. halstedii.
downy mildew in sunflowers  is caused by the oomycete plasmopara halstedii  berlese et de toni.
despite efforts by the international community to breed mildew-resistant varieties, downy mildew remains a major threat to the sunflower crop.
it also reveals, for the first time, that an infection mechanism exists in p. halstedii similar to that in other oomycetes associated with the presence of putative rxlr and crn effectors.
a  <dig> pyrosequencing run of two infected sunflower samples  generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  useable reads.
twenty putative rxlr and crn effectors were detected using psi-blast.
