this study was conducted to  <dig>  analyze genes differentially expressed between preadipocytes treated with an adipogenic cocktail  containing  <dig> nm dexamethasone,  <dig>  mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 20 μg/ml insulin and 300 μm oleic acid  and control cells and  <dig>  analyze genes differentially expressed between preadipocytes treated with dmioa and those treated with dmioa +  <dig> using affymetrix genechip® chicken genome arrays.
genes over-expressed in control cells compared to those treated with dmioa include those involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction , cellular assembly and organization , and cell cycle .
genes over-expressed in dmioa compared to control cells include those involved in cellular development , lipid metabolism , and molecular transport .
genes over-expressed in cells treated with dmioa compared with those treated with dmioa+ <dig> include those involved in lipid metabolism , molecular transport , and vitamin and mineral metabolism .
the role of this oxysterol and molecular mechanisms underlying the adipogenesis of preadipocytes from laying hens have not been investigated.
genes over-expressed in cells treated with dmioa+ <dig> compared with those treated with dmioa include those involved in cellular growth and proliferation , cellular development , and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction .
in experiment one, where we compared the gene expression profile of non-treated  cells with those treated with dmioa, out of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were over-expressed in control cells, and  <dig> were over-expressed in cells treated with dmioa.
