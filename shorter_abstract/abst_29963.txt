we expressed  <dig> arabidopsis e2s including six enzymes that have not been previously expressed, and  <dig> ring proteins, most of which had not been functionally characterised.
the wheat germ cell-free system used in our study, which is a eukaryotic expression system and more closely resembles the endogenous expression of plant proteins, is very suitable for expressing arabidopsis e2s and ring e3s in their functional form.
in expression assays of ring proteins,  <dig> proteins showed high molecular smears, which are probably the result of their functional activity.
the activities of another  <dig> ring proteins were evaluated with atubc <dig> and/or a group of different e2s.
protein ubiquitination is a ubiquitous mechanism in eukaryotes.
using the riken arabidopsis full-length cdna library  with the ‘split-primer’ pcr method and a wheat germ cell-free system, we established protein libraries of arabidopsis e <dig> and ring e <dig> enzymes.
in addition, the protein libraries described here can be used for further understanding e2-e <dig> specificities and as platforms for protein-protein interaction screening.

thioester assays using dithiothreitol  showed dtt-sensitive ubiquitin thioester formation for all e2s expressed.
in addition, several e2s, which might be necessary for the activity of certain e <dig> ligases, connot be expressed by escherichia coli or cultured insect cells and, therefore, remain uncharacterised.
all the  <dig> ring e3s tested showed ubiquitin ligase activity, including  <dig> ring e3s.
a large proportion of the ring e3’s gene products have yet to be characterised in vitro, likely because of the laborious work involved in large-scale cdna cloning and protein expression, purification, and characterisation.
