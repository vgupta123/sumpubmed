at the time of the initiation of cluster ripening , underripe green berries have higher seed content compared to the riper berries and there is a negative correlation between the seed weight-to-berry weight ratio  and the sugar level in berries of a cluster.
in contrast, in low-sb berries, concomitant with an earlier decrease of auxin level, the features of ripening initiation, such as increases in aba and sugar accumulation begin earlier.
individual berries in a grape  cluster enter the ripening phase at different times leading to an asynchronous cluster in terms of ripening.
auxin levels in seeds relative to the pericarp tissues are two to  <dig> times higher at pre-ripening stages.
this results in higher auxin-signaling activity that lasts longer in the pericarp of high-sb berries.
because the influence via hormonal communication of the seed on fruit set and growth is well known across fruit species, differences in berry seed content and resultant quantitative or qualitative differences in the hormone signals to the pericarp likely influence the relative timing of ripening initiation among berries of the cluster.
differences in the relative seed content among berries plays a major role in the timing of ripening initiation.
towards the end of berry maturation phase, low and high levels of auxin are observed in the pericarp of low- and high-sb berries, respectively.
in the prevéraison cluster, the expression of auxin-response factor genes was significantly higher in the pericarp of high-sb berries and remained higher until véraison compared to low-sb berries.
on the other hand, in low-sb berries, the expression of aba-biosynthetic and aba-inducible nced and myb genes was higher even two weeks before véraison.
the expression level of auxin-biosynthetic genes in the pericarp was the same between both berry groups based upon similar expression activity of yuc genes that are rate-limiting factors in auxin biosynthesis.
