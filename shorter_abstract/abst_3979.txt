base coverage among specimens and within targets in each species library was uniform, and the performance of targets among independent exon captures was highly reproducible.
our study demonstrates the potential of a transcriptome-enabled, multiplexed, exon capture method to create thousands of informative markers for population genomic and phylogenetic studies in non-model species across the tree of life.

final assemblies yielded over ten thousand orthologous loci  with thousands of fixed and polymorphic snps among species identified.
we evaluated the performance of our approach across specimens from four chipmunk species.
there was no decrease in coverage among chipmunk species, which showed up to  <dig> % sequence divergence in coding regions.
