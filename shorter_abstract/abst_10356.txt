our results are most parsimonious with the scenario where the lce3bc deletion has evolved under balancing selection in humans.
here, we show that the haplotype block that harbors the deletion  retains high allele frequency among extant and ancient human populations;  harbors unusually high nucleotide variation ;  contains an excess of intermediate frequency variants ; and  has an unusually long time to coalescence to the most recent common ancestor .
a common, 32kb deletion of lce3b and lce3c genes is strongly associated with psoriasis.
however, it was not clear why negative selection has not removed this deletion from the population.
