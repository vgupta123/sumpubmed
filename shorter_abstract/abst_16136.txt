we test these models using the largest of the species rich plant groups that characterise the botanically diverse cape floristic region : the genus erica l. we generate a novel phylogenetic hypothesis informed by nuclear and plastid dna sequences of c. 60 % of the c.  <dig> erica species , and use this to estimate clade ages , net diversification rates , and shifts in rates of diversification in different areas .
the diversity of erica species in the cfr is the result of a single radiation within the last c.  <dig> million years.
compared to ancestral lineages in the palearctic, the rate of speciation accelerated across africa and madagascar, with a further burst of speciation within the cfr that also exceeds the net diversification rates of other cape clades.
erica exemplifies the “hotbed” model of assemblage through recent speciation, implying that with the advent of the modern cape a multitude of new niches opened and were successively occupied through local species diversification.
