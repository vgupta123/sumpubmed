recent studies indicate that mirnas are key regulators of intestinal development and their aberrant expression leads to intestinal malignancy.
in this study, we have applied a straight forward approach to decipher the porcine intestinal mirnaome for the first time in mammals using a piglet model.
the high number of identified novel mirnas in the porcine intestine points out their crucial role in intestinal function as shown by pathway analysis.
the identified hairpin forming precursors were in part organized in genomic clusters, and most of the precursors were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
here, we present the identification of hundreds of apparently novel mirnas in the porcine intestine.
second, the porcine mirnaome along the entire intestine  was unraveled using customized mirna microarrays based on the identified sequences as well as known porcine and human ones.
in total, the expression of  <dig> intestinal mirnas was discovered, of which  <dig> represented assumed novel porcine mirnas.
