the qrt-pcr results revealed that wheat gapdhs were involved in several abiotic stress response.
expression analysis implied that gapdhs play roles in plants abiotic stress tolerance.
a total of  <dig> gapdh genes were identified in wheat cv.
chinese spring; the phylogenetic and structure analysis showed that these gapdh genes could be divided into four distinct subfamilies.
the expression profiles of gapdh genes showed tissue specificity all over plant development stages.
wheat carried  <dig> gapdh genes, representing four types of plant gapdhs .
whole genome duplication and segmental duplication might account for the expansion of wheat gapdhs.
