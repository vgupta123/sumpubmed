computational analysis of the regulatory regions of species-specific and -divergent responses suggests that dioxin response elements  are involved.
in order to further investigate the species-specific responses elicited by tcdd, temporal gene expression responses in human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie cells were compared.
microarray analysis identified a core set of conserved gene expression responses across species consistent with the role of ahr in mediating adaptive metabolic responses.
these results are consistent with in vivo rat vs. mouse species-specific differential gene expression, and more comprehensive comparative dre searches.
comparative analysis of human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie tcdd-elicited gene expression responses is consistent with in vivo rat-mouse comparative gene expression studies, and more comprehensive comparative dre searches, suggesting that ahr-mediated gene expression is species-specific.
current risk assessment practices routinely extrapolate results from in vivo and in vitro rodent models to assess human risk.
<dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is an environmental contaminant that elicits a broad spectrum of toxic effects in a species-specific manner.
however, significant species-specific as well as species-divergent responses were identified.
