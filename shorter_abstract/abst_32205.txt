livestock belonging to ethnic groups which traditionally stay near surface water, and which were reported to feed near lake chad, have a high risk of infection with f. gigantica.
however, further economic analysis is needed.
mobile pastoralists perceive liver parasites as a significant problem and think that proximity to lake chad can lead to infection.
this study aimed to assess the importance of liver fluke infections in mobile pastoralistsâ€™ livestock in the south-eastern lake chad region.
in  <dig>  all animals presented at three slaughter slabs near gredaya in the south-eastern lake chad area were examined for infection with fasciola spp.
animals grazing close to the shores of lake chad had a much higher risk of infection  than animals not feeding at the lake , with only one goat being positive .
geospatial distribution showed that animals originating from areas close to the lake were more likely to be infected with f. gigantica than those from more distant areas.
the ethnic group of the owner was a strong determinant for the risk of infection.
ethnic group likely served as a proxy for husbandry practices.
fasciolosis has been described in sub-saharan africa in many accounts, but the latest reports from chad are from the 1970s.
