in this paper, we investigate several existing measures for how well an rna sequence folds, and compare the behaviour of these measures over a large range of rfam ncrna families.
in the last few decades there has been a great deal of discussion concerning whether or not noncoding rna sequences  fold in a more well-defined manner than random sequences.
our analysis shows that ncrnas, but not mrnas, in general have lower minimal free energy  than random sequences with the same dinucleotide frequency.
moreover, even when the mfe is significant, many ncrnas appear to not have a unique fold, but rather several alternative folds, at least when folded in silico.
due to the correlations between the different measures we find that it is sufficient to use only two of them in rna folding studies, one to test if the sequence in question has lower energy than a random sequence with the same dinucleotide frequency  and the other to see if the sequence has a unique fold .
