a comparison of these ir events to the tair annotation and a large set of short-read rna-seq data showed that  <dig> of the predicted ir events are novel and that  <dig> events  overlap with either the tair annotation or the ir events inferred from the rna-seq data.
the method was applied in a genome-wide screen which resulted in the discovery of  <dig>  ir events.
analyzing a large collection of publicly available microarray and sequence data for the model plant a. thaliana, we demonstrated that our method is more accurate than existing approaches.
among the microarray platforms facilitating the discovery of as events, tiling arrays are well-suited for identifying intron retention, the most prevalent type of as in plants.
in this work, we present a novel method to detect intron retentions  and exon skips  from tiling arrays.
existing est and cdna sequences served for supervised training and evaluation.
since all predicted as events can be precisely attributed to experimental conditions, our work provides a basis for follow-up studies focused on the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying tissue-specific and stress-dependent as in plants.
due to the physiological importance of as, a complete inventory of as is of great interest.
while statistical tests have typically been proposed for this purpose, our method instead utilizes support vector machines  which are appreciated for their accuracy and robustness to noise.
however, analyzing tiling array data is challenging, because of high noise levels and limited probe coverage.
