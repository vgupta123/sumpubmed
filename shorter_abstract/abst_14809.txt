moreover, preventing autophagy in pex4- <dig> did not restore pex <dig> levels at high temperature.
in contrast, mg <dig> treatment increased pex <dig> levels, implicating the proteasome in degrading pex <dig>  especially at high temperature.
our results support the hypothesis that efficient retrotranslocation of pex <dig> after cargo delivery is needed not only to make pex <dig> available for further rounds of cargo delivery, but also to prevent the peroxisome dysfunction that results from pex <dig> lingering in the peroxisomal membrane.
we surveyed the impact of growth temperature on a panel of pex mutants and found that elevated temperature ameliorated dependence on external sucrose and reduced pex <dig> levels in the pex4- <dig> mutant.
despite extensive characterization of peroxisome biogenesis in arabidopsis grown in non-challenged conditions, the effects of environmental stressors on peroxisome function and pex mutant dysfunction are largely unexplored.
overexpressing pex <dig> also worsened pex4- <dig> defects, implying that pex <dig> lingering on the peroxisomal membrane when recycling is impaired impedes peroxisome function.
after cargo delivery, a peroxisome-tethered ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and peroxisomal ubiquitin-protein ligases mono- or polyubiquitinate pex <dig> for recycling back to the cytosol or for degradation, respectively.
most matrix proteins are delivered to peroxisomes by pex <dig>  a receptor that forms transient pores to escort proteins across the peroxisomal membrane.
these defects can be partially alleviated by providing a fixed carbon source, such as sucrose, in the growth medium.
arabidopsis pex mutants Î²-oxidize fatty acids inefficiently and therefore fail to germinate or grow less vigorously.
