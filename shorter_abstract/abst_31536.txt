the relative proportion of alternative transcription events revealed striking similarities between the chicken and human transcriptomes while also providing explanations for previously observed genomic differences.
this issue is common to all non-human vertebrate annotations due to the difficulty in transcript identification from short read rnaseq data.
of these, more than 20 k are novel lncrna transcripts with ~3 k classified as sense exonic overlapping lncrna, which is a class that is underrepresented in many vertebrate annotations.
5′ cap selection was performed on the embryo library to provide methodological comparison.
while previous studies have used single molecule long read sequencing for transcript discovery, they did not perform rna normalization and 5′-cap selection which may have resulted in lower transcriptome coverage and truncated transcript sequences.
our results indicate that the chicken transcriptome is similar in complexity compared to human, and provide insights into other vertebrate biology.
despite the significance of chicken as a model organism, our understanding of the chicken transcriptome is limited compared to human.
from these iso-seq sequencing projects, we have identified 60 k transcripts and 29 k genes within the chicken transcriptome.
we sequenced normalised chicken brain and embryo rna libraries with pacific bioscience iso-seq.
