the goal of this study was to over-produce a previously reported laccase from cyathus bulleri using the well-established expression system of pichia pastoris and examine and compare the properties of the recombinant enzyme with that of the native laccase.
in this study, complete cdna encoding laccase  from white rot fungus cyathus bulleri was amplified by race-pcr, cloned and expressed in the culture supernatant of pichia pastoris under the control of the alcohol oxidase  <dig> promoter.

laccase of c. bulleri was successfully produced extra-cellularly to a high level of  <dig> u l- <dig> in p. pastoris under the control of the aox <dig> promoter and purified by a simple three-step procedure to homogeneity.
addition of copper sulfate to the production medium enhanced the level of laccase by about 12-fold to a final activity of  <dig> u l- <dig>  the recombinant laccase  was purified by ~4-fold to a specific activity of ~ <dig> u mg- <dig> protein.
tryptic finger print analysis of the nlac and the rlac indicated altered glycosylation patterns.
the kinetic parameters against abts, guaiacol and pyrogallol were similar with the nlac and the rlac.
altered glycosylation pattern, identified by peptide mass finger printing, was proposed to contribute to altered properties of the rlac.
the deduced amino acid sequence of the matured protein displayed high homology with laccases from trametes versicolor and coprinus cinereus.
the investigation of properties of individual enzymes therefore becomes difficult.
there is considerable interest in using these enzymes for dye degradation as well as for synthesis of aromatic compounds.
laccases are produced at relatively low levels and, sometimes, as isozymes in the native fungi.
the sequence analysis indicated the presence of glu  <dig> and ser  <dig> and lel tripeptide at the position known to influence redox potential of laccases placing this enzyme as a high redox enzyme.
