patterns of expression in different plant organs and in response to al indicated that the two aspen genes are homologs of the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate.
ionic aluminum  is rhizotoxic and can be present in acid soils at concentrations high enough to inhibit root growth.
to obtain further insights into the root responses of aspen to al, we investigated root gene expression at al conditions that inhibit root growth.
exposure of aspen roots to al results in a rapid inhibition of root growth and a large change in root gene expression.
treatment of the aspen roots with  <dig> Î¼m al induced a strong inhibition of root growth within  <dig> h of exposure time.
the root growth subsequently recovered, reaching growth rates comparable to that of control plants.
the subsequent root growth recovery and the concomitant reduction in the number of responsive genes presumably reflect the success of the roots in activating al tolerance mechanisms.
the responses after  <dig> h were characterized by genes involved in cell wall modification, ion transport, and oxidative stress.
many forest tree species grow naturally in acid soils and often tolerate high concentrations of al.
changes in gene expression were determined after  <dig> h,  <dig> d, and  <dig> d of al exposure.
between  <dig> h and  <dig> d, the number of responsive genes strongly decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>  and then the number of changes remained low.
replicated transcriptome analyses using the affymetrix poplar genome array revealed a total of  <dig> significantly up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, of which 70% could be annotated based on arabidopsis genome resources.
the aspen genes als <dig> and mate may be important components of these mechanisms.
