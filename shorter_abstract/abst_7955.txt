in the present study, the p. japonicus βas gene was transformed into the rice cultivar ‘taijing 9’ using an agrobacterium-mediated approach, resulting in  <dig> rice transgenic plants of the t <dig> generation.
approximately 1– <dig> copies of the βas gene were detected in transgenic rice plants.
we have successfully produced a new rice germplasm, “ginseng rice”, which produces oleanane-type sapogenin.
hplc analysis showed that the concentration of oleanane-type sapogenin oleanolic acid in transgenic rice was  <dig> – <dig>  mg/100 g dw.
the current study is the first report on the transformation of p. japonicus βas gene into rice.
real-time pcr and western blotting analyses showed that the transformed βas gene could be overexpressed and β-amyrin synthase could be expressed in rice.
