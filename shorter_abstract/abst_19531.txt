after transient de-novo membrane expression of alkaline phosphatase , such cells highly up-regulate surface expression of complement receptor i .
these functions are based on prolonged preservation of antigen and its presentation in its native form by fdcs.
employing highly purified human monocytes as a starter population, low concentrations of il- <dig>  and gm-csf  in combination with dexamethasone   in serum-free medium trigger the differentiation into fdc-like cells.
the aim of our study was to demonstrate that fdc-like cells can be deduced from monocytes, and to develop a protocol in order to quantitatively generate them in vitro.
importantly, both, appos as well as apneg fdc-like cells, heterotypically cluster with and emperipolese b cells and exhibit the fdc characteristic ability to entrap functionally preserved antigen for prolonged times.
in this work we provide evidence that fdc-like cells can be derived from monocytes in vitro.
monocyte-derived fdc-like cells quantitatively produced offer a broad utility covering basic research as well as clinical application.
co-expression of cd <dig> confirms the monocytic origin of both, appos and cd35pos cells.
follicular dendritic cells  play a central role in controlling b-cell response maturation, isotype switching and the maintenance of b-cell memory.
