the analysis and interpretation of raw single-molecule data benefits greatly from the ongoing development of sophisticated statistical analysis tools that enable accurate inference at the low signal-to-noise ratios frequently associated with these measurements.
adoption of a common, standard data file format for sharing raw single-molecule data and analysis outcomes is a critical step for the emerging and powerful single-molecule field, which will benefit both sophisticated users and non-specialists by allowing standardized, transparent, and reproducible analysis practices.
while a number of groups have released analysis toolkits as open source software , it remains difficult to compare analysis for experiments performed in different labs due to a lack of standardization.
single-molecule techniques have emerged as incisive approaches for addressing a wide range of questions arising in contemporary biological research .
smd is designed to accommodate a wide variety of computer programming languages, single-molecule techniques, and analysis strategies.
