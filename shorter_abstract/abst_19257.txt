the utroup dna-binding domain contains six zinc finger motifs in tandem, which is able to recognise an 18-base-pair dna target sequence that statistically is present only once in the human genome.
this novel artificial molecule may represent an improved platform for the development of future applications in dmd treatment.
we have previously shown that the zinc finger-based artificial transcriptional factor “jazz” corrects the dystrophic pathology in mdx mice by upregulating utrophin gene expression.
we show that the artificial transcription factor utroup, due to its six zinc finger tandem motif, possesses a low dissociation constant that is consistent with a strong affinity/specificity toward its dna-binding site.
utroup has been designed to recognise an extended dna target sequence on both the human and mouse utrophin gene promoters.
when expressed in mammalian cell lines, utroup promotes utrophin transcription and efficiently accesses active chromatin promoting accumulation of the acetylated form of histone h <dig> in the utrophin promoter locus.
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is the most common x-linked muscle degenerative disease and it is due to the absence of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin.
to achieve a higher transcriptional activation, we coupled the utroup dna-binding domain with the innovative transcriptional activation domain, which was derived from the multivalent adaptor protein che-1/aatf.
here we describe a novel artificial transcription factor, named “utroup”, engineered to further improve the dna-binding specificity.
