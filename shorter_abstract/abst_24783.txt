one of the putative γ-ca encoding genes of a. brasilense was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli.
reverse transcription-pcr analysis indicated that gca <dig> in a. brasilense is co-transcribed with its upstream gene annotated as argc, which encodes a putative n-acetyl-γ-glutamate-phosphate reductase.
this study shows lack of co <dig> hydration activity in a recombinant protein expressed from a gene predicted to encode a γ-carbonic anhydrase in a. brasilense although it cross reacts with anti-cam antibody raised against a well characterized γ-ca.
at present, only γ-ca of methanosarcina thermophila  has been shown to have ca activity.
electrometric assays for ca activity of the whole cell extracts overexpressing recombinant gca <dig> did not show co <dig> hydration activity.
carbonic anhydrase  is a ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of co <dig> to bicarbonate, a reaction underlying diverse biochemical and physiological processes.
gamma class carbonic anhydrases  are widespread in prokaryotes but their physiological roles remain elusive.
the organization and regulation of this gene along with the putative argc gene suggests its involvement in arginine biosynthetic pathway instead of the predicted co <dig> hydration.
the transcription of argc-gca <dig> operon was upregulated in stationary phase and at elevated co <dig> atmosphere.
