however, the disease samples are usually heterogeneous, so that, the genes with great differential expression variance  are becoming attractive and important to indicate the specific state of a biological system.
in the context of differential expression variance, it is still a challenge to measure the enrichment or status of a pathway.
one is to infer the association among identified dysregulated pathways and expected target pathways by estimating pathway crosstalks.
furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept study on diabetes to indicate: iea rather than conventional ora or gsea can capture the under-estimated dysregulated pathways full of devgs and degs; these newly identified pathways could be significantly linked to prior-known disease pathways by estimated crosstalks; and many candidate subtype-factors recognized by iea also have significant relation with the risk of subtypes of genotype-phenotype associations.
totally, iea supplies a new tool to carry on enrichment analysis in the complicate context of clinical application , as a necessary complementary and cooperative approach to conventional ones.
the differentially expressed genes  are widely focused in conventional analysis, which is based on the great purity of samples.
pathway enrichment analysis is a useful tool to study biology and biomedicine, due to its functional screening on well-defined biological procedures rather than separate molecules.
based on a previously established evaluation scheme, we found that, in particular cohorts , a few target disease pathways can be significantly high-ranked by iea, which is more effective than other state-of-the-art methods.
the measurement of malfunctions of pathways with a phenotype change, e.g., from normal to diseased, is the key issue when applying enrichment analysis on a pathway.
to address this issue, we proposed integrative enrichment analysis  based on a novel enrichment measurement.
