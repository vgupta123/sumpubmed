availability of both the somatic and germline genomes is essential to examine the genome changes that occur during programmed dna elimination and ultimately decipher the mechanisms underlying the specific removal of germline-limited sequences.
this approach paves the way to sequence the germline genomes of p. aurelia sibling species for future comparative genomic studies.
we validated the method by flow cell imaging and by high throughput dna sequencing.
we developed a flow cytometry-based method to purify p. tetraurelia nuclei to high purity and provided quality control with flow cell imaging and high throughput dna sequencing.
this method enabled us to sequence, for the first time, the germline dna from pure micronuclei and to identify novel transposable elements.
sequencing the germline dna confirms that the pgm domesticated transposase is required for the excision of all ~ <dig>  internal eliminated sequences.
comparison of the germline dna and unrearranged dna obtained from pgm-silenced cells reveals that the latter does not provide a faithful representation of the germline genome.
we developed a novel experimental approach that uses flow cell imaging and flow cytometry to sort subpopulations of nuclei to high purity.

we identified  <dig> germline transposable elements including the first paramecium retrotransposons.
our work establishes the proof of principle that developing somatic macronuclei can be sorted from a complex biological sample to high purity based on their size, shape and dna content.
the transcriptionally inactive micronucleus contains the complete germline genome, while the somatic macronucleus contains a reduced genome streamlined for gene expression.
during development of the somatic macronucleus, the germline genome undergoes massive and reproducible dna elimination events.
dna elimination is developmentally programmed in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including unicellular ciliates, and leads to the generation of distinct germline and somatic genomes.
we sorted vegetative micronuclei and macronuclei during development of p. tetraurelia.
