inhibition of intestinal peristalsis is a major side effect of opioid analgesics.
therefore, the effect of -tramadol, -tramadol and the major metabolite o-desmethyltramadol on intestinal peristalsis in vitro and their mechanisms of action were examined.
racemic tramadol, its - and -enantiomers and the major metabolite o-desmethyltramadol  concentration-dependently increased ppt until peristalsis was transiently or persistently abolished.
distension-induced peristalsis was recorded in fluid-perfused segments of the guinea pig small intestine.
the results show that the metabolite o-desmethyltramadol is more potent in inhibiting peristalsis than its parent compound.
the peristaltic motor inhibition caused by - and -tramadol was markedly and that of o-desmethyltramadol nearly completely prevented by naloxone, but left unaltered by the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists methysergide plus tropisetron.
the action of all tramadol forms depends on opioid receptors, and that of - and -tramadol also involves adrenoceptors.
although tramadol is an opioid-like analgesic, its effect on gut motility is little known.
