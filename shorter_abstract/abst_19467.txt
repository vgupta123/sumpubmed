our experiments on five highly imbalanced splice site datasets, with positive to negative ratios of 1-to- <dig>  showed that the ensemble-based semi-supervised approaches represent a good choice, even when the amount of labeled data consists of less than 1% of all training data.
in the presence of limited amounts of labeled data, ensemble-based semi-supervised approaches can successfully leverage the unlabeled data to enhance supervised ensembles learned from highly imbalanced data distributions.
traditional machine learning approaches to genome annotation typically rely on large amounts of labeled data.
in this context, we focus on the problem of predicting splice sites in a genome using semi-supervised learning approaches.
this is a challenging problem, due to the highly imbalanced distribution of the data, i.e., small number of splice sites as compared to the number of non-splice sites.

semi-supervised learning approaches that can make use of unlabeled data, in addition to small amounts of labeled data, can help reduce the costs associated with labeling.
