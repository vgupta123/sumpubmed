among these,  <dig> were upregulated, the majority of which are involved in metabolism and transport of nutrients, and stress responses, including araa, ywka, yfls, mtla, ydgg et al.
in order to better understand these complex plant-pgpr interactions, changes in the transcriptome of the typical pgpr bacillus subtilis in response to rice seedlings were analyzed.
microarray technology was used to study the global transcriptionl response of b. subtilis okb <dig> to rice seedlings after an interaction period of 2 h. a total of  <dig> genes representing  <dig> % of the b. subtilis strain okb <dig> transcriptome showed significantly altered expression levels in response to rice seedlings.
plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  are soil beneficial microorganisms that colonize plant roots for nutritional purposes and accordingly benefit plants by increasing plant growth or reducing disease.
the  <dig> genes that were downregulated included chev, flil, spma and tua, and these are involved in chemotaxis, motility, sporulation and teichuronic acid biosynthesis, respectively.
