the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin  in selected regions of the brain results in irreversible neuronal damage, or bilirubin encephalopathy .
although ucb impairs a large number of cellular functions in other tissues, the basic mechanisms of neurotoxicity have not yet been fully clarified.
these results show for the first time that ucb exposure induces er stress response as major intracellular homeostasis in surviving neuroblastoma cells in vitro.
validation of selected er stress genes is shown by quantitative rt-pcr.
transcriptome changes induced by ucb exposure in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cell line were examined by high density oligonucleotide microarrays.
analysis of xbp <dig> splicing and ddit3/chop subcellular localization is presented.
