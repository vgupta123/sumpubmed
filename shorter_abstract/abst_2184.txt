we applied our approach to data coming from a genome-wide scan on  <dig> individuals affected by arterial hypertension and  <dig> nonagenarians without history of hypertension.
in order to assign states to the meta-variables we employ an approach based on classification trees.
however, learning bayesian networks is often non-trivial due to the high number of variables to be taken into account in the model with respect to the instances of the dataset.
the new approach presented in this paper is able to derive a gene-based predictive model based on snps data.
they are able to derive the existing correlation between genetic markers and phenotypic traits and, at the same time, to find the relationships between the markers themselves.
such model is more parsimonious than the one based on single snps, while preserving the capability of highlighting predictive snps configurations.
the method can be then considered as an alternative way to analyze the data coming from association studies.
therefore, it becomes very interesting to use an abstraction of the variable space that suitably reduces its dimensionality without losing information.
bayesian networks are powerful instruments to learn genetic models from association studies data.
the results were obtained by running a hold-out experiment five times.
we compared the performance of the proposed approach with the bayesian network learned with snps as variables and with the network learned with haplotypes as meta-variables.
the prediction performance of this approach was consistently superior to the snp-based and the haplotype-based one in all the test sets of the evaluation procedure.
