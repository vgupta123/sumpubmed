define covariates of cerebrospinal corticotropin-releasing hormone  levels in normal humans.
crhcsf was measured in  <dig> normal subjects as part of an intensive study of physiological responses stressors in chronic pain and fatigue states.
three models were defined:  crhcsf with blood glucose and sodium ;  crhcsf with resting respiratory and heart rates ; and  crhcsf with sf- <dig> vitality and multidimensional fatigue inventory physical fatigue domains .
low crhcsf was predicted by lower glucose, respiratory and heart rates, and higher sodium and psychometric constructs of well being.
