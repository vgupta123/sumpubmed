instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data.
the user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/mirna names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files.
we applied geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mrna-seq datasets, b) identify mirnas  in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in mirnas and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated mirnas.
analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by geoseq.
geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.
the analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays.
