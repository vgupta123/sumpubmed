we have developed a web-based tool, called eqtl viewer, to visualize the relationships between the expression trait genes and the candidate genes in the eqtl regions using scalable vector graphics.
expression quantitative trait locus  mapping methods have been used to identify the genetic basis of gene expression variations.
our tool provides an efficient and intuitive way for biologists to explore transcriptional regulation patterns, and to generate hypotheses on the genetic basis of transcriptional regulations.
the large number of mapping results produced makes it difficult to consider simultaneously the relationships between multiple genomic regions and multiple expressional profiles.
there is a need for informative bioinformatics tools to assist the visualization and interpretation of these mapping results.
the plot generated by eqtl viewer has the capacity to display mapping results with high resolutions at a variety of scales, and superimpose biological annotations onto the mapping results dynamically.
to map eqtl, thousands of expression profiles are related with sequence polymorphisms across the genome through their correlated variations.
