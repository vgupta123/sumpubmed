to complement other methods for classical signal peptide prediction we here present a publicly available method, tatp, for prediction of bacterial tat signal peptides.
the tatp method is able to positively classify 91% of  <dig> known tat signal peptides and 84% of the annotated cleavage sites of these tat signal peptides were correctly predicted.
the method developed here is able to discriminate tat signal peptides from cytoplasmic proteins carrying a similar motif, as well as from sec signal peptides, with high accuracy.
we have retrieved sequence data for tat substrates in order to train a computational method for discrimination of sec and tat signal peptides.
the tatp prediction server is available as a public web server at .
this method generates far less false positive predictions on various datasets than using simple pattern matching.
moreover, on the same datasets tatp generates less false positive predictions than a complementary rule based prediction method.
the method allows filtering of input sequences based on perl syntax regular expressions, whereas hydrophobicity discrimination of tat- and sec-signal peptides is carried out by an artificial neural network.
a potential cleavage site of the predicted tat signal peptide is also reported.
