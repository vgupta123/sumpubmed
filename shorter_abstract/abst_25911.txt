the second transcriptome assembly was constructed from more than  <dig> million illumina genome analyzer ii reads  using a combination of velvet, clc workbench and cap <dig> software packages.
using the misa software,  <dig>  ssr markers were also identified within the illumina transcriptome assembly and primers were designed for the identified markers.
a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  were identified from the assembly, and primers were designed for the ssrs.
to complement and enhance these resources, we applied ngs to three pepper genotypes: maor, early jalape√±o and criollo de morelos- <dig>  to identify snps and ssrs in the assembly of these three genotypes.
bwa, samtools and in-house perl scripts were used to identify snps among three pepper genotypes.
the assembly was annotated by blast2go and  <dig>   of annotated contigs were associated with functional proteins.
in order to have a better understanding of the assembled sequences and to identify candidate genes underlying qtls, we annotated the contigs of sanger-est and illumina transcriptome assemblies.
before availability of pepper genome sequence, assembling transcriptomes of this economically important crop was required to generate thousands of high-quality molecular markers that could be used in breeding programs.
