however, non-coding functional elements can also be located within coding region, as is common for exonic splicing enhancers, some transcription factor binding sites, and rna secondary structure elements affecting mrna stability, localization, or translation.
since these functional elements are located in regions that are themselves highly conserved because they are coding for a protein, they generally escaped detection by comparative genomics approaches.
we introduce a comparative genomics approach for detecting non-coding functional elements located within coding regions.
non-coding functional elements, in particular those involved in post-transcriptional regulation, are likely to be much more prevalent than is currently known.
codon evolution is modeled as a mixture of codon substitution models, where each component of the mixture describes the evolution of codons under a specific type of coding selective pressure.
we show how to compute the posterior distribution of the entropy and parsimony scores under this null model of codon evolution.
the analysis of a set of cortbp <dig> orthologous genes reveals a region of several hundred base pairs under strong non-coding selective pressure whose function remains unknown.
