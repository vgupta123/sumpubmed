bioinformatics approaches in allergen prediction have evolved appreciably in recent years to increase sophistication and performance.
to facilitate the allergen prediction, we implemented our computational method in a web application, which can be available at http://gmobl.sjtu.edu.cn/preal/index.php.
our new approach could improve the accuracy of allergen prediction.
assessment of potential allergenicity of protein is necessary whenever transgenic proteins are introduced into the food chain.
the overall accuracy in the cross-validation reached  <dig> % to 100% with our new method.
more importantly, it was observed that the features of subcellular locations and amino acid composition played major roles in determining the allergenicity of proteins, particularly extracellular/cell surface and vacuole of the subcellular locations for wheat and soybean.
results of the performance comparisons showed the superior of our method to the existing methods used widely.
we presented a more comprehensive model in  <dig> features space for allergenic proteins prediction by integrating various properties of proteins, such as biochemical and physicochemical properties, sequential features and subcellular locations.
