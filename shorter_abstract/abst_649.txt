moreover, endogenous nmda has been found in rat, where it has a role in the induction of gnrh  in the hypothalamus, and of lh  and prl  in the pituitary gland.
in this study we show evidence for the occurrence of endogenous nmda in the amphioxus branchiostoma lanceolatum.
given the simplicity of the amphioxus nervous and endocrine systems compared to mammalian, the discovery of nmda in this protochordate is important to gain insights into the role of endogenous nmda in the nervous and endocrine systems of metazoans and particularly in the chordate lineage.
nmda  is a widely known agonist for a class of glutamate receptors, the nmda type.
as in rat, in amphioxus nmda is also biosynthesized from d-aspartic acid  by a nmda synthase .
a relatively high concentration of nmda occurs in the nervous system of this species .
