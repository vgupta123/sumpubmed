expression analysis of populus mips indicates that populus xips don't show any tissue-specific transcript abundance.
aromatic/arginine  selectivity filters, characteristics of loops responsible for solute selectivity  and gating  and group conservation of small and weakly polar interfacial residues have been analyzed.
ar/r selectivity filters of dicots xips are more hydrophobic compared to fungi and moss xips and hence they are likely to transport hydrophobic solutes.
majority of the non-xip ptmips are similar to those in arabidopsis, rice and maize.
populus trichocarpa is a model tree species and provides an opportunity to investigate several tree-specific traits.
loop d in dicot xips has higher number of basic residues.
loop c is longer in one of the subgroups of dicot xips and most probably has a significant role in solute selectivity.
substitutions in ar/r selectivity filter, insertion/deletion in loop c, increasing basic nature of loop d and loss of introns are some of the events occurred during the evolution of dicot xips.
phylogenetic analysis reveals that populus has a fifth uncharacterized subfamily .
three-dimensional models of all  <dig> ptmips were constructed using homology modeling technique.
non-xip mips are similar in all four plant species considered in this study.
fifty five full-length mips have been identified in populus genome.
in this study, we have investigated populus mips  and compared them with their counterparts in arabidopsis, rice and maize.
small and weakly polar residues at the helix-helix interface are group conserved presumably to maintain the hourglass fold of mip channels.
intron loss is observed on two occasions: once between two subfamilies of eudicots and monocot and in the second instance, when dicot and moss xips diverged from fungi.
additional xips were identified from database search and  <dig> xip sequences from dicots, fungi, moss and protozoa were analyzed.
the model plants arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize contain more than  <dig> mips and based on phylogenetic analysis they can be divided into at least four subfamilies.
