protein structure research often deals with the comparison of two or more structures of the same protein, for instance when handling alternative structure models for the same protein, point mutants, molecule movements, structure predictions, etc.
this program may provide an insight into the local structural changes produced in a protein structure by different interactions or modifications.
it is convenient for the general user and it can be applied to standard or specific tasks on protein structure research.
we have implemented the algorithm through a computer program that performs the numerical evaluation and allows inspecting visually the results of the structure comparison.
here we present the algorithm and some results to illustrate its characteristics.
often the difference between structures is small, restricted to a local neighborhood, and buried in structural "noise" due to trivial differences resulting from experimental artifacts.
we have developed an algorithm to compare local structural differences between alternative structures of the same protein.
