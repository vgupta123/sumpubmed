advanced bioinformatic analysis of degs uncovered the pathways of “cysteine and methionine metabolism” and “plant hormone signal transduction”, which are likely to play important roles in the control of pollen tubes growth in si species.
a total of  <dig> enriched kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways were identified in sc and  <dig> enriched kegg pathways were identified in si, among which “cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway” and “plant hormone signal transduction pathway” were significantly enriched in si.
this study is the first global transcriptome-wide comparative analysis of sc and si tomato unpollinated/pollinated styles.
to determine the influence of gene expression on style self-pollination, a transcriptome-wide comparative analysis of sc and si tomato unpollinated/pollinated styles was performed using rna-sequencing  data.
transcriptome profiles of 24-h unpollination  and self-pollination  styles from sc and si tomato species were generated using high-throughput next generation sequencing.
