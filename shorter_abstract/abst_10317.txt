input dna was digested with a single restriction enzyme and ligated to y adapters modified to contain a sequence barcode and to provide a compatible overhang for ligation.
covering approximately 1/ <dig> of the  <dig> mb genome of rice we detected mutation densities ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> per mb of diploid dna depending on the mutagenic treatment.
for genome-dependent discovery 15- <dig> million of  <dig> base reads per individual were aligned to the reference sequence achieving individual sequencing coverage from  <dig> to 15Ã—.
we describe the development of a simple method for reduced representation sequencing.
to test its suitability for the discovery of very rare snp, one control and three mutagenized rice individuals  were used to prepare genomic libraries for illumina sequencers by ligating barcoded adapters to nlaiii restriction sites.
we demonstrated the efficiency of this method at snp discovery using rice and arabidopsis.
the combination of a simple and cost-effective library construction method, with illumina sequencing, and the use of a bioinformatic pipeline allows practical snp discovery regardless of whether a genomic reference is available.
