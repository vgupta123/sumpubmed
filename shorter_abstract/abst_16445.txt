to address these issues, we describe a new method, targeted alignment and artificial cytosine elimination for rrbs , which aligns bisulfite sequence reads to msp <dig> digitally digested reference and specifically removes the end repair cytosines.
reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  is a cost-effective method for studying dna methylation at single base resolution.

trace-rrbs aligned more reads uniquely than other tools and achieved the highest correlation with 450 k microarray data.
although several tools are available for rrbs data processing and analysis, it is not clear which strategy performs the best and there has not been much attention to the contamination issue from artificial cytosines incorporated during the end repair step of library preparation.
dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes.
the end repair artificial cytosine removal increased correlation between nearby cpgs and accuracy of methylation quantification.
we compared this approach on a simulated and a real dataset with  <dig> other rrbs analysis tools and illumina 450 k microarray platform.
