our study has demonstrated that the pathogen is continually acquiring new genes through horizontal gene transfer in the process of host adaptation, providing novel insight into its unusual genomic dynamics.
typhoid fever is an infectious disease of global importance that is caused by salmonella enterica subsp.
s. typhi is strictly a human pathogen, and some recovered individuals become long-term carriers who continue to shed the bacteria in their faeces, thus becoming main reservoirs of infection.
the understanding of these strains and virulence factors, and particularly the strain that is associated with the large outbreak and the less studied asymptomatic typhi carrier in the population, will have important impact on disease control.
additionally, the comparative genomics analysis with all of the other completely sequenced s. typhi genomes revealed that strains bl <dig> and cr <dig> exhibit unusual genomic variations despite s. typhi being generally regarded as highly clonal.
the uncommon genomic variations in the two closely related bl <dig> and cr <dig> strains suggests that s. typhi is more diverse than previously thought.

a comparative genomics analysis combined with a phylogenomic analysis revealed that the strains from the outbreak and carrier were closely related with microvariations and possibly derived from a common ancestor.
