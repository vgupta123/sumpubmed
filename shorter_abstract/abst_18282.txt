tgfÎ² <dig>  insulin and ascorbic acid were identified as signals that together with bmp- <dig> induce a chondrocytic phenotype that is characterized by increased expression of cartilage marker genes in a timely co-ordinated fashion.
compared with previous reports using a brief bmp- <dig> supplementation early in differentiation, prolonged exposure increased chondrogenic output, while supplementation with insulin and ascorbic acid prevented dedifferentiation.
es cells have the unlimited capacity to self-renew and maintain their pluripotency in culture.
we present here that bmp- <dig> can drive es cells to the cartilage, osteoblast or adipogenic fate depending on supplementary co-factors.
moreover, gene expression studies show that adipocytes can also differentiate from bmp- <dig> treated es cells.
ultimately, we have found that es cells can be successfully triggered to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells, which can further alter their fate to become hypertrophic, and adipocytes.
these results provide a foundation for the use of es cells as a potential therapy in joint injury and disease.
expression of collagen type iib and aggrecan, indicative of a fully mature state, continuously ascend until reaching a peak at day  <dig> of culture to approximately 80-fold over control values.
recently, tissue engineering has merged with stem cell technology with interest to develop new sources of transplantable material for injury or disease treatment.
sox <dig> and scleraxis, cartilage specific transcription factors, are highly expressed at very early stages and show decreased expression over the time course of eb differentiation.
bmp- <dig> induced chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and begin to alter their expression profile towards osteoblasts.
