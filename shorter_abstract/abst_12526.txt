the cluster of nbs-lrr genes located in melon chromosome  <dig> was analyzed and compared with the syntenic regions in other cucurbit genomes.
clusters of similar genes are present in the syntenic regions of the two species of cucurbitaceae that were sequenced, cucumber and watermelon.
the cluster containing the largest number of nbs-lrr genes has previously been analyzed in melon and related species and showed a high degree of interspecific and intraspecific variability.
clusters of genes coding for nbs-lrr proteins in cucurbits appear to have specific variability in different regions of the genome and between different species.
the variability within the melon species appears to consist essentially of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
this observation is in favour of considering that the adaptation of plant species to changing environments is based upon the variability that may occur at any location in the genome and that has been produced by specific mechanisms of sequence variation acting on plant genomes.
after comparing genome resequencing data of  <dig> cucumber varieties, deletion of a group of genes is observed in a group of varieties of indian origin.
a large proportion of these genes are organized in clusters that appear to be hotspots of variability.
cucurbitaceae species contain a significantly lower number of genes coding for proteins with similarity to plant resistance genes belonging to the nbs-lrr family than other plant species of similar genome size.
