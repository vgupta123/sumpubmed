the ability of probesets to hybridize to more than one gene product can lead to false positives when analysing gene expression.
an analysis of these relationships for affymetrix arrays considered both the extent and influence of exact matches between probe and transcript sequences.
it was found not only to lead to increased signal strength for the affected probesets, but the major effect is to significantly increase their correlation, even in situations when only a single probe from a probeset was involved.
more than 10% of the families contain members annotated to different genes or even different unigene clusters.
