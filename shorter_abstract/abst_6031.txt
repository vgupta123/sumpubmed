an osteochondral defect was created by arthroscopy in the medial surface of lateral trochlea of talus of left or right leg, randomly selected, from six healthy geldings.
articular cartilage, because of its avascular nature, has little capacity for spontaneous healing, and tissue engineering approaches, employing different biomaterials and cells, are under development.
at the end of the experiment , the total number of cells per field in repair tissues was equal to control, and macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells were not detected, suggesting that no significant inflammation was present.
nevertheless, the cell population in these tissues, both in presence of chitosan-gp and in untreated controls, were heterogeneous, with a lower proportion of type ii collagen-positives cells and some with a fibroblastic aspect.
moreover, the pgs synthesized in repair tissues formed in presence or absence of chitosan-gp were similar to those of normal cartilage.
these cells were able to synthesize type ii collagen and pgs similar to those synthesized in normal cartilage and in healing tissue without implant, indicating its chondrocyte nature.
the contralateral joint received an identical defect with no implant.
implanted chitosan-gp did not evoke an important inflammatory reaction, and permitted cell growth.
however, the chitosan-gp treated tissue had an disorganized appearance, and blood vessels were present.
these cells were able to synthesize type ii collagen and proteoglycans .
so, the aim of the present study was to investigate the biocompatibility of chitosan-gp in horse joints submitted to high mechanical loads.
after 180Â days, the repair tissues were collected, and also analyzed.
