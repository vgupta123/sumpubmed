unlike in abscission or dehiscence, fruit of kiwifruit actinidia eriantha develop the ability for peel detachment when they are ripe and soft in the absence of a morphologically identifiable abscission zone.
in fruit of a. eriantha, peel detachability is due to the establishment of a zone of discontinuity created by differential cell wall changes in peel and outer pericarp tissues that lead to changes in mechanical properties of the peel.
the ‘good-peeling’ genotype has detachment with clean debonding of cells, and a peel tissue that does not tear.
the ‘poor-peeling’ genotype has poor detachability, with cells that rupture upon debonding, and peel tissue that fragments easily.
although both genotypes expressed two polygalacturonase genes, no enzyme activity was detected in the good-peeling genotype, suggesting limited pectin breakdown, keeping cell walls strong without tearing or fragmentation of the peel and flesh upon detachment.
together these results reveal a novel and interesting mechanism for enabling cell separation.
structural studies indicated that peel detachability in both genotypes occurred in the outer pericarp beneath the hypodermis.
this zone of difference in methylesterification was enhanced by differential cell wall changes between the peel and outer pericarp tissue.
during ripening, the peel becomes flexible and the cells continue to adhere strongly to each other, preventing breakage, whereas the underlying outer pericarp loses cell wall strength as softening proceeds.
two closely-related genotypes with contrasting detachment behaviour have been identified.
high xyloglucanase activity in the peel of the good-peeling genotype may contribute by having a strengthening effect on the cellulose-xyloglucan network.
