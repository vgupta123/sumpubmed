furthermore, treatment with the myosin light chain kinase  inhibitor ml- <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression and loss of both f-actin and phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain from the contractile ring in a manner similar to treatment with u <dig> and et-18-och <dig>
in addition, both pip <dig> and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c  have been localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing mammalian cells.
several studies suggest pip <dig> must be hydrolyzed continuously for continued cleavage furrow ingression.
our results are consistent with a model in which pip <dig> hydrolysis acts via ca2+ to activate myosin via mlck and thereby control actin dynamics during constriction of the contractile ring.
here we compared the effects of u <dig> and the structurally unrelated plc inhibitor et-18-och <dig>  on cytokinesis in crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes.
our data show that the effects of u <dig> are indeed via plc because u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> produced similar effects on cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton organization that were distinct from those caused by nem.
