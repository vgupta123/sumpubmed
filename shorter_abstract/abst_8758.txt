to test this, we redesigned a typical comparative genomics algorithm, the reciprocal smallest distance algorithm , to run within amazon's elastic computing cloud .
however, the speed and flexibility of cloud computing environments provides a substantial boost with manageable cost.
the procedure designed to transform the rsd algorithm into a cloud-ready application is readily adaptable to similar comparative genomics problems.
the effort to transform existing comparative genomics algorithms from local compute infrastructures is not trivial.
