our results suggest that the crms predicted by depcrm are highly likely to be functional.
we have developed a novel graph-theoretic based algorithm depcrm for genome-wide de novo predictions of cres and crms using a large number of chip datasets.
we found that the putative crms as well as cres as a whole in a crm are more conserved than randomly selected sequences.
although the knowledge of cres and crms in a genome is crucial to elucidate gene regulatory networks and understand many important biological phenomena, little is known about the cres and crms in most eukaryotic genomes due to the difficulty to characterize them by either computational or traditional experimental methods.
the algorithm and predictions will hopefully facilitate the elucidation of gene regulatory networks in eukaryotes.
however, the exponentially increasing number of tf binding location data produced by the recent wide adaptation of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray hybridization  or high-throughput sequencing  technologies has provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify crms and cres in genomes.
depcrm predicts cres and crms by identifying overrepresented combinatorial cre motif patterns in multiple chip datasets in an effective way.
nonetheless, how to effectively mine these large volumes of chip data to identify cres and crms at nucleotide resolution is a highly challenging task.
when applied to  <dig> chip datasets of  <dig> tfs from d. melanogaster, depcrm identified  <dig> and  <dig> overrepresented cre motifs and their combinatorial patterns, respectively, and predicted a total of  <dig>  crms in the genome.
our algorithm is the first of its kind for de novo genome-wide prediction of cres and crms using larger number of transcription factor chip datasets.
