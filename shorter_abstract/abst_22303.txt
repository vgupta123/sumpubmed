by the combination of affinity enrichment and high-resolution lc-ms/ms analysis, large-scale lysine acetylome analysis was performed.
this work provides a resource for functional analysis of acetylated proteins in filamentous fungi.
although known for many years, its function remains elusive in fusarium graminearum, one of the most important necrotrophic plant pathogens with huge economic impact.

this work provides the first comprehensive survey of a possible lysine acetylome in f. graminearum and reveals previously unappreciated roles of lysine acetylation in the regulation of diverse biological processes.
in total,  <dig> lysine acetylation sites matched to  <dig> different proteins were identified.
lysine acetylation in proteins is a ubiquitous and conserved post-translational modification, playing a critical regulatory role in almost every aspect of living cells.
