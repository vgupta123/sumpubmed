in addition, we show that there is also a significant structural similarity between the amino and carboxy domains in both the foamy and ortho viruses.
these included both the dali method and the sap method, with rigorous statistical tests applied to the results of both methods.
these results indicate that, as well as the duplication of the double domain capsid, there may have been an even more ancient gene-duplication that preceded the double domain structure.
in addition, our structure comparison methodology demonstrates a general approach to problems where the components have a high intrinsic level of similarity.
for this, we employed collections of artificial fold ’decoys’  to provide a customised background distribution for each comparison, thus allowing significance levels to be estimated.
these similarities suggest that the origin of both viral capsids was a common ancestor with a double domain structure.
we have shown that the relationship of the two domains conforms to a simple linear correspondence rather than a domain transposition.
