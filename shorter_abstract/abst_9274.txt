east-southeast asian and brazilian isolates were generally included in the same group; a few members of this group were found in florida, but the majority of the isolates from florida were clustered separately.
isolates from brazil showed similar genetic makeup with east-southeast asian dominant group, suggesting the possibility of a common origin.
l. asiaticus' in florida were not clearly understood, the less-pervasive groups may have been introduced directly from asia or via brazil.
however, most of the isolates recovered from florida were clustered in a separate group.
notably, the recent outbreak of hlb in florida probably occurred through multiple introductions.
the objectives of this study were to develop microsatellite markers and conduct genetic analyses of 'ca.
a panel of seven polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed for 'ca.
microsatellite markers developed in this study provide adequate discriminatory power for the identification and differentiation of closely-related isolates, as well as for genetic studies of 'ca.
microsatellite analyses across the samples showed that the genetic diversity of 'ca.
upgma and structure analyses identified three major genetic groups worldwide.
our results identified three major genetic groups of 'ca.
while the sources of the dominant 'ca.
l. asiaticus' genome sequence has facilitated development of molecular markers from this bacterium.
the disease is associated with the presence of a fastidious, phloem-limited Î±- proteobacterium, 'candidatus liberibacter asiaticus', 'ca.
eburst analysis predicted three founder haplotypes, which may have given rise to three groups worldwide.
l. asiaticus' from a worldwide collection.
l. asiaticus' is higher in asia than americas.
