this line expresses modest levels of ha-dnd <dig> and serves as a good system to study dnd <dig> function in vitro.
we used this stable cell line to identify the transcripts that physically interact with dnd <dig>  by performing ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation  followed by rt-pcr, we identified that transcripts encoding pluripotency factors , cell cycle regulators  and apoptotic factors  are specifically associated with the ha-dnd <dig> ribonucleoprotein complex.
our results indicate that the inducible es cell line system serves as a suitable in vitro system to identify the mrna targets of dnd <dig>  the rip-rt results hint at the broad spectrum of mrna targets that interact with dnd <dig> in es cells.
based on what is known about dnd <dig> function, our results suggest that dnd <dig> may impose another level of translational regulation to modulate expression of critical factors in es cells.
the rna binding protein, dead end , is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates.
because es cells share similar gene expression patterns as germ cells, we utilized es cells to identify additional candidate mrnas that associate with dnd <dig>
es cells are readily amenable to genetic modification and easier to culture in vitro compared to germ cells.
