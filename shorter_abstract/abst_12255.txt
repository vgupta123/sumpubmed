the objective of this study was to identify the dysfunctional mirnas and their target mrnas using a wet-lab experimental and dry-lab bioinformatics approach.
the differentially expressed mirna candidates were identified from  <dig> mirna profiles, and were confirmed in crc clinical samples using reported target genes of dysfunctional mirnas to perform functional pathway enrichment analysis.
in addition, we identified that several pivotal target gene candidates may be comodulated by dysfunctional mirnas during colon cancer progression.
fifteen dysfunctional mirnas were engaged in metastasis-associated pathways through comodulating  <dig> target genes, which were identified by using a multi-step approach.
we identified  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> mirnas  that were significantly upregulated and downregulated in colon tumors, respectively.
bioinformatics analysis showed that the known targets of these dysregulated mirnas simultaneously participated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition , cell growth, cell adhesion, and cell cycles.
the roles of these candidate genes are worth further exploration in the progression of colon cancer, and could potentially be targets in future therapy.
potential target gene candidates were predicted by an in silico search, and their expression levels between normal and colorectal tumor tissues were further analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction .

numerous dysregulated mirnas simultaneously participate in the process of colon cancer development.
however, the detailed mechanisms and biological functions of co-expressed mirna in colorectal carcinogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated.
