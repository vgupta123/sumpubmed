the affinity of the probes towards their targets varies in a sequence-dependent manner.
the "success" of the sequence-independent naïve approach is only possible due to the control experiment and requires proper scaling of the measured intensities.
the detection of enriched dna or rna fragments by tiling microarrays has become more and more popular.
in order to remove this bias a number of approaches have been developed and shown to increase the detection of enriched dna or rna fragments.
sequence-dependent normalization of microarray data hardly improves the detection of enriched dna or rna fragments.
these microarrays contain a high number of small probes covering genomic loci.
thus, it seems possible that the enhancement of detection is due to the peak detection algorithm rather than the sequence-dependent normalization.
we will show that the sequence-dependent normalization procedures do not perform better than the naïve approach, suggesting that the benefit of using these normalization approaches is limited.
however, to achieve high coverage the probe sequences cannot be selected for their hybridization properties.
