in order to investigate reconstruction of spatial information at structurally complex regions, we have used an emulsion haplotype fusion pcr approach to reproducibly link sequences of up to 1kb in length to allow phasing of multiple variants from neighbouring loci, using allele-specific pcr and sequencing to detect the phase.
by using emulsion systems linking flanking regions to amplicons within the cnv, this led to the reconstruction of a 59kb haplotype across the defa1a <dig> cnv in hapmap individuals.
this study has demonstrated a novel use for emulsion haplotype fusion pcr in addressing the issue of reconstructing structural haplotypes at multiallelic copy variable regions, using the defa1a <dig> locus as an example.
these dynamic and structurally complex regions are often poorly understood from a sequence point of view.
for structurally complex regions, a more focussed approach to assembling haplotypes may be required.
despite progress made in genome-wide sequencing and phasing algorithms and methods, problems assembling  regions of repetitive dna and structural variation remain.
