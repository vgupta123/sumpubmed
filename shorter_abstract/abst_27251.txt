here, we showed negative and neutral pictures of figures and scenes and tested first, whether emotional effects are larger to figures than scenes for both epn and lpp, and second, whether emotional effects on epn and lpp are reduced less for unattended figures than scenes.
in research on event-related potentials  to emotional pictures, greater attention to emotional than neutral stimuli  is commonly indexed by two difference waves between emotional and neutral stimuli: the early posterior negativity  and the late positive potential .
when pictures were unattended, emotional effects on epn increased for scenes but tended to decrease for figures, whereas emotional effects on lpp decreased similarly for figures and scenes.
in these studies, pictures were shown at fixation, and picture composition was that of simple figures rather than that of complex scenes.
these findings imply that the emotional content captures attention more strongly for figures than scenes, but that the emotional content does not hold attention more strongly for figures than scenes.
