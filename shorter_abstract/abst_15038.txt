finally, siphonophores  are an exception and possibly require alternate assembly strategies.
the lack of genomic resources can present challenges for studies of non-model organisms.
a deeper examination of the mouse assemblies shows that with more reads, assembly errors become more frequent but such errors can be mitigated with more stringent assembly parameters.
