genome-wide expression profiling using microarrays or sequence-based technologies allows us to identify genes and genetic pathways whose expression patterns influence complex traits.
here, we present a bayesian variable selection method to prioritize gene sets that overcomes this limitation by considering all gene sets simultaneously.
we applied bayesian variable selection to differential expression to prioritize the molecular and genetic pathways involved in the responses to escherichia coli infection in danish holstein cows.
we used a bayesian variable selection method to prioritize kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways.
we used our data to study how the variable selection method was affected by overlaps among the pathways.
the variable selection method was robust to a change in prior probability and stable given a limited number of observations.
bayesian variable selection is a useful way to prioritize gene sets while considering their overlaps.
ignoring the overlaps gives different and possibly misleading results.
different methods to prioritize gene sets, such as the genes in a given molecular pathway, have been described.
