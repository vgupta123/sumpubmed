this creates an opportunity for bioinformatics tool developers.
this approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping.
bridgedb has already been integrated into several bioinformatics applications.
here we present bridgedb, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping.
this framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services.
by uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, bridgedb improves capability and flexibility of those tools.
this approach requires an interface layer between tools and mapping services.
mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations.
tools can be made to flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage.
