sperm adhesion molecule  <dig>  is the major mammalian testicular hyaluronidase and is expressed at high levels in sperm cells.
a previous study had identified spam <dig> as one of the many human genes that initiate within a transposable element.
spam <dig> protein is important for penetration of the cumulus cell layer surrounding the ovum, and is also involved in zona pellucida binding and sperm intracellular signalling.
the testis-specific promoters of the human and mouse spam <dig> genes are derived from sequence that was originally part of an erv pol gene.
examination of the human, mouse and rat spam <dig> loci revealed that transcripts initiate within the pol gene of an endogenous retrovirus  element.
