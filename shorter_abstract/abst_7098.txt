we then used gene expression microarrays to gain insight on the molecular pathways that sustain the ps tumor initiating cell  phenotype.
normal and cancer stem cells possess the ability to grow in vitro as self-renewing spheres, but the molecular basis of this phenotype remains largely unknown.
we intended to establish a comprehensive culture system to grow prostatospheres  from both cancer cell lines and patient tumors.
the cancer stem cell  hypothesis proposes that a population of tumor cells bearing stem cell properties is responsible for the origin and maintenance of tumors.
meta-analysis in oncomine reveals that some of these genes correlate with prostate cancer status and/or progression.
this set includes novel prostate tic growth factors , proteins implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal maintenance, transcriptional regulators  and factors involved in protein biosynthesis and metabolism.
gene expression analysis defined a gene signature composed of  <dig> genes that characterize lncap and patient pss.
traditional stem cell medium  supplemented with knockoutâ„¢sr  allows the propagation of monoclonal pss from cell lines and primary cells.
