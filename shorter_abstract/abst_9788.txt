these samples were separated by 2-d gel electrophoresis, and gels were treated with a glycoprotein-detecting probe.
we cloned the fragment of yp <dig> cdna from s. littoralis and determined that it is expressed in both ovaries and testes.
we reported previously that the circadian clock controls sperm release and maturation in several insect species.
we collected seminal fluid proteins from males before and after daily sperm release.
we observed a group of abundant glycoproteins in the sample collected after sperm release, which was absent in the sample collected before sperm release.
during the period of sperm release, yp <dig> protein appears in the seminal fluid and forms an external coat on spermatozoa.
this unexpected result was confirmed by western blotting demonstrating that seminal fluid contains protein immunoreactive to antibody against yolk protein yp <dig> produced in the follicle cells surrounding developing oocytes.
ultrastructural studies suggest that glycoproteins are involved in sperm maturation in insects; however, their characterization at the molecular level is lacking.
in the moth, spodoptera littoralis, the secretion of glycoproteins into the seminal fluid occurs in a daily rhythmic pattern.
the purpose of this study was to characterize seminal fluid glycoproteins in this species and elucidate their role in the process of sperm maturation.
it is produced in the testes and released into the seminal fluid where it interacts with sperm.
