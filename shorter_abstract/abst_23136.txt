we show that the esophagus-specific promoter ed-l <dig> is expressed only in the differentiated cells above the basal layer.
pulse-chase experiments confirmed that complete turnover of the esophageal epithelium in the adult mouse is achieved within 7–10 days.
moreover, we confirmed that esophageal turn-over in the adult mouse does not exceed 7–10 days.
upon doxycycline administration to the compound hnrnp-rtta/teto-h2b-gfp mice, near-complete labeling of all esophageal cells was achieved.
to this aim, we developed and studied a mouse model to allow labeling of esophageal cells with the histone 2b-gfp  fusion protein.
to facilitate the in vivo study of esophageal  cell biology in homeostasis and cancer, novel mouse models are necessary to elicit expression of candidate genes in a tissue-specific and inducible fashion.
to achieve expression in the basal compartment of the esophagus, we subsequently employed a different transgenic model expressing the reverse transactivator rtta2s-m <dig> under the control of the ubiquitous, methylation-free cpg island of the human hnrnpa2b1-cbx <dig> gene .
expression of the h2b-gfp fusion protein was observed upon doxycycline induction but was restricted to the terminally differentiated cells above the basal cell layer.
