co-localisation experiments showed that it is present in the same cells as hvnotch, however not always in the same membrane structures.
the putative notch ligand hyjagged is conserved in cnidarians.
hyjagged mrna is undetectable in adult hydra by in situ hybridisation but is strongly upregulated and easily visible at the border between bud and parent shortly before bud detachment.
in contrast, hyjagged protein is found in all cell types of an adult hydra, where it localises to membranes and endosomes.
moreover, protein distribution of both, hvnotch receptor and hyjagged indicate a more widespread function for these two transmembrane proteins in the adult hydra, which may be regulated by additional factors, possibly involving endocytic pathways.
in the cnidarian hydra it is involved in interstitial stem cell differentiation and in boundary formation during budding.
