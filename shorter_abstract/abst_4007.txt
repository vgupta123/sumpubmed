another, larger subgroup, is suggested to play a predominant role in the response to zinc limitation based on the presence of the corresponding cog0523-encoding genes downstream from putative zur binding sites in many bacterial genomes.
finally, the potential role of cog <dig> in zinc homeostasis is not limited to bacteria.
additionally, zur-dependent expression of cog <dig> and putative paralogs of zinc-dependent proteins may represent a mechanism for hierarchal zinc distribution and zinc sparing in the face of inadequate zinc nutrition.
based on phylogeny and comparative genomics, both the metal specificity and the protein target might vary from one cog <dig> subgroup to another.
we have predicted a link between cog <dig> and regulation by zinc in archaea and show that two cog <dig> genes are induced upon zinc depletion in a eukaryotic reference organism, chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
cog <dig> proteins are, like the nickel chaperones of the ureg family, part of the g3e family of gtpases linking them to metallocenter biosynthesis.
