the array design covers genome-wide common variation , east asian , and european  respectively); most of the variation with a minor allele frequency ≥  <dig>  in  <dig> addiction genes ; and nearly all variation from the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig>  nhlbi go exome sequencing project and hapmap databases in the regions related to smoking behavior and nicotine metabolism: chrna5-chrna3-chrnb <dig> and cyp2a6-cyp2b <dig>  of the  <dig> pilot dna samples derived from blood or cell line biospecimens that were genotyped on the array,  <dig>  passed quality control.
in a genome-wide association analysis of the nicotine metabolite ratio in  <dig> individuals participating in nicotine metabolism laboratory studies, we identified genome-wide significant variants in the cyp2a <dig> region .

this array allows researchers to perform genome-wide, candidate gene, and pathway-based association analyses of addiction, tobacco-use, treatment response, comorbidities, and associated diseases in a standardized, high-throughput platform.
for  <dig> samples that overlapped with hapmap <dig> release  <dig>  the genotype concordance was  <dig>  %.
in passing samples,  <dig>  % of markers passed quality control.
while tobacco control efforts and therapeutic interventions have made good progress in reducing smoking prevalence, challenges remain in optimizing their effectiveness based on patient characteristics, including genetic variation.
we developed a comprehensive genotyping array for addiction research and demonstrated its analytic validity and utility through pilot genotyping of hapmap and study samples.
addictive disorders are a class of chronic, relapsing mental disorders that are responsible for increased risk of mental and medical disorders and represent the largest, potentially modifiable cause of death.
in order to maximize collaborative efforts to advance addiction research, we have developed a genotyping array called smokescreen.
