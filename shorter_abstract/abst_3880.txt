a new feature of mtmdat allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis.
the new mtmdat-haddock pipeline enables direct high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data.
this addition, together with usability improvements in mtmdat, enables high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data.
if 3d structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex.
the algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component rpn <dig> and ubiquitin.
the mtmdat-haddock structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by nmr titration experiments.
the resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by mtmdat from limited proteolysis and modeled by haddock, was compared to the published nmr structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular noe interactions.
mtmdat is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis.
