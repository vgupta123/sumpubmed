the high similarity suggests differences between toxins are due to events beyond transcription of a single cell-type and that their relative potencies during infection may depend on differential effects across cell types within the intestine.
we next performed an enrichment analysis to determine biological functions associated with changes in transcription.
differentially expressed genes were associated with response to external stimuli and apoptotic mechanisms and, at  <dig> hr, were predominately associated with cell-cycle control and dna replication.
to validate our systems approach, we subsequently verified a novel g1/s and known g2/m cell-cycle block and increased apoptosis as predicted from our enrichment analysis.
to better understand their effects in a susceptible cell line, we analyzed the transciptome-wide gene expression response of human ileocecal epithelial cells  after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr of toxin exposure.
we show that toxins elicit very similar changes in the gene expression of hct- <dig> cells, with the tcdb response occurring sooner.
this study shows a successful example of a workflow deriving novel biological insight from transcriptome-wide gene expression.
