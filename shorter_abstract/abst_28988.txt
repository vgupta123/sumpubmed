in the present study, we selected and validated  <dig> snps which are useful in human identification in  <dig>  unrelated samples originating from three different populations .
current forensic dna techniques involve the search for genetic similarities and differences between biological samples.
comparison between in silico and in vitro analysis showed that current snps databases can efficiently improve and facilitate the selection of markers because most of the analyses performed  in more than  <dig>  samples confirmed available population data.
consequently the selection of ideal genomic biomarkers for human identification is crucial in order to ensure the highest stability and reproducibility of results.
a rigorous in silico selection of these markers provided a list of snps with very constant frequencies across the populations tested as demonstrated by the fst values.
furthermore, these snps also showed a high specificity for the human genome .
