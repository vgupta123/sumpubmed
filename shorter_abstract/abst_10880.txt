current chip-seq studies are interested in comparing multiple epigenetic profiles across several cell types and tissues simultaneously for studying constitutive and differential regulation.
yet there are currently few tools can perform joint inference of constitutive and differential regulation in multi-feature-multi-condition contexts with statistical testing.
we propose a novel and powerful method called dcap for simultaneously detecting constitutive and differential regulation of multiple epigenetic factors in multiple samples.
many of them only identify binary rather than quantitative variation, which are sensitive to threshold choices.
we further show in the mouse dataset that dcap captures genomic regions showing significant signal variations for tal <dig> occupancy between two mouse erythroid cell lines.

we show in the human dataset that the cell-type specific regulatory loci detected by dcap are significantly enriched near genes with cell-type specific functions and disease relevance.
existing tools either test regulatory variation for one factor in multiple samples at a time, or for multiple factors in one or two samples.
the novel tal <dig> occupancy loci detected only by dcap are highly enriched with gata <dig> occupancy and differential gene expression, while those detected only by other methods are not.
simultaneous analysis of multiple epigenetic features in many samples can gain substantial power and specificity than analyzing individual features and/or samples separately.
