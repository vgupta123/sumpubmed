low efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer  has been widely addressed with high incidence of placental abnormalities due to genetic and epigenetic modifications.
this study provides the first insight into genome wide mirna expression, their role in regulation of trophoblast differentiation as well as abnormal placental development in somatic cell nuclear transfer pregnancies to pave the way to improve the efficiency of cloning by nuclear transfer.
the present study has been carried out to identify the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas, their functional associations and mechanism of regulation in bovine placentas derived from artificial insemination , in vitro production  and nt pregnancies.
cell specific localization mirnas in blastocysts and expression profiling of embryos and placentas at different developmental stages identified that the major deregulation of mirnas exhibited in placentas at day  <dig> of pregnancies is found to be less dependent on global dna methylation, rather than on aberrant mirna biogenesis molecules.
along with other factors, aberrant ago <dig> expression was observed to be associated with multiple defects in trophoblast differentiation through deregulation of mirnas mediated mechanisms.
these aberrant mirna activities might be associated with genetic and epigenetic modifications in abnormal placentogenesis due to maldifferentiation of early trophoblast cell lineage in nt and ivp pregnancies.
this study reveals a massive deregulation of mirnas as chromosomal cluster or mirna families without sex-linkage in nt and in-vitro derived ivp placentas.
