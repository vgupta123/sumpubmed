disruption of genes for either the glucocorticoid receptor  or the nfib transcription factors results in perinatal lethality due to lung immaturity.
finally, we looked for enrichment of  <dig> recently published transcription factor motifs in the promoters of these putative target genes and found that the nfib and glucocorticoid receptor motifs were among the most enriched, suggesting that a subset of these genes may be directly activated by nfib and nr3c <dig>

we analyzed the roles of these two transcription factors in regulating transcription using chip-seq data for nfib, and rna expression data and motif analysis for both.
our new chip-seq data for nfib in lung at e <dig>  shows that nfib binds to a nfi motif.
lung maturation is a late fetal developmental event in both mice and humans.
this similarity suggests that the two genes may co-regulate a specific set of genes essential for lung maturation.
our data provide the first evidence for nfib and nr3c <dig> co-regulating genes related to lung maturation.
in both knockouts, the phenotype includes excess cell proliferation, failure of saccularization and reduced expression of markers of epithelial differentiation.
using available microarray data from nr3c1-ko mice, we further identified  <dig> genes that are under-expressed in both nfib and nr3c <dig> knockouts, an overlap which is  <dig>  times larger than what would be expected by chance.
