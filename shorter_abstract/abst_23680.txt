the integration of protein-protein interaction networks along with disease datasets and contextual information is an important tool in unraveling the molecular basis of diseases.
the application of gene prioritization can enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and aid in the discovery of drug targets.
relatively high predictive performance  was observed when classifying ad and normal gene expression profiles from individuals using leave-one-out cross validation.
an important challenge now is to identify meaningful disease-associated genes from a long list of candidate genes implicated by these analyses.
this approach correctly identified key ad susceptible genes: psen <dig> and traf <dig>  biological process enrichment analysis revealed the prioritized genes are modulated in ad pathogenesis including: regulation of neurogenesis and generation of neurons.
