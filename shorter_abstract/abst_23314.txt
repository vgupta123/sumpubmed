in preparation for migration from freshwater to marine habitats, atlantic salmon  undergo smoltification, a transformation that includes the acquisition of hyposmoregulatory capacity.
in atlantic salmon smolts, igfbp <dig> −5a,−5b <dig> −5b <dig> −6b <dig> and−6b <dig> transcripts are highly expressed in gill.

igfbp5a,−5b <dig> and−5b <dig> mrna levels did not change during smolting, but each had lower levels following a sw exposure in march.
we measured mrna levels of branchial and hepatic igfbps during smoltification , desmoltification  and following seawater  exposure in march and may.
indicative of smoltification, we observed increased branchial nka activity, nkcc <dig> and cftr <dig> transcription in may.
igfs interact with a suite of igf binding proteins  that modulate hormone activity.
our data suggest that dynamic expression of particular igfbps accompanies smoltification and sw challenges; thus, transcriptional control of igfbps may provide a mechanism for the local modulation of igf activity in salmon gill.
