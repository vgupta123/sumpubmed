here we present spabbats, an algorithm based on boolean satisfiability  that computes alternative metabolic pathways between input and output species in a reconstructed network.
spabbats is the first application of sat techniques to metabolic problems.
we deleted the genes for the glutamate dehydrogenases of the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis and isolated suppressor mutant strains able to grow on glutamate as single carbon source.
several computational methods exist to suggest rational genetic interventions that improve the productivity of industrial strains.
our sat approach proposed candidate alternative pathways which were decisive to pinpoint the exact mutation of the suppressor strain.
