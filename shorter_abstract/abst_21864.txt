the ntmmp <dig> gene is expressed constitutively at a low level but can be induced by exposure to bacterial pathogens.
given its induction in response to bacterial pathogens and its localization in the plasma membrane, we propose a role in pathogen defense at the cell periphery.
exchanging the catalytic domain of ntmmp <dig> with green fluorescent protein  facilitated subcellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy, showing the protein is normally inserted into the plasma membrane.
our biochemical analysis of ntmmp <dig> together with bioinformatic data on the primary sequence indicate that ntmmp <dig> is a constitutively-active protease.
