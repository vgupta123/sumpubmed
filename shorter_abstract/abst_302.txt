the model ikf <dig> captures important metabolic capabilities of b. cenocepacia j <dig> with a particular focus on the biosyntheses of key metabolic virulence factors to assist in understanding the mechanism of disease infection and identifying potential drug targets.
there is a strong demand to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig> to systematically analyze its metabolic capabilities and its virulence traits, and to search for potential clinical therapy targets.
we reconstructed the genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  an iterative reconstruction process led to the establishment of a robust model, ikf <dig>  which accounts for  <dig>  genes,  <dig> internal reactions, and  <dig> metabolites.
as the first genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  ikf <dig> allows a systematic study of the metabolic properties of b. cenocepacia and its key metabolic virulence factors affecting the cf community.
burkholderia cenocepacia is a threatening nosocomial epidemic pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis  or a compromised immune system.
strain b. cenocepacia j <dig> is the most infectious isolate from cf patients.
a total of  <dig> essential enzymes were identified as potential therapeutic targets.
the model was tested through biolog assays.
based on the model, the genome annotation of b. cenocepacia j <dig> was refined and  <dig> genes were properly re-annotated.
gene and enzyme essentiality were analyzed to provide further insights into the genome function and architecture.
