the test was used on  <dig> samples of seafood  and could successfully detect the presence of different or additional species that were not identified on the labelling of canned tuna, tuna salad and sauce samples.
moreover, the method is highly flexible: publicly available sequence information on mitochondrial genomes are rapidly increasing for most species, facilitating the choice of target sequences and the improvement of resolution of the test.
the reported application allowed the discrimination among  <dig> fish species of the scombridae family with high commercial interest such as mackerels, bonitos and tunas which are often present in processed seafood.
this limits the choice of target regions harbouring a sufficient number of diagnostic polymorphisms.
dna barcodes are a global standard for species identification and have countless applications in the medical, forensic and alimentary fields, but few barcoding methods work efficiently in samples in which dna is degraded, e.g.
this is particularly important for discrimination of marine and aquaculture species for which genome information is still limited.
the method described here uses existing pcr and sequencing methodologies to detect mitochondrial dna polymorphisms in complex matrices such as foods.
cocktail of primers are designed for pcr using publicly available sequences of the target sequence.
they are composed of a fixed 5' region and of variable 3' cocktail portions that allow amplification of any member of a group of species of interest.
the population of short amplicons is directly sequenced and indexed using primers containing a longer 5' region and the non polymorphic portion of the cocktail portion.
