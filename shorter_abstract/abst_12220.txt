a combined computational and experimental approach enabled us to identify  <dig> intergenic regions encoding srnas in p. aeruginosa.
in both p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens the stress sigma factor rpos was essential for rgsa expression.
most of these srnas have been discovered by a combination of computational and experimental methods.
our results also confirm that several gga motifs are required in an srna for sequestration of the rsma protein.
in p. fluorescens cha <dig>  an rgsa homolog was also expressed under positive gaca control.
rsmx, rsmy and rsmz contain multiple unpaired gga motifs and control the expression of target mrnas at the translational level, by sequestration of translational repressor proteins of the rsma family.
this 120-nt srna contained a single gga motif and, unlike rsmx, rsmy and rsmz, was unable to derepress translation of the hcna gene , but contributed to the bacterium's resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
small rnas  are widespread among bacteria and have diverse regulatory roles.
in the biocontrol bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens cha <dig>  three gaca-controlled srnas  regulate the response to oxidative stress and the expression of extracellular products including biocontrol factors.
