after ingestion of denv- <dig>  midgut infections in chetumal mosquitoes were characterized by a peak in virus titers between  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection .
the eip is conditioned by the kinetics and tropisms of virus replication in its vector.
here we document the virogenesis of denv- <dig> in newly-colonized aedes aegypti mosquitoes from chetumal, mexico in order to understand better the effect of vector-virus interactions on dengue transmission.
to be transmitted by its mosquito vector, dengue virus  must infect midgut epithelial cells, replicate and disseminate into the hemocoel, and finally infect the salivary glands, which is essential for transmission.
our results suggest that the eip of denv- <dig> in its vector may be shorter that the previously reported and that the tracheal system may facilitate denv- <dig> dissemination from the midgut.
the amount of viral antigen and viral titers in the midgut then declined, but viral rna levels remained stable.
unlike in the midgut, the amount of viral antigen  increased with time.
the presence of denv- <dig> antigen in the trachea was positively correlated with virus dissemination from the midgut.
