the core of our novel approach is the following: first, the original image is rotated in an arbitrary direction and each rotated image is opened with a single straight line-segment structuring element.
a reliable extraction technique for resolving multiple spots in light or electron microscopic images is essential in investigations of the spatial distribution and dynamics of specific proteins inside cells and tissues.
a new method to extract closely located, small target spots from biological images is proposed.
our method achieved effective spot extraction under various image conditions, including aggregated target spots, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and large variations in the background intensity.
the results showed the better performance of our method.
this method starts with a simple but practical operation based on the extended morphological top-hat transformation to subtract an uneven background.
second, the opened images are unified and then subtracted from the original image.
