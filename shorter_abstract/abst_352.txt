as expected, simulations also show that this new clustering algorithm leads to a reduction in the length of the confidence interval of qtl location provided that across studies there are enough observed qtl for each underlying true qtl location.
secondly, assuming that qtl can be projected on the consensus map, metaqtl offers a new clustering approach based on a gaussian mixture model to decide how many qtl underly the distribution of the observed qtl.
contrary to existing methods, metaqtl offers a complete statistical process to establish a consensus model for both the marker and the qtl positions on the whole genome.
integration of multiple results from quantitative trait loci  studies is a key point to understand the genetic determinism of complex traits.
up to now many efforts have been made by public database developers to facilitate the storage, compilation and visualization of multiple qtl mapping experiment results.
however, studying the congruency between these results still remains a complex task.
the usefulness of our approach is illustrated on published qtl detection results of flowering time in maize.
we demonstrate using simulations that the usual model choice criteria from mixture model literature perform relatively well in this context.
