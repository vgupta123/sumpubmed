regulatory mechanisms that have been identified include phosphorylation of irs proteins on tyrosine and serine residues and ubiquitination of lysine residues.
using the sos recruitment yeast two-hybrid system we found that irs- <dig> and histone deacetylase  <dig>  interact in the cytoplasmic compartment of yeast cells.
our results show that irs- <dig> is an acetylated protein, a post-translational modification that has not been previously described.
tsa-induced increases in acetylation of irs- <dig> were concomitant with increases in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin.
acetylation of irs- <dig> is permissive for tyrosine phosphorylation and facilitates insulin-stimulated signal transduction.
specific inhibition of hdac <dig> may increase insulin sensitivity in otherwise insulin resistant conditions.
the interaction mapped to the c-terminus of irs- <dig> and was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation in vitro of recombinant irs- <dig> and hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> bound to irs- <dig> in mammalian cells treated with phorbol ester or after prolonged treatment with insulin/igf- <dig> and also in the livers of ob/ob mice but not ptp1b knockout mice.
insulin receptor substrate  proteins are key moderators of insulin action.
these effects were confirmed using rna interference against hdac <dig>  indicating that hdac <dig> specifically prevents phosphorylation of irs- <dig> by the insulin receptor.
their specific regulation determines downstream protein-protein interactions and confers specificity on growth factor signalling.
we found that irs- <dig> is an acetylated protein, of which the acetylation is increased by treatment of cells with trichostatin a , an inhibitor of hdac activity.
