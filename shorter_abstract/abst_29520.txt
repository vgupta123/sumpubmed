host induced pathogen apoptosis and pathogen induced host cell apoptosis are often involved in fungal infections.
we also found that rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c has redox potential, peroxidase activity, and spectral properties similar to human and horse cytochrome c proteins.
rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c can activate human caspase- <dig> in hela cell extracts and it possesses similar physical and spectral properties as human and horse cytochrome c. this protein was found to have a previously unknown potential to activate human caspase- <dig>  an important step in the apoptosis cascade.
dna sequence encoding rhizopus arrhizus cytochrome c was cloned and expressed in e. coli.
both native and recombinant cytochrome c were purified using ion exchange followed by gel filtration chromatography.
