a large number of natural antisense transcripts have been identified in human and mouse genomes.
applying this technique to human jurkat cells, we identified antisense transcription at  <dig>  exonic loci of  <dig>  unigene clusters.
our results suggest that with a modified protocol affymetrix human, mouse and rat exon arrays can be used as a routine method for genome-wide analysis of antisense transcription in these genomes.
through modification of the cdna synthesis protocol, we labeled single-strand cdna in the reverse orientation as in the standard protocol, thus enabling the detection of antisense transcripts using the same array.
many of these antisense transcripts were not observed previously and some were validated by orientation-specific rt-pcr.
here we show that affymetrix exon arrays, which were designed to detect conventional transcripts in the sense orientation, can be used to monitor antisense expression across all exonic loci in mammalian genomes.
study of their potential functions clearly requires cost-efficient method for expression analysis.
