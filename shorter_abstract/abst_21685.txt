by repurposing expression microarray probes, we identified  <dig> lncrnas in bone marrow-derived macrophages  and classified them to enhancer-like lncrnas  and promoter-associated lncrnas  according to chromatin signatures defined by relative levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  fifteen elncrnas and  <dig> plncrnas are differentially expressed upon lps stimulation.
also, our results suggest that lncrnas can be important regulators of lps-induced innate immune response in bmdms.
also, the regulation of both elncrnas and plncrnas expression is associated with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac.
we established an integrative microarray analysis pipeline for profiling lncrnas.
though long non-coding rnas  are emerging as critical regulators of immune responses, whether they are involved in lps-activated tlr <dig> signaling pathway and how is their expression regulated in mouse macrophages are still unexplored.
crucially, many identified lps-regulated lncrnas, such as lncrna-nfkb <dig> and lncrna-rel, locate near to immune response protein-coding genes.
