the ets transcription factor elf <dig>  is highly expressed in the mammary gland and plays an important role in its development and differentiation.
a subset of these target genes demonstrates higher expression levels in elf5-null mammary glands suggesting a repressive functional role for this transcription factor.
finally, using elf5-null mammary epithelial cells and mammary glands, we show that loss of elf <dig> in vivo leads to up regulation of ccnd <dig> and an altered expression pattern in luminal cells.
although the molecular mechanisms that underlie the developmental block in elf <dig> null mammary glands are beginning to be unraveled, this investigation has been hampered by limited information about the identity of elf5-target genes.
to address this shortcoming, in this study we have performed chip-cloning experiments to identify the specific genomic segments that are occupied by elf <dig> in pregnant mouse mammary glands.
our studies offer new toolbox in examining the biological role of elf <dig> in mammary gland development and differentiation.
we identify a novel elf5-binding segment upstream of the ccnd <dig> gene and demonstrate that elf <dig> can transcriptionally repress ccnd <dig> by directly binding to the proximal promoter region.
