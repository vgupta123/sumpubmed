this transcriptomic data represents an important source of information for further studies on sturgeon species.
as a direct consequence, world-wide efforts have been made to develop sturgeon aquaculture programmes for caviar production.
the intense fishing pressure on wild stocks to harvest caviar has caused in the last decades a dramatic decline of their distribution and abundance leading the international union for conservation of nature to list them as the more endangered group of species.
in this context, the characterization of the genes involved in sex determination could provide relevant information for the selective farming of the more profitable females.
the  <dig> sequencing of two cdna libraries from the gonads and brain of one male and one female full-sib a. naccarii, yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads respectively, which, after strict quality control, were iterative assembled into more than  <dig>  high quality ests.
