by preventing female resistance, we show that females make a substantial contribution towards shortening copulations.
the reproductive behaviour of drosophila montana suggests the occurrence of sexual conflict over the duration of copulation.
copulation time is a trait subject to sexual conflict.
we staged matings under different sex ratio conditions, and provide evidence that copulation duration is a form of male reproductive investment that responds to the perceived intensity of sperm competition as predicted by game theoretical models.
further, we investigated potential benefits to persistent males, and costs to females coerced into longer matings.
mating durations exceeding female optima serve males as a form of 'extended mate guarding': by inducing mating refractoriness in the female, a male extends the time over which its sperm is exclusively used to sire progeny and reduces the likelihood of the female being reinseminated by a competitor.
