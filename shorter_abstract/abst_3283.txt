chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic potential is compromised in old bm-mscs.
stimulation with a cocktail mixture of bone morphogenetic protein , fibroblast growth factor  and insulin-like growth factor  induced cardiomyogenesis in young bm-mscs but not old bm-mscs.
significant differences in the expression of gap junction protein connexin- <dig> were observed between young and old bm-mscs.
young and old bm-mscs fused with neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes in co-culture and expressed key cardiac transcription factors and structural proteins.
significantly higher levels of dna double strand break marker Î³-h2ax and diminished levels of telomerase activity were observed in old bm-mscs.
we demonstrated that the expression profile of stemness markers was altered in bm-mscs derived from old rats.
the results suggest age related differences in the differentiation capacity of bm-mscs.
bm-mscs from young rats  expressed oct- <dig>  sox- <dig> and nanog, but we failed to detect sox- <dig> and nanog in bm-mscs from older animals .
the efficacy of adult stem cells is known to be compromised as a function of age.
