despite the wide application of rna-seq techniques to generate experimental data in the last few years, few computational methods are available to analyze this huge amount of transcription data.
the method predicted a soybean nodulation-related gene regulatory network consisting of  <dig> regulatory modules common for all three stages, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> modules separately for the first, second and third stage, each containing both a group of co-expressed genes and several transcription factors collaboratively controlling their expression under different conditions.
the computational methods for constructing gene regulatory networks from rna-seq expression data of hundreds or even thousands of genes are particularly lacking and urgently needed.
high-throughput rna sequencing  is a revolutionary technique to study the transcriptome of a cell under various conditions at a systems level.
we developed an automated bioinformatics method to predict gene regulatory networks from the quantitative expression values of differentially expressed genes based on rna-seq transcriptome data of a cell in different stages and conditions, integrating transcriptional, genomic and gene function data.
the method can generate valuable hypotheses for interpreting biological data and designing biological experiments such as chip-seq, rna interference, and yeast two hybrid experiments.
we applied the method to the rna-seq transcriptome data generated for soybean root hair cells in three different development stages of nodulation after rhizobium infection.
we developed a computational method to reliably reconstruct gene regulatory networks from rna-seq transcriptome data.
