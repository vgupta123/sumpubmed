19â€“ <dig> february  <dig> seventh annual mcbios conference.
enzyme dynamics has recently been shown to be crucial for structure-function relationship.
the structure relevance of the enzyme dynamics was discussed with reference to the three dimensional structure of the enzyme.
hdx mass spectrometry revealed significant intrinsic dynamics for the xylanase enzyme.
hdx mass spectrometry is a powerful high-throughput platform to identify the key regions protected during the ligand binding and to explore the molecular mechanisms of the enzyme function.
the hdx mass spectrometry analysis of cell wall degrading enzymes has provided a novel platform to guide the rational design of enzymes.
in particular, the technique has never been used for analyzing cell wall degrading enzymes.
we hereby used xylanase as a model to explore the potential of hdx mass spectrometry for studying cell wall degrading enzymes.
different regions of the enzymes are differentially stabilized in the apo enzyme.
hdx mass spectrometry revealed strong dynamics-function relevance and such relevance can be explored for the future enzyme improvement.
