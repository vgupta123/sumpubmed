rats were instrumented with a telemetric system for the measurement of systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure , pulse pressure , heart rate  and core body temperature .
hr in iso  increased during the time of surgical tolerance whereas a hr decrease was observed in kx  and mmf .
additionally, we observed a peaked increase of hr  during the wake-up period with iso and an increase of pp  in mmf during the time of surgical tolerance.
forty minutes after induction, iso delivery was terminated and mmf was antagonized with atipamezole-flumazenil-naloxone  whereas kx was not antagonized.
the slightest alterations of bp, hr and bt were observed using kx, but the long wake-up and recovery period suggest the need for prolonged monitoring.
this study investigated effects on cardiovascular parameters during anaesthesia with isoflurane , ketamine-xylazine  or a combination of medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl  in rats throughout induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia.
the anaesthesias influenced very differently the cardiovascular parameters measured in wistar rats.
iso caused mild hypotension and increased hr whereas mmf produced a marked hypertension and a significant decrease of hr.
