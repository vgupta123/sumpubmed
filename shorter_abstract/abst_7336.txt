here we report cnv analysis of publicly available, high-density microarray data files for  <dig> mouse tail samples, including  <dig> mice that had not been characterized for cnvs previously.
copy number variation is an important dimension of genetic diversity and has implications in development and disease.

cnv-gene overlap was associated with lipid metabolism, pheromone response and olfaction compared to immunity, carbohydrate metabolism and amino-acid metabolism for wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains, respectively.
a total of  <dig> genic copy number variable regions  were selected for experimental confirmation by droplet digital pcr .
using two subspecies of wild-caught mus musculus, we identified putative cnvs unique to those subspecies and show this diversity is better captured by wild-derived laboratory strains than by the classical laboratory strains.
the analysis we present is a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of cnvs in mus musculus, which increases the number of known variants in the species and will accelerate the identification of novel variants in future studies.
we find significant differences in the degree of cnv uniqueness  and the nature of cnv-gene overlap between wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains.
