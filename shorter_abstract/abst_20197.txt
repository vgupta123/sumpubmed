many are also predicted to encode for proteins involved in secondary metabolism and other functions associated with disease.
the genomic resources we have contributed will be useful for the identification of genes that contribute to the phenotypic variation and niche specialization that have been reported among members of the f. graminearum species complex.
genes that were common between isolates contained high levels of nucleotide variation and may be pseudogenes, allelic, or under diversifying selection.
a comparison of genome structure and gene content revealed a 93–99% overlap across all ten genomes.
these genes were co-localized in telomeric regions and select regions within chromosomes with a corresponding increase in snps and indels.
despite being closely related, these species and individuals within species have distinct phenotypic differences in toxin production and pathogenicity, with some isolates reported as non-pathogenic on certain hosts.
we identified more than 700 k base pairs  of single nucleotide polymorphisms , insertions, and deletions  within common regions of the genome, which validated the species and genetic populations reported within species.
in this report, we compare genomes and gene content of six new isolates from the species complex, including the first available genomes of f. asiaticum and f. meridionale, with four other genomes reported in previous studies.
the fusarium graminearum species complex is composed of many distinct fungal species that cause several diseases in economically important crops, including fusarium head blight of wheat.
