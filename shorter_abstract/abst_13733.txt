a significant reduction in expression level  in both families was only observed for cafad2-c <dig> together with significantly different c18: <dig> and pufa levels in oil.
the individual effect of each cafad <dig> gene on oil composition was investigated through studying transgenic lines  for differential expression levels in relation to the composition of seed-oil.
four or five transgene insertions are characterized in the progeny  of wg19- <dig> in contrast to a single insertion in the t <dig> progeny of wg4- <dig>  for the individual t2-plants of both families , seed-specific silencing of cafad2-c <dig> and cafad2-c <dig> was observed in several individual t2-plants but, on average in both families, the level of silencing of these genes was not significant.
crambe abyssinica produces high erucic acid  in the seed oil, which can be further increased by reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acid  levels.
cafad2-c <dig> expression is highly correlated to levels of c18: <dig>  and pufa , which suggests that cafad2-c <dig> is the most important one for changing the oil composition of crambe.
