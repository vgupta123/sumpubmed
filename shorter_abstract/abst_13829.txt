amongst the reasons for the discrepancy may be methodological shortcomings, such as high mortality and outcome variability, in the preclinical studies.
a common approach in animal stroke experiments is that a) focal cerebral ischemia is inflicted, b) some type of treatment is administered and c) the infarct sizes are assessed.
the direct and endothelin methods rendered lower mortality rate, whereas the embolus method increased it compared to the filament method.
the wistar strain and intraluminal filament procedure using a silicone coated filament was found optimal in lowering infarct size variability.
we therefore meta-analyzed data from  <dig> control groups described in  <dig> articles to find out how rat strain, procedure for causing focal cerebral ischemia and the type of filament coating affected mortality and infarct size variability.
however, within this paradigm, the researcher has to make numerous methodological decisions, including choosing rat strain and type of surgical procedure.
the current article provides means for researchers to adjust their middle cerebral artery occlusion  protocols to minimize infarct size variability and mortality.
