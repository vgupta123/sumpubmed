mlva results disclosed the genetic diversity f. tularensis and identified one genotype as the most prevalent among the investigated ticks in china.
in the present study, the prevalence of francisella tularensis in ticks was investigated during an epidemiological surveillance in china and then we measured their genetic diversity by conducting multiple-locus variable- number tandem repeat analysis .
the positive rates were significantly different among tick species, with dermacentor silvarum and ixodes persulatus responsible for all positive numbers.
holarctica and mlva disclosed genetic diversity.
all f. tularensis that were detected in ticks belonged to f. tularensis subsp.
another subtype belonging to f. tularensis subsp.
the study showed two tick species, d. silvarum and i. persulatus harboring the pathogen of tularemia in natural environment, indicating these two tick species might have a role in tularemia existence in china.
