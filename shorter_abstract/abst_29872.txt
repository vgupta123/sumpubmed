endothelial progenitor cells  play a fundamental role in post-natal vascular repair, yet epcs from different anatomic locations possess unique biological properties.
knocking down mir- <dig> levels in cb-epcs suppressed cell migration and microtubule formation, while overexpressing mir- <dig> in pb-epcs helped to recapitulate some of cb-epc functions.
our results show the foundation for a more detailed understanding of epcs from different anatomic sources.
epcs from cb expressed abundant genes involved in cell cycle, hypoxia signalling and blood vessel development, correlating with the phenotypes that cb-epcs proliferated more rapidly, migrated faster, and formed tubule structure more efficiently.
