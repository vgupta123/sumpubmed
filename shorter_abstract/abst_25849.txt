to investigate mechanisms of mycoparasitism, we compared the transcriptional responses of cosmopolitan opportunistic species and powerful biocontrol agents trichoderma atroviride and t. virens with tropical ecologically restricted species t. reesei during confrontations with a plant pathogenic fungus rhizoctonia solani.
t. virens, on the other hand, expressed mainly the genes for biosynthesis of gliotoxin, respective precursors and also glutathione, which is necessary for gliotoxin biosynthesis.
the majority of differentially regulated genes were orthologues present in all three species or both in t. atroviride and t. virens, indicating that the regulation of expression of these genes is different in the three trichoderma spp.
exhibited a strikingly different transcriptomic response already before physical contact with alien hyphae.
t. atroviride expressed an array of genes involved in production of secondary metabolites, gh <dig> ÃŸ-glucanases, various proteases and small secreted cysteine rich proteins.
in contrast, t. reesei increased the expression of genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases, and of the genes involved in solute transport.
