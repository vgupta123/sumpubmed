the endogenous sirnas were found mainly derived from transposable elements  or transposons and the natural antisense transcripts .
sirnas are mainly derived from transposable elements ; while natural antisense transcripts -derived sirnas were much less.
characterization of the genome-wide transcription of the sncrnas will be a major step in understanding of the parasite biology.
small endogenous non-coding rnas  such as small interfering rna , microrna and other small rna transcripts are derived from distinct loci in the genome and play critical roles in rna-mediated gene silencing mechanisms in plants and metazoa.
among the identified mirna transcripts, there were  <dig> unique to s. japonicum and  <dig> that belonged to  <dig> mirna families are common to other metazoan lineages.
in contrast to other organisms, the te-derived sirnas in s. japonicum were more predominant than other sncrnas including micrornas .
genes that encoded mirnas are mainly located in clusters within the genome of s. japonicum.
many mirna and endogenous sirna transcripts were identified in s. japonicum and the amount of sirna was at least  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more than that of mirna in both schistosomulum and adult worm stages respectively.
these mirnas were either ubiquitously expressed, or they exhibited specific expression patterns related to the developmental stages or sex.
both mirna and sirnas are potentially important regulators in the development of schistosomal parasites.
the development of the zoonotic parasite schistosoma japonicum parasite includes multiple steps of morphological alterations and biological differentiations, which provide a unique model for studies on the functions of small rnas.
a majority of mirna transcripts identified in the parasite were species-specific and the expression of certain mirnas was found developmentally regulated.
