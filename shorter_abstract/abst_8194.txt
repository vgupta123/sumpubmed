we assume two functional states of a gene - expressed or unexpressed - and propose a robust method to estimate gene expression states using an order relationship between pm and mm measures.
microarray technology is a high-throughput method for measuring the expression levels of thousand of genes simultaneously.
it should be noted that not all observed intensities are associated with expressed genes and many of those are associated with unexpressed genes, of which measured values express mere noise due to non-specific binding, cross-hybridization, or stray signals.
the observed intensities combine a non-specific binding, which is a major disadvantage with microarray data.
the implicit assumption that all genes are expressed leads to poor performance of microarray data analyses.
the proposed qualitative evaluation, 'probability of a gene being expressed', is a useful indicator for improving microarray data analysis.
we identified the candidate genes for which expression states differed  when compared between two outcomes.
expression states - expressed or unexpressed - correspond to the most fundamental gene function 'on' and 'off', which can lead to biologically meaningful results.
the affymetrix genechip assigned a mismatch  probe with the intention of measuring non-specific binding, but various opinions exist regarding usefulness of mm measures.
the usefulness of 'probability of a gene being expressed' is illustrated through an exploration of candidate genes involved in neuroblastoma prognosis.
