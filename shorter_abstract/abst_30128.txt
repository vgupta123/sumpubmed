the first was a promoter element from commelina yellow mottle virus , and the second was the rolc promoter from agrobacterium rhizogenes.
to assess the importance of this regulation to whole-plant growth and carbon partitioning, atsuc <dig> cdna was expressed from two exotic, phloem-specific promoters in a mutant background debilitated for atsuc <dig> function.
atsuc <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana encodes a phloem-localized sucrose/proton symporter required for efficient photoassimilate transport from source tissues to sink tissues.
atsuc <dig> plays a key role in coordinating the demands of sink tissues with the output capacity of source leaves, and in maintaining phloem hydrostatic pressure during changes in plant-water balance.
expressing atsuc <dig> from promoters that foster efficient phloem transport but are subject to regulatory cascades different from the endogenous sucrose/proton symporter genes has implications for biotechnology.
