differential coexpression over age generates significant and biologically relevant information about the genes producing it.
generalizing differential coexpression analysis to many time points presents a methodological challenge.
our method is based on the use of the haar basis set to efficiently represent changes in coexpression at multiple time scales, and thus represents a principled and generalizable extension of the idea of differential coexpression to life stage data.
our haar basis methodology for determining age-related differential coexpression performs better than other tested methods.
the haar basis set also lends itself to ready interpretation in terms of both evolutionary and physiological mechanisms of aging and can be seen as a natural generalization of two-category differential coexpression.
further, we examine the statistical properties of our measure of differential coexpression and establish that the results are significant both statistically and by an improvement in semantic similarity.
differential coexpression is a change in coexpression between genes that may reflect 'rewiring' of transcriptional networks.
while both coexpression and differential expression of genes have been previously studied in life stage change or aging, differential coexpression has not.
we validated the methodology by testing our ability to reconstruct gene ontology  categories using our measure of differential coexpression and compared this result to using coexpression alone.
