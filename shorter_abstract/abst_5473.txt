here, we present the complete genome sequence of dar <dig>  a strain of the st772-mrsa-v lineage from india, and investigate its genomic characteristics in regards to antibiotic resistance and virulence factors.
antibiotic resistance was further augmented by chromosomal mutations and redundancy of resistance genes.

we discovered numerous and redundant resistance genes associated with mobile genetic elements  and known core genome mutations that explain the highly antibiotic resistant phenotype of dar <dig>  staphylococcal toxins and superantigens, including the leukotoxin panton-valentinin leukocidin, were predominantly associated with genomic islands and the phage φ-ind772pvl.
the complete genome of dar <dig> provides a valuable resource for future investigations into the global dissemination and phylogeography of st772-mrsa-v.
some of these mobile resistance and virulence factors were variably present in other strains of the st772-mrsa-v lineage.
