sequence analyses revealed that the flanking regions of the chromosomally located gene contained sequences of mobile genetic elements, indicating a probable spread among different strains by horizontal gene transfer.
even though flanked by mobile genetic elements and three different genetic regions upstream of the gene, most probably indicating horizontal gene transfer events, the adhesin gene was significantly linked with strains of avian origin.
extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  represent a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria which are implicated in a large range of infections in humans and animals.
in accordance with this hypothesis, the adhesin was found to be present not only in different phylogenetic groups of extraintestinal pathogenic but also of commensal e. coli strains, yielding a significant association with strains of avian origin.
a specific antibody was raised against this protein and expression of the adhesin was shown under laboratory conditions.
due to the nucleotide sequence similarity of 98% to a recently published adhesin-related gene, located on plasmid papec-o1-colbm, the name aata  was adopted from that study.
the open reading frame of the gene spans a  <dig>  bp region leading to a putative 124-kda adhesive protein.
thus, we made use of suppression subtractive hybridization and compared apec strain imt <dig>  with human uropathogenic e. coli strain cft <dig>  to identify factors which may complete the currently existing model of apec pathogenicity and further elucidate the position of this avian pathoype within the whole expec group.
our data substantiate that aata might not only be of relevance in apec pathogenicity but also in facilitating their reservoir life style in the chicken intestine, which might pave the way for future intestinal preventive strategies.
