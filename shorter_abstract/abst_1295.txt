these proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ran gtpases and bind chromatin via histones.
subsequent to the revelation of this sequence homology, evidence was presented showing that uvr <dig> activity involves interaction with chromatin at the loci of some target genes through histone binding.
moreover, fusion of a vp <dig> activation domain to uvr <dig> did not alter expression of proposed uvr <dig> target genes in transient gene expression assays.
this has led us to conclude that the cellular activity of uvr <dig> likely does not involve its specific binding to chromatin at target genes.
plants perceive uv-b through the uv resistance locus  <dig>  photoreceptor and uvr <dig> activation leads to changes in gene expression such as those associated with uv-b acclimation and stress tolerance.
in contrast to human rcc <dig>  recombinant uvr <dig> also does not bind nucleosomes in vitro.
