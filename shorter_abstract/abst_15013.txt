tams likely play a role in the development of canine colorectal tumors.
further studies to determine the clinical significance of these parameters for prognostic, chemo-preventive and chemotherapeutic purposes in canine colorectal tumors are recommended.
the results suggest that ki- <dig> index and mcc are associated with malignancy in canine crc.
ki- <dig> index in crc  was strongly correlated  with mitotic index .
quantitative assessment of mcs and ki- <dig> coupled with mitotic index and other clinical parameters may help in evaluating malignancy in canine crc.
this has not been assessed in canine crc.
given similar genetic abnormalities between human and canine crc, we assessed ki- <dig> and mitotic indices, tams and mc count  in canine crc .
ki- <dig> index, tams and mcc in canine crc were recorded for the first time in this study.
ki- <dig> index and mcc are associated with malignancy in canine crc.
ki <dig> index, tumor associated macrophages  and mast cells  are associated with malignancies in animal and human neoplasms including colorectal carcinomas .
higher average tams were counted in adenomas  and in crc  than in the control , although the differences were not significant .
