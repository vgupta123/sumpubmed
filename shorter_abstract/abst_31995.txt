further studies are necessary to investigate the physiological roles of this receptor.
the receptor has been deeply remodelled through evolution by the mutation of numerous amino acids and by the addition of a long c-terminal tail.
this study demonstrated that there are only three members in the melatonin receptor subfamily with one of them  undergoing rapid evolution from fishes and birds to mammals.
it was necessary to also study the synteny of this gene to reach this conclusion because classical mathematical models that estimate orthology and build phylogenetic trees were not sufficient.
another receptor, the melatonin related receptor known as gpr <dig>  found exclusively in mammals and later identified as a member of the melatonin receptor subfamily because of its identity to the three melatonin receptors despite its absence of affinity for melatonin.
these alterations have modified its affinity for melatonin and probably affected its interactions with the other two known melatonin receptors mt <dig> and mt <dig> that are encoded by mel1a and mel1b genes respectively.
using an in silico approach, we demonstrated that gpr <dig> is the ortholog of the high affinity mel1c receptor.
