natural isolates of b. bassiana show up to 10-fold differences in virulence between the most and the least virulent isolate.
a high-quality, near-complete genome assembly was achieved for the highly virulent isolate bb <dig>  which was compared to the assemblies of the four other isolates.
entomopathogenic fungi such as beauveria bassiana are promising biological agents for control of malaria mosquitoes.
moreover, a putative new mat gene  was detected in the mat1– <dig> locus.
whole genome analysis showed a high level of genetic diversity between the five isolates , which grouped into two distinct phylogenetic clusters.
our results indicate several genes and molecular processes that may underpin virulence towards mosquitoes.
these unique genes have a tendency to cluster in the genome and to be often located near the telomeres.
thus, the genome sequences of five isolates of b. bassiana provide a better understanding of the natural variation in virulence and will offer a major resource for future research on this important biological control agent.
mating type gene analysis revealed the presence of either the mat1–1– <dig> or the mat1–2– <dig> gene.
indeed, infection with b. bassiana reduces the lifespan of mosquitoes in the laboratory and in the field.
a survey of candidate virulence genes for b. bassiana is presented.
