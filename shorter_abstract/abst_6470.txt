however, these non-genic transcripts often appear to be low in abundance, and their functional significance is not known.
of the eight, five were also detected in rat tissues, but none were detected at appreciable levels in human tissues or cultured cells.
to systematically search for functional ncrnas, we designed microarrays to detect  <dig>  intergenic and intronic sequences that are conserved between the human, mouse, and rat genomes, and that score highly by other criteria that characterize ncrnas.
our results confirm that relatively little of the intergenic sequence conserved between human, mouse and rat is transcribed at high levels in mammalian tissues, possibly suggesting a limited role for transcribed intergenic and intronic sequences as independent functional elements.
since the sequence and expression of most known coding transcripts and functional ncrnas is conserved between human and mouse, the lack of northern-detectable expression in human cells and tissues of the novel mouse and rat ncrnas that we identified suggests that they are not functional or possibly have rodent-specific functions.
among  <dig> candidates for highly-expressed novel ncrnas tested by northern blotting, eight were confirmed as small, highly-and ubiquitously-expressed rnas in mouse.
we probed these arrays with total rna isolated from  <dig> wild-type mouse tissues.
