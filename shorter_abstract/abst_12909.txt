the multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis.
in many applications multiple lc-ms measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis.
as in all physical experiments, lc-ms data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets.
liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples.
we propose two lc-ms proteomics as well as two lc-ms metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios.
it is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples.
using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics lc-ms measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general.
