it solubilizes copper and other metals from rocks and plays an important role in nutrient and metal biogeochemical cycling in acid environments.
bioinformatics analysis provides a valuable platform for gene discovery and functional prediction that helps explain the activity of a. ferrooxidans in industrial bioleaching and its role as a primary producer in acidic environments.
earlier models of iron and sulfur oxidation, biofilm formation, quorum sensing, inorganic ion uptake, and amino acid metabolism are confirmed and extended.
the lack of a well-developed system for genetic manipulation has prevented thorough exploration of its physiology.
an analysis of the genome of the type strain provides a coherent view of its gene content and metabolic potential.
acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a major participant in consortia of microorganisms used for the industrial recovery of copper .
the genome of the type strain a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> was sequenced and annotated to identify general features and provide a framework for in silico metabolic reconstruction.
initial models are presented for central carbon metabolism, anaerobic metabolism , stress responses, dna repair, and metal and toxic compound fluxes.
