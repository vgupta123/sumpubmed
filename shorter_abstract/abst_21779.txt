on western blots, the antiserum labeled two constitutively expressed proteins with distinct expression patterns.
two thaumatin-like proteins  were previously identified in phloem exudate of hybrid poplar  using proteomics methods, and their sieve element localization confirmed by immunofluorescence.
immunogold labelling suggested that tlps are associated with starch granules and starch-containing plastids in sieve elements and phloem parenchyma cells.
immunofluorescence using a tlp antiserum confirmed the presence of tlp in punctate, organelle-like structures within sieve elements.
in addition, the antiserum recognized tlps in the inner cell wall and sieve plate region of sieve elements.
tlp <dig> is expressed predominantly in tissues with a prominent vascular system such as midveins, petioles and stems, whereas the second tlp is primarily expressed in starch-storing plastids found in young leaves and the shoot apex.
in the current study, we analyzed different tissues to further understand tlp expression and localization in poplar, and used immunogold labelling to determine intracellular localization.
