the study reveals exclusive presence of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene families and exclusive absence of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene families in prevotella genomes derived from human oral cavity, gastro-intestinal tracts , urogenital tract  and skin, respectively.
but little is known about the nature of variations, if any, at the genome/sub-genome levels of a specific microbial community across different niches.
each individual microbe might also have a component of its own genetic machinery for host adaptation, as appeared from the huge number of singletons.
no niche-specific variations could be observed in distribution of kegg pathways.
prevotella genomes derived from different body sites differ appreciably in gene repertoire, suggesting that these microbiome components might have developed distinct genetic strategies for niche adaptation within the host.
the present report aims to explore, as a case study, the variations in gene repertoire of  <dig> prevotella reference genomes derived from different body-sites of human, as reported earlier by the human microbiome consortium.
on an average, 17% of predicted protein-coding genes of any particular prevotella genome represent the conserved core genes, while the remaining 83% contribute to the flexible and singletons.
the community composition of the human microbiome is known to vary at distinct anatomical niches.
distribution of various functional cog categories differs significantly among the habitat-specific genes.
