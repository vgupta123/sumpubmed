however, little is known on b-deficiency-responsive mirnas in plants.
we isolated  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas from b-deficient roots, demonstrating remarkable metabolic flexibility of roots, which might contribute to the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency.
other mirnas such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> in roots increased in response to b-deficiency, thus decreasing the expression of their target genes, which are involved in disease resistance, and hence, the disease resistance of roots.
mirnas might regulate the adaptations of roots to b-deficiency through following several aspects:  inactivating reactive oxygen species  signaling and scavenging through up-regulating mir <dig> and down-regulating mir <dig> and mir843;  increasing lateral root number by lowering mir <dig> expression and maintaining a certain phenotype favorable for b-deficiency-tolerance by increasing mir <dig> expression;  enhancing cell transport by decreasing the transcripts of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir3465;  improving osmoprotection  and regulating other metabolic reactions .
micrornas  play important roles in nutrient deficiencies.
boron -deficiency is a widespread problem in many crops, including citrus.
a model for the possible roles of mirnas in the tolerance of roots to b-deficiency was proposed.
our work demonstrates the possible roles of mirnas and related mechanisms in the response of plant roots to b-deficiency.
in this study, we first identified mirnas and their expression pattern in b-deficient citrus sinensis roots by illumina sequencing in order to identify mirnas that might be involved in the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency.
