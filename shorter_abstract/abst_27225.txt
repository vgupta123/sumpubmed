applying supervised learning/classification techniques to epigenomic data may reveal properties that differentiate histone modifications.
we achieved dramatically improved accuracy using histone modification features  and dna sequence features .
furthermore, the algorithms elicited interpretable features that withstand permutation testing, including: the histone modifications h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  which are components of heterochromatin; and the motif tccatt, which is part of the consensus sequence of satellite ii and iii dna.
classification algorithms applied to appropriately pre-processed chip-seq data can accurately discriminate between histone modifications.
these results are consistent with the recent biochemical finding that h4r3me2s provides a binding site for the dna methyltransferase  that methylates satellite ii and iii dna.
downstream analysis demonstrates that satellite ii and iii dna in the human genome is occupied by stable nucleosomes containing h2a/h4r3me2s, h4k20me <dig>  and/or h3k9me <dig>  but not  <dig> other histone methylations.
here, we investigate the impact of using appropriate data pre-processing —deduplication, normalization, and position-  finding to identify stable nucleosome positions — in conjunction with advanced classification algorithms, notably discriminatory motif feature selection and random forests.
algorithms that facilitate interpretation, such as discriminatory motif feature selection, have the added potential to impart information about underlying biological mechanism.
however, these efforts only achieved modest accuracy with limited biological interpretation.
performance assessments are based on accuracy and interpretative yield.
