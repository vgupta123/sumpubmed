schmallenberg virus  was first identified in november  <dig>  it is a novel orthobunyavirus  whose main ill effect is congenital malformation of the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems.
there was close spatial agreement between the results of the two different targeted surveillance strategies.
the objectives of this study were to determine the seroprevalence and distribution of exposure to schmallenberg virus in irish cattle from november  <dig> to november  <dig>
in national serosurveys conducted between november  <dig> until november 2013 the herd-level and animal-level sbv seroprevalences in cattle were  <dig> and 36 % respectively for the first survey,  <dig> and 35 % for the second survey and  <dig> and 33 % for the third survey.
at the end of the  <dig> vector season, there was widespread exposure to sbv among herds in southern and south eastern ireland.
samples of brain for the pathology based surveillance were collected from malformed bovine and ovine foetuses submitted for post mortem examination.
between october  <dig> and 10th may  <dig>  sbv was confirmed by rt-qpcr in brain tissues from malformed foetuses obtained from  <dig> cattle herds and  <dig> sheep flocks in ireland.
three serological surveys were carried out on sera submitted for the national brucellosis eradicartion programme.
a spatial analysis of both sets of data was carried out.
during  <dig>  there was little or no evidence of further outward spread, unlike the situation in several other european countries.
