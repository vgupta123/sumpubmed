the data suggest that epsilon-cyclization of lycopene is a key regulatory step in potato tuber carotenogenesis.
real time measurements confirmed the tuber-specific silencing of lcy-e. antisense tubers showed significant increases in beta-beta-carotenoid levels, with beta-carotene showing the maximum increase .
upon tuber-specific silencing of the corresponding gene, beta-beta-carotenoid and total carotenoid levels are increased, and expression of several other genes in the pathway is modified.
tuber-specific changes in expression of several genes in the pathway were observed.
total carotenoids increased up to  <dig> -fold.
we silenced the first dedicated step in the beta-epsilon- branch of carotenoid biosynthesis, lycopene epsilon cyclase , by introducing, via agrobacterium-mediated transformation, an antisense fragment of this gene under the control of the patatin promoter.
