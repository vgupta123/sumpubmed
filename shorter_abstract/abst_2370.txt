the progression of the various steps within the cryopreservation procedure is accompanied by declining survival rates of the explants.
to better understand the possible reasons for a reduction in the survival rate at the subsequent steps of cryopreservation, the concentration of amino acids, ammonium, Î³-aminobutyric acid , soluble sugars, malondialdehyde , and oxygen were measured in garlic shoot tips undergoing cryopreservation.
furthermore, malondialdehyde, soluble sugars and ammonium were quantified to demonstrate the influence of cryo-stress in declining survival rates.
in this study, hypoxia was characterized in cryopreservation of garlic with oxygen sensors and amino acid metabolism.
using microsensors, a very low oxygen concentration  was detected within the central meristem region of the shoot apex.
tissue level oxygen measurements supported the occurrence of hypoxia while biochemical analysis indicated adaptive responses, in particular the modulation in alanine and glutamate metabolism.
