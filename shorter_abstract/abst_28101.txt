cbl treatment normalized levels of drp- <dig> and restored mitochondrial structure.
these results suggest that the ability of cbl to ameliorate neurodegenerative pathology in the tauopathy model may involve reducing accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and reducing alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis associated with tau.
we have previously shown that cerebrolysintm , a neuropeptide mixture with neurotrophic effects, ameliorates the behavioral deficits and neuropathological alterations in amyloid precursor protein  transgenic  mouse model of ad by reducing hyper-phosphorylated tau.
compared to single tau tg mice the tau/gsk3β double tg model displayed elevated levels of tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.
for this purpose we sought to investigate the effects of cbl in a tg model of tauopathy.
cbl treatment reduced the levels of tau phosphorylation in the dentate gyrus and the degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of the tau/gsk3β double tg mice.
ultrastructural analysis of the mitochondria in the tau/gsk3β double tg mice demonstrated increased numbers and fragmentation of mitochondria in comparison to non-tg mice.
accordingly, double tg mice expressing mutant tau under the mthy- <dig> promoter and gsk3β  were treated with cbl and evaluated neuropathologically.
interestingly, the tau/gsk3β double tg mice also displayed elevated levels of dynamin-related protein- <dig> , a protein that hydrolyzes gtp and is required for mitochondrial division.
these disorders are associated with tau accumulation.
