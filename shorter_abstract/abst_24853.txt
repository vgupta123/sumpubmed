we developed a new functional screening strategy based on transduction of mammalian cells of a given species with an expression library from another species, followed by one-shot quantitative tracing with dna microarrays of all library-derived transcripts before and after selection.
we transduced a retroviral cdna expression library from mouse testis into human and canine cells, and optimized the use of commercial murine gene expression arrays for species-specific detection of library-derived transcripts.
a major limit of this approach resides in the labor-intensive cloning of resistant cells, identification of the integrated genes and validation of their ability to confer a selective advantage.
we then conducted a functional screening by growing library-transduced canine mdck cells in suspension, to enrich for cdnas conferring anchorage independence.
indeed, this strategy allowed identification and validation of genes promoting anchorage-independent growth of epithelial cells under selection conditions not amenable to conventional expression cloning.
microarray analysis revealed reproducible enrichment after three weeks of growth on polyhema for seven genes, among which the hras proto-oncogene and sox <dig>  when individually transduced into mdck cells, sox <dig> specifically promoted anchorage-independent growth, thereby confirming the validity and specificity of the approach.
in this way, exogenous transcripts enriched after selection, and therefore likely to confer resistance, are readily detected.
systematic search for genes whose gain-of-function by exogenous expression confers an advantage in cell-based selective screenings is a powerful method for unbiased functional exploration of the genome, and has the potential to disclose new targets for cancer therapy.
