comparative analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in p. szechuanica after infection with different rust fungus isolates showed significant differences, and more mirnas were suppressed during rust infection.
previous studies have reported mirnas in populus that respond to abiotic stresses, such as cold, heat, drought, flooding, high salt and mechanical stress.
these results demonstrate that the expression of mirnas was altered in poplar under stress associated with m. larici-populina infection, and different temporal dynamics were observed in incompatible and compatible libraries.
qrt-pcr analysis indicated that most mirnas were up-regulated in the sb <dig> library and down-regulated in the th <dig> library at 48Â h post-inoculation .
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that regulate the gene expression of target mrnas involved in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress and pathogen responses.
these findings suggest important roles for mirna regulation in populus upon infection with foliar rust fungus.
among the differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas were relevant to the rust fungus infection, and according to kegg  pathway analysis, these mirnas primarily regulate genes encoding disease-resistance proteins, serine/threonine protein kinases, transcription factors, and related proteins.
quantitative real-time pcr  was used to validate the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas.
a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from three small-rna libraries of populus szechuanica infected with m. larici-populina isolates sb <dig> and th <dig> and a control.
