in addition, reduced taxon, single gene analyses revealed multiple horizontal transfers of atp <dig> from host to parasite lineage, suggesting that parasites may be important vectors of horizontal gene transfer in angiosperms.
consequently, the number of origins of parasitism and the phylogenetic distribution of the heterotrophic lifestyle among angiosperm lineages is unclear.
here we report the results of a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> species of seed plants designed to infer the position of all haustorial parasitic angiosperm lineages using three mitochondrial genes: atp <dig>  coxi, and matr.
overall, the mtdna phylogeny agrees with independent studies in terms of non-parasitic plant relationships and reveals at least  <dig> independent origins of parasitism in angiosperms, eight of which consist entirely of holoparasitic species that lack photosynthetic ability.
collectively, these results indicate that the parasitic lifestyle has arisen repeatedly in angiosperm evolutionary history and results in increasing parasite genomic chimerism over time.
from these results, it can be inferred that modern-day parasites have disproportionately evolved in certain lineages and that the endoparasitic habit has arisen by convergence in four clades.
