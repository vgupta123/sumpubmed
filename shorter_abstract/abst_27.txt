the new tsss and transcribed sequences are essential for further exploration of the promoter and other cis-regulatory sequences at the 5'end of genes.
our knowledge of transcriptional initiation sequences in the human genome is limited despite the availability of the complete genome sequence.
in this study we describe the mapping of tsss of genes expressed in human retina.
our work combines in silico analysis of ests and known algorithm predictions together with their experimental validation via cap-finder race.
results can be grouped into five categories, compared to the refseq;  tss located in new first exons,  splicing variation of the second exon,  extension of the annotated first exon,  shortening of the annotated first exon,  confirmation of previously annotated tss.
our results highlight the necessity of a tissue specific approach to complete the existing gene annotation.
while genome wide experimental and bioinformatic approaches are improving our knowledge of tsss, they lack information concerning genes expressed in a restricted manner or at very low levels, such as tissue specific genes.
