our molecular and morphological analyses of phytomyxid isolates–including for the first time oomycete and sea-grass parasites–demonstrate two cross-kingdom host shifts between closely related parasite species: between angiosperms and oomycetes, and from diatoms/brown algae to angiosperms.
some phytomyxid parasites are of considerable economic and ecologic importance globally, and their hosts include important species in marine and terrestrial environments.
such large-scale host shifts between closely related obligate biotrophic eukaryote parasites is to our knowledge unique to phytomyxids.
phytomyxids  are cosmopolitan, obligate biotrophic protist parasites of plants, diatoms, oomycetes and brown algae.
phytomyxids may readily adapt to a wide diversity of new hosts because they have retained the ability to covertly infect alternative hosts.
however most phytomyxid diversity remains uncharacterised and knowledge of their relationships with host taxa is very fragmentary.
