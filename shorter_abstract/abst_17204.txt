bioinformatics analysis suggested three putative kb sites in promoter region of mir-34a gene.
these findings might be helpful in understanding mir-34a abnormality in human malignancies and open new perspectives for the roles of mir-34a and nf-kappab in tumor progression.
we found that overexpression of nf-kappa b p <dig> subunit could increase mir-34a levels in ec <dig>  an esophageal squamous cancer cell line, while ectopic expression of dn ikappab leaded to a significant reduction of mir-34a expression.
mir-34a functions as an important tumor suppressor during the process of carcinogenesis.
however, the mechanism of mir-34a dysregulation in human malignancies has not been well elucidated.
in addition, we found that overexpression of nf-kappab p <dig> could not successfully induce mir-34a expression in esophageal cancer cell lines with mutant p <dig> or decreased p <dig>  reporter assay further showed that nf-kappab-induced mir-34a transcriptional activity was reduced by p <dig> impairment.
our work indicates a novel mechanism of mir-34a regulation that nf-kappab could elevate mir-34a expression levels through directly binding to its promoter.
our study aimed to further investigate the regulation mechanism of mir-34a.
mutation two of these kb sites impaired p <dig> induced mir-34a transcriptional activity.
and wildtype p <dig> is responsible for nf-kappab-mediated mir-34a transcriptional activity but not for nf-kappab binding.
chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays both showed that nf-kappab could specifically bind to the third kb site located in mir-34a promoter.
nevertheless, chip analysis suggested binding of nf-kappab to mir-34a promoter was not affected in cells with mutant p <dig>
