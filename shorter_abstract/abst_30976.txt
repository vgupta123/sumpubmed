we here wanted to systematically analyze, whether these proteins are tumor specific antigens which could be targeted immunologically.
consequently, we conclude that mdr and mrp proteins must be considered as weak tumor specific antigens-at least for colorectal carcinoma.
peptide specificity and hla-a <dig>  restriction were proven in ifn-Î³-elispot analyses and in cytotoxicity tests against mdp loaded target cells for a total of twelve peptides derived from mdr- <dig>  mdr- <dig>  mrp- <dig>  mrp- <dig>  mrp- <dig> and mrp- <dig>  of note, two of these epitopes are shared between mdr- <dig> and mdr- <dig> as well as mrp- <dig> and mrp- <dig>  however, comparably weak cytotoxic activities were additionally observed against hla-a <dig> + tumor cells even after upregulation of mdr protein expression by in vitro chemotherapy.
using the reverse immunology approach,  <dig> hla-a <dig>  restricted mdr and mrp derived peptides  were selected.
multidrug resistance  is a clinically, highly relevant phenomenon.
