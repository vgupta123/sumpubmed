the average expression level of the contigs was lower than that of the known cdnas, implying that these contigs included transcripts that were rarely represented in the full-length cdna library.
a comparative analysis of the wheat- and rice-responsive transcripts for orthologous genes under pi-starvation revealed commonly upregulated transcripts, most of which appeared to be involved in a general response to pi starvation, namely, an ips1-mediated signalling cascade and its downstream functions such as pi remobilisation, pi uptake, and changes in pi metabolism.
phosphorus  is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development.
we carried out de novo assembly on  <dig>  million high-quality reads generated from rna-seq libraries.
to elucidate these mechanisms, we used rna-seq methods to generate transcriptome profiles of the wheat variety ‘chinese spring’ responding to  <dig> days of pi starvation.
within the non-redundant transcript set, we identified 892– <dig>  responsive transcripts in roots and shoots, corresponding on average to  <dig> % of the contigs not covered by cdnas in trifldb under pi starvation.
our transcriptome profiles demonstrated the impact of pi starvation on global gene expression in wheat.
this study revealed that enhancement of the pi-mediated signalling cascade using ips <dig> is a potent adaptation mechanism to pi starvation that is conserved in both wheat and rice and validated the effectiveness of using short-read next-generation sequencing data for wheat transcriptome analysis in the absence of reference genome information.
when compared with barley full-length cdnas,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs were unalignable, suggesting that many might be distinct from barley transcripts.
