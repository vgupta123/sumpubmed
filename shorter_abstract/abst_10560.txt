in comparison with non-competitive binding at promoters, competition drastically reduces the region of the parameters space characterized by oscillatory solutions.
this task remains still to be attained due to the inherent synergy of the biological building blocks and to an insufficient feedback between experiments and mathematical models.
our results point out that the oscillatory capacity is not only affected by the interaction polarity but by how it is implemented at promoter level.
the ultimate goal of synthetic biology is the conception and construction of genetic circuits that are reliable with respect to their designed function .
moreover, while competition leads to pulse-like oscillations with long-tail distribution in period and amplitude for various parameters or noisy conditions, the non-competitive scenario shows a characteristic frequency and confined amplitude values.
it has been emphasized in the literature that the architecture of a genetic oscillator must include positive  and negative  genetic interactions in order to yield robust oscillations.
our study also situates the competition mechanism in the context of existing genetic oscillators, with emphasis on the atkinson oscillator.
