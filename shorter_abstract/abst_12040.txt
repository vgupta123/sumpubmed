we show that enigma constitutes a valuable addition to the repertoire of methods to analyze such data.
compendia of gene expression profiles under chemical and genetic perturbations constitute an invaluable resource from a systems biology perspective.
finally, we apply enigma to the rosetta compendium of expression profiles for saccharomyces cerevisiae and we analyze one pheromone response-related module in more detail, demonstrating the potential of enigma to generate detailed predictions.
in contrast to the biclusters produced by most other methods, enigma modules may show internal substructure, i.e.
enigma leverages differential expression analysis results to extract expression modules from perturbational gene expression data.
the grouping of these  related patterns in one module greatly aids in the biological interpretation of the data.
we introduce a novel method, called enigma, that addresses some of these issues.
it is increasingly recognized that perturbational expression compendia are essential to identify the gene networks underlying cellular function, and efforts to build these for different organisms are currently underway.
we show that enigma outperforms other methods on artificial datasets, using a quality criterion that, unlike other criteria, can be used for algorithms that generate overlapping clusters and that can be modified to take redundancy between clusters into account.
however, the perturbational nature of such data imposes specific challenges on the computational methods used to analyze them.
for instance, some biclustering methods are less suited to identify overlapping biclusters, while others generate highly redundant biclusters.
