we establish that the pygidium possesses a complicated nervous system with a nerve ring and a pair of sensory ganglia, a complex intrinsic musculature, a large terminal circular blood sinus and an unusual unpaired torus-shaped coelomic cavity.
we analyze these scenarios in the context of two classical theories on the origin of segmentation: the cyclomeric/archicoelomate concept and the colonial theory.

we describe a much more complex organization of the pygidium of p. dumerilii than previously suggested.
using different methods of microscopy, immunolabelling and a number of molecular markers, we describe the neural and mesodermal structures of the pygidium of platynereis dumerilii.
we also describe some earlier steps of pygidial development and pygidial structure of mature animals after epitokous transformation.
many of the characteristics are strikingly similar to those found in the trunk segments, opening the debate on whether the pygidium and trunk segments derive from the same ancestral metameric unit.
both theories provide possible explanations for the partial or complete homology of trunk segments and pygidium.
