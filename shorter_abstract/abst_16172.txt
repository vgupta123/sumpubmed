nematode development is invariant from one specimen to the next, whereas in mammals, aspects of development are probabilistic, and development exhibits variation between even genetically identical individuals.
we find that during mouse development, muscle and fat arise from a mixed progenitor cell pool in the germ layer, but, contrastingly, vascular endothelium in brain derives from a smaller source of progenitor cells.
additionally, formation of tissue primordia is marked by establishment of left and right lateral compartments, with restricted cell migration between divisions.
in this approach, somatic mutations arising in individual cells are used to retrospectively deduce lineage relationships through phylogenetic and—as newly investigated here—related analytical approaches based on genetic distance.
we quantitatively demonstrate that development represents a combination of stochastic and deterministic events, offering insight into how chance influences normal development and may give rise to birth defects.
to determine the extent to which patterns of cell lineage are conserved between different mice, we have employed the recently developed method of “phylogenetic fate mapping” to compare cell fate maps in siblings.
the c. elegans cell fate map, in which the lineage of its approximately  <dig> cells is visibly charted beginning from the zygote, represents a developmental biology milestone.
consequently, a single defined cell fate map applicable to all individuals cannot exist.
