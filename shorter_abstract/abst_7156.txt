the new method, named hs-forest, avoids the computationally expensive task of clustering every decoy, yet still allows superior correct-fold selection.
structure-based clustering is commonly used to identify correct protein folds among candidate folds  generated by protein structure prediction programs.
experimental results on  <dig> rosetta decoy sets and  <dig> i-tasser decoy sets show that our method can improve the correct fold detection rate as assessed by two different quality criteria.
however, traditional clustering methods exhibit a poor runtime performance on large decoy sets.
we integrated our new clustering strategy with several different scoring functions to assess both the performance and speed in identifying correct or near-correct folds.
our method detects structurally similar decoys  and extracts representatives from them without assigning every decoy to a cluster.
