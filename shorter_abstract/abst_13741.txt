the flux analysis and modeling environment  is the first web-based modeling tool that combines the tasks of creating, editing, running, and analyzing/visualizing stoichiometric models into a single program.
analysis results can be automatically superimposed on familiar kegg-like maps.
with fame, we present the community with an open source, user-friendly, web-based "one stop shop" for stoichiometric modeling.
