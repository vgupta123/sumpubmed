both carnosine and β-alanyl-l-leucine stimulated corticosterone release.
β-alanyl-l-leucine strongly stimulated, and the other two dipeptides tended to stimulate, corticosterone release.
these results suggest that central β-alanyl-branched chain amino acid stimulates activity in chicks through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.
carnosine  is a putative neurotransmitter and has a possible role in neuron-glia cell interactions.
in the present study, we focused on other β-alanyl dipeptides to determine if they have novel functions.
thus, dipeptides of β-alanyl-branched chain amino acids were compared in experiment  <dig>  the i.c.v.
injection of β-alanyl-l-leucine, but not β-alanyl-glycine, induced hyperactivity behavior as observed with carnosine.
