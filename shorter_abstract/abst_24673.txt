we have found that multiple lowest energy solutions point to an interaction of the kringle domain of upa at the boundary between α and β chains on the surface of the integrins.
we demonstrated that in silico docking experiments can be successfully carried out to identify the binding mode of the kringle domain of urokinase on the scaffold of integrins in the open and closed conformation.
we have modeled the interaction of urokinase on two integrins, αiibβ <dig> in the open configuration and αvβ <dig> in the closed configuration.
