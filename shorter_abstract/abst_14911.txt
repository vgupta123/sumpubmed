stem cells reside in a plant's shoot meristem throughout its life and are main regulators of above-ground plant development.
we show that the interference hypothesis leads to an abundance of receptors, while the loss-of-signal hypothesis leads to sequestration of clavata <dig> and relies on degradation or internalization of the bound clavata <dig> receptor.
using computational modeling, we show that an interference hypothesis and a more parsimonious loss-of-signal hypothesis for a clavata <dig> non-null mutant both lead to behaviors predicting wild type and six receptor mutant experiments.
although the two models have identical implementations of the unperturbed feedback network for stem cell regulation, we can point out model-predicted differences that may be resolved in future experiments.
the stem cell maintenance depends on a feedback network between the clavata and wuschel genes.
we present two models for the clavata-wuschel feedback network including two receptor pathways for wuschel repression and differing only by the hypothesized mechanisms for the clavata1- <dig> non-null mutant.
the two models for the clavata1- <dig> mutant differ in the direct mechanism of the mutant, but they also predict other differences in the dynamics of the stem cell regulating network.
we optimize the models using data from wild type and four single receptor mutant experiments and use data from two receptor double mutant experiments in a validation step.
