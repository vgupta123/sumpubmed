atp binding is essential for the bioactivity of several growth factors including nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor- <dig> and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
we found evidence that atp binding tovegf-a <dig> induced a conformational change in the secondary structure of the growth factor.
vascular endothelial growth factor isoform  <dig>  induces the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, however a dependence on atp-binding is currently unknown.
addition of alkaline phosphate to cell culture lowered the atp concentration in the cell culture medium to  <dig>  nm and inhibited cell proliferation.
this binding appears to be significant at the biological level, as we found evidence that nanomolar levels of atp  are required for the vegf-a165-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
the aim of the present study was to determine if atp binding is essential for the bioactivity of vegf-a <dig>
