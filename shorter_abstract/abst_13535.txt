due to the extremely aberrant nature of their dna, the symbiotic lineages within enterobacteriaceae form long branches and tend to cluster as a monophyletic group.
we particularly focused on the long-branch attraction-reducing methods, such as a nucleotide and amino acid data recoding and exclusion , taxa exclusion and usage of complex evolutionary models, such as nonhomogeneous model and models accounting for site-specific features of protein evolution .
we assembled the richest taxon sampling of enterobacteriaceae to date  and analyzed both nucleic and amino acid data sets using several probabilistic methods.
our data strongly suggest independent origins of four symbiotic clusters; the first is formed by hamiltonella and regiella  placed as a sister clade to yersinia, the second comprises arsenophonus and riesia  as a sister clade to proteus, the third sodalis, baumannia, blochmannia and wigglesworthia  as a sister or paraphyletic clade to the pectobacterium and dickeya clade and, finally, buchnera species and ishikawaella  clustering with the erwinia and pantoea clade.
the results of this study confirm the efficiency of several artifact-reducing methods and strongly point towards the polyphyly of p-symbionts within enterobacteriaceae.
the possible origins of intracellular symbiotic bacteria from gut-associated or pathogenic bacteria are suggested, as well as the role of facultative secondary symbionts as a source of bacteria that can gradually become obligate maternally transferred symbionts.
the bacterial family enterobacteriaceae gave rise to a variety of symbiotic forms, from the loosely associated commensals, often designated as secondary  symbionts, to obligate mutualists, called primary  symbionts.
the main reasons have been the absence of sufficient data, the highly derived nature of the symbiont genomes and lack of appropriate phylogenetic methods.
