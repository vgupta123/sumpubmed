glycinea , was increased in n. benthamiana plants upon treatment with pstab extracts .
in this study, we found that pstab extracts suppress plant defense responses such as stomatal closure and nonhost hr cell death induced by the nonhost bacterial pathogen pst t <dig> in n. benthamiana.
cor has been shown to suppress plant defense responses.
the hr cell death induced by pathogen-associated molecular pattern , gene-for-gene interaction  and ethanol was not delayed or suppressed by pstab extracts.
we found that the pstab extracellular metabolite extracts  remarkably suppressed stomatal closure and nonhost hypersensitive response  cell death induced by a nonhost pathogen, p. syringae pv.
we also found that the accumulation of nonhost pathogens, pst t <dig> and p. syringae pv.
the results from gene expression profiling of pr- <dig>  pr- <dig>  pr- <dig>  pdf <dig> , aba <dig>  coi <dig>  and hsr203j suggest that pstab extracellular metabolites may interfere with sa-mediated defense pathways.
it is not clear if pstab produces any extracellular metabolites that actively suppress early defense during bacterial pathogenesis.
we performed metabolite profiling to investigate the extracellular metabolites from pstab using uplc-qtof-ms and identified  <dig> extracellular metabolites from the pstab supernatant culture.
tabaci  is the causal agent of wildfire disease in tobacco plants.
tomato t <dig> , in nicotiana benthamiana.
interestingly, pstab does not produce cor but still actively suppresses early plant defense responses.
