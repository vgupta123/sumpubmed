currently, the aba database mainly serves as an online reference for visual inspection of individual genes; the underlying rich information of this large data set is yet to be explored by novel computational tools.
given a query brain image, hrc is a fully automated algorithm that is able to quickly mine vast number of brain images and identify a manageable subset of genes that potentially shares similar spatial co-distribution patterns for further visual inspection.
by unveiling gene behaviors at both the cellular and molecular levels, aba is becoming a unique and comprehensive neuroscience data source for decoding enigmatic biological processes in the brain.
in this proof-of-concept study, we studied the hypothesis that genes sharing similar three-dimensional expression profiles in the mouse brain are likely to share similar biological functions.
we demonstrated how the hrc algorithm offers the sensitivity of identifying a manageable number of gene pairs based on automatic pattern searching from an original large brain image collection.
the allen brain atlas  project systematically profiles three-dimensional high-resolution gene expression in postnatal mouse brains for thousands of genes.
in order to address the pattern comparison challenge when analyzing the aba database, we developed a robust image filtering method, dubbed histogram-row-column  algorithm.
databases such as aba provide valuable data source for characterizing brain-related gene functions when armed with powerful image querying tools like hrc.
