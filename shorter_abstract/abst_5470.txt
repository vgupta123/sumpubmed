however, even these simple looking indels show a surprisingly high level of hidden homoplasy .
simple indels are mostly small  with a most frequent size class of 1aa.
among the apparently homoplasy-free simple indels, we identify  <dig> potential clade-defining indels  that may warrant closer examination.
however, it appears that simple indels in universal proteins are too rare and homoplasy-rich to be used for pure indel-based phylogeny.
we sought to characterize indel patterns focusing first on the major groups of multicellular eukaryotes.
insertions/deletions  in protein sequences are useful as drug targets, protein structure predictors, species diagnostics and evolutionary markers.
we find considerable potential for identifying taxon-marker indels using an automated pipeline.
however there is limited understanding of indel evolutionary patterns.
