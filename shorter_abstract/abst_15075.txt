we show that different predictors offer complementary advantages, and our method is able to integrate them using non-trivial constraints, generating more consistent predictions.
in particular, we show how to integrate three stand-alone predictors of correlated features: subcellular localization , disulfide bonding state , and metal bonding state , in a way that takes into account the respective strengths and weaknesses, and does not require any change to the predictors themselves.
we also compare our methodology against two alternative refinement pipelines based on state-of-the-art sequential prediction methods.
the logical layer enforces a set of weighted first-order rules encoding biological constraints between the features, and improves the raw predictions so that they least violate the constraints.
a key observation is that several protein features are closely inter-related, that is, they are conditioned on each other.
here we show how to jointly improve the outputs of multiple correlated predictors by means of a probabilistic-logical consistency layer.
