in the leaf, ca-tdc <dig> expression was detected in some epidermal cells and in groups of mesophyll cells but not in glandular trichomes; in the stem, it was observed in parenchyma cells of the vascular tissue; in the root, no expression was detected.
camptotheca acuminata is a major natural source of the terpenoid indole alkaloid camptothecin .
the pattern of cpt accumulation was compared with the expression pattern of some genes involved in cpt biosynthesis in c. acuminata .
in all organs, cpt accumulation was detected in epidermal idioblasts, in some glandular trichomes, and in groups of idioblast cells localized in parenchyma tissues.
drought-stress caused an increase in cpt accumulation and in the number of glandular trichomes containing cpt, whereas no increase in epidermal or parenchymatous idioblasts was observed.
ca-tdc <dig> expression was observed exclusively in leaves of plantlets subjected to drought-stress, in the same sites described for ca-tdc <dig>  in the leaf, ca-hgo was detected in all chlorenchyma cells; in the stem, it was observed in the same sites described for ca-tdc1; in the root, no expression was detected.
both cpt accumulation and gene expression were investigated in plants at different degrees of development and in plantlets subjected to drought-stress.
the finding that the sites of cpt accumulation are not consistently the same as those in which the studied genes are expressed demonstrates an organ-to-organ and cell-to-cell translocation of cpt or its precursors.
