prediction and evaluation of the potential allergenicity is of importance for safety evaluation of foods and other environment factors.
although several computational approaches for assessing the potential allergenicity of proteins have been developed, their performance and relative merits and shortcomings have not been compared systematically.
flexible parameter setting and batch prediction were also implemented.
to facilitate the allergen prediction, we integrated these three methods in a web-based application proap, which provides the global search of the known allergens and a powerful tool for allergen predication.
furthermore, we integrated these methods into a web application proap, greatly facilitating users to do customizable allergen search and prediction.
to evaluate and improve the existing methods for allergen prediction, we collected an up-to-date definitive dataset consisting of  <dig> known allergens and massive putative non-allergens.
