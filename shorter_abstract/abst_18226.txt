advances in automated dna sequencing technology have accelerated the generation of metagenomic dna sequences, especially environmental ribosomal rna gene  sequences.
xplorseq is a software package that facilitates the compilation, management and phylogenetic analysis of dna sequences.
a document-based architecture permits parallel analysis of sequence data from multiple clones or amplicons, with sequences and other data stored in a single file.
xplorseq should benefit researchers who are engaged in analyses of environmental sequence data, especially those with little experience using bioinformatics software.
although xplorseq was developed for management of rdna sequence data, it can be applied to most any sequencing project.
through this gui, users may perform basic sequence import and assembly steps , perform blast  searches of ncbi and local databases, create multiple sequence alignments, build phylogenetic trees, assemble operational taxonomic units, estimate biodiversity indices, and summarize data in a variety of formats.
xplorseq integrates and extends several commonly used unix-based analysis tools by use of a macintosh os-x-based graphical user interface .
