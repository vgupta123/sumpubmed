sucrose transporters  are critical for both phloem loading in source tissue and sucrose uptaking in sink tissue, and are considered to be the control points for regulating sucrose storage.
gene expression analyses were performed for tissues from seedlings under drought stress and mature plants of three saccharum species .
gene structure comparison demonstrated that the number and position of exons/introns in suts were highly conserved among the close orthologs; in contrast, there were variations among the paralogous suts in sacchuarm.
though with the high polyploidy level, gene allelic haplotype comparative analysis showed that the examined four sssut members exhibited conservations of gene structures and amino acid sequences among the allelic haplotypes accompanied by variations of intron sizes.
sut <dig> could be a low active member in the family because it is undetectable in our study, but it might not be a pseudogene because it harbored integrated gene structure.
both of sut <dig> and sut <dig> had lower expression level than other gene member, and expressed stronger in source leaves and are likely to play roles in phloem loading.
by using comparative genomics and bacterial artificial chromosomes , six sut genes were identified and characterized in s. spontaenum.
sut <dig> had similar expression level in all of the examined tissues, but sut <dig> was undetectable.
phylogenetic analyses revealed that the two pairs sssuts  could be clustered together into two separate monocot specific sut groups, while sssut <dig> and sssut <dig> were separated into the other two groups, with members from both dicot and monocot species.

in this study, we presented the first comprehensive genomic study for a whole gene family, the sut family, in saccharum.
out of the six members, sssuts, sssut <dig> and sssut <dig> were recent duplication genes accompanied by rapid evolution, while, sssut <dig> and sssut <dig> were the ancient members in the families.
despite the high polypoidy genome, functional redundancy may not exist among the suts allelic haplotypes supported by the evidence of strong purifying selection of the gene allele.
we speculated that there were six sut members in the s. spotaneum genome.
however, due to sugarcane’s complicated genomes, it is still challenging to study the genetic basis of traits, such as sucrose accumulation.
sut <dig> and sut <dig> were the main members for the sucrose transporter, while, these suts had sub-functional divergence in response to sucrose accumulation and plant development in saccharum.
in the seeding plant leave under water stress, four genes sut <dig>  sut <dig>  sut <dig> and sut <dig> were detectable.
