the genome of the diploid species musa acuminata which is the ancestor of a majority of triploid banana cultivars has recently been sequenced.
two genes encoding the ethylene biosynthetic enzyme acc oxidase and several ethylene-responsive transcription factors  were among the strongly induced genes by both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>
both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> are able to spread into the vascular system of banana roots during the early infection process and their infection led to similar gene expression profiles in banana roots.
the knowledge of global gene expression patterns influenced by infection of different foc races will help to understand the host responses to the infection.
a large number of simple nucleotide polymorphisms  and short insertions and deletion  were identified from the transcriptome data.
digital gene expression  profiling analysis reveal that the infection by foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> caused very similar changes in the global gene expression profiles in the banana roots during the first two days of infection.
both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> were found to be able to invade banana roots and spread to root vascular tissues in the first two days following inoculation.
rna samples from different organs of the cavendish cultivar were pooled for deep sequencing using the illumina technology.
the foc infection led to induction of many well-known defense-related genes.
the transcriptome profiling analysis indicates that the ethylene synthetic and signalling pathways were activated in response to the foc infection.
gfp-expressing foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> were used to monitor the infection process.
analysis of the banana transcriptome led to identification of over  <dig> genes that were not annotated by the musa genome project.
availability of banana transcriptomes will be highly useful for improving banana genome annotation and for biological research.
