for degraded rna samples, ribo-zero showed clear performance advantages over the other two protocols as it generated more accurate and better reproducible gene expression results even at very low input amounts such as 1 ng and 2 ng.
we found that each protocol generates highly reproducible results  on intact rna samples down to input amounts of 10 ng.
for highly degraded rna samples, rna access performed best generating reliable data down to 5 ng input.
we assessed the accuracy of the generated expression values by comparison to gold standard taqman qpcr measurements and gained unprecedented insight into the limits of applicability in terms of input quantity and sample quality of each protocol.
we compared for the first time three commercial illumina library preparation kits  as representatives of these three different approaches using well-established human reference rna samples from the maqc/seqc consortium on a wide range of input amounts  and degradation levels .
rna-sequencing  has emerged as one of the most sensitive tool for gene expression analysis.
