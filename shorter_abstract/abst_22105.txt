our method demonstrated pbm can be conveniently performed by adopting:  quadruple 9-mers may increase protein-dna binding interactions in the microarray, and  a one-step incubation shortens the wash and hybridization steps.
we facilitated the pbm technology using a dsred fluorescent protein and a concatenated sequence of oligonucleotides.
proteins were labeled via n-terminal fusion with dsred fluorescent protein, which circumvents the need for a multi-step incubation.
the pbm was designed in such a way that target probes were synthesized as quadruples of all possible 9-mer combinations, permitting unequivocal interpretation of the cis-acting elements.
comprehensive genome-wide methods have been developed to characterize protein-dna interactions.
