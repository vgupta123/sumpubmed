the rearrangement-based methods consist in minimizing a total rearrangement distance on the branches of a species tree.
the homology-based methods consist in the detection of a set of potential ancestral contiguity features, followed by the assembling of these features into contiguous ancestral regions .
in the context of ancestral gene order reconstruction from extant genomes, there exist two main computational approaches: rearrangement-based, and homology-based methods.
in this paper, we present a new homology-based method that uses a progressive approach for both the detection and the assembling of ancestral contiguity features into cars.

the method is based on detecting a set of potential ancestral adjacencies iteratively using the current set of cars at each step, and constructing cars progressively using a 2-phase assembling method.
