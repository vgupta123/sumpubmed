bacterial pops are pharmaceutically important enzymes, yet their functional and evolutionary details are not fully explored.
prolyl oligopeptidases  are proteolytic enzymes, widely distributed in all the kingdoms of life.
such anomalous distribution of pop genes in different bacterial genomes shows differential expansion of pop gene family primarily by multiple horizontal gene transfer events.
therefore, current analysis is aimed at understanding the distribution, domain architecture, probable biological functions and gene family expansion of pops in bacterial and archaeal lineages.
we observed wide distribution of pops in all the analysed bacterial lineages.
our study reflects diversity and functional importance of pops in bacterial species.
phylogenetic analysis and co-clustering of pops of different phyla suggested their common functions in all the prokaryotic species.
many genomes with multiple pops were identified with high sequence variations and different cellular localizations.
analysis of coexisting domains in pops highlighted their involvement in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling.
