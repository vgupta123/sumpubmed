the main control strategy for visceral leishmaniasis in brazil has been based on the elimination of seropositive dogs, although this is not widely accepted.
the secreted cytokine signatures and their major sources were determined.
the aim of this work was to determine the timeline kinetics of the cytokine microenvironment derived from circulating leukocytes as supportive immunological biomarkers triggered by leishmune® vaccine.
in this context, the use of a long-lasting protective vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis  has been highly expected.

at six months after vaccination, leishmune® induced an increase in il- <dig>  ifn-γ, il-17a and tnf-α levels and a decrease in il- <dig>  cytokine signature analysis revealed a shift in the microenvironment towards a pro-inflammatory profile mediated by il- <dig> and ifn-γ.
the changes observed in the cytokine profile suggested that leishmune® was able to induce an effective response at six months after primovaccination.
in vitro short-term whole blood cultures were stimulated with leishmania infantum soluble antigen .
both, cd4+  and cd8+  t-cells contributed to the acquired immune responses observed after stimulation with slag.
