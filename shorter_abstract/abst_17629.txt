despite low overall sequence homology in the c-terminus of all proteins, even in those with similar functions across arabidopsis and vitis, highly conserved motif sequences and exon lengths were found.
no genome-wide characterization of this family has been conducted in a woody species such as grapevine.
in addition, previous analysis of the recently released grape genome sequence suggested expansion events of several gene families involved in wine quality.
members control processes such as epidermal cell differentiation, stomatal aperture, flavonoid synthesis, cold and drought tolerance and pathogen resistance.
two anthocyanin myba related clusters were identified in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  one of which includes the previously described grape colour locus.
myb gene abundance, homology and orientation within particular loci also suggests that expanded myb clades conferring quality attributes of grapes and wines, such as colour and astringency, could possess redundant, overlapping and cooperative functions.
this genome wide transcription factor analysis in vitis suggests that clade-specific grape r2r <dig> myb genes are expanded while other myb genes could be well conserved compared to arabidopsis.
