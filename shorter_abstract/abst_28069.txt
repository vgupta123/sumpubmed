a mutagenesis approach directing the stepwise evolution of dsred has produced mrfp <dig>  the first true monomer.
it paves the way for the use of dsred-based monomeric rfps in transgenic and gene targeted approaches which often necessitate spatially and/or temporally restricted reporter expression.
mrfp <dig> currently represents an attractive autofluorescent reporter for use in heterologous systems.
this has been attributed to the non-viability, or toxicity, of the protein, probably as a result of its obligate tetramerization.
widespread use of dsred has been hampered by several issues resulting in the inability to establish and maintain lines of red fluorescent protein expressing embryonic stem cells and mice.
we have used embryonic stem cell-mediated transgenesis to evaluate mrfp <dig> in embryonic stem cells and mice.
high levels of widespread mrfp <dig> expression are maintained in a constitutive manner in embryonic stem cells in culture and in transgenic animals.
our work in generating cag::mrfp <dig> transgenic es cells and mice demonstrates the developmental neutrality of mrfp <dig> in an organismal context.
high levels of mrfp <dig> expression do not affect cell morphology, developmental potential or viability and fertility of animals.
we find that mrfp <dig> exhibits the most spatially homogenous expression when compared to the native  and variant dimeric forms of dsred.
moreover co-visualization of red, green and cyan fluorescent cells within a sample is easily achieved without the need for specialized methodologies, such as spectral deconvolution or linear unmixing.
fluorescent proteins with excitation and/or emission profiles in the red part of the visible spectrum represent distinct partners, or longer wavelength substitutes for gfp.
