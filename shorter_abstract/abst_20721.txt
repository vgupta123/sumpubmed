twelve of these tfs are involved in mapk signaling or myeloid leukemia pathways defined in the kegg database, or are known to physically interact with each other.
thus, our algorithm extends the applicability of nca to the realm of mammalian regulatory network analysis.
the advantage of our new algorithm, relative to the original nca, is that our algorithm can identify the important tf-gene interactions.
identifying the important tf-gene interactions is crucial for understanding the roles of pleiotropic global regulators, such as p <dig>  also, our algorithm has been developed to overcome nca's inability to analyze large networks where multiple tfs regulate a single gene.
at least 80% of the main target genes were correctly predicted in the extreme condition of high noise level and small number of datasets.
furthermore, the trimmed network was able to predict eno <dig> as an important target of hif1a; this key interaction could not be detected without trimming the regulatory network.
network component analysis  has been used to deduce the activities of transcription factors  from gene expression data and the tf-gene binding relationship.
thus, it is beneficial to identify key tf-gene interactions under the experimental condition based on transcriptome data.
theoretical studies demonstrated that the regulatory signals were accurately reconstructed even in the case where only three independent transcriptome datasets were available.
our algorithm was tested with transcriptome data taken from mice under rapamycin treatment.
