in this respect, a striking difference was observed between the transcript profiles of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and those encoding ribosomal biogenesis components.
therefore, these can be seen as true "signature" transcripts for anaerobicity under dynamic as well as under steady state conditions.
the shift towards fully fermentative conditions caused a massive transcriptional reprogramming, where one third of all genes within the genome were transcribed differentially.
this transition was studied by exposing aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a low specific growth rate to two simultaneous perturbations: oxygen depletion and relief of glucose limitation.
our study demonstrated that, despite the complexity of this multiple-input perturbation, the transcriptional responses could be categorized and biologically interpreted.
by comparing this study with public datasets representing dynamic and steady conditions,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were determined to be anaerobic specific.
the changes in transcript levels were mostly driven by relief from glucose-limitation.
