most studied methods for prediction of subcellular localization of proteins are signal peptides, the location by sequence homology, and the correlation between the total amino acid compositions of proteins.
taking amino-acid composition and amino acid pair composition into consideration helps improving the prediction accuracy.
svm modules were trained to predict the subcellular location based on amino acid composition and amino acid pair composition.
total prediction accuracy reached to  <dig> % for amino acid composition and  <dig> % for amino acid pair composition.
results were calculated after 10-fold cross validation.
radial basis function  outperformed polynomial and linear kernel functions.
it is highly desirable to predict a protein's subcellular locations automatically from its sequence.
we constructed a dataset of protein sequences from swiss-prot database and segmented them into  <dig> classes based on their subcellular locations.
in order to observe the impact of number of subcellular locations we constructed two more datasets of nine and five subcellular locations.
a new svm based approach is presented based on amino acid and amino acid pair composition.
total accuracy was further improved to  <dig> % and  <dig> %.
