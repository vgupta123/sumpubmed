one such phenomenon is heterosis or hybrid vigor: crossing individuals from genetically distinct populations often results in improvements in quantitative traits, such as growth rate, biomass production and stress resistance.
thus, the model also describes a process akin to speciation due to genetic incompatibility of the separated populations.
hybrid vigor was observed and its extent was seen to increase as parental populations diverged, up until a point of sudden collapse of hybrid fitness.
we also reproduce, for the first time in a model, the fact that hybrid vigor cannot easily be fixed by within a breeding line, currently an important limitation of the use of hybrid crops.
the level of detail in our model allows us to suggest possible warning signs of the impending collapse of hybrid vigor in breeding.
our model reproduced common experimental observations on heterosis using only biologically justified parameters, such as mutation rates.
we have taken a computational approach to studying heterosis, developing a simulation of evolution, independent reassortment of alleles and hybridization of gene regulatory networks  in a boolean framework.
this study describes the most detailed simulation of heterosis using gene regulatory networks to date and reproduces several phenomena associated with heterosis for the first time in a model.
