interfering with glutathione production in the cytosol by buthionine sulfoximine  or enhancing its localized destruction by expression of the glutathione-degrading enzyme chac <dig> in the lumen of the er further enhanced the luminal h2o <dig> signal and eroded β-cell viability.
over the years hints have suggested that glutathione, puzzlingly abundant in the er lumen, might have a role in reducing the heavy burden of h2o <dig> produced by the luminal enzymatic machinery for disulfide bond formation.
consistent with the hypothesized contribution of oxidative protein folding to h2o <dig> production, er-localized triper detected an increase in the luminal h2o <dig> signal upon induction of pro-insulin , which was attenuated by the ectopic expression of catalase in the er lumen.
the fate of hydrogen peroxide  in the endoplasmic reticulum  has been inferred indirectly from the activity of er-localized thiol oxidases and peroxiredoxins, in vitro, and the consequences of their genetic manipulation, in vivo.
