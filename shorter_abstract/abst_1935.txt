this showed that the paralogs were associated with for example energy production, cell motility, ion transport, and defence mechanisms.
a statistical overrepresentation analysis of gene and protein annotations was based on paralogs of the  <dig> prokaryotes with the highest fraction of paralog-forming genes.
if there is no selective advantage in keeping the duplicated gene, it is usually reduced to a pseudogene and disappears from the genome.
the clusters were classified using similarity scores on properties and species to identify interesting clusters, and a subset of clusters were analysed by comparison to literature data.
these gene products are likely to be beneficial to the organism, e.g.
paralogs were identified in a number of prokaryotes, and these paralogs were compared to singletons of persistent orthologs based on functional classification.
paralogs and singletons dominate different categories of functional classification, where paralogs in particular seem to be associated with processes involving interaction with the environment.
biclustering of overrepresented gene ontology terms versus species was used to identify clusters of properties associated with clusters of species.
however, the analysis also showed that the gene ontology terms sometimes were too general, imprecise or even misleading for automatic analysis.
properties described by gene ontology terms identified in the overrepresentation analysis are often consistent with individual prokaryote lifestyles and are likely to give a competitive advantage to the organism.
this includes processes like ion transport, locomotion, chemotaxis and photosynthesis.
gene duplication is a normal evolutionary process.
