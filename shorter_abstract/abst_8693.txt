most wheat snps were monomorphic in the oat population.
however the polymorphic wheat snps could be scored accurately and integrated well into the linkage map.
we report the first apr qtl in oat with a large and consistent effect.
the genetic basis of this apr was studied under field conditions in three recombinant inbred line  populations: 1) ac assiniboia/mn <dig>  2) ac medallion/mn <dig>  and 3) makuru/mn <dig>  the populations were evaluated for crown rust resistance with the crown rust isolate cr <dig>  in multiple environments.
crown rust, caused by puccinia coronata f. sp.
the crown rust apr in the oat line mn <dig> has been effective for more than 30 years.

this study reports a high density genetic linkage map constructed with oat and wheat snp markers in the ac assiniboia/mn <dig> ril population.
this qtl is flanked by two snp markers, gmi_gbs_ <dig> and gmi_es14_c1439_ <dig>  qpc.crc-14d was validated in the populations ac medallion/mn <dig> and makuru/mn <dig>
adult plant resistance , based upon partial resistance, has proven to be a durable rust management strategy in other cereal rust pathosystems.
the 6 k oat and 90 k wheat illumina infinium single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays were used for genotyping the ac assiniboia/mn <dig> population.
avenae, is the most important disease of oat worldwide.
synteny with wheat suggests that qpc.crc-14d is orthologous with the stripe rust apr gene yr <dig> in wheat.
a major quantitative trait locus  on oat chromosome 14d, designated qpc.crc-14d, explained up to 76% of the apr phenotypic variance.
this is also the first study to use the 90 k wheat infinium snp array on oat for marker development and comparative mapping.
