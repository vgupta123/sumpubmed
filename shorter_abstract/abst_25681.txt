chip-seq analysis combined with transcriptome data also demonstrates that cgra directly regulates the expression of numerous sigma factors and transcription factors several of which are known to be involved in cyst cell development.
recent analysis of cyst development has revealed that ~20Â % of the rhodospirillum centenum transcriptome undergo temporal changes in expression as cells transition from vegetative to cyst forms.
this analysis reveals the presence of cgra binding sites upstream of many developmentally regulated genes including many transcription factors and signal transduction components.
our results indicate that disruption of cgra leads to altered expression of  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which have been previously reported to be involved in cyst development.
several gram-negative species undergo development leading to the formation of metabolically dormant desiccation resistant cysts.
cgra thus functions as master controller of the cyst development by initiating a hierarchal cascade of downstream transcription factors that induces temporal expression of encystment genes.
cgra in the presence of cgmp initiate a cascade of gene expression leading to the development of cysts.
