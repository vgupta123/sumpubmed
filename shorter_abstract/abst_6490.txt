thus, it is important to develop methods to identify regulatory targets of tfs from chip-chip data.
we developed a method, called temporal relationship identification algorithm , which uses gene expression data to identify a tf's regulatory targets among its binding targets inferred from chip-chip data.
we applied tria to yeast cell cycle microarray data and identified many plausible regulatory targets of cell cycle tfs.
tria has the ability to identify subsets of highly co-expressed genes among the regulatory targets of a tf.
finding the regulatory targets of tfs is important for understanding how cells change their transcription program to adapt to environmental stimuli.
we validated our predictions by checking the enrichments for functional annotation and known cell cycle genes.
chip-chip data, which indicate binding of transcription factors  to dna regions in vivo, are widely used to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks.
finally, for a control, we showed that tria also performs well for cell-cycle irrelevant tfs.
