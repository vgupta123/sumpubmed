while ngs allows rapid global detection of transcripts, it remains difficult to distinguish ncrnas from short mrnas.
out of  <dig> annotated ehec ncrnas,  <dig> showed an rcv similar to protein-coding genes, of those,  <dig> had riboseq patterns matching annotated genes in other enterobacteriaceae, and  <dig> seem to possess a shine-dalgarno sequence, suggesting that such ncrnas may encode small proteins instead of being solely non-coding.
based on their low rcv,  <dig> novel non-translated ehec transcripts were identified as putative ncrnas, representing both antisense and intergenic transcripts,  <dig> of which had expressed homologs in e. coli mg <dig>  bioinformatics analysis predicted statistically significant target regulons for  <dig> of the intergenic transcripts; experimental analysis revealed 4-fold or higher differential expression of  <dig> novel ncrna in different growth media.
a high ratio of ribosomal footprints per transcript  is expected to indicate a translated rna, while a low rcv should point to a non-translated rna.
