the tool jane rapidly maps ests or variable sequence reads in prokaryotic sequencing and transcriptome efforts to related template genomes.
ests or variable sequence reads can be available in prokaryotic studies well before a complete genome is known.
use cases include  transcriptome studies or  single cell sequencing of bacteria.
without suitable software their further analysis and mapping would have to await finalization of the corresponding genome.
furthermore, we developed for rapid mapping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided from the blast algorithm.
rapid assembly on and replacement of the template genome by sequence reads or mapped ests is achieved.
