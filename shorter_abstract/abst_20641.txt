daphnia magna was fed with either a cyanobacterial strain that produces microcystins or its genetically engineered microcystin knock-out mutant.
since daphniaâ€™s genome was published only recently, it is now possible to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of microcystin tolerance of daphnia.
here, we were able to identify new candidate genes that specifically respond to microcystins by separating cyanobacterial effects from microcystin effects.
the involvement of these candidate genes in tolerance to microcystins was validated by correlating the difference in transporter gene expression with clonal tolerance.
with the availability of clear candidate genes, future investigations examining the process of local adaptation of daphnia populations to microcystins are now possible.
cyanobacterial blooms are increasing worldwide in intensity and frequency due to eutrophication and global warming.
cyanobacteria constitute a serious threat to freshwater ecosystems by producing toxic secondary metabolites, e.g.
here we show that the expression of transporter genes in daphnia was regulated as a specific response to microcystins.
