although convergent evolution appears likely, syndactyly in diprotodontia and peramelemorpha may occur through homologous developmental processes.
reports of incipient syndactyly in some marsupial clades could not be confirmed; contrary to previous claims, syndactyly does not appear to impact on tarsal bone arrangement.
however, this does not impact on overall locomotor adaptation patterns in the syndactylous foot as determined by analysis of locomotor predictor ratios.
the results suggest that marsupial syndactyly originates from a constraint that is rooted in early digit ontogeny and results in evolution of the syndactylous digits as a highly integrated unit.
syndactylous digits have virtually identical variance/covariance matrices and display heterochronic ossification timing with respect to digits iv/v.
this study undertakes the first interdisciplinary characterisation of syndactyly, using variance/covariance matrix comparisons of morphometric measurements, locomotor indices, ossification sequences, and re-assessment of the largely anecdotal data on the phylogenetic distribution of tarsal/metatarsal articulations and "incipient syndactyly".
it is traditionally defined as a condition in which digits ii and iii of the foot are bound by skin and are reduced.
