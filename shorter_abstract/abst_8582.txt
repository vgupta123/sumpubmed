the serotype specificity and affinity of the sdabs were identified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance assay.
results demonstrated that the two sdabs were specific for serotype o and shared no cross-reactivity with serotypes a and asia  <dig>  the equilibrium dissociation constant  values of the two sdabs ranged from  <dig>  nm to  <dig>  nm, which indicated high affinity to fmdv antigens.
foot-and-mouth disease  is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals and causes significant economic losses to husbandry worldwide.
the variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies  are single-domain antigen-binding fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies.
co-localization with the sdab-af <dig> and sdab-qd probes indicated the same location of fmdv virions in baby hamster kidney- <dig>  cells.
sdab-qd probes are powerful tools to detect and image fmdv in bhk- <dig> cells.
moreover, the sdabs were conjugated with quantum dots to constitute probes for imaging fmd virions.

in this work, two sdabs against fmd virus  serotype o were selected from a camelid phage display immune library and expressed in escherichia coli.
