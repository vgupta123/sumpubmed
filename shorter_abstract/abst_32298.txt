it allows the retrieval of plant nematode multialigned sequences or the classification of new nematode rdna sequences by applying reb.
the same algorithm also supports automatic updating of the ppnema database.
however, in some specific contexts, it is useful to compare the query sequence against a cluster such as a multialignment .
automatic characterization of a submitted biosequence according to the function of the sequences described by the pattern best matching the query sequence.
using reb can also rapidly solve any other bioinformatics problem, where the addition of a new sequence to a pre-existing cluster is required.
