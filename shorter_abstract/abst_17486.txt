developers typically spend considerable time and effort implementing these support structures, which detracts from working on the novel aspects of their tool.
and even though the purpose of these tools can vary significantly, they usually share a basic set of features, including the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the visualization of  spectra and chromatograms, and the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines.
the library contains a broad set of features required for reading, parsing, and analyzing proteomics data.
our library thus allows the developers to focus on the novel aspects of their tools, rather than on the basic functions, which can contribute substantially to faster development, and better tools for proteomics.
