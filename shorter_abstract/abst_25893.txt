the copper  transporter  gene family has an important role in the maintenance of cu homeostasis in different species.
however, these copt genes, which showed different tissue-specific expression patterns and cu level-regulated expression patterns, were also transcriptionally influenced by deficiency of iron, manganese, or zinc.
the endogenous concentrations of iron, manganese, or zinc may influence cu homeostasis by influencing the expression of copts in rice.
these results suggest that copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> may cooperate with copt <dig>  respectively, and copt <dig> acts alone for cu transport in different rice tissues.
however, only two, copt <dig> and copt <dig>  have been characterized for their functions in cu transport.
all members of the rice copt family have the conserved features of known copt/ctr-type cu transporter genes.
among the proteins encoded by rice copts, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> physically interacted with copt <dig>  respectively, except for the known interaction between copt <dig> and copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> cooperating with copt <dig> mediated a high-affinity cu uptake in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacked the functions of scctr <dig> and scctr <dig> for cu uptake.
copt <dig> alone could mediate a high-affinity cu uptake in the yeast mutant.
