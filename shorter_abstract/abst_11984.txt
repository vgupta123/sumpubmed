we show that, using the recommended default parameters, the programs tested are producing a wide range of predictions at different levels of specificity and sensitivity.
we identify settings, in which the different predictors have the same false positive rate.
this is useful in the framework of proteome-wide applications where high specificity is required such as in our in-house sequence analysis pipeline and the annie webserver.
consequently, several methods with different underlying principles for disorder prediction have been independently developed by various groups.
this work identifies parameter settings and thresholds for a selection of disorder predictors to produce comparable results at a desired level of specificity over a newly derived benchmark dataset that accounts equally for ordered and disordered regions of different lengths.
we assess conditions when sets of predictors can be run together to derive consensus or complementary predictions.
for assessing their usability in automated workflows, we are interested in identifying parameter settings and threshold selections, under which the performance of these predictors becomes directly comparable.
first, we derived a new benchmark set that accounts for different flavours of disorder complemented with a similar amount of order annotation derived for the same protein set.
