initially, endothelial cell lines were in silico subtracted from non-endothelial cell lines to identify endothelial genes.
these methods were applied to the latest available cell line and bulk tissue cdna libraries in a two-step screen to predict novel tumour endothelial markers.
subsequently, a second bulk tumour versus normal tissue subtraction was employed to predict tumour endothelial markers.
<dig> genes were predicted tumour endothelial markers in multiple tissues based on the second bulk tissue screen.
this approach represents a significant advance on earlier work in its ability to accurately assign an est to a gene, statistically measure differential expression between two pools of cdna libraries and predict putative tumour endothelial markers before entering the laboratory.
firstly by the introduction of an accurate method of assigning expressed sequence tags  to genes and secondly, by using a novel likelihood ratio statistical scoring of differential gene expression between two pools of cdna libraries.
from an endothelial cdna library analysis,  <dig> genes were significantly up regulated in endothelial cells with a false discovery rate adjusted q-value of  <dig>  or less and  <dig> of these were expressed only in endothelial cells.
in this study, differential gene expression analysis using complementary dna  libraries has been improved.
