cannibalism depends on population density and nutritional conditions, and could be beneficial during colonisation of new environments.
while high population density significantly increased cannibalism in both larvae and adults, the norm of reaction of cannibalism to individual density did not change significantly during the invasion and/or laboratory rearing processes.
we investigated whether the propensity for cannibalism in h. axyridis differs both between native and invasive populations and between invasive populations from the core and from the front of the invasive area in western europe.
cannibalism was significantly greater in larvae from invasive populations compared to native or biocontrol populations, but there was no difference in cannibalism rates between populations from the core or front of the invaded range.
this study is the first to provide evidence for a higher propensity for cannibalism in invasive populations compared to native ones.
we measured the cannibalism rates of eggs by first instar larvae and adult females at two different individual densities of ladybirds from three types of population , in laboratory-controlled conditions.
no differences in cannibalism rates of adult females were found between any populations.
however, we are still at an early stage in understanding the underlying mechanisms and several different research perspectives are needed to determine whether the higher propensity for cannibalism is a general feature of the invasion process.
our experiments also shed light on the difference in cannibalism evolution with respect to life stages.
we also compared the propensity for cannibalism of these natural populations with that of laboratory-reared biocontrol populations.
cannibalism was significantly lower in larvae from biocontrol populations compared to wild  populations.
