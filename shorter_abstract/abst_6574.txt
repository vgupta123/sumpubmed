recent studies have shown significant epigenetic patterns associated with developmental stages and diseases.
we used this method to analyze a published chip-seq dataset of five histone modification marks  in mouse embryonic stem  cells.
we developed a hidden markov model  approach for detecting the types and locations of epigenetic domains from multiple histone modifications.
in total, our three-state hmm identified  <dig> domains in the mouse genome containing  <dig>  genes on average.
we found that each type of domain is associated with distinct biological functions and structural changes during early cell differentiation.
the hmm approach successfully detects domains of consistent epigenetic patterns from chip-seq data, providing new insights into the role of epigenetics in long-range gene regulation.
however, previous studies have been mostly limited to focal epigenetic patterns, whereas methods for analyzing large-scale organizations are still lacking.
