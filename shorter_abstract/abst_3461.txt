in this study, one of the first in a forensic environment, we used the ion torrent personal genome machine  for generating complete mitogenome sequences via stand-alone massively parallel sequencing and describe a standard data validation practice.
in this first representative investigation on the mitochondrial dna  variation of east timor  population including > <dig> individuals, we put special emphasis on the reconstruction of the initial settlement, in particular on the previously poorly resolved haplogroup p <dig>  an indigenous lineage of the southwest pacific region.

the temporal proximity and possible coincidence of these latter dispersals, which encompassed autochthonous haplogroups, with the postulated “later” events of  east asian origin pinpoints a highly dynamic migratory phase.
our results suggest a colonization of southern sahul  > <dig> kya, limited subsequent exchange, and a parallel incubation of initial settlers in northern sahul  followed by westward migrations < <dig> kya.
