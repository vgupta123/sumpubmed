the acyclic terpene utilization pathway is used in t. linaloolentis 47lolt during growth on -linalool and nitrate under anoxic conditions.
the betaproteobacterium thauera linaloolentis 47lolt was isolated on the tertiary monoterpene alcohol -linalool as sole carbon and energy source under denitrifying conditions.
the draft genome of t. linaloolentis 47lolt had atu and liu genes with homology to those of pseudomonas spp..
a transposon mutagenesis yielded  <dig> transconjugants that could not grow anaerobically on linalool and nitrate in liquid medium.
this is the first experimental verification of an active atu pathway outside of the genus pseudomonas.
thus, a  <dig> -hydroxyl-Δ1-Δ2-mutase  activity may initiate the degradation, followed by enzymes of the acyclic terpene utilization  and leucine/isovalerate utilization  pathways that were extensively studied in pseudomonas spp.

growing cultures formed geraniol and geranial transiently, but also geranic acid.
the deficiencies were apparently based on gene functions required to overcome the toxicity of linalool, but not due to inactivation of genes in the degradation pathway.
analysis of expressed proteins detected several enzymes of the atu and liu pathways.
