in archaea and eukaryotes, ribonucleoprotein complexes containing small c/d box srnas use base pair complementarity to target specific sites within ribosomal rna for 2'-o-ribose methylation.
we have identified the complete sets of c/d box srnas from seven archaea using rna-seq methodology.
in total,  <dig> c/d box srnas were identified, each containing two guide regions.
in addition, several c/d box srnas were identified that use their two guides to target locations distant in the rrna sequence but close in the secondary and tertiary structure.
gene duplication, rearrangement, mutational drift and convergent evolution of srna genes and guide sequences were observed.
this pan-archaeal analysis of c/d box srna guide regions identified conserved patterns of rrna 2'-o-methylation in archaea.
the genomes of hyperthermophilic archaea encode large numbers of c/d box srna genes, suggesting an increased necessity for rrna stabilization at extreme growth temperatures.

we propose that they act as rna chaperones and facilitate complex folding events between distant sequences.
