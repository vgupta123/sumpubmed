the goal of this study was to identify the effect of diet composition on plasma levels of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids and triglycerides in cats receiving different diets .
intake of the high-carbohydrate diet resulted in higher insulin concentrations compared with the two other diets.
as the high-carbohydrate diet led to the highest insulin blood concentrations, it might be useful to avoid such diets in cats predisposed to overweight.
the other blood parameters were not correlated with phenotype.
in addition, even cats with genetically linked obesity can regain insulin sensitivity after weight loss.
insulin levels were lower, whereas leptin levels were higher in cats predisposed to overweight.
insulin levels were within the values described for non-obese cats in previous studies.
insulin and leptin concentrations were significantly correlated with phenotype.
there was no difference in metabolic response between the two groups.
