ice  family genes play an important role in the regulation of cold tolerance pathways.
using emsa  and yeast one-hybrid assays, we confirmed that cdice <dig> binds specifically to the myc element in the cddreba promoter and activates transcription.
interestingly, we observed that cdice1-overexpressing plants experienced significant reduction in mir <dig>  in addition, its target genes csd <dig>  and csd <dig> showed inducible expression under acclimation at 16Â°c, indicating that the mir398-csd pathway was involved in the induction of freezing tolerance.
