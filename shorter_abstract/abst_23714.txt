low sequence coverage, repetitive elements and short read length make de novo genome assembly difficult, often resulting in sequence and/or fragment “gaps” – uncharacterized nucleotide  stretches of unknown or estimated lengths.
we demonstrate how it scales to successfully close  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of gaps in human  and white spruce  draft assemblies in under  <dig> and 27 h, respectively – a feat that is not possible with other leading tools with the breadth of data used in our study.
while next-generation sequencing technologies have made sequencing genomes faster and more affordable, deciphering the complete genome sequence of an organism remains a significant bioinformatics challenge, especially for large genomes.
sealer is an automated finishing application that uses the succinct bloom filter representation of a de bruijn graph to close gaps in draft assemblies, including that of very large genomes.
here we describe sealer, a tool designed to close gaps within assembly scaffolds by navigating de bruijn graphs represented by space-efficient bloom filter data structures.
