the aim of our study was to assess the ability of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles -labeled wharton’s jelly of the human umbilical cord-derived mscs  to carry the green fluorescent protein  gene to cutaneous injury sites in a murine model.
the spions/gfp-positive wj-mscs expressed multipotent cell markers and demonstrated the potential for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation.

group i was treated with wj-mscs, group ii with spions/gfp-positive wj-mscs, and group iii with spions/gfp-positive wj-mscs exposed to an external magnetic field .
the results showed that gfp could be intensively detected around the wound in vivo 24 h after the cells were injected.
mesenchymal stem cells  are multipotent stromal cells that have the ability to self-renew and migrate to sites of pathology.
magnetic resonance imaging and optical molecular imaging were performed, and images were acquired  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after cell injection.
