the most frequent phage types  identified in argentinian, australian, and new zealand strains were pt <dig> , pt <dig> , and pt <dig> , respectively.
stec o <dig> strains isolated in argentina, australia, and new zealand differed from each other in terms of stx-genotype and phage type.
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  is an important cause of bloody diarrhoea , non-bloody diarrhoea  and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome .
the main aims of this study were to compare the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of stec o <dig> strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from humans in argentina, australia and new zealand, and to establish their clonal relatedness.
the clonal relatedness of strains was investigated by phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis .
in argentina and new zealand, the most prevalent stec serotype is o157:h <dig>  which is responsible for the majority of hus cases.
seventy-three o <dig> stec strains, isolated from hus , bd , nbd , or unspecified conditions  in argentina, australia and new zealand, were analysed.
this analysis revealed that the most frequent stx genotypes were stx2/stx2c   in argentina, stx <dig>  in new zealand, and stx1/stx <dig>  in australia.
no stx1-postive strains were identified in argentina or new zealand.
all strains harboured the eae gene and  <dig> strains produced enterohaemolysin .
in australia, on the other hand, stec o157:h <dig> is associated with a minority of hus cases.
international collaborative studies of the type reported here are needed to detect and monitor potentially hypervirulent stec clones.
