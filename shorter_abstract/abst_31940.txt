a molecular approach is presented for the rapid identification of pathogens combining pcr amplification with microarray detection.
the newly developed molecular assay can be carried out within  <dig> hours in a research laboratory from pathogen isolation to species identification.
the observed detection limits varied from  <dig> cells  to  <dig> cells  per ml artificially spiked blood.
molecular biology based techniques allow fast identification, however discrimination of very closely related species remains still difficult.
from our results we conclude that dna microarrays can be a useful tool for rapid identification of closely related pathogens particularly when the protocols are adapted to the special clinical scenarios.
however, early and accurate identification is a crucial requisite for fast and optimally targeted antimicrobial treatment.
pathogen identification in clinical routine is based on the cultivation of microbes with subsequent morphological and physiological characterisation lasting at least  <dig> hours.
a prototype software providing this statistical evaluation was developed, allowing correct identification in  <dig> % of the cases at the genus and in  <dig>  % at the species level .
