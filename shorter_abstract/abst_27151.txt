this is consistent with the average accuracy of  <dig> % for a holdout test set comprised of  <dig> am and  <dig> non-amyloidogenic sequences.
non-amyloidogenic sequences are predicted with average loo cross validation accuracies between  <dig> % and  <dig> % using the bayesian classifier, depending on the training set size.
the loo cross validation accuracy increases to  <dig> % when the training set is augmented by the holdout test set.
in comparison, the average classification accuracy for the holdout test set obtained using a decision tree is  <dig> %.
the accuracy for the holdout test set was 89%.
the average accuracy based on leave-one-out  cross validation of a bayesian classifier generated from  <dig> amyloidogenic sequences is  <dig> %.
we explore using a naive bayesian classifier and a weighted decision tree for predicting the amyloidogenicity of immunoglobulin sequences.
for the decision tree, the non-amyloidogenic prediction accuracy is  <dig> %.
the accuracy of the classifiers may also be improved when additional factors, such as structural and physico-chemical data, are considered.
this exploratory study indicates that both classification methods may be promising in providing straightforward predictions on the amyloidogenicity of a sequence.
