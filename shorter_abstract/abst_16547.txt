ipcs gene exhibited slightly lower codon bias as compared to spl and spt protein families.
the present work relates to the role of selection pressure deciding functional conservedness and divergence of the drug targets.
evolutionary tracing of the proposed drug targets has been done with a viewpoint that the amino-acids lining the drug binding pocket should have a lower evolvability.
selection pressure governs the relative mutability and the conservedness of a protein across the protein family.
to further explore the selection pressure at the codon level, codon usage bias indices were calculated to analyze genes for their synonymous codon usage pattern.

ipcs and spl protein families appear to diverge from the spt family.
the three protein families were largely under the influence of purifying selection and were moderately conserved baring two residues in the ipcs protein which were under the influence of positive selection.
biomolecules  continuously evolve under the effect of evolutionary pressure that arises as a consequence of the host parasite interaction.
sites under positive selection  should be avoided during devising strategies for inhibitor design.
ipcs , spl  and spt  represent three important enzymes involved in the sphingolipid metabolism of leishmania.
