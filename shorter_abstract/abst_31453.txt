here, we investigate the possibility that spontaneous conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate could be responsible for ai- <dig> generation in the absence of luxs.
our results suggest that luxs-independent formation of ai- <dig>  via spontaneous conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate, may indeed occur in vivo.
however, generation of ai-2-like activity has also been reported for organisms lacking the luxs gene and the existence of alternative pathways for ai- <dig> formation in escherichia coli has recently been predicted by stochastic modelling.
however, low activities were detected in an e. coli pgi-eda-edd-luxs mutant, a strain which degrades glucose entirely via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, with ribulose-5-phosphate as an obligatory intermediate.
in agreement with previous studies, culture supernatants of e. coli and staphylococcus aureus luxs mutants were found not to contain detectable levels of ai- <dig> activity.
it does not contribute to ai- <dig> formation in wildtype e. coli and s. aureus under the conditions tested, but may be responsible for the ai-2-like activities reported for other organisms lacking the luxs gene.
