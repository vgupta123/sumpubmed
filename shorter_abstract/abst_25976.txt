as a whole, the organogenetic sequence of bat embryos is uniform and the embryos appear homoplastic before stage  <dig>  morphological differentiation between species occurs mainly after embryonic stage  <dig>  our study provides three new bat species for interspecific comparison of post-implantation embryonic development within the order chiroptera and detailed data on the development of nose-leaves for bats in the superfamily rhinolophoidea.
using an established embryonic staging system, we identified the embryonic stages for m. schreibersii fuliginosus, h. armiger and h. pratti and described the morphological changes in each species, including the development of the complex and distinctive nose-leaves in h. armiger and h. pratti.
however, there are far fewer morphological studies of post-implantation embryonic development than early embryonic development in bats.
