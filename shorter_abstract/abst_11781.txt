linearity was present for crp concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 281 mg/l.
for clinically relevant crp concentrations of 7–281 mg/l, recovery ranged between  <dig> and 105% and intra- and inter-assay cvs ranged between  <dig> % -  <dig> % and  <dig> % -  <dig> %, respectively.
imprecision, accuracy, interference and the prozone effect were determined using samples from healthy and diseased dogs .
no prozone effect occurred up to 676 mg/l crp.
aims of our study were 1) to independently evaluate the canine-specific crp assay on the abx pentra  <dig> clinical chemistry analyzer in comparison to the previously validated human-based immunoturbidimetric assay  and 2) to assess the impact of different sample types  on the results.
the sample type had a significant  but clinically not relevant impact on the results .
the species-specific gentian canine crp immunoassay reliably detects canine crp on the abx pentra  <dig> clinical chemistry analyzer whereby both serum and heparin plasma can be used.

method comparison study revealed a spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of rs =  <dig>  and a mean constant bias of  <dig> %.
a canine-specific immunoturbidimetric crp assay, gentian canine crp immunoassay) with species-specific controls and calibrators was introduced and recently evaluated on the clinical chemistry analyzer abbott architect c <dig> as well as on the olympus au <dig>
interference was not present up to a concentration of 5 g/l hemoglobin, 800 mg/l bilirubin and 10 g/l triglycerides.
the randox canine crp assay calibrated with canine specific control calibration material served as a reference method.
additionally, the impact of the sample type  was evaluated based on samples of healthy and diseased dogs  in a second part of the study.
