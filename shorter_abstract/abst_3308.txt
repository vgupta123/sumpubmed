the blue mountains water skink  is a viviparous scincid lizard that is restricted to <  <dig> isolated montane swamps in south-eastern australia.
our study suggests that low adult survival rates, as well as specialisation on a rare and fragmented habitat type  contribute to the endangered status of the blue mountains water skink.
litter size and offspring size are similar in the two species, but female e. leuraensis reproduce annually whereas many e. tympanum produce litters biennially.
offspring quality may decline with maternal age, based upon captive-born neonates .
information on the age structure within populations of an endangered species can facilitate effective management.
our  <dig> populations exhibited similar growth rates and population age structures despite substantial variation in elevation, geographic location and swamp size.
thus, a low survival rate  is the key reason why e. leuraensis is endangered.
in contrast to its broadly sympatric  congener e. tympanum, e. leuraensis is short-lived .
