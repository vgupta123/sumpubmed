real time pcr of  <dig> candidate genes validated the expression pattern of some genes in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves infected with calam or calas.
many gene transcripts and biological processes are significantly altered upon calam infection.
we analyzed global changes in gene expression of calam-infected leaves of sweet orange during the symptomatic stage of infection and compared the results with previously published microarray studies that used calas-infected plants.
the microarray analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes during the symptomatic stage of calam infection.
these data will be useful for selecting target genes for genetic engineering to control hlb.
several studies of the transcriptional response of citrus plants manifesting hlb symptoms have been reported, but only for calas infection.
gene set enrichment analysis  revealed that several of the transcripts encoded transporters associated with the endomembrane system, especially zinc transport.
this study evaluated the transcriptional reprogramming of a susceptible genotype of sweet orange challenged with calam, using a customized 385k microarray containing approximately  <dig>  unigene transcripts.
among the most biologically relevant gene transcripts in gsea were those related to signaling, metabolism and/or stimulus to hormones, genes responding to stress and pathogenesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, oxidative stress and transcription factors belonging to different families.
some of them had been identified in response to calas infection, while others had not been previously reported.
l. americanus , depending on the continent where the bacteria were first detected.
twenty candidate genes were selected to validate the expression profiles in symptomatic and asymptomatic pcr-positive leaves infected with calas or calam.
