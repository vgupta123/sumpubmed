regarding the identification of geographical locations, the system takes advantage of existing databases such as geonames to achieve 86% recall with 92% precision.
envmine is capable of retrieving the physicochemical variables cited in the text, by means of the accurate identification of their associated units of measurement.
this tool can help in determining the precise location and physicochemical variables of sampling sites, thus facilitating the performance of ecological analyses.
also a bayesian classifier was tested for distinguishing parts of the text describing environmental characteristics from others dealing with, for instance, experimental settings.
such a description must be done in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, allowing a direct comparison between different environments that would be difficult to do otherwise.
so far, this had to be performed by manual inspection of the corresponding documents.
currently, there is no schema for annotating these environmental features, and these data have to be extracted from textual sources .
to facilitate this task, we have developed envmine, a set of text-mining tools devoted to retrieve contextual information  from textual sources of any kind.
for ecological studies, it is crucial to count on adequate descriptions of the environments and samples being studied.
envmine is a very efficient method for extracting contextual information from different text sources, like published articles or web pages.
