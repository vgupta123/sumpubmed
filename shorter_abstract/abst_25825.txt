importantly, the absence of hypersensitivity response to the second allogeneic bm-mscs injection validates the use of repeat dose treatments to potentiate the therapeutic benefit of these cells.
total protein , white blood cell count  and neutrophil count  in synovial fluid were also measured at the same time-points.
the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and inflammatory responses to intra-articular single and repeat dose administration of autologous or of pooled allogeneic mscs in healthy equine healthy joints.
a mild synovial effusion without associated lameness was observed after all bm-mscs injections.
all contralateral joints were injected with lactated ringer’s solution  as the control vehicle.
mesenchymal stem cells  transplantation has become a promising therapeutic choice for musculoskeletal injuries.
these results notably contribute to the development of stem cell based therapies for equine and human joint diseases.

six horses were intra-articularly injected with a single autologous dose of bone marrow derived mscs  and two separate doses of allogeneic bm-mscs pooled from several donors.
both, clinical and synovial parameters were progressively normalized and by day  <dig> post-inoculation appeared indistinguishable from controls.
local temperature slightly increased after all bm-mscs treatments compared to the controls.
