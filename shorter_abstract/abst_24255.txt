a pipeline program package, agsnp, was developed and used for genome-wide snp discovery in aegilops tauschii-the diploid source of the wheat d genome, and with a genome size of  <dig>  gb, of which 90% is repetitive sequences.
a total of  <dig>  putative snps were discovered in gene sequences,  <dig>  putative snps were discovered in uncharacterized single-copy regions, and another  <dig>  putative snps were discovered in repeat junctions.
multiple genome equivalents of shotgun reads of another genotype generated with solid or solexa are then mapped to the annotated roche  <dig> reads to identify putative snps.
large genome sizes, an abundance of repeated sequences, and polyploidy present challenges to genome-wide snp discovery using next-generation sequencing  of total genomic dna by making alignment and clustering of short reads generated by the ngs platforms difficult, particularly in the absence of a reference genome sequence.
an annotation-based, genome-wide snp discovery pipeline is reported using ngs data for large and complex genomes without a reference genome sequence.
the pipeline is suitable for snp discovery in genomic libraries of complex genomes and does not require a reference genome sequence.
tauschii accession al8/ <dig> was sequenced with the roche  <dig> ngs platform.
tauschii accession as <dig> was sequenced primarily with solid, although some solexa and roche  <dig> genomic sequences were also generated.
roche  <dig> shotgun reads with low genome coverage of one genotype are annotated in order to distinguish single-copy sequences and repeat junctions from repetitive sequences and sequences shared by paralogous genes.
the pipeline is applicable to all current ngs platforms, provided that at least one such platform generates relatively long reads.
tauschii snps can be accessed at .
in a sample of  <dig> randomly selected putative snps,  <dig> % in gene regions,  <dig> % in repeat junctions, and  <dig> % in uncharacterized regions were validated.
both of these attributes typify the genome architecture in the tribe triticeae, whose members include economically important wheat, rye and barley.
genomic dna and cdna of ae.
an annotation-based genome-wide snp discovery pipeline for ngs platforms was developed.
to assess the false positive snp discovery rate, dna containing putative snps was amplified by pcr from al8/ <dig> and as <dig> and resequenced with the abi  <dig> xl.
many plants have large and complex genomes with an abundance of repeated sequences.
these snps were dispersed across the entire ae.
