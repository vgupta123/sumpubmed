we evaluated the probabilities to implement possible functions for each motif and found that the kurtosis of these distributions correlate well with the natural abundance pattern.
intrinsic plasticity is associated to each motif in terms of its capacity of implementing a repertoire of possible functions and it is directly linked to the motif's evolvability.
kurtosis is a standard measure for the peakedness of probability distributions.
the natural abundance pattern of the feed-forward loop can be reconstructed concerning its intrinsic plasticity.
furthermore, we examined the functional robustness of the motifs facing mutational pressure in silico and observed that the abundance pattern is biased by the degree of their evolvability.
transcription networks define the core of the regulatory machinery of cellular life and are largely responsible for information processing and decision making.
