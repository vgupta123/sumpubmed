in this study, we provide a complete analysis of rice dicer-like, argonaute and rdr gene families including gene structure, genomic localization and phylogenetic relatedness among gene family members.
this investigation has identified  <dig> rice genes belonging to dcl, argonaute and rdr gene families that could potentially be involved in reproductive development-specific gene regulatory mechanisms.
although most of the genes express both in vegetative and reproductive organs,  <dig> osdcls,  <dig> osagos and  <dig> osrdrs were found to express specifically/preferentially during stages of reproductive development.
these data provide an insight into probable domains of activity of these genes and a basis for further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of rna silencing machinery during reproductive phase of plant development.
important developmental processes in both plants and animals are partly regulated by genes whose expression is modulated at the post-transcriptional level by processes such as rna interference .
one of the argonautes  also showed specific up-regulation in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress.
investigations in eukaryotes have revealed that these proteins are encoded by variable number of genes with plants showing relatively higher number in each gene family.
