it is an attractive and emerging method to enhance wound healing and improve clinical outcomes both in human and veterinary medicine.
the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of lllt on cellular migration and proliferation of cultured canine epidermal keratinocytes  in an in vitro wound healing model.
canine epidermal keratinocyte cells exposed to lllt with  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  j/cm <dig> migrated significantly more rapidly  and showed significantly higher rates of proliferation  compared to non-irradiated cells cultured in the same medium and cells exposed to the higher energy dose of 10 j/cm <dig>  irradiation with 10 j/cm <dig> was characterized by decreased cellular migration and proliferation.
in this in vitro wound-healing model, lllt increased cellular migration and proliferation at doses of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  j/cm <dig> while exposure to 10 j/cm <dig> decreased cellular migration and proliferation.
these results revealed that lllt has a measurable, dose-dependent effect on two different aspects of keratinocyte biology in vitro.

low-level laser therapy  has been used clinically as a treatment modality for a variety of medical conditions including wound-healing processes.
keratinocyte migration and proliferation were assessed using a scratch migration assay and a proliferation assay, respectively.
fifteen independent replicates were performed for each assay.
