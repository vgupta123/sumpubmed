clostridium sticklandii belongs to a cluster of non-pathogenic proteolytic clostridia which utilize amino acids as carbon and energy sources.
stadtman in  <dig>  it has been generally regarded as a "gold mine" for novel biochemical reactions and is used as a model organism for studying metabolic aspects such as the stickland reaction, coenzyme-b12- and selenium-dependent reactions of amino acids.
besides, experimental procedures reveal that c. sticklandii degrades amino acids in a preferential and sequential way.
c. sticklandii is one of the best biochemically studied proteolytic clostridial species.
c. sticklandii possesses both the f-type and v-type atpases.
a rather unusual metabolic feature is the presence of genes for all the enzymes involved in two different co2-fixation pathways: c. sticklandii harbours both the glycine synthase/glycine reductase and the wood-ljungdahl pathways.
analysis of the c. sticklandii genome and additional experimental procedures have improved our understanding of anaerobic amino acid degradation.
energy conservation is primarily obtained by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentative pathways.
the reactions catalyzed by different ferredoxin oxidoreductases and the exergonic nadh-dependent reduction of crotonyl-coa point to a possible chemiosmotic energy conservation via the rnf complex.
