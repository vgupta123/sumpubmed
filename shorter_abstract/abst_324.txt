the sepsidae family of flies is a model for investigating how sexual selection shapes courtship and sexual dimorphism in a comparative framework.
the t. biloba transcriptome is a critical resource for performing large-scale rna-seq investigations of gene expression patterns, and is the first transcriptome sequenced in this dipteran family.
the pipeline we have developed for assembly and analysis increases contig length, recovers unique transcripts, and assembles more base pairs than other methods through the use of a meta-assembly.
we assembled transcriptomes from an additional three non-model organisms to demonstrate that our pipeline assembled a higher-quality transcriptome than single k-mer approaches across multiple species.
it uses a multiple k-mer length approach combined with a second meta-assembly to extend transcripts and recover more bases of transcript sequences than standard single k-mer assembly.
however, like many non-model systems, there are few molecular resources available.
we used  <dig> sequencing to generate  <dig>  million reads from cdna generated from embryo, larva, and pupae of t. biloba and assembled a transcriptome consisting of  <dig>  contigs.
