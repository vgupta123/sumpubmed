in this study, we designed a thorough experiment to evaluate six read count-based rnaseq analysis methods  using both real and simulated data.
rnaseq technology is replacing microarray technology as the tool of choice for gene expression profiling.

while providing much richer data than microarray, analysis of rnaseq data has been much more challenging.
we found the six methods produce similar fold changes and reasonable overlapping of differentially expressed genes based on p-values.
