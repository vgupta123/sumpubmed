the neuropsychological test battery covered  <dig> major cognitive domains by several well-established tests each.
most tests exhibited a similar pattern upon repetition:  clinically relevant practice effects during high-frequency testing until month  <dig> , most pronounced early on, and  a performance plateau thereafter upon low-frequency testing.
since repeated neuropsychological testing is required for respective longitudinal study designs, occurrence, time pattern and magnitude of practice effects on cognition have to be understood first under healthy good-performance conditions to enable design optimization and result interpretation in disease trials.
moreover, normative data for serial testing may now be collected to assess normal learning curves as important comparative readout of pathological cognitive processes.
