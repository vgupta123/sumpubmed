drosophila virilis is a cosmopolitan species belonging to the virilis group, where divergence times between different phylads go back to the early miocene.
the particular behavioural traits of this species, including weak species-discrimination and intraspecific mate choice exercised by the females, can be understood from this perspective.
the species showed no geographic structure in the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes, in contrast to results of a recent microsatellite-based analysis.
the lack of geographic structure and the star-like topology depicted by the d. virilis haplotypes indicate a pattern of global demographic expansion, probably related to human movements, although this interpretation cannot be distinguished from a selective sweep in the mitochondrial dna until nuclear sequence data become available.
we analysed mitochondrial dna sequence variation among  <dig> drosophila virilis strains covering the species' range in order to detect demographic events that could be used to understand the present characteristics of the species, as well as its differences from other members of the group.
the pattern of genetic variation within and among populations of a species is strongly affected by its phylogeographic history.
drosophila virilis showed very low nucleotide diversity with haplotypes distributed in a star-like network, consistent with a recent world-wide exponential expansion possibly associated either with domestication or post-glacial colonization.
all analyses point towards a rapid population expansion.
analyses based on putatively neutral markers provide data from which past events, such as population expansions and colonizations, can be inferred.
the central haplotype in the network, which could be interpreted as ancestral, is widely distributed and gives no information about the geographical origin of the population expansion.
