systems that are committed to defend survival and stimulate regeneration of tubular cells.
in this study we investigated whether msc operate by resetting cytokine network and scatter factor systems, i.e.
in addition, msc sustain the expression of the scatter factor systems expression, i.e.
our results demonstrate that msc modify cytokine network to a tolerogenic setting, they suppress th <dig> cells, inactivate monocytes/macrophage, recruit tregs.
in former studies we showed in a rat model of renal transplantation that mesenchymal stromal cells  prevent acute rejection in an independent way of their endowing in the graft.

controls were grafted untreated and normal rats.
in grafted untreated rats ifn-γ increased in serum and renal tissue and il- <dig> rose in serum.
msc were injected into the renal artery soon after reperfusion.
