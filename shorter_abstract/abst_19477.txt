moreover, bse infection could be discriminated from scrapie infection by faster electrophoretic migration of the prpres bands.
using dual antibody staining with selected monoclonal antibodies like 12b <dig> and l <dig>  these differences in migration could be employed for an unequivocal differentiation between bse and scrapie.
diagnosis based on prion detection in lymph nodes of sheep and goats can improve active surveillance for scrapie and, if it were circulating, for bovine spongiform encephalopathy .
with sizes that allow repetitive testing and a location that is easily accessible at slaughter, retropharyngeal lymph nodes  are considered suitable organs for testing.
firstly, in a study with preclinical scrapie cases, wb of rln from infected sheep of vrq/vrq genotype – vrq represents, respectively, polymorphic prp amino acids  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> – allowed a diagnosis  <dig> mo earlier compared to wb of brain stem.
with respect to glycosylation of prpres, bse cases exhibited a greater diglycosylated fraction than scrapie cases.
secondly, samples collected from sheep with confirmed scrapie in the course of passive and active surveillance programmes in the period 2002– <dig> yielded positive results depending on genotype: all sheep with genotypes arh/vrq, vrq/vrq, and arq/vrq scored positive for prpres, but arq/arq and arr/vrq were not all positive.
furthermore, a slight time dependent increase of diglycosylated prpres was noted between individual sheep, which was remarkable in that it occurred in both scrapie and bse study.
optimal prpres detection in rln by wb was achieved by proper tissue processing, antibody choice and inclusion of a step for prpresconcentration.
