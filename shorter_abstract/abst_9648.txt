we present structuprint, a free standalone software that fully automates the rendering of protein surface maps, given - at the very least - a directory with a pdb file and an amino acid property.
according to the results of a benchmark, its memory requirements and execution time are reasonable, allowing it to run even on low-end personal computers.
structuprint is partly optimized for multicore computers, making the rendering of animations of entire molecular dynamics simulations feasible.
we believe that it will be of use - primarily but not exclusively - to structural biologists and computational biochemists.
the term ‘molecular cartography’ encompasses a family of computational methods for two-dimensional transformation of protein structures and analysis of their physicochemical properties.
the core algorithm comprises the generation of a mould of the protein surface, which is subsequently converted to a sphere and mapped to two dimensions, using the miller cylindrical projection.
structuprint is an efficient application, implementing a molecular cartography algorithm for protein surfaces.
