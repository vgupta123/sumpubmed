the strong expression of pkcδ in ganglia during murine development shown in this study suggests a significant role of this isoform as well as redundancy with other pkcs within the nervous system, since pkcδ deficient mice develop normally.
ganglia were the domains with most prominent expression of pkcδ in most of the stages analysed, although pkcδ could also be detected in heart and somites at earlier stages, and cartilage primordium and skin among other sites in older embryos.
through lac z and antibody staining procedures, we show here the in vivo expression of pkcδ during mouse embryogenesis.
