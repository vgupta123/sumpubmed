we have demonstrated how a literature-based cckr signaling map together with its protein interaction extensions can be analyzed to generate new hypotheses on molecular mechanisms involved in gastrin- and cholecystokinin-mediated regulation of cellular processes.
we performed a detailed analysis of the literature reporting experimental evidence on signaling pathways triggered by cck1r and cck2r, in order to create a comprehensive map of gastrin and cholecystokinin-mediated intracellular signaling cascades.
these proteins represent experimentally testable hypotheses for gaining new knowledge on gastrin- and cholecystokinin receptor signaling.
the cckr map is freely available both in a downloadable, machine-readable sbml-compatible format and as a web resource through payao .
gastrin, a central regulator of gastric acid secretion, is involved in growth and differentiation of gastric and colonic mucosa, and there is evidence that it is pro-carcinogenic.
cholecystokinin is implicated in digestion, appetite control and body weight regulation, and may play a role in several digestive disorders.
