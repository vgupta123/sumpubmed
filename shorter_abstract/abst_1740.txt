by focusing on the ontological classification, we are able to determine the entire go profiles that are distributed at different levels of hierarchy.
in the present work we construct two layers of the breast cancer network: the gene layer, where the correlation network of breast cancer genes is analyzed to identify gene modules, and the protein layer, where each gene module is extended to map out the network of expressed proteins and their interactions in order to identify submodules.
genomic, proteomic and high-throughput gene expression data, when integrated, can be used to map the interaction networks between genes and proteins.
the present approach is an effective method for discovering coherent gene modules and protein submodules.
we thus construct a “network of networks”, and demonstrate that both the gene and protein interaction networks are modular in nature.
within each submodule most of the proteins are biologically correlated, and participate in groups of distinct biological activities.
we analyze the system in terms of modules, namely a set of densely interconnected nodes that can be further divided into submodules that are expected to participate in multiple biological activities in coordinated manner.
we show that this also provides a means of determining biological pathways  that are related, in the present instance, to breast cancer.
