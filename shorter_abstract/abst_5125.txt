consequently, hyper <dig> dye can be used in parallel with cy <dig> under any environmental conditions in array experiments.
our results show hyper <dig> signal to be stable to high ozone levels.
additionally, hyper <dig> arrays are shown to preserve sensitivity and data quality from gene expression experiments.
regardless of the microarray platform, cyanine dyes  are one of the most widely used fluorescent dye pairs for microarray analysis owing to their brightness and ease of incorporation, enabling high level of assay sensitivity.
our laboratory has been active in fluorescent dye research to find a suitable alternative to cy <dig> that is stable to ozone and resistant to photo-bleaching.
photobleaching experiments show hyper <dig> to be resistant to light induced damage with 3- fold improvement in dye stability over cy <dig>  in high resolution array cgh experiments, hyper <dig> is demonstrated to detect chromosomal aberrations at loci 2p21- <dig>  and 15q <dig> - <dig>  from three patient sample using bacterial artificial chromosome  arrays.
repeated exposure of mouse arrays hybridized with hyper5-labeled cdna to  <dig> ppb ozone at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minute intervals resulted in no signal loss from the dye.
cy <dig> can also suffer disproportionately from dye photobleaching resulting in distortion of  ratios used in copy number analysis.
the photostability of hyper <dig> is further documented by repeat array scanning without loss of detection.
however, combining both dyes on arrays can become problematic during summer months when ozone levels rise to near  <dig> parts per billion .
hyper <dig> is demonstrated to be resistant to ozone at up to  <dig> ppb, levels significantly higher than commonly observed during summer months.
