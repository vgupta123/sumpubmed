this study used comparative genomic analysis to address the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> multiprotein family, from early eukaryotes to mammals, in an effort to understand the forces that shaped the human genome content of chitinase related proteins.
mammals are not known to synthesize chitin or metabolize it as a nutrient, yet the human genome encodes eight gh <dig> family members.
finding that the human gh <dig> gene family is closely linked to the human major histocompatibility complex paralogon on chromosome  <dig>  together with the recent association of gh <dig> chitinase activity with th <dig> cell inflammation, suggests that its late expansion could be related to an emerging interface of innate and adaptive immunity during early vertebrate history.
chitinases  hydrolyze the β- <dig> -linkages in chitin, an abundant n-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine polysaccharide that is a structural component of protective biological matrices such as insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls.
gene duplication and loss according to a birth-and-death model of evolution is a feature of the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> family.
the family expanded in the chitinous protostomes c. elegans and d. melanogaster, declined in early deuterostomes as chitin synthesis disappeared, and expanded again in late deuterostomes with a significant increase in gene number after the avian/mammalian split.
only the chitinase/chitolectin group is associated with expansion in late deuterostomes.
this comprehensive genomic study of animal gh <dig> proteins reveals three major phylogenetic groups in the family: chitobiases, chitinases/chitolectins, and stabilin- <dig> interacting chitolectins.
