an integrative approach using transcriptomics, quantitative real-time pcr, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemistry shows that gltx is highly expressed exclusively in four pharyngeal lobes, a previously unrecognized part of the venom apparatus.
we present the first molecular characterization of glycerotoxin , a potent neurotoxin found in the venom of the bloodworm glycera tridactyla .
our results overturn a century old textbook view on the glycerid venom system, suggesting that it is anatomically and functionally much more complex than previously thought.
within the animal kingdom, gltx shows a unique mode of action as it can specifically up-regulate the activity of cav <dig>  channels  in a reversible manner.
the lack of sequence information has so far hampered a detailed understanding of its mode of action.
the herein presented gltx sequence information constitutes an important step towards the establishment of gltx as a versatile tool to understand the mechanism of synaptic function, as well as the mode of action of this novel neurotoxin.
