because of long reads and lack of bias in coverage of at-rich regions, pacbio rs ii showed a great promise for highly accurate ‘finished’ genomes, especially for a de novo assembly of genomes.
using the smrt sequencing to investigate the chloroplast genome of n. nucifera will help to elucidate the plastid evolution of basal eudicots.
the sizes of the de novo assembled complete chloroplast genome of n. nucifera were  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp with average depths of coverage of 7×, 712× and 105× sequenced by sanger, illumina miseq and pacbio rs ii, respectively.
the precise chloroplast genome of n. nucifera was obtained from pacbio rs ii data proofread by illumina miseq reads, with a quadripartite structure containing a large single copy region  and a small single copy region  separated by two inverted repeat regions .
n. nucifera is one member of basal eudicots, however, evolutionary analyses of ir structural variations of n. nucifera and other basal eudicots suggested that ir expansions/contractions occurred independently in these basal eudicots or were caused by independent insertions and deletions.
the precise chloroplast genome of n. nucifera will present new information for structural variation of chloroplast genomes and provide new insight into the evolution of basal eudicots at the primary sequence and structural level.

the genome contains  <dig> different genes, including four distinct rrnas,  <dig> distinct trnas and  <dig> distinct peptide-coding genes.
recently, a new sequencing platform pacbio rs ii, known as ‘smrt  sequencing’, has been developed.
the chloroplast genome is important for plant development and plant evolution.
a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> taxa from  <dig> orders indicated that nelumbo with an age of  <dig> million years is a sister clade to platanus, which belongs to the basal eudicots.
ir expansions/contractions within the basal eudicots seem to have occurred independently.
basal eudicots began to emerge during the early jurassic with estimated divergence times at  <dig> million years using mcmctree.
