pseudomonas fuscovaginae  is an emerging plant pathogen of rice and also of other gramineae plants.
an in planta screen of  <dig> random independent tn <dig> genomic mutants resulted in the isolation of nine mutants which showed altered virulence.
the roles of the nine loci identified in the in planta screen are discussed in relation to pathogenicity of pfv.
in summary, this article reports a first study on the virulence of this pathogen involving in planta screening studies and suggests the presence of several virulence features with known and novel functions in the pseudomonas group of bacteria.
pfv is a broad host range pathogen and very little is known about its virulence mechanisms.
being an emerging pathogen worldwide, the broad host range pathogen pfv has not yet been studied for its virulence functions.
