molecular characterization provided an understanding of the molecular–function relationships for the salt tolerance and high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase.
hj <dig> harboured in the saline soil of an abandoned salt mine and was expressed in escherichia coli.
most metal ions and chemical reagents at final concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm or  <dig>  and  <dig> %  had little or no effect  on the enzyme activity.
enzymatic degradation of chitin has attracted substantial attention because chitin is an abundant renewable natural resource, second only to lignocellulose, and because of the promising applications of n-acetylglucosamine in the bioethanol, food and pharmaceutical industries.
these characteristics suggest that the enzyme has versatile potential in biotechnological applications, such as bioconversion of chitin waste and the processing of marine materials and saline foods.
the purified recombinant enzyme showed specific activities of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards p-nitrophenyl β-n-acetylglucosaminide and n,n'-diacetyl chitobiose, respectively, a v
biochemical characterization revealed that the glcnacase had novel salt–glcnac tolerance and high activity.
furthermore, the enzyme had higher proportions of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, glycine, random coils and negatively charged surfaces but lower proportions of cysteine, lysine, α-helices and positively charged surfaces than its homologs.
these molecular characteristics were hypothesised as potential factors in the adaptation for salt tolerance and high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase.
