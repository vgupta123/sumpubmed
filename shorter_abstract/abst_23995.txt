protein-protein interaction networks are key to a systems-level understanding of cellular biology.
however, interaction data can contain a considerable fraction of false positives.
moreover, it corroborates experimental evidence of physical interactions.
most of them require the integration of additional data like protein expression and interaction homology information.
while being certainly useful, such additional data are not always available and may introduce additional bias and ambiguity.
several methods have been proposed to assess the confidence of individual interactions.
it exploits the networkâ€™s inherent modular architecture for assessing the confidence of individual interactions.
our method is not limited to physical interactome maps as we exemplify with a large yeast genetic interaction network.
our method determines algorithmic parameters intrinsically and does not require any parameter input or reference sets for confidence scoring.
on the basis of five yeast and two human physical interactome maps inferred using different techniques, we show that cappic reliably assesses interaction confidence and its performance compares well to other approaches that are also based on network topology.
we propose a novel, network topology based interaction confidence assessment method called cappic .
