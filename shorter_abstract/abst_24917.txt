using immunoprecipitated  dna fragments recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation  with anti-rin antibody from ripening tomato fruit, we analyzed potential binding sites for rin  in the promoters of representative ripening-induced genes by quantitative pcr.
results revealed nearly a 5- to 20-fold enrichment of carg boxes in the promoters of leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  pg, tbg <dig>  leexp <dig>  and leman <dig> and of rin itself, indicating direct interaction of rin with their promoters in vivo.
quantitative pcr revealed that four of the potential binding sites were enriched 4- to 17-fold in the iped dna pools compared with the controls, indicating direct interaction of rin with these sites in vivo.
during ripening, climacteric fruits increase their ethylene level and subsequently undergo various physiological changes, such as softening, pigmentation and development of aroma and flavor.
near one of the four carg boxes we found a gene encoding a protein similar to thioredoxin y <dig>  an increase in the transcript level of this gene was observed with ripening in normal fruit but not in the rin mutant, suggesting that rin possibly induces its expression.
the presented results suggest that rin controls fruit softening and ethylene production by the direct transcriptional regulation of cell-wall-modifying genes and ethylene biosynthesis genes during ripening.
moreover, sequence analysis and genome mapping of  <dig> cloned iped dnas revealed potential rin binding sites.
these changes occur simultaneously and are caused by the highly synchronized expression of numerous genes at the onset of ripening.
these findings clarify the crucial role of rin in the transcriptional regulation of ripening initiation and progression.
