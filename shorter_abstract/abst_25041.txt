the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence and identify gastrointestinal helminths in feral carnivores in guangxi province.
major zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths, including liver and intestinal flukes, toxocara spp., and ancylostoma spp., are present in feral dogs and cats in guangxi, and may represent a significant risk for public health.
in guangxi, a province of southern china, an important number of dogs and cats roam freely in rural settings, and the presence of these animals in proximity of people may represent a risk of parasitic zoonoses.
the gastrointestinal helminths were found in all the necropsied dogs and in  <dig> out of  <dig> cats.
most of them may be responsible for zoonotic infections.
