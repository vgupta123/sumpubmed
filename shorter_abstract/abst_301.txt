reproductive output is critical to both agronomists seeking to increase seed yield and to evolutionary biologists interested in understanding natural selection.
we examine the genetic architecture of diverse reproductive fitness traits in recombinant inbred lines  developed from a crop  × wild-like  genotype of brassica rapa in field and greenhouse environments.
this study characterizes the genetic structure of important fitness/yield traits within and between generations in b. rapa.
several fitness traits showed strong correlations and qtl-colocalization across environments .
total fruit number was uncorrelated across environments and most qtl affecting this trait were correspondingly environment-specific.
