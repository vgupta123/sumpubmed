sharing sets of chemical data  among collaborators with diverse skill sets is a common task in computer-aided drug design and medicinal chemistry.
there is a need for a simple, free, open-source program that can automatically export aggregated reports of entire chemical data sets to files viewable on any computer, regardless of the operating system and without requiring the installation of additional software.
with these features, webchem viewer enables interdisciplinary collaborations that require the sharing and visualization of small molecule structures and associated sets of heterogeneous chemical data.
the ability to associate this data with images of the relevant molecular structures greatly facilitates scientific communication.
furthermore, in designing webchem viewer we have also created a useful online web application for remotely generating molecular structures from smiles strings.
we here present a program called webchem viewer that automatically generates these types of highly portable reports.
we encourage the direct use of this online application as well as its incorporation into other software packages.
the associated web application  can be accessed through freely available web services provided by the national biomedical computation resource at http://nbcr.ucsd.edu.
the program is released under the freebsd license and can be downloaded from http://nbcr.ucsd.edu/webchemviewer.
