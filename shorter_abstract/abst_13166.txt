this study reports the results of the analysis and integrates them with new and existing experimental data.
for bacteria, these results demonstrate that much can be learnt from comparative genomics, even for well-explored primary metabolic pathways.
folate synthesis and salvage pathways are relatively well known from classical biochemistry and genetics but they have not been subjected to comparative genomic analysis.
the availability of genome sequences from hundreds of diverse bacteria, and from arabidopsis thaliana, enabled such an analysis using the seed database and its tools.
for plants and bacteria, the predictions comprised the identities of a 'missing' folate synthesis gene  and of a folate transporter, and the absence from plants of a folate salvage enzyme.
based on sequence similarity and the clustering, fusion, and phylogenetic distribution of genes, several functional predictions emerged from this analysis.
