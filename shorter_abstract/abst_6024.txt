cell wall analyses indicated changes in yield and composition of pectin, and a higher molecular weight distribution of cdta-soluble pectin.
pg1-suppressed ‘royal gala’ apples harvested from multiple seasons were firmer than controls after ripening, and intercellular adhesion was higher.
this change in morphology appears to be linked with reduced transpirational water loss in the fruit.
in apple pg <dig> also appears to influence other fruit texture characters such as juiciness and water loss.
structural analyses revealed more ruptured cells and free juice in pulled apart sections, suggesting improved integrity of intercellular connections and consequent cell rupture due to failure of the primary cell walls under stress.
this study examined the effect of down regulation of pg <dig> expression in ‘royal gala’ apples, a cultivar that typically has high levels of pg <dig>  and softens during fruit ripening.
these findings confirm pg1’s role in apple fruit softening and suggests that this is achieved in part by reducing cellular adhesion.
