we apply a regression hidden markov model  to further investigate the potential multiple relationships between genes and histone methylation levels in mouse embryonic stem cells.
in addition, the housekeeping gene expression levels are significantly less explained by histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells, which is consistent with the constitutive expression patterns that would be expected.
based on reghmm results, genes segregated into two groups, referred to as state  <dig> and state  <dig>  have distinct association strengths.
we found specific go categories that may be attributed to the different relationships.
gene expression levels are not universally affected by histone methylation levels, and the relationships between the two differ by the gene functions.
studies have shown the strong association between histone modification levels and gene expression levels.
we suspect that additional biological factors may also be strongly associated with the gene expression levels in state  <dig>  we discover that the effect of the presence of cpg island in tss ±  <dig> kb is larger in state  <dig>
seven histone methylation levels are used in the study.
genes in state  <dig> are better explained by histone methylation levels with r2=.
the expression levels of the genes that perform the most common housekeeping genes’ go categories are less strongly associated with histone methylation levels.
averaged histone modifications over non-overlapping  <dig> bp windows on the range transcription starting site  ±  <dig> kb are used as predictors, and in total  <dig> explanatory variables are generated.
<dig>  the regression coefficients in the two states are not very different in magnitude except in the intercept,.
<dig> while those in state  <dig> have weaker association strength with r2=.
