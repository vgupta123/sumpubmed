built-in tools are provided to prioritize candidate genes and create modules of specific phenotypes.
we describe a new open-source cytoscape plugin named ictnet .
the online database and cytoscape plugin are freely available for academic use at: http://www.cs.queensu.ca/ictnet
ictnet provides a user-friendly interface to search, integrate, visualize, and analyze genome-scale biological networks for human complex traits.
ictnet integrates several data sources to allow automated and systematic creation of networks with up to five layers of omics information: phenotype-snp association, protein-protein interaction, disease-tissue, tissue-gene, and drug-gene relationships.
