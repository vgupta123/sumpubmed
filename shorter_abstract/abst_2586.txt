while many classical meta-analysis methods are developed with the former goal in mind, the latter goal has much more practicality for genomic data analysis.
in this paper, we propose a class of meta-analysis methods based on summaries of weighted ordered p-values  that aim at detecting significance in a majority of studies.
meta-analysis has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially in genomic data analysis, due to the fast growth of available data and studies that target the same questions.

in particular, we consider weights based on the binomial distribution, where the median of the p-values are weighted highest and the outlying p-values are down-weighted.
some aim at combining information to find signals in at least one of the studies, while others hope to find more consistent signals across the studies.
