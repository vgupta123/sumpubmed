comparative analysis of e. falciformis with toxoplasma gondii shows an emergence and diversification of gene families associated with motility and invasion mainly at the level of the coccidia.
e. falciformis possesses a reduced set of transmembrane transporters and we suggest an altered mode of iron uptake in the genus eimeria.
we report a complete genome sequence of the mouse parasite eimeria falciformis.
the genome of e. falciformis is 44Â mb in size and contains  <dig>  predicted protein coding genes.
many rhoptry kinases, among them important virulence factors in t. gondii, are absent from the e. falciformis genome.
the e. falciformis genome sequence sheds light on the evolution of the coccidia and helps to identify determinants of host-parasite interaction critical for drug and vaccine development.
comparisons with t. gondii showed differences between genes involved in metabolism, n-glycan and gpi-anchor synthesis.
surface antigens are divergent between eimeria species.
we assembled and annotated the genome sequence to study host-parasite interactions in this understudied genus in a model organism host.
eimeria is the largest and most diverse genus of apicomplexan parasites and some species of the genus are the causative agent of coccidiosis, a disease economically devastating in poultry.
reduced diversity of genes required for host-parasite interaction and transmembrane transport allow hypotheses on host adaptation and specialization of a single host parasite.
