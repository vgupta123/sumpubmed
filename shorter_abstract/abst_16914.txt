thirty-nine b. anthracis and ten y. pestis strains, representative of the species genetic diversity, were genotyped by agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer using previously described multiple locus vntr analysis assays .
anthrax and plague are diseases caused by bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis respectively.
results were compared to previous data obtained by standard genotyping system  and, when necessary, direct amplicon sequencing.
this platform is a candidate for on-site mlva genotyping of biothreat agents as well as other bacterial pathogens.
in this report an automated dna electrophoresis apparatus which provides a cheaper alternative compared to capillary electrophoresis approaches was applied for genotyping of b. anthracis and y. pestis.
