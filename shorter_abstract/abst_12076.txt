lipoxygenases , a type of non-haem iron-containing dioxygenase, are ubiquitous enzymes in plants and participate in the formation of fruit aroma which is a very important aspect of fruit quality.
by using structure analysis, phylogenic analysis and collinearity analysis, we identified variation in gene structure and revealed the phylogenetic evolutionary relationship of this gene family.
specific gene duplication was found on chromosome <dig> in the pear genome.
although some studies have been conducted on the lox gene family in several species including arabidopsis, soybean, cucumber and apple, there is no information from pear; and the evolutionary history of this gene family in the rosaceae is still not resolved.

expression of certain pear lox genes during fruit development was verified by analysis of transcriptome data.
useful information was provided for future research on the evolutionary history and transgenic research on lox genes.
these compounds are formed from unsaturated fatty acids through oxidation, pyrolysis and reduction steps.
<dig> lox genes were identified in pear and these genes were found to have undergone a duplication 30– <dig> mya; most of these  <dig> genes are functional.
