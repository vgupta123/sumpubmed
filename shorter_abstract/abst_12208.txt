moreover, dsp <dig> interacts with the hox gene scr, the dsp <dig> protein is present on a scr me in s <dig> cells but not in embryos.
in order to search for a common target, we performed a genetic interaction analysis.
our results reveal that the proteins corto and dsp <dig> are differently recruited to a scr me depending on whether the me is active, as seen in s <dig> cells, or inactive, as in most embryonic cells.
the presence of a given combination of etps on an me would control the recruitment of either pcg or trxg complexes, propagating the silenced or active state.
we show that corto and dsp <dig> proteins co-localize at  <dig> sites on polytene chromosomes and co-immunoprecipitate in embryos.
our previous work has shown that corto, which codes for a chromodomain protein, and dsp <dig>  which codes for an hmgb protein, belong to a class of genes called the enhancers of trithorax and polycomb  that interact with both pcg and trxg.
