analysis of genes known to be involved in kidney development, particularly during mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, showed an enrichment of non-coding antisense transcripts extended along protein-coding rnas.

these studies, however, fall short of capturing the transcriptional complexity arising from each locus due to the limited scope of microarray-based technology, which is largely based on "gene-centric" models.
the transcriptional complexity of rnas arising from mouse refseq loci was catalogued; including  <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts and  <dig> uncharacterized alternate 3' utrs.
the added resolution of rna-seq has provided the basis for a transition from classical gene-centric models of kidney development towards more accurate and detailed "transcript-centric" representations, which highlights the extent of transcriptional complexity of genes that direct complex development events.
the developing mouse kidney is currently the best-characterized model of organogenesis at a transcriptional level.
to address this, the polyadenylated rna and microrna transcriptomes of the  <dig>  dpc mouse kidney were profiled using strand-specific rna-sequencing  to a depth sufficient to complement spatial maps from pre-existing microarray datasets.
the resulting resource further refines the transcriptomic cartography of kidney organogenesis by integrating deep rna sequencing data with locus-based information from previously published expression atlases.
detailed spatial maps have been generated for gene expression profiling combined with systematic in situ screening.
