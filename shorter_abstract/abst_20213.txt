although both the asian and african strains of the pathogen, xanthomonas oryzae pv.
differentially expressed genes were related to metabolism, secretion and transport, pathogen adherence to plant tissues, plant cell-wall degradation, is elements, and virulence.
it also confirms that african xoo strains do differ from their asian counterparts, even at the transcriptional level.
quantitative real-time pcr confirmed 86% of the identified profile on a set of  <dig> genes selected according to the microarray analysis.
this is the first report to compare the expression of xoo genes in planta across different time points during infection.
microarray hybridization was performed comparing bacteria recovered from plant tissues at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after inoculation  with bacteria grown in vitro.
changes in gene expression of the african xoo strain mai <dig> in the susceptible rice cultivar nipponbare were profiled, using an ssh xoo dna microarray.
oryzae , induce similar symptoms, they are nevertheless genetically different, with the african strains being more closely related to the asian x. oryzae pv.
in addition, various other genes encoding proteins with unknown function or showing no similarity to other proteins were also induced.
this work shows that as-yet-unidentified and potentially new virulence factors are appearing in an emerging african pathogen.
