using a novel protein-dna pull-down assay, we show that smar <dig> binding is very specific to gad <dig> promoter but not to the other isoform, gad <dig>  we show that streptozotocin  mediated dna damage leads to upregulation of smar <dig> and p <dig> expression, resulting in elevated levels of gad <dig>  in both cell lines as well as mouse Î²-islets.
smar <dig> and p <dig> act synergistically to up-regulate gad <dig> expression upon stz treatment.
we propose a novel mechanism of gad <dig> regulation by synergistic activities of smar <dig> and p <dig>
