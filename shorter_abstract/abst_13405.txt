a recent study of lateral septum  suggested a large number of autism-related genes with altered expression in the postpartum state.

genes involved in these deficits may also contribute to elevated sociability in the maternal brain.
to date, this is the first study to show a significant, quantitative link between the maternal brain and mental health disorders using large scale gene expression data.
as a simple alternative, we have developed the modular single-set enrichment test , a minimal tool that enables one to easily evaluate expression data for enrichment of any conceivable gene list of interest.
additionally, maternal ls displayed enrichment for genes associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, adhd, and depression.
some individuals with autism, schizophrenia, or other mental health disorders exhibit impaired social traits.
the mset approach was validated by testing several publicly available expression data sets for expected enrichment in areas of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and arthritis.
a network of  <dig> autism-related genes was identified, representing developmental processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal morphogenesis, and differentiation.
using nine independent, unique autism gene lists extracted from association databases and two recent publications, a striking consensus of enrichment was detected within gene expression changes in ls of postpartum mice.
many gene-disease association databases have been curated which are not currently incorporated in popular, full-featured enrichment tools, and the use of custom gene lists in these programs can be difficult to perform and interpret.
