the results suggest that beclin- <dig> plays an important role in tumor progression of malignant cmts.
cytoplasmic beclin- <dig> expression was significantly weaker in cancer cells than in nearby normal mammary glands .
multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that beclin- <dig> cytoplasmic expression is an independent prognostic factor .
low cytoplasmic expression  was associated with older age, lower degree of tubular formation, increased mitotic activity, higher histologic grade, and extensive necrosis.
univariate survival analysis showed that beclin- <dig> cytoplasmic expression was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival rate .
loss of beclin- <dig> is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and poor overall survival.
low nuclear expression  was connected with older age, lower degree of tubular formation, extensive necrosis, and negative for her2/neu overexpression.
we examined beclin- <dig> expression in  <dig> cases of malignant cmts by immunohistochemistry.
