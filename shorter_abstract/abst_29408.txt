usmb induced the release of 19% and 67% of gfp from the cytoplasm in viable and non-viable cells, respectively.
tfn release from early/recycling endosomes increased by 23% in viable cells upon usmb treatment.
in addition, the mfi of lamp- <dig> antibody increased by 50% in viable cells, suggesting usmb-stimulated lysosome exocytosis.
in non-viable cells, labeling of lamp- <dig> intracellular structures in the absence of cell permeabilization by detergents suggests that usmb-induced cell death correlates with lysosomal permeabilization.
the underlying mechanism associated with usmb-enhanced intracellular uptake such as membrane disruption and endocytosis may also be associated with usmb-induced release of cellular materials to the extracellular milieu.
ultrasound and microbubbles  have been shown to enhance the intracellular uptake of molecules, generally thought to occur as a result of sonoporation.
