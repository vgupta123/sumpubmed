the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig> revealed a complex balance of rapid nucleoplasmic shuttling but low nucleolar mobility, suggesting nol <dig> may play functional roles in both compartments.
further, this work characterizes the relative contribution of each sequence to nol <dig> nuclear and nucleolar dynamics, the subnuclear constituents that participate in this targeting, and suggests a functional role for nol <dig> in both compartments.
these results identify the minimal sequences required for the active targeting of nol <dig> to the nucleus and nucleolus.
taken together, these results identify the requisite protein domains for nol <dig> localization, the kinetics that drive this targeting, and suggest nol <dig> may function in both the nucleus and nucleolus.
an in vitro import assay demonstrated that nol <dig> requires cytosolic machinery for active nuclear transport.
using sequence homology and prediction algorithms, four putative nuclear localization signals  were identified.
in addition, four basic clusters within nls <dig> and nls <dig> were independently capable of nucleolar targeting.
reintroduction of nol <dig> into cells resulted in significant suppression of in vivo tumor growth and modulation of the angiogenic phenotype.
however, the mechanisms regulating its subcellular localization have not been elucidated.
