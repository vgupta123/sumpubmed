multichipmixhmm is a user-friendly r package to analyse chip-chip data modeling spatial dependencies between directly adjacent probes on a chromosome and enabling a simultaneous analysis of replicates.
this identification can be improved by accounting for dependencies between adjacent probes on chromosomes and by modeling of biological replicates.
it is based on a linear regression mixture model, designed to perform a joint modeling of immunoprecipitated and input measurements.
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to a tiling array  is a cost-effective and routinely used method to identify protein-dna interactions or chromatin/histone modifications.
we show the utility of multichipmixhmm by analyzing histone modifications of arabidopsis thaliana.
