guide-trees are used as part of an essential heuristic to enable the calculation of multiple sequence alignments.
we explore all possible guide-trees for a set of protein alignments of up to eight sequences.
alignment methods that use consistency or hidden markov models to make alignments are less susceptible to sub-optimal guide-trees than simpler methods, that basically use conventional sequence alignment between profiles.
some guide-tree construction schemes are based on pair-wise distances amongst unaligned sequences.
we find that pairwise distance based default guide-trees sometimes outperform evolutionary guide-trees, as measured by structure derived reference alignments.
however, default guide-trees fall way short of the optimum attainable scores.
on average chained guide-trees perform better than balanced ones but are not better than default guide-trees for small alignments.
the results for randomly chained guide-trees improve with the number of sequences.
one phylogeny aware alignment program can strongly discriminate between good and bad guide-trees.
others try to emulate an underlying evolutionary tree and involve various iteration methods.
the latter appear to be affected positively by evolutionary based guide-trees for difficult alignments and negatively for easy alignments.
