the timing of grape ripening initiation, length of maturation period, berry size and seed content are target traits in viticulture.
berry size determines grape productivity; seedlessness is especially demanded in the table grape market and is negatively correlated to fruit size.
segregating traits were evaluated in three growing seasons by recording flowering, veraison and ripening dates and by measuring berry size, seed number and weight.
our results revealed novel insights into the genetic control of relevant grapevine features.
eighteen pairs of homologous groups were integrated into a consensus map spanning over  <dig> cm with  <dig> markers  and an average map distance between loci of  <dig>  cm.
they provide a basis for performing marker-assisted selection and testing the role of specific genes in trait variation.
in order to elucidate their genetic determinism we carried out a quantitative analysis in a  <dig> individuals-f <dig> segregating progeny obtained by crossing two table grape cultivars.
