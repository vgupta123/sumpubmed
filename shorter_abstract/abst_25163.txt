to gain better insight in the molecular mechanisms in the development of ragweed pollen and its allergenic proteins under global change scenarios, we generated supersage libraries to identify differentially expressed transcripts.
in addition, ests encoding allergenic proteins in other plants were also identified.
total rna was isolated from ragweed pollen, exposed to the four mentioned scenarios and four supersage libraries were constructed.
increased levels of individual flavonoid metabolites were found under elevated co <dig> and/or drought.
pollen of common ragweed  is a main cause of allergic diseases in northern america.
the pollen viability was not altered under elevated co <dig>  whereas drought stress decreased its viability.
the analysis of changes in the transcriptome of ragweed pollen upon co <dig> and drought stress using supersage indicates that under global change scenarios the pollen transcriptome was altered, and impacts the allergenic potential of ragweed pollen.
among the identified ests, those encoding allergenic ragweed proteins  increased under elevated co <dig> and drought stress.
the library dataset included  <dig>  unique sequences, showing overlapping as well as clear differently expressed sequence tags .
the weed has recently become spreading as a neophyte in europe, while climate change may also affect the growth of the plant and additionally may also influence pollen allergenicity.
