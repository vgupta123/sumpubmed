using the proposed approach, we inferred  <dig> drug pairs that are likely to not interact with each other; these drug pairs are used as representative data for the negative class in binary classification for ddi prediction.
we obtained  <dig> ddis from drugbank database.
further, we provide a case study on three predicted cyp-dependent ddis to evaluate the clinical relevance of this study.
our proposed approach showed an absolute improvement in f1-score of  <dig> and 38% in comparison to the method that randomly selects unlabeled data points as likely negatives, depending on the choice of similarity function.
the proposed method consists of three steps: i) application of growing self organizing maps to infer negatives from the unlabeled dataset; ii) using a pairwise similarity function to quantify the overlap between individual features of drugs and iii) using support vector machine classifier for inferring ddis.
investigating and understanding drug-drug interactions  is important in improving the effectiveness of clinical care.
our discoveries can be used to improve clinical care as well as the research outcomes of drug development.
hence, there is a great interest in developing efficient and useful computational methods for inferring potential ddis.
to address this lack of negatives, we introduce a positive-unlabeled learning method for inferring potential ddis.
we inferred  <dig> possible cyp-dependent ddis and  <dig> cyp-independent ddis with the highest posterior probabilities.
in a ddi context, drug pairs that are known to interact can serve as positives for predictive methods.
but, the negatives or drug pairs that have been confirmed to have no interaction are scarce.
moreover, we classify the predicted ddis as cytochrome p <dig>  enzyme-dependent and cyp-independent interactions invoking their locations on the growing self organizing map, due to the particular importance of these enzymes in clinically significant interaction effects.
