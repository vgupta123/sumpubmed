complexity is a key problem when visualizing biological networks; as the number of entities increases, most graphical views become incomprehensible.
data on a layer can be clustered via k-means, affinity propagation, markov clustering, neighbor joining, tree clustering, or upgma .
a simple input format defines the name and url for each node, and defines connections or similarity scores between pairs of nodes.
related data – such as proteins, chemicals, or pathways – can be grouped onto separate layers and arranged via layout algorithms, such as fruchterman-reingold, distance geometry, and a novel hierarchical layout.
we present a new visualization tool, arena3d, which introduces a new concept of staggered layers in 3d space.
arena3d is a user friendly visualization tool that is able to visualize biological or any other network in 3d space.
