this is a significant finding, given that deformed wing virus has earlier been shown to be a contributory factor to winter mortality and colony collapse disorder.
we documented for the first time vertical transmission of some viruses, as well as significant differences between two honey bee races in being affected by deformed wing virus.
the most abundant viruses were deformed wing virus and sacbrood virus , although lake sinai virus and acute bee paralysis virus were also occasionally detected .
remarkably, we found apis mellifera carnica bees to be less infected with deformed wing virus than buckfast bees , and also found them to have a lower average total number of infecting viruses .
overall, the success ratio of this queen breeding programme has been only around 50%.
the member states of european union are encouraged to improve the general conditions for the production and marketing of apicultural products.
moreover, negative-strand detection of sacbrood virus in eggs was demonstrated for the first time.

we found a high quantity of viruses, with more than 75% of the egg samples being infected with at least one virus.
