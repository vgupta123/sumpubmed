in the mouse olfactory system, the role of the olfactory bulb in guiding olfactory sensory neuron  axons to their targets is poorly understood.
we demonstrate that the nascent external plexiform and glomerular layers of the bulb can be divided into multiple domains based on the expression of these genes, several of which are known to function in axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and angiogenesis.
the expression patterns of these genes divide the bulb into previously unrecognized subdomains.
although projection neurons are not required, other cell-types within the external plexiform and glomerular layers also form synapses with osns.
we hypothesized that these cells are important for targeting, and express spatially differentially expressed guidance cues that act to guide osn axons within the bulb.
these genes represent candidate guidance cues that may act to guide osn axons within the bulb during targeting.
interestingly, some genes are expressed in both the medial and lateral bulb, showing for the first time the existence of symmetric expression along this axis.
we used laser microdissection and microarray analysis to find genes that are differentially expressed along the dorsal-ventral, medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior axes of the bulb.
