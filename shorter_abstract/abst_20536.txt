investigating pairs of scoring functions, the set theoretic measures identify known scoring strategies as well as a number of novel approaches, indicating promising augmentations of traditional scoring methods.
three set theoretic approaches are used to identify pairs of scoring functions capable of correctly scoring different complexes.
this shows that functions in different clusters capture different aspects of binding and are likely to work together synergistically.
