the purified recombinant proteins bound to the n. caninum-specific antibodies in serum samples from infected cattle as revealed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
by co-immobilizing these recombinant proteins, a novel indirect elisa was developed for detection of neosporosis.
a diagnostic method employing recombinant proteins of n. caninum was developed.
recombinant surface associated antigen  <dig> , ncsag <dig> related sequence  <dig>  and the dense granule antigen  <dig>  of n. caninum were expressed either in silkworm or in escherichia coli and purified.
with the use of  <dig> serum samples, comprising  <dig> positive serum samples and  <dig> negative serum samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were found to be  <dig>  and 100%, respectively.
seventy-two serum samples from dairy farms were also tested and one was diagnosed with neosporasis with both this method and a commercial assay.
diagnostic test with field serum samples suggested its applicability to the practical diagnosis of neosporosis.
neosporosis appears to be a major cause of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide and causes to huge economic loss to dairy industry.
neosporosis is an infectious disease primarily of cattle and dogs, caused by intracellular parasite, neospora caninum.
the method showed high sensitivity and specificity.
