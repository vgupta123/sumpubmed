we also further confirmed the involvement of horizontally transferred carotenoid synthesis genes in diapause and different color morphs of t. urticae.
diapause or developmental arrest, is one of the major adaptations that allows mites and insects to survive unfavorable conditions.
the spider mite tetranychus urticae is a serious polyphagous pest that exhibits a reproductive facultative diapause, which allows it to survive winter conditions.
furthermore, we identified and analyzed an unique class of putative antifreeze proteins that were highly upregulated in diapausing females.
gene ontology analysis revealed that many metabolic pathways were affected in diapausing females.
diapause evokes a number of physiological, morphological and molecular modifications.
analysis of this dataset showed that a remarkable number, 11% of the total number of predicted t. urticae genes, were differentially expressed.
genes related to digestion and detoxification, cryoprotection, carotenoid synthesis and the organization of the cytoskeleton were profoundly influenced by the state of diapause.
at the molecular level, diapause is less studied but characterized by a complex and regulated change in gene-expression.
