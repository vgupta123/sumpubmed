we constructed a platform with a flexible structure allowing the exchange of various elements, such as promoters, fusion tags, intergenic regions or resistance markers.
we obtained plasmid vectors carrying genes for fluorescent proteins , and sequences for the c-myc epitope, and tandem affinity purification or polyhistidine tags.
for the tandem affinity purification tag, the purification of two protein complexes  was performed.
thus, we aimed to construct a highly efficient cloning platform compatible with plasmid vectors that are suitable for various approaches.
the three trypanosomatids pathogenic to men, trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosoma brucei and leishmania major, are etiological agents of chagas disease, african sleeping sickness and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively.
the vectors were verified by successful subcellular localization of two previously characterized proteins  and a putative centrin.
this platform is based on gatewayÂ® technology, to ensure a fast and efficient cloning system.
