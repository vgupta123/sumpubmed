with the rapid development of high-throughput experiments, detecting functional modules has become increasingly important in analyzing biological networks.
we propose a novel graph theoretic decomposition scheme combined with dynamics consideration for probing the architecture of complex biological networks.
our approach allows us to identify two structurally important components: the "minimal production unit" which responds quickly and robustly to external signals, and the feedback controllers which adjust the output of the mpu to desired values usually at a larger time scale.
the proposed scheme may be potentially applied to various large-scale cell regulation networks to identify functional modules that play essential roles and thus provide handles for analyzing and understanding cell activity from basic biochemical processes.
