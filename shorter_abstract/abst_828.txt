dectin-2-dependent il- <dig> production may contribute to ifn-Î³ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide igg after s. pneumoniae infection, which may promote s. pneumoniae bacterial opsonization for engulfment.
host defense against this bacterium is mediated by activation of innate immune cells that sense bacterial components.
we demonstrated that dectin- <dig> is intimately involved in the host defense against infection with a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae.
s. pneumonia-infected dectin-2ko mice had a shorter survival time, larger bacterial burden and lower interferon gamma  production in the lungs than wt mice.
in the present study, we first compared the clinical course and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of dectin- <dig> knock-out  and wild type  mice.
streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative bacterial pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule.
when bm-dcs were stimulated with s. pneumoniae culture supernatant or its concanavalin a -bound fraction, il- <dig> production was abrogated in dectin-2ko mice compared to wt mice.
although neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs was equivalent between dectin-2ko mice and wt mice, s. pneumonia engulfment by neutrophils was attenuated in dectin-2ko mice compared to wt mice.
the anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific igg and igg <dig> levels in balf were lower in dectin-2ko mice than in wt mice.
mice were infected intratracheally with a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae, and s. pneumoniae bacterial engulfment by neutrophils and inflammatory cytokine and anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific igg levels were evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid .
we also examined the effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on interleukin - <dig> production by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  stimulated with the bacterial components.
