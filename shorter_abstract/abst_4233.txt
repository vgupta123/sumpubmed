we then analyzed mirna activity changes related to the ras-pathway and found  <dig> mirnas that switch from silenced to activated status in parallel with ras activation.
these results suggest an association between ras signaling and mirna processing in which mirnas may attenuate their own biogenesis.
in this study we integrate multiple gene expression datasets to determine mirna activity patterns associated with cancer phenotypes and oncogenic pathways in mesenchymal tumors â€“ a very heterogeneous class of malignancies.
we also showed that mirna activity is imperfectly correlated with mirna expression levels.
our study represents the first gene expression-based investigation of mirna regulatory activity in human sarcomas, and our findings indicate that mirna activity patterns derived from integrated transcriptomic data are reproducible and biologically informative in cancer.
we identified an association between ras signaling and mirna processing, and demonstrated sequence alterations as plausible causes for differential mirna activity.
importantly, nearly half of these  <dig> mirnas were predicted to regulate integral parts of the mirna processing machinery, and our gene expression analysis revealed significant reductions of these transcripts in ras-active tumors.
mirna expression levels have been used in profiling studies, but some evidence suggests that expression levels do not fully capture mirna regulatory activity.
using a computational method, we identified differentially activated mirnas between  <dig> normal tissue specimens and  <dig> sarcomas and we validated many of these findings with microarray interrogation of an independent, paraffin-based cohort of  <dig> tumors.
using next-generation mirna sequencing we identified potential base sequence alterations which may explain differential activity.
