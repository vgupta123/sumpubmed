however, in urban districts there are a lower proportion of households owning pet dogs than in rural districts.
results are presented using chloropleth maps.
this paper describes the spatial distribution of pet dog and pet cat owning households on the island of ireland.
in  <dig>  there were an estimated  <dig>  pet dog owning households and  <dig>  pet cat owning households in ireland.
these estimates are derived from logistic regression modelling, based on household composition to determine pet dog ownership and the type of house to determine pet cat ownership.
spatial representation allows us to visualise the impact of human household distribution on the density of both pet dogs and pet cats on the island of ireland.
there is considerable international research regarding the link between human demographics and pet ownership.
in several international studies, pet ownership was associated with household demographics including: the presence of children in the household, urban/rural location, level of education and age/family structure.
there are more households with cats in the urban areas, but the proportion of households with cats is greater in rural areas.
this information can be used when analysing risk of disease spread, for market research and for instigating veterinary care.
there is a higher density of pet dog owning households in the east of ireland and in the cities than the west of ireland and rural areas.
the difference in spatial distribution of dog ownership is a reflection of a generally higher density of households in the east of ireland and in major cities.
