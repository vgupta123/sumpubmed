to potentially assess this conundrum, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the brain of wild-type mice with that of transgenic mice invalidated at this locus either at the zygotic or at the adult stages.
when performed at the adult stage, neuronal prnp disruption appeared to sequentially induce a response to an oxidative stress and a remodeling of the nervous system.
these results suggest that the physiological function of prp is redundant at the adult stage or important for only a small subset of the brain cell population under classical breeding conditions.
only subtle transcriptomic differences resulting from the prnp knockout could be evidenced, beside prnp itself, in the analyzed adult brains following microarray analysis of  <dig>  <dig> mouse genes and qpcr assessment of some of the putatively marginally modulated loci.
the physiological function of the prion protein remains largely elusive while its key role in prion infection has been expansively documented.
