using simulated data, we demonstrate reasonable accuracy of local ancestry inference by rfmix, with a tendency towards miss-calling san ancestry as bantu.
regions with either excess san ancestry or excess african  ancestry are less likely to be affected by this bias, and we therefore proceeded to identify such regions, found in cases but not in controls .
the admixed south african coloured population is ideally suited to the discovery of tuberculosis susceptibility genetic variants and their probable ethnic origins, but previous attempts at finding such variants using genome-wide admixture mapping were hampered by the inaccuracy of local ancestry inference.

in this study, we infer local ancestry using the novel algorithm implemented in rfmix, with the emphasis on identifying regions of excess san or bantu ancestry, which we hypothesize may harbour tb susceptibility genes.
promising immune-related susceptibility genes such as the gadd45a, osm and b7-h <dig> genes are also harboured in the identified regions.
