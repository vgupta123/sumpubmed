by -pk <dig> autoradiography of coronal hypothalamic-hippocampal sections, an increased tspo signal was detected in the dentate gyrus  and choroids plexus of ob/ob mice, without appreciable changes in the cortex or hypothalamic-thalamic regions.
binding studies were thus carried out in brain or peripheral tissues, blood platelets  and kidneys , of ob/ob and wt mice supplied with a standard diet, using the selective radiochemical ligands -paroxetine and -pk <dig>
we observed comparable sert number or affinity in brain and platelets of ob/ob and wt mice, whilst a significantly higher -pk <dig> density was reported in the brain of ob/ob animals.
unchanged sert in mutant mice is discussed herein in the context of previous literature as the forerunner to a deeper biochemical investigation.
these findings show that tspo expression is up-regulated in cerebral regions of ob/ob leptin-deficient mice, suggesting a role of the translocator protein in leptin-dependent cns trophism and metabolism.
the present study sought at examining the density and affinity of two proteins related to neurotransmission and cell metabolism, the serotonin transporter sert and the cholesterol import-benzodiazepine site tspo , in a rodent leptin-lacking mutant, the obese ob/ob mouse.
