the final map included  <dig> loci on the  <dig> cotton chromosomes,  <dig>  cm in total length and  <dig>  cm in average distance between adjacent markers.
a genetic map based on simple polymerase chain reaction markers will be efficient for marker-assisted breeding in cotton, and markers from transcribed sequences have more chance to target genes related to traits.
a total of  <dig> new est-ssrs developed in our laboratory and other newly released ssrs were used to enrich our interspecific bc <dig> genetic linkage map.
to construct a genome-wide, functional marker-based genetic linkage map in cotton, we isolated and mapped expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats  from cotton ests derived from the a <dig>  d <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genome.
the segregation distorted chromosomes can be a guide to identify segregation distortion loci in cotton.
the annotation of ssr sequences identified frequent and rare gene ontology items on each chromosome, which is helpful to discover functions of cotton chromosomes.
functional analysis of ssr sequences showed that  <dig> loci of this map  were transcribed loci and  <dig> loci  were translated loci.
twenty-one segregation distortion regions  were found in this map; three segregation distorted chromosomes, chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  were identified with  <dig> % of distorted markers segregating toward the heterozygous allele.
a high-density genetic linkage map is the prerequisite for cotton genetics and breeding.
