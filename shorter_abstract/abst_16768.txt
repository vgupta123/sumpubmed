we also show that this model, trained on human sequences, works well on hairpins from other vertebrate as well as invertebrate species.
our algorithm achieved average sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 88%, on 10-fold cross-validation of human mirna precursor data.
micrornas  are small non-coding single-stranded rnas  that are known to act as post-transcriptional and translational regulators of gene expression.
in spite of their biological significance, the identification of mirna genes in newly sequenced organisms is still based, to a large degree, on extensive use of evolutionary conservation, which is not always available.
this may lead to efficient prediction of mirna genes in virtually any organism.
we have developed hhmmir, a novel approach for de novo mirna hairpin prediction in the absence of evolutionary conservation.
