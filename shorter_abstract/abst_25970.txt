contrasting effects of qtls on bunch number and weights reflected the close negative correlation between the two traits.
oil palm breeding would benefit from marker-assisted selection but genetic studies are scarce and inconclusive.
the pedigree-based approach using data from ongoing breeding programs is a powerful, relevant and economic approach to map qtls.
eighteen qtl regions controlling production traits were identified among a large genetically diversified sample from breeding program.
genetic determinisms contributing to heterotic effects have been identified and provide valuable information for orienting oil palm breeding strategies.
a quantitative trait locus  mapping approach involving two-step variance component analysis was employed using phenotypic data on  <dig> palms from crosses between more than  <dig> genotyped parents of two heterotic groups.
qtl patterns depended on the genetic origin, with only one region shared between heterotic groups.
genome scans were performed at parental level by modeling qtl effects as random terms in linear mixed models with identity-by-descent  kinship matrices.
this study aims to identify genetic bases of oil palm production using a pedigree-based approach that is innovative in plant genetics.
