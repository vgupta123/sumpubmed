the a. mellifera genome, in particular, was found to be highly heterogeneous, due to extremely high rates of recombination, with hotspots, but the only bias consistently introduced into pyrosequenced multiplex-enriched libraries concerned sequence length, with the overrepresentation of sequences  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length.
the acquisition of microsatellites through multiplex-enriched libraries and  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing is a promising new tool for the isolation of new markers in unknown genomes.
microsatellites are markers of choice in population genetics and genomics, as they provide useful insight into patterns and processes as diverse as genome evolutionary dynamics and demographic processes.
in this study, we deciphered potential discrepancies in microsatellite content recovery for two reference genomes , selected on the basis of their extreme heterogeneity in terms of the proportions and distributions of microsatellites on chromosomes.
