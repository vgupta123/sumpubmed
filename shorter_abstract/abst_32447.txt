the specimens included  <dig> normal brain tissue samples,  <dig> meningiomas, one medulloblastoma,  <dig> oligodendrocytic gliomas,  <dig> oligoastrocytic gliomas,  <dig> astrocytic gliomas, and  <dig> astrocytoma cell lines.
notable findings include high expression of transferrin receptor  <dig> in the hippocampus and medulla oblongata compared to other brain regions, low expression of hfe in normal brain with elevated hfe expression in meningiomas, and absence of hepcidin mrna in astrocytoma cell lines despite expression in normal brain and tumor specimens.
these results indicate that several iron-related genes are expressed in normal brain, and that their expression may be dysregulated in brain tumors.
we investigated the mrna levels of hepcidin , hfe, neogenin , transferrin receptor  <dig> , transferrin receptor  <dig> , and hemojuvelin  in normal human brain, brain tumors, and astrocytoma cell lines.
defective iron homeostasis may be involved in the development of some diseases within the central nervous system.
