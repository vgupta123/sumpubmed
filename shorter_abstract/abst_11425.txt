such compartmentalization is critical for cells to restrict different pathways to be carried out in different subcellular regions.
over eighty-eight percent of superpathways in the swiss-prot dataset occur in cytoplasm and mitochondria.
to extract pathway localization across organisms, we defined  <dig> superpathways as clusters of basic pathways with the same pathway annotations from different organisms.
as the first effort to systematically integrate pathway localization, this database is very useful in discovering the variation of localization of pathways between organisms and also cross-talk between different organelles within a pathway.
and over seventy percent of uniprot superpathways have multiple localization annotations.
integrating the subcellular localization of enzymes and their pathways from uniprot knowledgebase and kegg pathway databases, we present the first database for subcellular localization of  <dig> pathways from  <dig> uniprot entries and their pathway annotations from uniprot and kegg pathway databases.
the pathlocdb database is available at http://pathloc.cbi.pku.edu.cn.
the summary and classification of subcellular localizations of metabolic pathways are the first steps towards understanding their roles in spatial differentiation and the specialization of metabolic pathways in different organisms.
pathlocdb is a free web-accessible database that enables biochemical researchers to quickly access summarized subcellular localization of pathways from uniprot and kegg pathway databases.
based on this database, we also discovered  <dig> potential transport systems between different steps of multiply localized pathways and  <dig> duplicated genes from  <dig> pathways, occurring in parallel in several locations in humans.
we summarized four common reasons for the multiple localization of superpathways.
