in this work we propose a novel fuzzy methodology based on a fuzzy association rule mining method for biological knowledge extraction.
it is shown that fuzzy association rules can model this knowledge in an intuitive way by using linguistic labels and few easy-understandable parameters.
we apply this methodology over a yeast genome dataset containing heterogeneous information regarding structural and functional genome features.
fuzzy set theory is specially suitable to model imprecise data while association rules are very appropriate to integrate heterogeneous data.
in addition, a comparison between crisp and fuzzy results proves the fuzzy associations to be more reliable than crisp ones.
a number of association rules have been found, many of them agreeing with previous research in the area.
last years' mapping of diverse genomes has generated huge amounts of biological data which are currently dispersed through many databases.
biological data are often imprecise and noisy.
an integrative approach as the one carried out in this work can unveil significant knowledge which is currently hidden and dispersed through the existing biological databases.
