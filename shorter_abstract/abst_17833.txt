biochemical reactions are often modelled as discrete-state continuous-time stochastic processes evolving as memoryless markov processes.

our technique allows us to randomly sample waiting times from probability density functions that not necessarily are distributed according to a negative exponential function.
noticeably, this feature allows some types of enzyme reactions to be modelled as non-markovian processes.
in this context, we discuss an important case-study in which the probability density function is inferred from single-molecule experiments that describe the distribution of the time intervals between two consecutive enzymatically catalysed reactions.
we show that our methodology makes it possible to obtain accurate models of enzymatic reactions that, in specific cases, fit experimental data better than the corresponding markovian models.
our methodology is based on constraint programming and is implemented by using gecode, a state-of-the-art framework for constraint solving.
