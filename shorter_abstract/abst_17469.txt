we conclude that such functionally-equivalent change has the potential to contribute to evolutionary plasticity in interfaces by creating cryptic variation, which in turn may provide the raw material for functional innovation and coevolution.
unfortunately, the interfaces through which proteins interact are complex, typically containing many amino-acid residues that collectively must contribute to binding specificity as well as binding affinity, structural integrity of the interface and solubility in the unbound state.
of key importance is the evolution of binding specificity, the set of interactions made by a protein, since change in specificity can lead to “rewiring” of interaction networks.
physical interactions between proteins are essential for almost all biological functions and systems.
immediately after duplication these paralogues will have identical sequences and protein products that make an identical set of interactions.
in order to study the relationship between interface composition and binding specificity, we make use of paralogous pairs of yeast proteins.
