the immune system of the purple sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is complex and sophisticated.
to understand the genomic organization of the sp185/ <dig> gene family, a bac insert containing sp185/ <dig> genes was assembled, with careful attention to avoiding artifacts resulting from collapse or artificial duplication/expansion of very similar genes.
this underrepresentation could be due to the difficulties that large gene families present in shotgun assembly, where multiple similar genes can be collapsed into a single consensus gene.
this was unexpected given their proximity and putative effects of gene homogenization in closely linked, similar genes.
the s. purpuratus genome assembly, however, contains only six sp185/ <dig> genes.
the sp185/ <dig> genes in this cluster were no more similar to each other than to previously sequenced sp185/ <dig> genes isolated from three different animals.
both edges of the segmental duplications were bounded by different microsatellites.
the high sequence similarity of the sp185/ <dig> genes and flanking regions, suggests that the microsatellites may promote genomic instability and are involved with gene duplication and/or gene conversion and the extraordinary sequence diversity of this family.
all six genes displayed significant similarity including both 5' and 3' flanking regions, which were bounded by microsatellites.
twelve candidate bac assemblies were generated with varying parameters and the optimal assembly was identified by pcr, restriction digests, and subclone sequencing.
