this appears to be the first study to report  <dig> new fungal species in oman and  <dig> new fungal species from date fruits.
some potentially mycotoxin-producing fungi were detected in stored dates, including aspergillus flavus, a. versicolor and penicillium citrinum, but their relative abundance was very limited .
a total of  <dig> fungal species were detected, with species belonging to penicillium, alternaria, cladosporium and aspergillus comprising more than 60% of the fungal reads.
permanova analysis revealed the presence of insignificant differences in fungal communities between date parts or date cultivars, indicating that fungal species associated with the skin may also be detected in the mesocarp.
it also indicates the possible contamination of dates from different cultivars with similar fungal species, even though if they are obtained from different areas.
the analysis shows the presence of different fungal species in dates.
date palm has been a major fruit tree in the middle east over thousands of years, especially in the arabian peninsula.

the aim of the study was to provide in-depth analysis of fungal communities associated with the skin  and mesocarp  of stored dates  of two cultivars  through the use of illumina miseq sequencing.
