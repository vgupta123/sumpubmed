to bring insights into pop <dig> function, a promoter-reporter gene strategy was used and showed that pop <dig> was mainly expressed in roots under control conditions and was induced in primary root apex and aerial parts of plants in response to nacl.
we further performed a functional analysis of the corresponding gene pop <dig> and demonstrated that the previously isolated loss-of-function pop2- <dig> mutant was oversensitive to ionic stress but not to osmotic stress suggesting a specific role in salt tolerance.
gaba-t would act in salt responses in linking n and c metabolisms in roots.
additionally, gc-ms- and uplc-based metabolite profiling revealed major changes in roots of pop2- <dig> mutant upon nacl stress including accumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates content.
here, we investigated the regulation of gaba metabolism in arabidopsis thaliana at the metabolite, enzymatic activity and gene transcription levels upon nacl stress.
gaba metabolism was overall up-regulated in response to nacl in arabidopsis.
we identified the gaba transaminase , the first step of gaba catabolism, as the most responsive to nacl.
particularly, gaba-t was found to play a pivotal function and impairment of this step was responsible for a decrease in salt tolerance indicating that gaba catabolism was a determinant of arabidopsis salt tolerance.
