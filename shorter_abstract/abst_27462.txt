to make the classifier accessible to the genetics research community, we have developed a new web server, called mustab .
although several machine learning methods have been reported for predicting protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions, the previous studies did not utilize relevant sequence features representing biological knowledge for classifier construction.
in this study, a new machine learning method has been developed for sequence feature-based prediction of protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions.
support vector machines were trained with data from experimental studies on the free energy change of protein stability upon mutations.
relevant sequence features can be used to accurately predict protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions.
predictive results at this level of accuracy may provide useful information to distinguish between deleterious and tolerant alterations in disease candidate genes.
it was shown that classifier performance varied significantly by using different sequence features.
protein destabilization is a common mechanism by which amino acid substitutions cause human diseases.
to construct accurate classifiers, twenty sequence features were examined for input vector encoding.
the most accurate classifier in this study was constructed using a combination of six sequence features.
this classifier achieved an overall accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % specificity.
