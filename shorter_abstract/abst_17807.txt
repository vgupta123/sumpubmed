this pathogen is also a key factor in the decline of the koala in australia.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  appear to be key factors in understanding the adaptive process.
in one koala strain , the toxb gene was truncated by a premature stop codon but is full-length in iptale and dbdeug.
an examination of the distribution of these pseudogenes in c. pecorum strains from a variety of koala populations, alongside a number of sheep and cattle c. pecorum positive samples from australian livestock, confirmed the presence of four predicted pseudogenes in koala c. pecorum clinical samples.
two regions of the chromosome were found to be accumulating a large number of snps within the koala strains.
we sequenced the genomes of three koala c. pecorum strains, isolated from the urogenital tracts and conjunctiva of diseased koalas.
the genomic data revealed that variation between c. pecorum strains were mainly due to the accumulation of snps, some of which cause gene inactivation.
these regions include the chlamydia plasticity zone, which contains two cytotoxin genes , and a  <dig> kbp region that codes for putative type iii effector proteins.
another five pseudogenes were also identified, two unique to the urogenital strains c. pecorum mc/marsbar and c. pecorum dbdeug, respectively, while three were unique to the koala c. pecorum conjunctival isolate iptale.
comparisons of the draft c. pecorum genomes against the complete genomes of livestock c. pecorum isolates revealed that these strains have a conserved gene content and order, sharing a nucleotide sequence similarity > 98%.
the identification of these genetic differences will provide the basis for further studies to understand the biology and evolution of this important animal pathogen.
