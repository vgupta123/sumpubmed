co-expression of cascade, cas <dig> and crrna is effective at giving e. coli cells resistance to phage lysis, if a transcriptional repressor of cascade and crispr, h-ns, is inactivated .
we observed that e. coli type i-e crispr-cas mediated resistance to phage λ was strongly temperature dependent, when repeating previously published experimental procedures.
we present further genetic analyses of the regulation of crispr-cas mediated phage resistance in Δhns e. coli cells.
further genetic analyses highlighted the importance of culture conditions for controlling the extent of crispr immunity in e. coli.
in many bacteria, including e. coli, a specialized ribonucleoprotein complex called cascade enacts immunity by“ an interference reaction" between crispr encoded rna  and invader dna sequences called “protospacers”.
regulation of cas <dig> is responsive to phase of growth, and to growth temperature in e. coli, impacting on the efficacy of crispr-cas immunity in these experimental systems.
