by day ten, differentiated cells presented an expression profile of real neurons.
however, the clinical use of embryonic stem cells or foetal tissues is limited by ethical considerations and other scientific problems.
using microarray analysis, we compared gene expression profile of these different samples, before and after neurogenic differentiation.
among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed, genes down-regulated are involved in osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, adipogenesis, myogenesis and extracellular matrix component .
our results demonstrate that bm-msc have the potential to differentiate in neuronal cells with specific gene expression and functional properties.
cellular therapies using stem cells are promising approaches for the treatment of neurological diseases.
thus, bone marrow mesenchymal stomal cells  could represent an alternative source of stem cells for cell replacement therapies.
bm-msc are thus promising candidates for cell-based therapy of neurodegenerative diseases
most of them are involved in the synaptic transmission and long term potentialisation as cortactin, cask, syncrip, syntl <dig> and stx <dig>  other genes are involved in neurite outgrowth, early neuronal cell development, neuropeptide signaling/synthesis and neuronal receptor .
