moreover, the population experiencing more gene flow exhibited a lesser degree of bill length divergence despite similar differences in climate.
we found that mutation-scaled migration rate  between persistently humid and semi-humid environments was nearly  <dig> times higher when the habitats were contiguous  than when separated by a barrier, the cordillera de vilcanota .
gene flow appears to hinder the evolution of functional traits toward local adaptive optima.
to address this, we compared patterns of genetic and morphological diversity in peruvian populations of the hummingbird metallura tyrianthina.
ecological differences, represented here by climate characteristics, are necessary for functional divergence.
the ridges and valleys of the andes create physical barriers that limit animal dispersal and cause deterministic local variation in rainfall.
however, the relative influences of geographic isolation, ecoclimatic conditions, and their potential interactions remain poorly understood.
phylogenetic and variation partitioning analyses showed that geographic isolation rather than climatic dissimilarity explained the greatest proportion of genetic variance.
geographic isolation is necessary for genetic divergence.
this suggests that functional diversification requires geographic isolation followed or accompanied by a shift in ecological conditions.
andean topography causes both isolation and climatic variation, underscoring its dual role in biotic diversification.
in contrast, bill length variation was explained by climatic seasonality, but not by genetic divergence.
this has resulted in physical isolation of animal populations and variation in habitats, each of which has likely contributed to the evolution of high species diversity in the region.
