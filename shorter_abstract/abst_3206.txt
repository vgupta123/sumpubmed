in conclusion, the present results provide new information on the accumulation of specific elements in the feline liver and kidneys, demonstrating a dependency on age and an impaired kidney function, but not on the sex of the animals.
in order to provide new knowledge on the storage of strontium , barium , cadmium , copper , zinc , manganese , chromium , antimony , selenium  and lead  in the feline organism, we measured the concentrations of these elements in the liver, renal cortex and renal medulla, evaluating also the impact of age, sex or the occurrence of a chronic kidney disease .
higher cd concentrations were measured in the renal cortex of female cats, while no further gender-related differences were observed.
the cd concentrations were lower in the renal medulla compared to the renal cortex and the liver, and sr was higher in the renal medulla compared to the liver.
the occurrence of a ckd also affected the storage of the elements, with lower concentrations of ba , zn  and mn , but higher cd concentrations  in diseased cats.
cu, zn and mn were the highest in the liver, followed by the renal cortex and the renal medulla.
the element concentrations in the tissues of  <dig> cats  were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
the se concentrations in the cortex of the kidneys were higher than in the medulla of the kidneys and in the liver.
