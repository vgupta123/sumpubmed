additionally, outlier chips can impact the signals of other arrays, and can themselves be skewed by the majority of the population.
this combination of approaches results in a method that performs comparably to existing approaches on artificial benchmark datasets  and demonstrates promising improvements in segregating true signals within biologically complex experiments.
secondly, the technique does not require similarity in signal distribution across chips for normalization, which can be important for maintaining biologically relevant differences in a heterogeneous background.
