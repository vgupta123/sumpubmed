curative-intent radiation therapy has been described as a valuable treatment option, resulting in long and stable tumor control in these patients.
curative-intent radiation therapy with an accelerated fractionation schedule can be considered a safe, cosmetically superior treatment option for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal planum in cats, resulting in long and stable tumor control.
forty-four cats met the inclusion criteria for this study.
the aim of the current study was to evaluate outcome and toxicity, as well as possible prognostic factors using an accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy protocol.
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal planum in cats is a common indication for antitumor treatment such as external beam radiation therapy.
cats with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal planum treated with an accelerated radiation protocol  were retrospectively evaluated.

all cats showed complete response to therapy.
one- and 2-year oss were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % .
of the tested variables, only tumor volume showed a tendency to influence dfi, with larger tumors having a  <dig>  times greater risk of recurrence than the smaller ones , p =  <dig> ).
of the tested variables, again, only tumor volume influenced os with larger tumors having a  <dig>  times greater risk of dying than the smaller ones , p =  <dig> ).
tumor- and treatment-associated variables were evaluated in respect to local control and survival.
the acute and late toxicity profile was low and hence clinically acceptable.
