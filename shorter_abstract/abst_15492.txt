much progress in xylan biosynthesis has been gained in the model plant species arabidopsis.
however, xylan biosynthesis in grass such as miscanthus remains poorly understood.
the results demonstrated that all seven mlgt43s are functionally conserved in xylan biosynthesis during secondary cell wall formation but diversify in seed coat mucilage xylan biosynthesis.
the results obtained provide deeper insight into xylan biosynthesis in grass, which lay the foundation for genetic modification of grass cell wall components and structure to better suit for next-generation biofuel production.

xylan is the most abundant un-cellulosic polysaccharides of plant cell walls.
overexpression of mlgt43a-e but not mlgt43f and mlgt43g in arabidopsis irx <dig> fully or partially rescued the mutant defects, including morphological changes, collapsed xylem and increased xylan contents, whereas overexpression of mlgt43f and mlgt43g but not mlgt43a-e complemented the defects of irx <dig>  indicating that mlgt43a-e are functional orthologues of irx <dig>  while mlgt43f and mlgt43g are functional orthologues of irx <dig>  however, overexpression of all seven mlgt <dig> genes could not rescue the mucilage defects of irx <dig> seeds.
all seven mlgt <dig> proteins were localized to golgi apparatus.
we characterized seven gt <dig> members in m. lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy crop.
two homologous pairs irregular xylem  <dig> /9l and irx14/14l from glycosyltransferase  family  <dig> have been proved to play crucial roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis.
