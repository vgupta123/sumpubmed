immunostaining and immunoblotting procedures were employed to study the presence of repressive histone modifications and hp <dig> proteins in normal human and mouse blood neutrophils, and in vitro differentiated granulocytes of the mouse promyelocytic  system.
these granulocytes revealed negligible amounts of hp <dig> α and β, but exhibited detectable levels of hp <dig> γ. of particular interest, mouse blood and mpro undifferentiated cells and granulocytes revealed clear co-localization of trimethylated h3k <dig>  trimethylated h4k <dig> and hp <dig> γ with pericentric heterochromatin.
however, the apparent paucity of hp <dig> proteins in neutrophils suggests that heterochromatin organization and binding to the nuclear envelope may differ in this cell-type.
understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional repression and activation in neutrophils requires detailing the chromatin epigenetic markers, which are virtually undescribed in this cell type.
much is known about the heterochromatin epigenetic markers in other cell-types, permitting a basis for comparison with those of mature normal neutrophilic granulocytes.
future investigations should follow changes in epigenetic markers and levels of hp <dig> proteins during granulopoiesis and bacterial activation of neutrophils.
a variety of repressive histone methylation markers were detectable in these granulocytes .
mature blood neutrophils possess some epigenetic heterochromatin features that resemble those of well-studied cells, such as lymphocytes.
