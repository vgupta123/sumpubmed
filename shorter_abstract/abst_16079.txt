somatic and non-synonymous single nucleotide variants identified from each patient were assigned a quantitative score  that represents the extent of negative impact on the gene function.
this study demonstrates that gene mutation profiles can be effectively used with unsupervised machine-learning methods to identify clinically distinguishable breast cancer subgroups.
finally, using the identified subgroups, we also developed a supervised classification model to predict the stage of the patients.
the classification model developed in this method could provide a reasonable prediction of the cancer patients’ stage solely based on their mutation profiles.
comparison of the mutation scores of early and late-stage-enriched subgroups identified  <dig> genes that carry significantly higher mutations rates in the late stage subgroup.
this study represents the first use of only somatic mutation profile data to identify and predict breast cancer subgroups and this generic methodology can also be applied to other cancer datasets.
hence in this study, we explore the use of gene mutation profiles to classify, characterize and predict the subgroups of breast cancers.

several classification strategies based on er/pr/her <dig> expression or the expression profiles of a panel of genes have helped, but such methods often produce misleading results due to their dynamic nature.
the high degree of heterogeneity observed in breast cancers makes it very difficult to classify the cancer patients into distinct clinical subgroups and consequently limits the ability to devise effective therapeutic strategies.
using these scores with non-negative matrix factorization method, we clustered the patients into three subgroups.
we analyzed the whole exome sequencing data from  <dig> ethnically similar breast cancer patients in the cancer genome atlas  project.
by comparing the clinical stage of patients, we identified an early-stage-enriched and a late-stage-enriched subgroup.
