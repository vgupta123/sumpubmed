isolates resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol were found and the genes blaz, erm, erm, tet, fusc were identified.
nasal swabs of  <dig> donkeys obtained in a large slaughterhouse in  <dig> were inoculated in specific media for s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus  recovery.
the objective of this study was to determine the genetic lineages and the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants of nasal staphylococcus aureus isolates of healthy donkeys destined to food consumption in tunisia.
genetic lineages, toxin gene profile, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms were determined in recovered isolates.
s. aureus isolates were ascribed to agr type i , iii , ii , and iv .
different combinations of enterotoxin, leukocidin and haemolysin genes were identified among s. aureus isolates.
twenty-five different spa-types were detected among the  <dig> mssa with  <dig> novel spa-types.
the gene tst was detected in  <dig> isolates and the gene etb in one isolate.
s. aureus was obtained in 50% of the samples, being all of isolates methicillin-susceptible .
cc <dig> seems to have a broader host distribution than expected.
