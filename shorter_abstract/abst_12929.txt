in the present study, the transcriptomes were analyzed using next-generation sequencing technology to find the genes involved in microsclerotia development.
however, mass production and commercialization of this organism are limited due to its fastidious growth and sporulation requirements.
among the annotated sequences, only  <dig> were annotated with  <dig> gene ontology  functional categories, and  <dig>  sequences were mapped to  <dig> pathways by searching against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway  database.
subsequently, we examined the up-regulation or uniquely expressed genes following amended medium treatment, which were also expressed on the enrichment pathway, and found that most of them participated in mediating oxidative stress homeostasis.
to elucidate the role of oxidative stress in microsclerotia development, we analyzed the diversification of unigenes using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr .
our findings suggest that oxidative stress occurs during microsclerotia development, along with a broad metabolic activity change.
however, little is known about the genes involved in microsclerotia development.
nomuraea rileyi is used as an environmental-friendly biopesticide.
when cultured in amended medium, we found that n. rileyi could produce microsclerotia bodies, replacing conidiophores as the infectious agent.
our data provide the most comprehensive sequence resource available for the study of n. rileyi.
we believe that the transcriptome datasets will serve as an important public information platform to accelerate studies on n. rileyi microsclerotia.
