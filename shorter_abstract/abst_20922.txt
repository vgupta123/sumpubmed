however, the sensitivities of these methods vary based on the allelic fraction of the mutation in the tumor sample.
the recently developed gold standard variant set for the reference individual na <dig> by the nist-led “genome in a bottle” consortium  provides a good resource to evaluate admixtures with various snv fractions.
using the nist-giab gold standard, we compared the performance of five popular somatic snv calling algorithms  for matched tumor-normal amplicon and exome sequencing data.
although numerous studies have compared the performance of various algorithms on exome data, there has not yet been a systematic evaluation using pcr-enriched amplicon data with a range of variant allele fractions.
our analysis can assist researchers in choosing a somatic snv calling method suitable for their specific needs.
we demonstrated that the five commonly used somatic snv calling methods are applicable to both targeted amplicon and exome sequencing data.
