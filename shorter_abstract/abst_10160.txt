two types of violations were introduced:  semantically incorrect sentences containing a selectional restriction violation ;  morphosyntactically incorrect sentences containing a verb that was incorrectly inflected .
erp correlates of semantic and morphosyntactic aspects of dgs clearly differed from each other and showed a number of similarities with those observed in other signed and oral languages.
the present study investigated the neural correlates of sign language processing of deaf people who had learned german sign language  from their deaf parents as their first language.
semantic violations  elicited an n <dig> effect followed by a positivity.
these data suggest a similar functional organization of signed and oral languages despite the visual-spacial modality of sign language.
