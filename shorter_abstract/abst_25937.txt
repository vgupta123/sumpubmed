we show that coffee component hhq has significant apoptotic effect on mda-mb- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells in vitro, and that ros generation, change in mitochondrial membrane permeability, upregulation of bax and caspase- <dig> as well as down regulation of pgk <dig> and pkm <dig> expression may be important apoptosis-inducing mechanisms.
the results suggest that pparÎ³ ligands may serve as potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer therapy.
coffee contains several compounds that have the potential to influence breast cancer risk and survival.
