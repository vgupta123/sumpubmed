the  <dig> selected genes can predict breast cancer recurrence.
oncologists can offer the genetic information for patients when understanding the gene expression profiles on breast cancer recurrence.
the bootstrap method, mann–whitney u test and 20-fold cross-validation were performed to investigate candidate genes with  <dig> most-significant p-values.
the dt models exhibited the lowest predictive power and the poorest extrapolation when applied to the test samples.
we analyzed published breast cancer microarray databases to predict five-year recurrence and compared the performance of three data mining algorithms of artificial neural networks , decision trees  and logistic regression  and two composite models of dt-ann and dt-lr.
the collection of microarray datasets from the gene expression omnibus, four breast cancer datasets were pooled for predicting five-year breast cancer relapse.
the predictive powers of dt, lr and ann models were assessed using accuracy and the area under roc curve.
the ann models displayed the best predictive power and showed the best extrapolation.
the associated genes were evaluated using cox regression.
the  <dig> most-associated genes, as determined by integration of each model, were analyzed using cox regression with a  <dig> -fold  increased risk of breast cancer five-year recurrence…
