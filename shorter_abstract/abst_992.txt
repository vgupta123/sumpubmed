here, we present a software package for gene regulatory network reconstruction at a genomic level, in which gene interaction is measured by the conditional mutual information measurement using a parallel computing framework .
this new software package provides a powerful tool for genomic network reconstruction to biological community.
in cmip, we provide not only an automatic threshold determination method but also an effective parallel computing framework for network inference.
reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, in particular, genome-scale networks, is essential for comparative exploration of different species and mechanistic investigation of biological processes.
in addition, successful application on a real genomic dataset confirms its practical applicability of the package.
currently, most of network inference methods are computationally intensive, which are usually effective for small-scale tasks , but are difficult to construct grns at genome-scale.
performance tests on benchmark datasets show that the accuracy of cmip is comparable to most current network inference methods.

a gene regulatory network  represents interactions of genes inside a cell or tissue, in which vertexes and edges stand for genes and their regulatory interactions respectively.
