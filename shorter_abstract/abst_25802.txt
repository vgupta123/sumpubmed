a higher percentage of cd39+ tregs was detected within the population of foxp3+cd4+ t cells in peripheral blood of ascs patients.
moreover, the percentage of cd39+ tregs was significantly less in cah and aclf patients.
initial characterization studies of healthy peripheral cd39+foxp3+cd4+ t cells revealed that the majority were cd45ra- treg cells.
a newly identified subset of the cd4+foxp3+ tregs, the cd39+ tregs, has been associated with viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
the increased proportions of circulating cd39+ tregs were positively correlated with serum viral load, but inversely correlated with serum alt level.
these findings not only suggest that cd39+ treg cells may be involved in hbv disease progression but also identify cd39+ tregs as a dynamic immune regulatory cell population that may represent a new target of immunomodulatory therapeutic interventions.
subsequent analysis of hbv-infected patients ,  <dig> chronic active hepatitis b ,  <dig> hbv-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure ) and healthy individuals  was conducted to assess association with hbv copy number and the liver injury marker alanine aminotransferase .
