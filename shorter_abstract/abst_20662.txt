the proteolytic system of lab converts proteins to peptides and then to amino acids, which is essential for bacterial growth and also contributes significantly to flavor compounds as end-products.
variations were observed in the proteinase prtp and its maturation protein prtm, in one of the opp transport systems and in several peptidases between strains from different lactococcus subspecies or from different origin.
comparison of protein 3d structures of proline peptidases pepi/pepr/pepl and esterase a allowed identification of a conserved core structure, which was then used to improve phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation within this protein superfamily.
the improved functional annotation of the proteolytic system components provides an excellent framework for future experimental validations of predicted enzymatic activities.
recent developments in high-throughput genome sequencing and comparative genomics hybridization arrays provide us with opportunities to explore the diversity of the proteolytic system in various lab strains.
we performed a genome-wide comparative genomics analysis of proteolytic system components, including cell-wall bound proteinase, peptide transporters and peptidases, in  <dig> sequenced lab strains.
transcriptomics and metabolomics for prediction of proteolytic and flavor-forming potential of lab strains.
lactic acid bacteria  are a group of gram-positive, lactic acid producing firmicutes.
such an integrated approach can be used to tune the strain selection process in food fermentations.
the diversity of proteolytic system components in  <dig> lactococcus lactis strains was explored using pangenome comparative genome hybridization analysis.
