we conclude that the scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes emerged as part of the 2r genome duplications.
in the analysed teleost species no scd <dig> is found, while the surrounding scd5-less locus is conserved in comparison to tetrapods.
paralogy analysis hints that scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes emerged as part of the whole genome duplications  that occurred at the stem of the vertebrate lineage.
we show here, through comparative genomics and phylogenetics that the scd gene family underwent an unexpectedly complex history of duplication and loss events.
in the amphibian xenopus tropicalis we find a single scd <dig> gene but not scd <dig>  though this could be due to genome incompleteness.
despite being crucial for interpreting scds roles across species, the evolutionary history of the scd gene family in vertebrates has yet to be elucidated, in particular their isoform diversity, origin and function.
they catalyze the desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-coa substrates at the delta- <dig> position, generating essential components of phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and wax esters.
we propose that the evolutionary conserved gene expression between distinct lineages underpins the importance of scd activity in the brain , in a yet to be defined role.
we argue that an expression independent of an external stimulus, such as diet induced activity, emerged as a novel function in vertebrate ancestry allocated to the scd <dig> isoform in various tissues , and it was selectively maintained throughout vertebrate evolution.
the scd <dig> gene family expanded in rodents with the parallel loss of scd <dig> in the muridae family.
