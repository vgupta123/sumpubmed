additional histological procedures were used to localize inflammatory cell infiltrates, microgliosis and astrogliosis.
mice with ceae had more iron-labeled vessels compared to controls, but these vessels were not commonly associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates.
the findings indicate that iron deposition around vessels can occur independently of inflammation providing evidence against the hypothesis that iron deposits account for inflammatory cell infiltrates observed in ms.
a recent hypothesis stated that cns inflammation is induced by perivenular iron deposits that occur in response to altered blood flow in ms subjects.
laser doppler was used to measure cerebral blood flow.
doppler analysis revealed that ceae mice had a reduction in cerebral blood flow compared to controls.
in order to generate ceae, mice were given an encephalitogen injection followed by a stereotactic intracerebral injection of tnf-α and ifn-γ.
control animals received encephalitogen followed by an intracerebral injection of saline, or no encephalitogen plus an intracerebral injection of saline or cytokines.
in order to evaluate this hypothesis, an animal model was developed, called cerebral experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , which presents with cns perivascular iron deposits.
some iron-laden vessels had associated microgliosis that was above the background microglial response, and iron deposits were observed within reactive microglia.
