the comparison, and matching with competitive accuracy, of one medium sized  query structure against the complete pdb database  takes about 8Â min using an average desktop computer.
the method relies on the calculation of 2d matrices containing a description of the three-dimensional arrangement of secondary structure elements .
we validate the performance of the method for fold and superfamily assignment in a large benchmark set of protein structures.
the method is able to detect partial structure matching, rigid body shifts, conformational changes and tolerates substantial structural variation arising from insertions, deletions and sequence divergence, as well as structural convergence of unrelated proteins.
here we report on the development of a new method for the fast and flexible comparison of protein structure chains.
however, comparable accurate flexible structural aligners to perform efficient whole database searches of multi-domain proteins are not yet available.
the availability of such a tool is critical for a sustainable boosting of biological discovery.
we finally provide a series of examples to illustrate the usefulness of this method and its application in biological discovery.
the total number of known three-dimensional protein structures is rapidly increasing.
