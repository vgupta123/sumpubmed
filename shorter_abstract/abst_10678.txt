cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins  regulate translation by binding to regulatory motifs of defined mrna targets.
the purpose of the current study is to investigate the alternative splicing isoforms of a particular cpeb, cpeb <dig>  based on current databases, and to characterize the expression of cpeb <dig> in the retina.
experimentally, we show that cpeb <dig> expression is increased in a time-dependent manner during the course of postnatal development, and cpeb <dig> is localized mostly in the inner retina, including retinal ganglion cells.
this translational mechanism has been shown to play a critical role in oocyte maturation, early development, and memory formation in the hippocampus.
we report the presence of eight alternative splicing patterns of cpeb <dig>  including a novel one, in the mouse retina.
the relative abundance of the patterns in the retina is demonstrated.
