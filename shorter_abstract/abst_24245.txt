a few taxa matched sequences only from the d. pulex and the d. pulicaria datasets: aeromonas, pseudomonas and delftia.
these communities are similar at the genus and higher taxonomic level, but are composed of different species.
the apparent similarity of the symbiont communities of the three daphnia species breaks down on a species and strain level.
the similarity of these three symbiont communities hints that some of these associations may be stable in the long-term.
the current project makes use of four shotgun datasets from three species of the planktonic freshwater crustaceans daphnia: one dataset from clones of d. pulex and d. pulicaria and two datasets from one clone of d. magna.
three clones from three species of the genus daphnia were found to harbor a rich community of symbionts.
the two daphnia magna datasets obtained from two different pyrosequencing platforms revealed rather similar results.
second, we search for evidence for cyanobacteria and plastids, which had been suggested to occur as symbionts in a related daphnia species.
communities have a similar composition at a higher taxonomic level, but the actual sequences found are divergent.
we found no clear evidence for the presence of symbiotic cyanobacteria or plastids.
in all datasets we found evidence for a large number of bacteria belonging to diverse taxa.
we analyzed these datasets with three aims: first, we search for bacterial symbionts, which are present in all three species.
the vast majority of these were proteobacteria.
shotgun sequences of dna extracts from whole organisms allow a comprehensive assessment of possible symbionts.
