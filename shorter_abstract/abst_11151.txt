differentiation was evaluated over  <dig> days by monitoring terminal differentiation markers ; cell viability, growth phase, kinetics, and apoptosis; assessing cellular morphology and ultrastructure; and conformational changes to major cellular components.
however, nicotine exposure during differentiation suppressed the oxidative burst in hl- <dig> cells ; inhibited bacterial killing ; and increased the lps-induced release of mmp- <dig>  but not mmp- <dig> .
neutrophils leave the bone marrow as terminally differentiated cells, yet little is known of the influence of nicotine or other tobacco smoke components on neutrophil differentiation.
these findings may partially explain the known increase in susceptibility to bacterial infection and neutrophil-associated destructive inflammatory diseases in individuals chronically exposed to nicotine.
nicotine increased the percentage of cells in late differentiation phases  compared to dmso alone , but did not affect any other marker of neutrophil differentiation examined.
