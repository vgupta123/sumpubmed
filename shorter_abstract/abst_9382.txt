despite the fundamental biological importance and clinical relevance of characterizing the effects of chronic hypoxia exposure on central nervous system  development, the changes in gene expression from hypoxia are unknown.
we perform transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution to systematically determine and then experimentally validate the response of cns connectivity genes to hypoxia exposure.
we characterized mrna changes during development, comparing the effects of chronic hypoxia exposure at different time-points.
overall, our study identifies the response of cns connectivity genes to hypoxia exposure during development.
we focused on changes in expression levels of a subset of  <dig> genes selected for their roles in development of cns connectivity, including axon pathfinding and synapse formation.
we found that the majority of cns connectivity genes were unaffected by hypoxia.
the observed dysynchrony of gene expression could impair the development of normal cns connectivity maps.
here, we use the small vertebrate zebrafish  to study the effects of hypoxia on connectivity gene expression across development.
however, for a small subset of genes hypoxia significantly affected their gene expression profiles.
while for most genes hypoxia did not significantly affect expression, for a subset of genes hypoxia changed both levels and timing of expression.
in particular, hypoxia appeared to affect both the timing and levels of expression, including altering expression of interacting gene pairs in a fashion that would potentially disrupt normal function.
