the scoring function was subsequently validated and networks constructed around key proteins, identified as being highly up- or down-regulated in rat cell lines of high metastatic potential.
the protein network generation and subsequent network analysis used here, were shown to be useful for highlighting key proteins involved in metastasis.
this approach, in conjunction with microarray expression data, can be extended to other species, thereby suggesting possible pathways around proteins of interest.
protein-protein interactions have traditionally been studied on a small scale, using classical biochemical methods to investigate the proteins of interest.
we constructed networks, or 'interactomes', of putative protein-protein interactions in the rat proteome â€“ the rat being an organism extensively used for cancer studies.
more recently large-scale methods, such as two-hybrid screens, have been utilised to survey extensive portions of genomes.
using clustering methods on the networks, we have identified key protein communities involved in cancer metastasis.
