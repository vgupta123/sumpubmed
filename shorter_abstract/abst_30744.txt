this network functions autonomously of limb bud signaling centers or other limb bud positional cues.
the skeletal elements of vertebrate embryonic limbs are prefigured by rod- and spot-like condensations of precartilage mesenchymal cells.
correspondingly, knockdown of cg-1a inhibits the formation of skeletal elements while knockdown of cg- <dig> enhances it.
our findings indicate that cg-1a and cg- <dig> constitute a multiscale network that is a major mediator, earlier-acting than any previously described, of the formation and patterning of precartilage mesenchymal condensations in the developing limb.
the apparent paradox of mutual activation at the gene expression level coupled with antagonistic roles in skeletogenesis is resolved by analysis of the direct effect of the proteins on precartilage cells.
the two molecules enhance one another's gene expression but have opposite effects on condensation formation and cartilage development in vivo and in vitro: cg-1a, a non-covalent homodimer, promotes this process, while the tandem-repeat-type cg- <dig> antagonizes it.
