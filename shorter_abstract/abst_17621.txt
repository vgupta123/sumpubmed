best docking results of wssgtl <dig> in the form of stable enzyme-substrate complex having lowest binding energies were obtained with brassicasterol, transandrosteron and wssgtl <dig> with solasodine, stigmasterol and 24-methylene cholesterol.
the role of sgts has been demonstrated in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important molecules of medicinal plants like withania somnifera.
wssgtl <dig> and wssgtl <dig>  however, besides being ubiquitous in nature and with broad substrate specificity, difference between wssgtl <dig> and wssgtl <dig> is briefly described by difference in stability  of enzyme-substrate complexes through comparative docking.
members of this family modulate physical and chemical properties of secondary plant products important for various physiological processes.
substrate specificity of wssgts were analysed through docking performance of wssgts with different substrates .
analysis suggested conserved behaviour and high similarity in active sites of wssgts with other plant gts.
