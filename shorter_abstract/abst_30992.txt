importantly, constitutively active rab <dig> cannot rescue the awd phenotype, suggesting that awd is required for rab <dig> function in early endosome maturation.
our results demonstrate that awd function is required before Î³-secretase mediated cleavage since over-expression of the constitutively active form of the notch receptor in awd mutant follicle cells allows rescue of the signaling.
in awd mutant follicle cells and wing disc cells, notch accumulates in enlarged early endosomes, resulting in defective notch signaling.
by using markers of different endosomal compartments we show that notch receptor accumulates in early endosomes in awd mutant follicle cells.
the drosophila abnormal wing discs  belongs to a highly conserved family of genes implicated in metastasis suppression, metabolic homeostasis and epithelial morphogenesis.
a trafficking assay in living wing discs also shows that notch accumulates in early endosomes.
in addition, we identify the endocytic step at which awd function is required for notch signaling and we obtain evidence indicating that awd is necessary for rab <dig> function.
