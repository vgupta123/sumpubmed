changes in cho and cho/cr were similar across the brain regions, increasing at  <dig> wpi, and falling below baseline levels at  <dig> wpi.
in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy  studies of hiv-infected humans have demonstrated significant metabolic abnormalities that vary by brain region, but the causes are poorly understood.
mi and mi/cr levels were increased across all brain regions.
these data best support the hypothesis that different brain regions have variable intrinsic vulnerabilities to neuronal injury caused by the aids virus.
most abnormalities were observed at the time of peak viremia,  <dig> weeks post infection .
at that time point, significant decreases in naa and naa/cr, reflecting neuronal injury, were observed only in the frontal cortex.
metabolic changes in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia and white matter in  <dig> siv-infected macaques were investigated using mrs during the first month of infection.
cr was significantly elevated only in the white matter.
