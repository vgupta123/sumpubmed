in the first stage, the model learns the general epitope patterns of each kind of propensity from a large data set containing computationally defined epitopes.
with heterogeneity well learnt, the transferability of the prediction model was remarkably improved to handle new data with a high level of heterogeneity.
this work proposed a staged heterogeneity learning method, which learns both characteristics and heterogeneity of data in a phased manner.
the proposed method uses only antigen sequence information, and thus has much broader applications.
this proposed sequence-based method achieved outstanding performance - about twice that of existing methods, including the sequence-based predictor cbtope and three other structure-based predictors.
in the second stage, the model learns the heterogenous complementarity of these propensities from a relatively small guided data set containing experimentally determined epitopes.
the broad heterogeneity of antigen-antibody interactions brings tremendous challenges to the design of a widely applicable learning algorithm to identify conformational b-cell epitopes.
the method was applied to identify antigenic residues of heterogenous conformational b-cell epitopes based on antigen sequences.
moreover, we designed an algorithm to cluster the predicted individual antigenic residues into conformational b-cell epitopes so as to provide strong potential for real-world applications, such as vaccine development.
