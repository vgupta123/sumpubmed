the diminished cooperation in mixes between groups suggests that the level of genetic variation between individuals influences the extent of their cooperation.
in this study we look at genetic diversity in p. violaceum and at how this diversity impacts social behavior.
the phylogeny of the ribosomal dna sequence  shows that p. violaceum is made up of at least two groups.
p. violaceum clones are more likely to form clonal fruiting bodies when they are mixed with clones from a different group than when they are mixed with a clone of the same group.
both the phylogenetic and mating analyses suggest the possibility of cryptic species in p. violaceum.
the level of divergence found within p. violaceum is comparable to the divergence between sibling species in other dictyostelids.
mating compatibility is more common between clones from the same phylogenetic group, though matings between clones from different phylogenetic groups sometimes occurred.
the social amoeba polysphondylium violaceum, which is a member of the dictyostelia, has a social stage where individual amoebae aggregate together to form a multicellular fruiting body with dead stalk cells and live spores.
