our results support and extend the homology hypotheses for the thoracic musculatures of odonata and neoptera, thus supplementing our understanding of the evolution of pterygota and providing additional characters for phylogenetic analyses comprising all subgroups of pterygota.
nine of these muscles were previously unknown in odonata, and for seven muscles no homologous muscles could be identified in the neopteran thorax.
here we present a comparative morphological investigation of the thoracic musculature of dragonfly  nymphs.
