a control group of  <dig> sera from healthy danish blood-donors were analysed in order to determine the cut-off for interpretation of results.
as a part of this, antibody decay profiles after culture confirmed yersinia enteritis were studied.
moreover, the knowledge gained from this longitudinal study of antibody decay profiles can be used in future epidemiological studies of seroprevalence.
the elisa was highly specific for yersinia when testing sera from individuals with confirmed gastrointestinal infections by other bacteria.
a longitudinal collection of  <dig> sera drawn between  <dig> and 1053 days after onset of symptoms from  <dig> adult danish patients with verified yersinia enteritis were examined.
using a definition of positive as a positive result for either iga, igg or igm antibodies, a diagnostic sensitivity of 81% was achieved for samples received within 60 days after onset of symptoms.
an elisa using yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig> lps as the coating antigen was developed for measuring iga, igg and igm specific antibodies.
serum samples from  <dig> out of  <dig> patients who delivered either the first or the second sample were found positive for specific antibodies against yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig> lps .
for samples collected within 60 days after onset of symptoms  sensitivities of 58%, 42% and 79% for iga, igg and igm antibodies were found.
in particular, the levels of specific igm antibodies were elevated.
the study aimed to develop a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for detection of yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig> lps antibodies in sera from danish patients with suspected yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig> gastrointestinal infection.
a sensitivity of 81% was found for these samples when using the definition of a positive result in either iga, igg or igm as a combined positive.
the antibody levels as well as decay profiles for the three different immunoglobulin classes for the individual patients exhibited a large degree of variation.
in comparison, the standard tube-agglutination assay achieved a sensitivity of 60% on the same samples.
