the identified disease patterns can then be further investigated with regards to their diagnostic utility or help in the prediction of novel therapeutic targets.
we quantified robust associations between analytes measured with different profiling platforms as networks.
we compared the stability of this molecular network in an extended dataset between schizophrenia and affective disorder patients and found more stable structures in the latter.
the applied framework is able to enhance the understanding of complex psychiatric diseases, and may give novel insights into drug development and personalized medicine approaches.
this lack of integration results in the loss of valuable information about how disease associated factors act synergistically to cause the complex phenotype.
in the diagnosis of complex diseases such as neurological pathologies, a wealth of clinical and molecular information is often available to help the interpretation.
here, we investigated complex psychiatric diseases as networks.
we provided an estimate of the heterogeneity of the population of schizophrenia and detected a subgroup of patients featuring remarkable abnormalities in a network of serum primary fatty acid amides.
the heterogeneity of the patient population was analyzed by clustering and graph theoretical procedures.
