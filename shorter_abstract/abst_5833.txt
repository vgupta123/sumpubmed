to quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants , we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.
different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited.
however, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane.
species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass.
emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.
here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions.
we found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant .
a shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.
we conclude that plant species  vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere.
