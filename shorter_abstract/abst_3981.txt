inference of population stratification and individual admixture from genetic markers is an integrative part of a study in diverse situations, such as association mapping and evolutionary studies.
we have developed psmix, an r package based on maximum likelihood method using expectation-maximization algorithm, for inference of population stratification and individual admixture.
bayesian methods have been proposed for population stratification and admixture inference using multilocus genotypes and widely used in practice.
compared with software based on bayesian methods , psmix has similar accuracy, but more efficient computations.
