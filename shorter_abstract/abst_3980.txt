firstly we investigated genes differentially expressed in the aneurysm prone segment of the suprarenal aorta in these mice.
using microarrays we identified genes relevant to aneurysm formation within apolipoprotein e deficient mice.
genes associated with extracellular matrix remodelling, such as a range of matrix metalloproteinases were also differentially expressed in relation to aneurysm formation.
this study is the first report describing whole genome expression arrays in the apolipoprotein e deficient mice in relation to aneurysm formation.
the findings suggest that the pathways believed to be critical in human aaa are also relevant to aneurysm formation in this mouse model.
an animal model commonly used to investigate pathways and potential therapeutic interventions relevant to abdominal aortic aneurysm  involves subcutaneous infusion of angiotensin ii within the apolipoprotein e deficient mouse.
secondly we investigated genes that were differentially expressed in the aortas of mice developing aneurysms relative to those that did not develop aneurysms in response to angiotensin ii infusion.
the aim of this study was to investigate genes differentially expressed in aneurysms forming within this mouse model in order to assess the relevance of this model to human aaa.
the findings therefore support the value of this model to investigate interventions and mechanisms of human aaa.
