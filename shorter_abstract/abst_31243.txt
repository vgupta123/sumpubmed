recombination-based subcloning permits expression of multi-shrna transcripts from a comprehensive range of plasmid or viral vectors.
effective and stable knockdown of multiple gene targets by rna interference is often necessary to overcome isoform redundancy, but it remains a technical challenge when working with intractable cell systems.
we demonstrate functional consequences of depleting multiple endogenous target genes using mir-shrnas, and highlight the versatility of the described vector platform for multiple target gene knockdown in mammalian cells.
we have developed a flexible platform using rna polymerase ii promoter-driven expression of microrna-like short hairpin rnas which permits robust depletion of multiple target genes from a single transcript.
