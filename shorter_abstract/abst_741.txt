this group has radiated spectacularly in the old world tropics and presents an exciting opportunity to better understand processes of invertebrate rapid radiations.
basal relationships are unresolved, but we recover six well-supported clades.
however, the generic-level taxonomy of the subtribe has been in a constant state of flux, and relationships among genera are unknown.
our phylogeny paves the way for further comparative studies on this group that will help us understand the processes underlying diversification in rapid radiations of invertebrates.
some species of mycalesis are nested within a primarily madagascan clade of heteropsis, while nirvanopsis is nested within lohora.
the results indicate that the group mycalesina radiated rapidly around the oligocene-miocene boundary.
we infer the phylogeny of the group with data from three genes  and use these data to reconstruct events in the biogeographic history of the group.
we discuss factors that are likely to have played a key role in the diversification of the group.
the australasian radiation shares a common ancestor derived from asia.
mycalesis, lohora and nirvanopsis are found in the oriental region, the first of which is the most speciose genus among mycalesines, and extends into the australasian region.
the current dataset tentatively suggests that the madagascan fauna comprises two independent radiations.
