here the juvenile onset of spermatogenesis in mice is analyzed by combining cytological and transcriptomic data in a novel computational analysis that allows decomposition of the transcriptional programs of spermatogonia and meiotic prophase substages.
independent principal component analyses of cytological and transcriptomic data yielded similar patterns for both data types, providing strong evidence for substage-specific gene expression signatures.
germ cells from testes of individual mice were obtained at two-day intervals from  <dig> to 18 days post-partum , prepared as surface-spread chromatin and immunolabeled for meiotic stage-specific protein markers .
expression of meiosis-specific genes is not substage-limited, suggesting regulation of substage transitions at other levels.
a novel permutation-based maximum covariance analysis  was developed to map co-expressed transcripts to one or more of the eight meiotic prophase substages, thereby linking distinct molecular programs to cytologically defined cell states.
here it revealed not only features of meiotic substage-specific gene expression, but also a network of substage-specific transcription factors and relationships to potential target genes.
