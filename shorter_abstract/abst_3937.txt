plasmids play a crucial role in the evolution of bacterial genomes by mediating horizontal gene transfer.
phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences showed that different minireplicons on the same megaplasmid have different evolutionary histories.
this work studied the origin and evolution of  <dig> b. cereus group megaplasmids  focusing on the most conserved regions on plasmids, minireplicons.
in megaplasmids of the b. cereus group, individual minireplicons of different megaplasmids in the same strain belong to different types or subtypes.
megaplasmids of b. cereus group are fusion of smaller plasmids, and the fusion of plasmids likely occurs frequently in the b. cereus group and in other bacterial taxa.
therefore, we speculated that these megaplasmids are the results of fusion of smaller plasmids.
all plasmids of a bacterial strain must be compatible.
strains of the bacillus cereus group contain up to  <dig> plasmids with genome sizes ranging from 2 kb to 600 kb, and thus can be used to study plasmid dynamics and evolution.
a broader analysis of all  <dig> bacterial plasmids with putative known minireplicons whose complete genome sequences were available from genbank revealed that 34%  of the plasmids have two or more minireplicons.
this indicates that plasmid fusion events are general among bacterial plasmids.
