identifying novel ptm sites in different organisms, including humans and model organisms, has expedited our understanding of key signal transduction mechanisms.
here, we addressed this by developing a web-based software tool, phosphortholog  that accurately maps protein modification sites between different species.
here we describe phosphortholog, a web-based application for mapping known and novel orthologous ptm sites from experimental data obtained from different species.
this facilitates the comparison of datasets derived from multiple species, and should be a valuable tool for the proteomics community.
current tools that address this can only map known ptms between species based on known orthologous phosphosites, and do not enable the cross-species mapping of newly identified modification sites.
this is particularly important because functionally important modification sites are more likely to be evolutionarily conserved; yet cross-species comparison of ptms is difficult since they often lie in structurally disordered protein domains.
although coverage statistics are dataset dependent, phosphortholog increased the number of cross-species mapped sites in all our example data sets by more than double when compared to those recovered using existing resources such as phosphositeplus.
identification of conserved ptms across species from large-scale experimental data increases our knowledgebase of functional ptm sites.
most biological processes are influenced by protein post-translational modifications .
this is achieved through pairwise sequence alignment of orthologous protein residues.
