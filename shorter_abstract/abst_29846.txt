the subtype of ehpss could be determined by a minor genetic component or modulating factors during embryonic development.
the study group consisted of  <dig> males and  <dig> females from  <dig> breeds.
this study was performed to determine the distribution of extrahepatic portocaval and porto-azygous shunts in purebred dog populations.
twenty-five percent of dogs had porto-azygous shunts and 75% had portocaval shunts.
small dogs are mostly diagnosed with portocaval shunts  whereas both types are detected.
the age at diagnosis in dogs with porto-azygous shunts was significantly higher than that of dogs with portocaval shunts .
if in general both portocaval and porto-azygous shunts occur in breeds predisposed to portosystemic shunts then this could indicate a common genetic background.
of the dogs with porto-azygous shunts only 27% was male .
no significant sex difference was detected in dogs with a portocaval shunt.
an inherited basis for congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts  has been demonstrated in several small dog breeds.
the correlation between shunt localization, sex, age, dog size and breed were studied.
the remarkable similarity of phenotypic variation in many dog breeds may indicate common underlying genes responsible for ehpss across breeds.
