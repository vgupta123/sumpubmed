the set of conserved genes in r. grahamii comprises some of those that are highly expressed in r. phaseoli on plant roots, suggesting that they play an important role in root colonization.
well conserved nod and nif genes were found in r. grahamii and r. mesoamericanum with some differences.
variable degrees of nucleotide identity and gene content conservation were found among the different r. grahamii ccge <dig> replicons in comparison to r. mesoamericanum genomes.
the ccge <dig> genome comprises one chromosome and two extrachromosomal replicons , prgrccge502a and prgrccge502b.
the extrachromosomal replicons from r. grahamii were more similar to those found in phylogenetically related rhizobium species.
r. grahamii has a broad-host-range that includes leucaena leucocephala and phaseolus vulgaris, although it is a poor competitor for p. vulgaris nodulation in the presence of rhizobium etli or rhizobium phaseoli strains.
this work analyzed the genome sequence and transfer properties of r. grahamii plasmids.
genome sequence was obtained from r. grahamii ccge <dig> type strain isolated from dalea leporina in mexico.
regarding conjugative transfer we were unable to transfer the r. grahamii ccge <dig> symbiotic plasmid and its megaplasmid to other rhizobial hosts but we could transfer the symbiotic plasmid to agrobacterium tumefaciens with transfer dependent on homoserine lactones.
however, limited similarities of r. grahamii ccge <dig> symbiotic plasmid and megaplasmid were observed in other more distant rhizobium species.
the genomic comparison of ers from this group showed that gene content is more variable than average nucleotide identity .
rhizobium grahamii belongs to a new phylogenetic group of rhizobia together with rhizobium mesoamericanum and other species.
