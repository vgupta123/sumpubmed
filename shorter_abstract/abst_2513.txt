differential gene expression observed in monocytic differentiation is primarily regulated by interacting transcription factors .
current research suggests that micrornas  degrade and repress translation of mrna, but also may target genes involved in differentiation.
our analysis identified  <dig> tfs that potentially play a central role in regulating mirnas throughout the differentiation process.
subsequently, we have identified  <dig> candidate key controllers of mirnas during this differentiation process.
we focus on getting insights into the transcriptional circuitry regulating mirna genes expressed during monocytic differentiation.
we computationally analysed the transcriptional circuitry of mirna genes during monocytic differentiation using in vitro time-course expression data for tfs and mirnas.
time-lagged expression correlation analysis was utilised to evaluate the tf→mirna associations.
a set of tf→mirna associations was derived from predicted tf binding sites in promoter regions of mirna genes.
furthermore, it is the first study to decipher on a large-scale, how mirnas are controlled by tfs during human monocytic differentiation.
six of these  <dig> tfs  have not previously been described to be important for monocytic differentiation.
the remaining six tfs are cebpb, creb <dig>  elk <dig>  nfe2l <dig>  runx <dig>  and usf <dig>  for several mirnas , we show how their inferred transcriptional regulation impacts monocytic differentiation.
