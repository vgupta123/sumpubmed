normal mice received saline for all injections.
exogenous ogf or endogenous ogf following ldn suppressed t and b lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes of mog-immunized mice.
periodically over a  <dig> week period, spleens and inguinal lymph nodes were removed, total lymphocytes counted, and subpopulations of cd4+ and cd8+ specific t-cells, as well as b lymphocytes, were determined by flow cytometry.
ogf or ldn repress proliferation of cd4+ and cd8+t cells and b220+ b lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes of immunized mice within a week of immunization.
on day  <dig> of treatment, lumbar spinal cord tissue was removed; cns lymphocytes isolated, and assayed for th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> markers by flow cytometry.
proliferation of t and b cells located in peripheral lymph tissues such as spleen and inguinal lymph nodes of c57bl/6j mice are stimulated.
these data provide novel mechanistic pathways underlying the efficacy of ogf and ldn therapy for ms.
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , an animal model of multiple sclerosis, is induced by immunization of mice with myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein  injections, and after  <dig> days, mice develop behavioral signs of chronic progressive eae.

eae mice treated with ogf for  <dig> days displayed elevated th <dig> and th <dig> cells; no subpopulations of th2-specific t cells were noted.
in addition to repressed behavioral profiles, spinal cord neuropathology is diminished in mice treated with ogf or low dosages of naltrexone .
