tuberculosis, caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis or mycobacterium bovis, remains one of the leading infectious diseases worldwide.

to study the mechanisms employed by highly virulent mycobacteria to promote their intracellular survival, we investigated modulating effects of two pathogenic m. bovis isolates and a reference m. tuberculosis h37rv strain, differing in their ability to multiply in macrophages, on activation phenotypes of the cells primed with major cytokines regulating proinflammatory macrophage activity.
this strain induced weaker secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, coinciding with higher expression of m <dig> cell markers, mannose receptor  and arginase- <dig> .
treatment of macrophages with ifn-γ and infection by the strains b <dig> and h37rv synergistically induced m <dig> polarization, leading to high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression, and reduced expression of the arg- <dig>  in contrast, the cells infected with the strain mp287/ <dig> expressed high levels of arg- <dig> which competed with inos for the common substrate arginine, leading to lower levels of no production.
pathogenic mycobacteria can survive the hostile environment of the phagosome through interference with activation of bactericidal responses.
bactericidal functions of phagocytes are strictly dependent on activation status of these cells, regulated by the infecting agent and cytokines.
