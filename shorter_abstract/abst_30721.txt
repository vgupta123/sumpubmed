with an abundant amount of microarray gene expression data sets available through public repositories, new possibilities lie in combining multiple existing data sets.
we present the newly released insilicomerging r/bioconductor package which, together with the earlier released insilicodb r/bioconductor package, allows consistent retrieval, integration and analysis of publicly available microarray gene expression data sets.
by providing  access to uniformly curated and preprocessed data,  a collection of techniques to remove the batch effects between data sets from different sources, and  several validation tools enabling the inspection of the integration process, these packages enable researchers to fully explore the potential of combining gene expression data for downstream analysis.
