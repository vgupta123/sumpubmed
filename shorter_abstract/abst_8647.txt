ihc results confirm a correlation between inflammation and tfeb expression in c57bl/ <dig> mice.
in contrast, kitw/kitw-v mice did not exhibit inflammation in response to par activation.
emsa results confirmed the increased tfeb binding activity in c57bl/ <dig> but not in kitw/kitw-v mice.
as tfeb belongs to a family of tfs essential for mast cell survival, our findings suggest that this molecule may influence the participation of mast cells in par-mediated inflammation and that targeting tfeb/mitf activity may be a novel approach for the treatment of bladder inflammatory disorders.
as mast cells seem to play a fundamental role in bladder inflammation, we determined whether c-kit receptor deficient  mice have an abrogated response to par stimulation.
all four pars are present in the urinary bladder, and their expression is altered during inflammation.
in order to search for therapeutic targets other than the receptors themselves, we set forth to determine tfs downstream of par activation in the c57bl/ <dig> urinary bladders.
this is the first report describing the increased expression of tfeb in bladder inflammation in response to par activation.
for this purpose, we used a protein/dna combo array containing  <dig> different tf consensus sequences.
finally, tfeb antibody was used for chip/q-pcr assay and revealed up-regulation of genes known to be downstream of tfeb.
tfeb, a member of the mitf family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper, was the only tf commonly up-regulated by all par-aps.
