the mutation was not found in homozygous state in  <dig>  animals  and is thus likely to cause lethality of homozygous embryos.
exploiting comprehensive genotype and sequence data enabled us to reveal two deleterious alleles in slc2a <dig> and sugt <dig> that compromise pre- and postnatal survival in homozygous state.
our results provide the basis for genome-assisted approaches to avoiding inadvertent carrier matings and to improving reproductive and rearing success in fleckvieh cattle.
the mutation leads to premature termination of translation and activates cryptic splice sites resulting in multiple exon variants also with premature translation termination.
the affected calves exhibit stunted growth, resembling the phenotypic appearance of fanconi-bickel syndrome in humans , which is also caused by mutations in slc2a <dig>

a mutation causing an evolutionarily unlikely substitution in sugt <dig> was perfectly associated with a haplotype compromising insemination success.
a frameshift mutation in slc2a <dig> encoding glucose transporter  <dig>  compromises calf survival.
a scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency in  <dig>  fleckvieh cattle uncovered four haplotypes affecting reproductive and rearing success.
exploiting whole-genome resequencing data from  <dig> animals facilitated to pinpoint putatively causal mutations in two of these haplotypes.
