our work described the srna profiles of pear winter buds during dormant phase transition, showing that dormancy release is a highly coordinated physiological process involving the regulation of srnas.
we also characterized a multifunctional mirna precursor mir <dig>  which produces two functional mir <dig> transcripts, namely mir <dig>  and mir <dig> ; cleavage events were predominantly mediated by the non-conserved variant mir <dig>  rather than the conserved variant mir <dig> .
in this study, we analyzed the srnaome of japanese pear flower buds in endodormant and ecodormant stages over two seasons by implementing of rna-seq and degradome-sequencing.
a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the endodormancy phase transition is necessary for developing countermeasures against the effects of global warming.
in woody perennial plants, including deciduous fruit trees, such as pear, endodormancy is a strategy for surviving the cold winter.
on the contrast,  <dig> of  <dig>  loci that produced srnas were differentially expressed between endodormancy and ecodormancy, suggesting their potential roles on the phase transition from endodormancy to ecodomancy.
we analyzed the srnaome of pear flower bud during dormant phase transition.
finally, we showed that a tas <dig> trans-acting sirna triggered phased sirna within the orf of one of its target genes, auxin response factor  <dig>  via the analysis of phased sirna loci, indicating that sirnas are able to trigger phased sirnas in pear.
however, none of the conserved micrornas or pear-specific mirnas was differentially expressed between endodormancy and ecodormancy stages.
we identified  <dig> conserved or less conserved mirnas and  <dig> pear-specific mirnas.
