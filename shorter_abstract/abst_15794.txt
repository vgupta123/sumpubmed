based on these results, we propose a protocol to identify and confirm shorter exonic cnvs combining computational prediction algorithms and custom acgh experiments.
with advances in next generation sequencing technologies and genomic capture techniques, exome sequencing has become a cost-effective approach for mutation detection in genetic diseases.
we also tested these predictions using a custom array targeting exons.
we used six published cnv prediction programs  and an in-house modification to exomecopy and exomedepth  for computational cnv prediction on  <dig> exomes from the  <dig> genomes project and  <dig> exomes from primary immunodeficiency patients.
the goal of our study was to develop a protocol to detect exonic cnvs , combining computational prediction algorithms and a high-resolution custom cgh array.
however, computational prediction of copy number variants  from exome sequence data is a challenging task.
finally, the performance of each computational program was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and false positive rate.
additionally, exonic cnv discovery using standard acgh has limitations due to the low probe density over exonic regions.
after this validation, we next evaluated the computational prediction of shorter cnvs.
exomecopy and the in-house modified algorithm, excopydepth, showed the highest capability in detecting shorter cnvs.
cnv predictions were tested using a custom cgh array designed to capture all exons .
