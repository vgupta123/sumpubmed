analysis with known cres and all possible hexanucleotides showed that some functional elements gather close to the transcription and translation initiation sites and that elements other than the tata-box motif are conserved between eukaryote promoters.
using differentially aligned datasets from the model species arabidopsis thaliana, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and saccharomyces cerevisiae, we convincingly demonstrated the importance of the position and orientation for motif discovery.
furthermore, with the information on positional enrichment of a motif or a known functional cre, it is possible to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears to function.
while a high background frequency usually decreases the effectiveness of such an enumerative investigation, we improved our analysis by conducting motif distribution maps using large datasets.
this in turn might accelerate the in depth examination of known and yet unknown cis-regulatory sequences in the laboratory.
