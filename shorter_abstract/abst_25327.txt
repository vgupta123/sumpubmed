tyrosine phosphorylation of rhogdiα by fer prevented subsequent binding of rac to rhogdiα, but once a rhogdiα-rac complex was formed, the fer kinase was not able to cause rac release through tyrosine phosphorylation of preformed rhogdiα-rac complexes.
these results identify tyrosine phosphorylation of rhogdiα by fer as a mechanism to regulate binding of rhogdiα to rac.
activation of fer by reactive oxygen species caused increased phosphorylation of rhogdiα and pervanadate treatment further augmented this.
we report that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase fer is able to phosphorylate rhogdiα and form a direct protein complex with it.
this interaction is mediated by the c-terminal end of rhogdiα.
