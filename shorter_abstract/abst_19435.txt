membrane proteins are estimated to represent about 25% of open reading frames in fully sequenced genomes.
additionally, it has been able to retrieve ipm anchors in naively tested sets of transmembrane proteins .
this type of membrane anchor is still poorly understood and no suitable prediction method is currently available.
we report here the "amphipaseek" method developed to predict ipm anchors.
considerable efforts have thus been made to develop prediction methods.
alternatively, a membrane protein can be monotopic and anchored via an amphipathic helix inserted in a parallel way to the membrane interface, so-called in-plane membrane  anchors.
the method is based on a pattern recognition support vector machine with a dedicated kernel.
