the most likely mechanism of cold-shock induced androgenesis is an elimination of the egg nucleus together along with the second polar body and subsequent development of a decondensed sperm nucleus or male pronucleus.
in this paper, we demonstrate that cold-shock treatment  of loach eggs for  <dig> min just after fertilization successfully induces androgenetic haploid development.
nuclear behavior after the cold-shock treatment was traced by microscopic observation of dapi -stained samples and hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections, and the extrusion of egg  nucleus was observed in eggs treated in the optimum timing.
while a few of them were the normal diploid, most of them turned out to be abnormal haploid.
when the eggs of wild-type females were fertilized with sperm of albino or orange phenotype males and cold-shocked at  <dig> to 3Â°c for  <dig> min duration just after fertilization, generally more than 30%  of the hatched progeny were androgenotes.
in fish, the conventional technique for induced androgenesis has been applied for rapid fixation to traits, recovery of cryopreserved genotypes, sex-control, etc.
all-male inheritance was verified by the expression of the recessive color trait  and microsatellite genotypes comprising only paternally derived alleles.
