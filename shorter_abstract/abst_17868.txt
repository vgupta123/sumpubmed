features include visualisation of results from multiple predictors within proteins in one plot, genome-wide analysis and estimates of epitope conservation.
however there is currently no convenient way to access the results from multiple methods at the same time or to execute predictions for an entire proteome at once.
we present a self contained web application, epitopemap, for calculating and viewing epitope predictions with multiple methods.
we designed a web application that allows integration of multiple epitope prediction methods for any number of proteins in a genome.
