a b. saltans genome sequence will provide a free-living comparison with parasitic genomes necessary for comparative analyses of existing and future trypanosomatid genomic resources.
although synteny was typically conserved for those genes with trypanosomatid homologs, strict colinearity was rarely observed because gene order was regularly disrupted by bodo-specific genes.
a complete genome sequence will provide an effective ancestral model for understanding the shared and derived features of known trypanosomatid genomes, but it will also identify those kinetoplastid genome features lost during the evolution of parasitism.
structural similarities suggest that its assembly should be solvable, and, although de novo assembly will be necessary, existing trypanosomatid projects will provide some guide to annotation.
various coding regions were sequenced to provide a preliminary insight into the bodonid genome sequence, relative to trypanosomatid sequences.
bodo saltans is a free-living kinetoplastid and among the closest relatives of the trypanosomatid parasites, which cause such human diseases as african sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and chagas disease.
<dig>  mbp of b. saltans genome was sequenced from  <dig> distinct regions and contained  <dig> coding sequences.
the b. saltans genome contains both sequences homologous to trypanosomatids and sequences never seen before.
intergenic sequences were typically short, resulting in higher gene density than in trypanosomatids.
