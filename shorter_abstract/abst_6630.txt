by proposing a new visualization environment to analyse repeated sequences, this application aims to increase the efficiency of laboratories involved in investigating repeat organization in single genomes or across several genomes.
the application projects data from a repeat index file on the analysed sequences, and by combining this principle with a query system, is capable of locating repeated sequences with specific properties.
a large number of studies on genome sequences have revealed the major role played by repeated sequences in the structure, function, dynamics and evolution of genomes.
in-depth repeat analysis requires specialized methods, including visualization techniques, to achieve optimum exploratory power.
this article presents pygram, a new visualization application for investigating the organization of repeated sequences in complete genome sequences.
implementation of the complete configuration is illustrated in an analysis of crispr structures in archaea genomes and the detection of horizontal transfer between archaea and viruses.
