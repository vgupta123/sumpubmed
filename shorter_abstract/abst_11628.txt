bioinformatics analysis reveals important changes in muscle metabolism, in particular, in glucose and glycogen utilisation, and activation of the starvation response which affects aminoacid and lipid metabolism.
mutations in the gene encoding thymidine kinase  <dig>  result in the myopathic form of mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome which is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy presenting in children.
we have analysed the whole transcriptome of skeletal muscle from patients with tk <dig> mutations and compared it to normal muscle and to muscle from patients with other mitochondrial myopathies.
in order to unveil some of the mechanisms involved in this pathology and to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets we have investigated the gene expression profile of human skeletal muscle deficient for tk <dig> using cdna microarrays.

we have identified those transcriptional regulators which are likely to be responsible for the observed changes in gene expression.
we propose that gdf- <dig> may represent a potential novel biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction although further studies are required.
