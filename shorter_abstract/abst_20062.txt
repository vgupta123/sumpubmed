the reproducibility of transcriptomic biomarkers across datasets remains poor, limiting clinical application.
while further research is required, this approach has the potential to become a standard for transcriptomic biomarkers.
importantly, ensemble classification improves biomarkers with initially good results but does not result in spuriously improved performance for poor biomarkers.
to test this hypothesis, we systematically assessed the effects of pre-processing on biomarker classification using  <dig> different pre-processing methods and  <dig> distinct signatures of tumour hypoxia in  <dig> datasets .
importantly, exploiting different pre-processing techniques in an ensemble technique improved classification for a majority of signatures.
