the markers show high pic values and therefore will be useful for cultivar identification, taxonomic studies, and genetic mapping.
the study further shows that mining ests is a highly efficient strategy for polymorphism detection within the cultivated cassava gene pool.
the repertoire of simple sequence repeat  markers for cassava is limited and warrants a need for a larger number of polymorphic ssrs for germplasm characterization and breeding applications.
a total of  <dig> putative microsatellites were identified in silico from an  <dig>  cassava unigene set with an average density of one ssr every  <dig> kb.
of  <dig> markers with clean amplification products,  <dig>  displayed polymorphism based on high resolution agarose gels.
of  <dig> est-ssr markers screened,  <dig>  amplified alleles from one or more wild species  whereas  <dig>  amplified alleles from castor bean and  <dig>  amplified alleles from leafy spurge; hence nearly all markers were transferable to wild relatives of m esculenta while only a fraction was transferable to the more distantly related taxa.
a set of  <dig> new, unique polymorphic est-ssrs was developed and characterized which extends the repertoire of ssr markers for cultivated cassava and its wild relatives.
one hundred and ninety-two candidate ssrs were screened for polymorphism among a panel of cassava cultivars from africa, latin america and asia, four wild manihot species as well as two other important taxa in the euphorbiaceae, leafy spurge  and castor bean .
cassava , a starchy root crop grown in tropical and subtropical climates, is the sixth most important crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize, potato and barley.
