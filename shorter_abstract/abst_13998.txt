our findings demonstrate that irf <dig> regulates the expression of genes involved in antiviral immunity, inflammation, and the response to oxidative stress during hrv infections in hbe cells, and also suggests that other transcription factors play a major role in this response.
a subset of genes identified in the microarray study were validated at the mrna and/or protein level using real time rt-qpcr, elisa, and western blots.
the aim of this study was to employ microarray profiling, upstream regulator analysis, and sirna mediated gene silencing to further our understanding of the role of interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  in this response.
upstream regulator analysis of these data suggested that irf <dig> was a major molecular driver of this response.
upstream regulator analysis of the part of the response that was insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown suggested it was driven by nf-κb, stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and irf <dig>
airway epithelial cells are the primary site for hrv infection and replication, and the initiation of host inflammatory responses.
at present, the molecular mechanisms that underpin hrv responses in airway epithelial cells are incompletely understood.

the cells were allowed to recover, and then cultured in the presence or absence of hrv- <dig> for 24 h. global patterns of gene expression were profiled on microarrays.
however, the majority of genes that were perturbed by hrv in hbe cells including those that are known to be regulated by irf <dig> were insensitive to irf <dig> knockdown.
hundreds of genes were upregulated in hbe during hrv infection.
pathways analysis demonstrated that these genes were mainly involved in type i and ii interferon signaling, rig-i/mda <dig> signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis.
knockdown of irf <dig> reduced the hrv-driven upregulation of genes involved in antiviral responses , and increased the expression of genes that promote inflammation  and the response to oxidative stress.
