in addition, the seven vhhs could inhibit the haemagglutination activity of different ndv strains.
the seven vhhs may have great potential for ndv diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapeutics.
in this study, a vhh yeast two-hybrid library was constructed from ndv vaccine immunized c. bactrianus, and seven vhh fragments to the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase  protein of ndv were successfully screened and characterized for the first time.
elisa, dot blot, immunocytochemistry and pull down results showed that the screened vhhs could interact with ndv virion, among which five had neutralizing activity.
these selected vhh clones were all expressed as soluble protein in e. coli.
newcastle disease , which is caused by the newcastle disease virus , is one of the most important avian diseases in poultry.

the comparatively small size, high affinity, high solubility, low immunogenicity and ability to bind epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies of vhh make them ideal candidates for a considerable number of therapeutic and biotechnological applications.
the variable domains of the heavy chain of the heavy-chain antibodies  are the smallest naturally occurring antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies.
we constructed an ndv-immunized vhh yeast two-hybrid library and screened and characterized seven vhhs targeting ndv hn protein for the first time.
although a stringent vaccination policy is widely adopted to control nd, nd outbreaks still occur, and virulent ndv is sporadically isolated from chickens and wild birds.
since its discovery in  <dig>  nd has caused great economic losses to the world poultry industry and remains a threat to chickens and wild birds.
