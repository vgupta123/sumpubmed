we have applied protonet, an unsupervised hierarchical protein clustering method that covers about  <dig> million sequences, for automatic annotation of the daphnia's proteome.
functional annotations were successfully assigned for 86% of the proteins.
<dig> %  of the daphnia full-length proteins were successfully mapped to  <dig>  protonet stable clusters, and only  <dig> % remained unmapped.
the crustaceans and insects have diverged from a common ancestor.
we focused on gene amplification as a leading strategy of the daphnia in coping with environmental toxicity.
it is a model organism for studying the molecular makeup for coping with the environmental challenges.
daphnia pulex  is the first fully sequenced crustacean genome.
