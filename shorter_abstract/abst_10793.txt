typical methods to perform these predictions are  flux balance analysis, which is based on the assumption that cell behaviour is optimal, and  metabolic flux analysis, which combines the model with experimental measurements.
the methodology can be cast as linear programming problems, able to handle thousands of variables with efficiency, so it is suitable to deal with large-scale networks.
herein we discuss a possibilistic framework to perform metabolic flux estimations using a constraint-based model and a set of measurements.
we introduce a possibilistic framework for the estimation of metabolic fluxes, which is shown to be flexible, reliable, usable in scenarios lacking data and computationally efficient.
the methodology is able to handle inconsistencies, by considering sensors errors and model imprecision, to provide rich and reliable flux estimations.
moreover, the possibilistic estimation does not attempt necessarily to predict the actual fluxes with precision, but rather to exploit the available data – even if those are scarce – to distinguish possible from impossible flux states in a gradual way.
