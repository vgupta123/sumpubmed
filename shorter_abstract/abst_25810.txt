our results demonstrate that atgai mrna can move from companion cells to sieve tubes and that the translated product remains at the sites to which it is transported, resulting in attenuation of ga responses by reducing the expression of many genes.
as the gai transcript is transportable in phloem elements, a Î”-della gai  transgenic stock plant can reduce the stature of a scion through transport of gai mrna from the stock.
microarray analysis to clarify the effect of the cgt stock on the gene expression pattern in the scion clearly revealed that the wt scions on cgt stocks had fewer genes whose expression was altered in response to ga treatment.
the coymvp:atgai-t <dig>  transgenic nicotiana benthamiana exhibited a dwarf phenotype and lower sensitivity to ga enhancement of shoot stature.
the induction of semi-dwarfism in an apple cultivar on root stock harbouring atgai suggests that long-distance transport of mrna from grafts would be applicable to horticulture crops.
deletion of the della domain results in constitutive suppression of ga signaling.
a wild-type  scion on a cgt stock contained both atgai-t <dig> mrna and the translated product.
