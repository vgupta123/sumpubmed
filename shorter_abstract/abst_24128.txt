a time-kill assay showed that the baer deletion mutant showed an approximate 1-log <dig> reduction in colony forming units  relative to the wild-type strain when the tigecycline concentration was  <dig>  μg/ml throughout the assay period.
increasing the tigecycline concentration to  <dig>  μg/ml produced an even more marked  <dig> -log <dig> reduction in cfus of the baer deletion mutant at 8 h, while only a  <dig> -log <dig> reduction was observed for the wild-type strain.
tigecycline resistance in acinetobacter baumannii is primarily acquired through overexpression of the adeabc efflux pump.
in this study, we found that the tcs genes baer and baes are co-transcribed and function as stress responders under high osmotic conditions.
taken together, these data show for the first time that the baesr tcs influences the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii through the positive regulation of the resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump genes adea and adeb.
in contrast, the overexpression of baer resulted in a doubled tigecycline mic, with a more than 2-fold increase in adea and adeb expression.
the baesr and adeab genes showed increased transcription in both the laboratory-induced and clinical tigecycline-resistant strains compared with the wild-type strain.
the deletion of baer in the atcc  <dig> strain led to 67–73% and 68% reduction in adea and adeb expression, respectively, with a resultant 2-fold decrease in the tigecycline minimal inhibition concentration .
