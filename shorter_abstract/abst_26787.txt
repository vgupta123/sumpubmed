here, we describe a multilocus sequence analysis  of  <dig> of the most highly studied reference strains and clinical isolates of t. denticola; which were originally isolated from subgingival plaque samples taken from subjects from china, japan, the netherlands, canada and the usa.

although the biological or phenotypic properties of a significant number of t. denticola isolates have been reported in the literature, their genetic diversity or phylogeny has never been systematically investigated.
our methodology and results establish a genetic framework for the discrimination and phylogenetic analysis of t. denticola isolates, which will greatly assist future biological and epidemiological investigations involving this putative ‘periodontopathogen’.
sequence data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic and phylogenetic software tools.
phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated protein-encoding gene sequence data  using bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches indicated that the t. denticola strains were monophyletic, and formed  <dig> well-defined clades.
our analyses indicate that previous biological and biophysical investigations have predominantly focused on a subset of t. denticola strains with a relatively narrow range of genetic diversity.
no specific geographical relationships could be established; but several strains isolated from different continents appear to be closely related at the genetic level.
all analyzed t. denticola strains appeared to have a genetic origin distinct from that of ‘treponema vincentii’ or treponema pallidum.
the oral spirochete bacterium treponema denticola is associated with both the incidence and severity of periodontal disease.
