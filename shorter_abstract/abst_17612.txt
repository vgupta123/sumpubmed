moreover, we also identified a new cnvr , encoding the sortilin-related receptor gene, with copy number changes in only black-bone chicken.
in addition, we employed quantitative pcr  to further validate several copy number variable genes, such as prolactin receptor, endothelin  <dig> , suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  cd8a molecule, with important functions, and the results suggested that edn <dig> might be a molecular marker for the selection of dark skin color in poultry production.
a recently recognized aspect of genomic structural variation, called copy number variation , is gaining interest in chicken genomic studies.
a total of  <dig> copy number variation regions  were identified, covering  <dig>  mb of polymorphic sequences or  <dig> % of the entire chicken genome.
these results provide additional information for understanding genomic variation and related phenotypic characteristics.
the functional annotation of cnvrs indicated that these regions completely or partially overlapped with  <dig> genes and  <dig> quantitative traits loci, suggesting these cnvs have important functions and might be promising resources for exploring differences among various breeds.
using a commercial 385 k array-based comparative genomic hybridization  genome array, we performed cnv discovery using  <dig> chicken samples from four local chinese breeds and the french breed houdan chicken.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the pattern and functional characterization of cnvs in five characteristic chicken breeds, which will be important for future studies associating phenotype with chicken genome architecture.
here, we report a genome-wide analysis of the cnvs in five chicken breeds using acgh.
the association between edn <dig> and melanoblast proliferation was further confirmed using qpcr.
