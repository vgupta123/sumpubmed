based on these analyses, we selected  <dig> genes to study their ability to normalize qrt-pcr data.
we generated a cdna library containing expressed sequence tags  from adult b. amphitrite.
we also present a systematic validation of potential reference genes for normalization of quantitative real-time pcr  data obtained from different developmental stages of this animal.
these software programs produced highly comparable results, with the most stable gene being mt-cyb, while tuba, tubb and cp <dig> were clearly unsuitable for data normalization.
we developed a qrt-pcr assay to determine the most reliable reference genes.
although many aspects of its biology have been elucidated, the lack of genetic information is impeding a molecular understanding of its life cycle.
as part of a wider multidisciplinary approach to reveal the biogenic cues influencing barnacle settlement and metamorphosis, we have sequenced and annotated the first cdna library for b. amphitrite.
the collection of b. amphitrite ests and their annotation has been made publically available representing an important resource for both basic and applied research on this species.
balanus amphitrite is a barnacle commonly used in biofouling research.
total rna extracted from  <dig> developmental stages was reverse transcribed and the expression stability of the selected genes was compared using genorm,  bestkeeper and normfinder.
a total of  <dig> unique sequences  were derived from  <dig> reliable unidirectionally sequenced ests.
transcripts encoding cytochrome b and nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> were expressed most stably, although other genes also performed well and could prove useful to normalize gene expression studies.
