the k-mer spectrum-based measure was found to behave similarly to one based on mapping to a reference gene catalog, but different from one using a genome catalog.
here we evaluated a metagenomic pairwise dissimilarity measure based on short k-mer spectrum using the example of human gut microbiota, a biomedically significant object of study.
dissimilarity measure based on k-mer spectrum provides a wider perspective in comparison with the ones based on the alignment against reference sequence sets.
we developed a method for calculating pairwise dissimilarity  of “shotgun” metagenomes based on short k-mer spectra .
our approach allows rapid estimation of pairwise dissimilarity between metagenomes.
a rapidly increasing flow of genomic data requires the development of efficient methods for obtaining its compact representation.
it helps not to miss possible outstanding features of metagenomic composition, particularly related to the presence of an unknown bacteria, virus or eukaryote, as well as to technical artifacts  at the early stages of bioinformatic analysis.
this difference turned out to be associated with a significant presence of viral reads in a number of metagenomes.
simulations showed limited impact of bacterial genetic variability as well as sequencing errors on k-mer spectra.
