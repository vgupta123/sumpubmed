this method appears to efficiently discover network models which not only identify connections between the disease and key features, but also organizes relationships between features--and furthermore creates a stable classifier that categorizes new data at predicted error rates.
in addition, when used to classify new data, these feature sets are far more consistent than those produced by many traditional techniques.
verification of results using withheld data showed excellent predictive power.
the method was applied to artificial data with known feature relationships and typical tof-ms variability introduced, and was able to recover those relationships nearly perfectly.
the relationships discovered between features allowed preliminary identification of a protein biomarker which was consistent with other cancer studies and later verified experimentally.
unfortunately, this potential has largely been unrealized to date due to the high variability of measurements, uncertainties in the distribution of proteins in a given population, and the difficulty of extracting repeatable diagnostic markers using current statistical tools.
the network structure provides additional information about the relationships among features that is useful to guide further biochemical analysis.
