moreover, the backbone dihedral angles, highly correlated with secondary structures, provide crucial information about the local three-dimensional structure.
we predict independently both the secondary structure and the backbone dihedral angles and combine the results in a loop to enhance each prediction reciprocally.
we have created an accurate predictor of backbone dihedral angles and secondary structure.
the prediction of the secondary structure of a protein is a critical step in the prediction of its tertiary structure and, potentially, its function.
support vector machines, a state-of-the-art supervised classification technique, achieve secondary structure predictive accuracy of 80% on a non-redundant set of  <dig> proteins, significantly higher than other methods on the same dataset.
our method, called disspred, is available online at http://comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/disspred/.
