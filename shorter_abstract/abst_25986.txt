while identifying these networks, we found that current cnvr and snp-based haplotype maps in mice represented distinct sources of genetic variation contributing to expression variation, implying that mapping studies utilizing either source alone will have reduced sensitivity.
more than  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant strains and were highly enriched in the apoptotic program, but it remained unclear which genes, if any, contribute directly to t-aml susceptibility.
an improved understanding of susceptibility factors and the biological processes in which they act may lead to the development of t-aml prevention strategies.
therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  is a secondary, generally incurable, malignancy attributable to chemotherapy exposure.
we found that the pre-exposure transcriptional state of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells predicts susceptibility status.
to address this issue, we integrated gene expression data with genetic information, including single nucleotide polymorphisms  and dna copy number variants , to identify genetic networks underlying t-aml susceptibility.
the  <dig> t-aml susceptibility networks we found are robust: they were validated in independent, previously published expression data, and different analytical methods converge on them.
although there is a genetic component to t-aml susceptibility in mice, the relevant loci and the mechanism by which they contribute to t-aml are largely unknown.
further, the networks are enriched in genes involved in cell cycle and dna repair , suggesting that these processes contribute to t-aml susceptibility.
