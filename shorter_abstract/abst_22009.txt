the new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many different cancer data sets with measured dna methylation or gene expression.
we introduce a new method for robust prediction of phenotypes from molecular measurements such as dna methylation or gene expression.
applied to a leukemia data set, our method finds several ribosomal proteins associated with the risk group, which might be interesting targets for follow-up studies.
molecular measurements from cancer patients such as gene expression and dna methylation can be influenced by several external factors.
