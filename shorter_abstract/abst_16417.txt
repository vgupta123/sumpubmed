almost ~42 % and ~25 % of predicted putative homologies by inparanoid and hamstr respectively were classified as false positives on experimental data set.
we demonstrate that our machine learning method trained on both known homology clusters obtained from orthodb and randomly generated sequence alignments , successfully determines apparent false positives inferred by heuristic algorithms especially among proteomes recovered from low-coverage rna-seq data.
in this paper we develop biologically informative features that can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments of putative homologous genes  and further utilized in context of guided experimentation to verify false positive outcomes.
our process increases the quality of output from other clustering algorithms by providing a novel post-processing method that is both fast and efficient at removing low quality clusters of putative homologous genes recovered by heuristic-based approaches.
accurate detection of homologous relationships of biological sequences  amongst organisms is an important and often difficult task that is essential to various evolutionary studies, ranging from building phylogenies to predicting functional gene annotations.
