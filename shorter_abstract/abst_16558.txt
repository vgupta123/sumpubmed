given the role of norepinephrine  in attentional processes, we examined the forebrain ne systems from prenatal cocaine exposed rats.
these data suggest that prenatal cocaine exposure results in a persistent alteration in forebrain ne systems as indicated by alterations in receptor density.
prenatal cocaine exposure produces attentional deficits which to persist through early childhood.
these neurochemical changes may underlie behavioral abnormalities observed in offspring attentional processes following prenatal exposure to cocaine.
sex-specific alterations of α2-ar were found in the hippocampus and amygdala of the cocaine-exposed animals, as well as an upregulation of α2-ar in parietal cortex.
