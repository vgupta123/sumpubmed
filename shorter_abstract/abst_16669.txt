a novel model reduction technique allows the significant reduction and modularization of these models.
the developed methods are used to reduce a model of egf and insulin receptor crosstalk comprising  <dig>  ordinary differential equations  to a model with  <dig> odes.
receptors and scaffold proteins usually possess a high number of distinct binding domains inducing the formation of large multiprotein signaling complexes.
for instance, we provide techniques to handle the formation of multi-scaffold complexes as well as receptor dimerization.
the methods, presented in this contribution, significantly enhance the available methods to exactly reduce models of combinatorial reaction networks.
furthermore, we discuss a new modeling approach that allows the direct generation of exactly reduced model structures.
