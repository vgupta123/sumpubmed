a computation of the mutual information matrix for a sequence alignment in fasta-format is possible.
selective pressure in molecular evolution leads to uneven distributions of amino acids and nucleotides.
to quantify these correlations the mutual information -after proper normalization - has proven most effective.
to visually analyze mutual information we developed a matrix visualization tool that allows different views on the mutual information matrix: filtering, sorting, and weighting are among them.
the respective stand-alone program computes in addition proper normalizations for a null model of neutral evolution and maps the mutual information to z-scores with respect to the null model.
the software can also be used for visual analysis of other matrix-like data, such as information obtained by dna microarray experiments.
