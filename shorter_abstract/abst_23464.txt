we studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic uk cats using results of a real time pcr assay for  <dig> enteropathogenic species; feline coronavirus , feline panleukopenia virus , clostridium perfringens , salmonella enterica , giardia spp.
multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats, and case management needs to take this into account.
individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described, but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis.
mean  enteropathogen co-infection  <dig>  , was significantly higher in pedigree cats  compared to dsh  and decreased with age .
, tritrichomonas foetus , cryptosporidium spp.
prevalence of co, gi and tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats  and prevalence decreased with increasing age for co, pa, gi, cr and tr.
when exact combinations of co-infection were examined, tr tended to be found in combinations with co, cl, and gi.
