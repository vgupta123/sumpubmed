they were randomly divided into the i/s group , the e/s group , the i/p group , and the e/p group .
these results suggest that the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory function and bdnf mrna levels were different, molar loss may have a greater long-term effect on memory ability than powder diet does.
here we examined the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory ability and the expression of bdnf mrna in the hippocampus of adult c57bl/6j mice.
whereas, the powder diet had no effect on memory function and bdnf mrna level even at 16 weeks later.

it is known that tooth loss is known to be a risk factor for alzheimer’s disease and soft diet feeding induces memory impairment.
recent studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor  is associated with tooth loss or soft diet in young animal model, and that bdnf expression is decreased in patients with alzheimer’s disease.
however, single or combined effect of tooth loss and/or soft diet on brain function has not fully understood.
to analyze the memory ability, the step-through passive avoidance test was conducted.
however, at 16 weeks later, e/s and e/p group showed memory impairment, and decreased level of bdnf mrna.
