this condition may better reflect the in vivo gene signature of msc, with potential implications in regenerative medicine.
in the bone marrow, hematopietic and mesenchymal stem cells form a unique niche in which the oxygen tension is low.
the duration of hypoxemia is a critical parameter in the differentiation capacity of msc.
in parallel, msc displayed  inhibition of genes involved in dna metabolism, cell cycle progression and chromosome cohesion whereas transcripts involved in adhesion and metabolism  were stimulated.
compared to normoxic cells, hypoxic cells were morphologically undifferentiated and contained less mitochondrias.
