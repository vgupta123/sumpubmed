its accuracy is similar to bayesian methods but it takes only a fraction of the time.
however a full bayesian analysis is often not feasible due to the large computational time involved.
the accuracy of prediction is comparable to a full bayesian analysis but the em algorithm is considerably faster.
a simulated example of genomic selection from an international workshop is used to demonstrate the features of the em algorithm.
embayesb is a fast and accurate em algorithm for implementing genomic selection and predicting complex traits by mapping qtl in genome-wide dense snp marker data.
the em algorithm was accurate in locating qtl which explained more than 1% of the total genetic variation.
the information provided by dense genome-wide markers using high throughput technology is of considerable potential in human disease studies and livestock breeding programs.
a computational algorithm for very large snp panels is described.
the posterior probability of being in ld with at least one qtl is calculated for each snp along with estimates of the hyperparameters for the mixture prior.
genome-wide association studies relate individual single nucleotide polymorphisms  from dense snp panels to individual measurements of complex traits, with the underlying assumption being that any association is caused by linkage disequilibrium  between snp and quantitative trait loci  affecting the trait.
