evolutionary distance analyses of these duplicated genes indicated two rounds of large scale duplication events had occurred in g. lamblia genome.
gene duplication has long been thought to be the most common mechanism in the production of primary resources for the origin of evolutionary novelties.
in order to parse the evolutionary trajectory of giardia parasitic lifestyle, here we carried out a genome-wide analysis about gene duplication patterns in g. lamblia.
based on the genome-wide analysis of duplicated genes in g. lamblia, we found that gene duplication was essential for the origin and evolution of giardia parasitic lifestyle.
based on evolutionary comparison with their hosts, it was found that the rapid expansion of vsps in g. lamblia is consistent with the evolutionary radiation of placental mammals.
therefore we proposed a hypothesis that the increment of giradia hosts might be the driving force for the rapid expansion of vsps.
the recent expansion of vsps uniquely occurring in g. lamblia is consistent with the increment of its hosts.
much evidence from g. lamblia indicated they might be the most primitive extant eukaryotes.
although genomic comparison showed that in g. lamblia the contents of many fundamental biologic pathways are simplified and the whole genome is very compact, in our study 40% of its genes were identified as duplicated genes.
