commercial two-color platforms seem to have higher power for finding differentially expressed genes between groups with small differences in expression.
the comparability of gene expression data generated with different microarray platforms is still a matter of concern.
here we address the performance and the overlap in the detection of differentially expressed genes for five different microarray platforms in a challenging biological context where differences in gene expression are few and subtle.
gene expression profiles in the hippocampus of five wild-type and five transgenic Î´c-doublecortin-like kinase mice were evaluated with five microarray platforms: applied biosystems, affymetrix, agilent, illumina, lgtc home-spotted arrays.
the different microarray platforms give partially complementary views on biological processes affected.
we demonstrate significant overlap in the affected gene sets identified by the different platforms, although biological processes were represented by only partially overlapping sets of genes.
our data indicate that when analyzing samples with only subtle differences in gene expression the use of two different platforms might be more attractive than increasing the number of replicates.
two genes were found significantly differentially expressed by all platforms and the four genes identified by the abi platform were found by at least three other platforms.
aberrances in gaba-ergic signalling in the transgenic mice were consistently found by all platforms.
using a fixed false discovery rate of 10% we detected surprising differences between the number of differentially expressed genes per platform.
