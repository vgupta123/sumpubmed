phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and subsequent sub- and neo-functionalisation can result in distinct local phylogenetic relationships that are discordant with species phylogeny.
saguaro identifies regions under lineage-specific constraint for the first set, and genomic segments that we attribute to incomplete lineage sorting in the second dataset.
saguaro detects distinct cacti describing local phylogenetic relationships without requiring any a priori hypotheses.
after testing the software on simulated data, we demonstrate the utility of saguaro by testing two different data sets:   <dig> dengue virus strains, and   <dig> primate genomes.
while the hmm determines the genomic boundaries from aligned sequences, the som hypothesises new cacti in an unsupervised and iterative fashion based on the regions that were modelled least well by existing cacti.
we developed saguaro, a combination of a hidden markov model  and a self organising map , to characterise local phylogenetic relationships among aligned sequences using cacti, matrices of pair-wise distance measures.
