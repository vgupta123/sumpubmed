in an effort to better examine diversity among m. ap strains, we used optical mapping to profile genomic variations between strains of m. ap k- <dig>  and m. ap atcc  <dig> .
interestingly, alignment of the optical map of the m. ap atcc  <dig> genome to the complete m. ap k- <dig> genome sequence revealed a 648-kb inversion around the origin of replication.
the optical map of m. ap atcc  <dig> clearly indicated the miss-assembly of the sequenced genome of m. ap k- <dig>  moreover, it identified  <dig> new genes in m. ap k- <dig> genome.
infection of cattle with mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  causes severe economic losses to the dairy industry in the usa and worldwide.
