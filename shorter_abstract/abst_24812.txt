we identified three distinct and well-supported clades within the ecuadorean range of e. ockendeni: an uplands clade spanning north to south, a northeastern and central lowlands clade, and a central and southeastern clade, which is basal.
using bayesian  and net phylogenetic estimates, the southeastern clade diverged from the upland/lowland clades in the mid-miocene or late oligocene.
the forests of the upper amazon basin harbour some of the world's highest anuran species richness, but to date we have only the sparsest understanding of the distribution of genetic diversity within and among species in this region.
our extensive phylogeographic survey thus assesses the spatial distribution of e. ockendeni genetic diversity across eastern ecuador.
clades marginally overlap in some geographic areas  but are reproductively isolated, evidenced by diagnostic differences in microsatellite pcr amplification profiles or dna repeat number and coalescent analyses  best modelled without migration.
our research coupled with other studies suggests that species richness in the upper amazon is drastically underestimated by current inventories based on morphospecies.
lowland and upland clades speciated more recently, in the early or late miocene.
clades are separated by 12% to 15% net corrected p-distance for cytochrome b, with comparatively low sequence divergence within clades.
our findings uncover previously unsuspected cryptic species diversity within the common leaflitter frog e. ockendeni, with at least three different species in ecuador.
