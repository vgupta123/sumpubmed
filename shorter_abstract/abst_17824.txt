our results suggest that as <dig> can modulate 5s rrna levels, giving it the potential to affect chloroplast translation and plant growth.
analysis of as <dig> transcripts revealed four distinct species in wild-type  and as5ox plants, and additional as5ox-specific products.
however, run-on transcription showed that the 5s-trnr region was transcribed four-fold more in the as5ox plants compared to wt, indicating that overexpression of as <dig> was associated with decreased stability of 5s rrna.
in this study, we used nicotiana tabacum to investigate the effect on sense strand transcripts of overexpressing a natural chloroplast asrna, as <dig>  which is complementary to the region which encodes the 5s rrna and trnaarg.
of the corresponding sense strand transcripts, trnaarg overaccumulated several-fold in transgenic plants whereas 5s rrna was unaffected.
in addition, polysome analysis of the transformants showed less 5s rrna and rbcl mrna associated with ribosomes.
as5-overexpressing  plants obtained by chloroplast transformation exhibited slower growth and slightly pale green leaves.
more globally, overexpression of asrnas via chloroplast transformation may be a useful strategy for defining their functions.
the roles of non-coding rnas in regulating gene expression have been extensively studied in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, however few reports exist as to their roles in organellar gene regulation.
