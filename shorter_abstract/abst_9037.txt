these studies demonstrated  <dig> % w/v epn administered topically at 1 mg/kg body weight to be highly efficacious against a broad range of ovine gastrointestinal nematodes and d. filaria lungworms and well tolerated by sheep of different ages, breeds, gender and physiological status.
a total of  <dig> sheep harboring naturally acquired gastrointestinal nematode infections were included in the field efficacy study at two sites each in germany  and in italy .
in the two dose confirmation studies, which included  <dig> sheep each, sheep treated with topical epn had significantly  fewer of the following nematodes than the untreated sheep with overall reduction of nematode counts by >99%: adult dictyocaulus filaria, haemonchus contortus, teladorsagia circumcincta, trichostrongylus axei, t. colubriformis, t. vitrinus, cooperia curticei, nematodirus battus, strongyloides papillosus, chabertia ovina and oesophagostomum venulosum, and inhibited fourth-stage teladorsagia larvae.
pharmacokinetics of epn following single treatment with topical epn were determined in eight ~ <dig>  year old female merino cross sheep based on the analysis of plasma samples which were collected from two hours to 21 days following treatment.
animals were blocked on pre-treatment body weight and within each block, one animal was randomly assigned to the control  group and three animals were randomly assigned to be treated with topical epn.
the anthelmintic efficacy of the  <dig> % w/v topical formulation of eprinomectin , eprinex® pour-on  when administered at 1 mg/kg body weight was evaluated in sheep in two dose confirmation laboratory studies and one multicenter field study.
examination of feces 14 days after treatment demonstrated that, relative to the controls, topical epn-treated sheep had significantly  lower strongylid egg counts.
no treatment-related health problems or adverse drug events were observed in any study.
