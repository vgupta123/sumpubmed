connections between hidden states and state emission probabilities reflect the organization of protein structures into secondary structure segments.
a number of successful secondary structure prediction methods use neural networks, but unfortunately, neural networks are not intuitively interpretable.
secondary structure prediction is a useful first step toward 3d structure prediction.
we then use it for secondary structure prediction.
on the contrary, hidden markov models are graphical interpretable models.
because they offer a strong statistical background and allow model interpretation, we propose a method based on hidden markov models.
the hidden markov model presented here achieves valuable prediction results using only a limited number of parameters.
furthermore, it can be used as a tool for generating protein sequences with a given secondary structure content.
