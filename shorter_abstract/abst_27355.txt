for restricted classes of pseudoknots, several polynomial time algorithms have been designed, where the otime and o space algorithm by rivas and eddy is currently the best available program.
we introduce the class of canonical simple recursive pseudoknots and present an algorithm that requires o time and o space to predict the energetically optimal structure of an rna sequence, possible containing such pseudoknots.
the general problem of rna secondary structure prediction under the widely used thermodynamic model is known to be np-complete when the structures considered include arbitrary pseudoknots.
