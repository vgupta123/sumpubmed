bettsia and ascosphaera are characterized by a unicellular cyst-like cleistothecium known as a spore cyst, while eremascus is characterized by completely naked asci, or asci not formed within a protective ascocarp.
because of their unique fruiting bodies, the close relationship of these bee-specialist fungi and their monophyly appeared certain.
the convergent evolution of these unusual ascocarps is hypothesized to be adaptive for bee-mediated dispersal.
the naked ascus and spore cyst are both shown to have evolved convergently within the bee habitat.
eremascus albus is closely related to ascosphaera in eurotiomycetes while e. fertilis belongs in myxotrichaceae, a putative member of leotiomycetes.
to establish the systematic position of e. fertilis and bettsia alvei, i performed phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal lsu + ssu dna sequences from these species and  <dig> additional ascomycetes.
the phylogenetic analyses revealed that eremascus is not monophyletic.
among the understudied fungi found in nature are those living in close association with social and solitary bees.

these isolates represent the second report of e. fertilis both in nature and in the honey bee hive.
bettsia is not closely related to ascosphaera and like e. fertilis apparently belongs in leotiomycetes.
the new genus skoua is described to accommodate e. fertilis.
these results indicate that both the naked ascus and spore cyst evolved twice in the pezizomycotina and in distantly related lineages.
elucidating the dispersal strategies of these fungal symbionts contributes to our understanding of their interaction with bees and provides insight into the factors which potentially drive the evolution of reduced ascocarps in pezizomycotina.
in this study, i isolated the very rare fungus eremascus fertilis  from the bee bread of honey bees.
