large changes in transcript abundance were observed which were categorised into distinct phases of differentiation , grain fill  and desiccation/maturation  and were associated with specific tissues and processes.
transcript abundance profiles in both experiments for nine selected known and putative wheat transcription factors were independently confirmed by real time rt-pcr.
this transcriptome data will provide a valuable resource for molecular studies on wheat grain.
these expression profiles confirm or extend our knowledge of the roles of the known transcription factors and suggest roles for the unknown ones.
it has been demonstrated how it can be used to distinguish general developmental shifts from specific effects of treatments on gene expression and to diagnose the probable tissue specificity and role of transcription factors.
