the method’s ability to model inter- and intra-cluster variance leads to more biologically meaningful clusters.
time course data from microarrays and high-throughput sequencing experiments require simple, computationally efficient and powerful statistical models to extract meaningful biological signal, and for tasks such as data fusion and clustering.
in particular, we illustrate the method’s capacity for missing data imputation, data fusion and clustering.the method can impute data which is missing both systematically and at random: in a hold-out test on real data, performance is significantly better than commonly used imputation methods.
we propose hierarchical gaussian processes as a general model of gene expression time-series, with application to a variety of problems.
