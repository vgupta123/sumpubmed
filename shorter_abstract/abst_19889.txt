to facilitate direct comparisons, the raw datasets are automatically preprocessed and normalized in terms of both migration times and signal intensities.
various forms of comparisons and statistical tests can be applied to highlight subtle differences.
we present a mathematica  package mathdamp , which highlights differences between raw datasets acquired by hyphenated mass spectrometry methods by applying arithmetic operations to all corresponding signal intensities on a datapoint-by-datapoint basis.
peak identification and integration is thus bypassed and the results are displayed graphically.
the processed datasets and the results of direct comparisons between them are visualized using density plots  providing an intuitive overall view.
with the advent of metabolomics as a powerful tool for both functional and biomarker discovery, the identification of specific differences between complex metabolite profiles is becoming a major challenge in the data analysis pipeline.
our tool facilitates the visualization and identification of differences between complex metabolite profiles according to various criteria in an automated fashion and is useful for data-driven discovery of biomarkers and functional genomics.
overlaid electropherograms  corresponding to the vicinities of the candidate differences from any result may be generated in a descending order of significance for visual confirmation.
the task remains difficult, given the datasets' size, complexity, and common shifts in migration  times between samples analyzed by hyphenated mass spectrometry methods.
a combination of dynamic programming and global optimization is used for the alignment of the datasets along the migration time dimension.
additionally, a standard library table  may be aligned and overlaid on the plots to allow easier identification of metabolites.
