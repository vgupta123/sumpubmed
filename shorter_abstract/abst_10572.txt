a total of sixty-three naturally contaminated chicken samples were investigated by both methods and relative accuracy, relative sensitivity and relative specificity of the real-time pcr method were determined to be  <dig>   <dig> and 87%, respectively.
real-time pcr methodology can contribute to meet the need for rapid identification and detection methods in food testing laboratories.
the real-time pcr based method comprised a pre-enrichment step in buffered peptone water  overnight, followed by a shortened selective enrichment in rappaport vasilliadis soya broth  for  <dig> hours and subsequent dna extraction.
the real-time multiplex pcr assay and traditional cultural method showed 100% inclusivity and 100% exclusivity on all strains tested.
a real-time multiplex pcr assay was developed for the detection of multiple salmonella serotypes in chicken samples.
the traditional cultural method according to en iso 6579: <dig> for the detection of salmonella in food was performed in parallel.
the real-time multiplex pcr assay was as sensitive as the traditional cultural method in detecting salmonella in artificially contaminated chicken samples and correctly identified the serotype.
thirty cultures blind tested were correctly identified by the real-time multiplex pcr method.
artificially contaminated chicken samples resulted in a detection limit of between  <dig> and  <dig> cfu per  <dig> g sample for both methods.
