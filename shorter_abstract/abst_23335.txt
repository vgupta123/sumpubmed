if the flux along one pathway is changed then the sam concentration will change affecting all the other mt pathways, so it is difficult for the cell to regulate the pathways independently.
methyltransferase  reactions, in which methyl groups are attached to substrates, are fundamental to many aspects of cell biology and human physiology.
because of these long-range allosteric interactions, the dynamic behavior of the network is very complicated, and so mathematical modeling is a useful tool for investigating the effects of the regulatory mechanisms and understanding the complicated underlying biochemistry and cell biology.
we created a mathematical model, based on the known biochemistry of the folate and methionine cycles, to study the regulatory mechanisms that enable the cell to overcome this difficulty.
using the model, we quantify the effects of different regulatory mechanisms and show how cell processes would be different if the regulatory mechanisms were eliminated.
some of the primary mechanisms are long-range allosteric interactions by which substrates in one part of the biochemical network affect the activity of enzymes at distant locations in the network .
the long-range allosteric interactions enable the cell to regulate the mt reactions somewhat independently.
finally, we explain why a full understanding of how competing mts are regulated is important for designing intervention strategies to improve human health.
the low km values of many mts also play a role because the reactions then run near saturation and changes in sam have little effect.

the universal methyl donor for these reactions is s-adenosylmethionine  and this presents the cell with an important regulatory problem.
