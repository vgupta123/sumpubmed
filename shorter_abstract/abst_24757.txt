our study also demonstrates that extracellular s1p stimulates cells to rapidly produce and secrete additional s1p, which can further amplify the nf-κb activation.
nf-κb was activated by extracellular s1p via s1p <dig> receptors and gi protein signaling.
we found that s1p protected cells from fasl-induced cell death in an nf-κb dependent manner.
s1p mediates its effects either by signaling through g protein-coupled receptors  or through an intracellular mode of action.
