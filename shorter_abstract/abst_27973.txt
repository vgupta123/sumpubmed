particular emphasis has been put towards characterizing the algal homologs of the canonical rate-limiting enzymes, diacylglycerol acyltransferase  and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase .
our analysis contributes to advance in the knowledge of complex superfamilies involved in lipid metabolism and provides clues to possible enzymatic players of chloroplast tag synthesis.
subcellular targeting prediction suggests that most green algal dgat <dig> proteins are imported to the chloroplast, evidencing that the green algal chloroplast might have a soluble pathway for the de novo synthesis of tags.
our analysis also revealed the existence of a novel dgat exclusive to green algae with moderate similarity to plant soluble dgat <dig>  the dgat <dig> clade shares a most recent ancestor with a group of uncharacterized proteins from cyanobacteria.
heterologous expression of c. reinhardtii dgat <dig> produces an increase in the accumulation of tag, as evidenced by thin layer chromatography.
amongst our main findings, we identified a novel clade of dgat1-like proteins exclusive to red algae and glaucophyta and a previously uncharacterized subclade of dgat <dig> proteins with an unusual number of transmembrane segments.
less work has been done to analyze homologs from a phylogenetic perspective.
