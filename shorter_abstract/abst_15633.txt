the control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates.
in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of rhdv ’s evolutionary history, we undertook fresh bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor  estimates for rhdv based on the vp <dig> and rna-dependent rna polymerase genes.
the literature is ripe with phylogenetic estimates of nucleotide substitution rates, especially of measurably evolving species such as rna viruses.
after excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of rhdv, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus.
these jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous dates of isolation.
