the exact mechanism of action is poorly understood.
an endorem labelling concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml fe  had no adverse effects on the viability of canine ascs.
chondrogenic differentiation occurred to a lesser extent compared with a control sample.
however, it must be clarified whether there is any negative influence on cell function and viability after labelling prior to clinical administration.
the efficiency of the labelling was investigated using prussian blue staining and macs assay.
therapy with mesenchymal stem cells  has been reported to provide beneficial effects in the treatment of neurological and orthopaedic disorders in dogs.

for the purpose of the study, seven samples with canine adipose-derived stem cells were incubated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles  for 24 h. the internalisation of the iron particles occurred via endocytosis.
magnetic resonance imaging  gives the opportunity to observe mscs after clinical administration.
after 3 weeks the percentage of spio labelled canine stem cells decreased.
labelled cells underwent osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation.
spio particles were localized as free clusters in the cytoplasm or within lysosomes depending on the time of investigation.
to visualise mscs with the help of mri, labelling with an mri contrast agent is necessary.
therefore, this contrast agent could be used as a model for iron oxide labelling agents.
