ebbie is available under gnu gpl and currently implemented on
the reliable storage of inserts, and their annotation in a mysql database, blastn <cit>  comparison of new inserts to dynamic and static databases make it a powerful new tool in any laboratory using dna sequencing.
our laboratory used ebbie to analyze scores of dna sequencing data originating from an smrna cloning project <cit> .
ebbie is a semi-automated smrna cloning data processing algorithm, which initially searches for any substring within a dna sequencing text file, which is flanked by two constant strings.
ebbie also prevents manual mistakes during the excision process and speeds up annotation and data-entry.
the substring, also termed smrna or insert, is stored in a mysql and blastn database.
dna sequencing is used ubiquitously: from deciphering genomes <cit>  to determining the primary sequence of small rnas   <cit> .
ebbie was designed for medium sized smrna cloning projects with about  <dig>  database entries  <cit> .ebbie can be used for any type of sequence analysis where two constant primer regions flank a sequence of interest.
recently we completed a smrna cloning project involving tobacco plants, where analysis was required for ~ <dig> smrna sequences <cit> .
