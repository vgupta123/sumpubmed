as species of rickettsiales are associated with an extremely diverse host range, a better understanding of the historical associations between these bacteria and their hosts will provide important information on their evolutionary trajectories and, particularly, their potential emergence as pathogens.
notably, two lineages of ehrlichia and one lineage of anaplasma were distinct from any known rickettsiales, suggesting the presence of potentially novel species in ticks in xinjiang.
bacteria of the order rickettsiales  are obligate intracellular parasites that infect species from virtually every major eukaryotic lineage.
our phylogenetic analyses revealed some topological differences between the phylogenies of the bacteria and their vectors, which led us to marginally reject a model of exclusive bacteria-vector co-divergence.
both bacteria-vector co-divergence and cross-species transmission appear to have played important roles in rickettsiales evolution.
in this work, we identified a single tick species that harbors multiple species of rickettsiales, and uncovered extensive genetic diversity of these bacteria in two tick species from xinjiang.
nine species of rickettsiales  were identified in two species of hard ticks  from two geographic regions in xinjiang through genetic analyses of 16s rrna, glta, and groel gene sequences.
