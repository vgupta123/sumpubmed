apple cultivars differ greatly in their allergenic properties, but knowledge of the causes for such differences is incomplete.
for mal d  <dig>  a wide range of isoallergens and variants exist, and they are encoded by a large gene family.
the results from the application of the assay showed that  <dig> genes were not expressed in fruit.
we successfully developed gene-specific primer pairs for each of the  <dig> mal d  <dig> genes and incorporated them into a qrt-pcr assay.
in addition, differential expression was observed among the mal d  <dig> genes that were expressed in the fruit.
