import of cgh profiles from different cgh system vendors is already supported; its extension to other systems can be readily achieved through perl scripts.
cgh profiler can also be used to analyse comparative expressed sequence hybridisation  data.
cesh reveals gene expression patterns according to chromosomal locations in a similar manner as cgh detects chromosomal imbalances.
cgh-profiler comes with different consistency checks, calculates various statistics and automatically assigns a median copy number ratio to each chromosomal band.
cgh-profiler is a useful tool for processing of cgh and cesh data.
cgh-profiler circumvents the semantic iscn description by importing data from different cgh system vendors and by directly transferring the data into a table format that is readily accessible for subsequent statistical analysis.
comparative genomic hybridisation  is a well-established, molecular cytogenetic method that allows the detection of chromosomal imbalances in entire genomes.
