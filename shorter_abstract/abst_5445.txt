here, a poisson mixture model, which assumes excess variability arises from sampling a mixture of distinct components, is proposed and the merits of this model are discussed and evaluated.
the goodness of fit of the poisson mixture model on  <dig> sets of biological sage replicates is compared to the previously proposed hierarchical gamma-poisson  model, and a substantial improvement is seen.
the poisson mixture model performs well as a) a method to represent sage data from biological replicates, and b) a basis to assign significance when testing for differential expression between multiple groups of replicates.
these profiles are count-based and are assumed to follow a binomial or poisson distribution.
in further support of the mixture model, there is observed: 1) an increase in the number of mixture components needed to fit the expression of tags representing more than one transcript; and 2) a tendency for components to cluster libraries into the same groups.
serial analysis of gene expression  is used to obtain quantitative snapshots of the transcriptome.
however, tag counts observed across multiple libraries  have additional variance that cannot be accommodated by this assumption alone.
several models have been proposed to account for this effect, all of which utilize a continuous prior distribution to explain the excess variance.
a confidence score is presented that can identify tags that are differentially expressed between groups of sage libraries.
