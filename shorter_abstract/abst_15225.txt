further experiments illustrated the capacity of our arrays to detect differential gene expression in a variety of flax tissues as well as between two contrasted flax varieties.
moreover, this highly reliable platform can also be used for the quantification of mrna transcriptional profiling in different flax tissues.
cross-validation of microarray data was carried out using quantitative qrt-pcr.
nine target genes were selected on the basis of microarray results and reflected the whole range of fold change .
recent advances in genomics are now providing opportunities to improve our fundamental knowledge of these complex processes.
<dig> independent experiments were used to evaluate the hybridization quality, precision, specificity and accuracy and all results confirmed the high technical quality of our microarray platform.
a statistically significant positive correlation was obtained comparing expression levels for each target gene across all biological replicates both in qrt-pcr and microarray results.
all results suggest that our high-density flax oligo-microarray platform can be used as a very sensitive tool for analyzing gene expression in a large variety of tissues as well as in different cultivars.
in this paper we report the development and validation of a high-density oligo microarray platform dedicated to gene expression analyses in flax.
