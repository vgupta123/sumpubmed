we introduce a new data format and software library called wormtable, which provides efficient access to tabular data in python.
files written in existing formats can be easily converted to wormtable format, and we provide conversion utilities for the vcf and gtf formats.
wormtableâ€™s simple api allows users to process large tables orders of magnitude more quickly than is possible when parsing text.
these benefits of reduced code complexity and greatly increased performance allow users much greater freedom to explore their data.
wormtable stores data in a compact binary format, provides random access to rows, and enables sophisticated indexing on columns within these tables.
data are commonly represented in tables stored as plain text files and require line-by-line parsing for analysis, which is time consuming and error prone.
furthermore, the indexing facilities provide efficient access to subsets of the data along with providing useful methods of summarising columns.
