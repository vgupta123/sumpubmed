the obtained data indicate that obese persons in ukraine adult population have a significantly higher level of firmicutes and lower level of bacteroidetes compared to normal-weight and lean adults.
metagenomic studies confirm that obesity is associated with a composition of gut microbiota.
in an unadjusted logistic regression model, f/b ratio was significantly associated with bmi .

to examine the association between body mass index and microbiota composition in ukrainian population, fecal concentrations of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, actinobacteria and firmicutes/bacteroidetes  ratio were analyzed in  <dig> adult individuals.
this association continued to be significant after adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, tobacco smoking and physical activity .
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
the f/b ratio also raised with increasing bmi.
the relative abundance of actinobacteria was small  and comparable in different bmi categories.
there are some controversies, however, about the composition of gut microbial communities in obese individuals in different populations.
