analysis of rna expression using real-time pcr  traditionally includes reference genes  as an internal control.
the mrna expression of the following genes of interest  were analyzed: skeletal muscle alpha  <dig> actin , myogenin/myogenic factor  <dig> , embryonic skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain  <dig>  and the activity of creatine phosphokinase .
rna expression analyses including three independent softwares revealed that rplpo, tbp as reference genes or nf calculated by genorm software, are suitable to normalize the mrna expression in myoblast after culture under differentiation conditions.
the genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper software programs were used to ascertain the most suitable rg to normalize the rna input.
using the genorm program, rplpo and tbp were found to be the most stable genes, additionally a suitable normalization factor  was calculated.
bestkeeper program also revealed that rplpo and tbp as stable genes, but ppia was the most stable reference gene, whereas gapdh and actb were the worst ranked.
the rg were analyzed in human myoblast cultures under differentiation conditions.
