though, these approaches provide high prediction accuracy, the window lengths used are longer in size.
the proposed approach has been compared with commonly used approaches i.e., maximum entropy modeling , maximal dependency decomposition , weighted matrix method  and markov model of first order  and was found to perform equally with mem and mdd and better than wmm and mm <dig> in terms of prediction accuracy.
the proposed prediction approach can be used in the prediction of donor splice sites with higher accuracy using short sequence motifs and hence can be used as a complementary method to the existing approaches.
therefore, splice site prediction with short sequence motifs and without encoding sequence data became a motivation for the present study.
based on the proposed methodology, a web server was also developed for easy prediction of donor splice sites by users and is available at http://cabgrid.res.in:8080/sspred.
an approach for finding association among nucleotide bases in the splice site motifs is developed and used further to determine the appropriate window size.
most of the approaches for splice site prediction are based on machine learning techniques.
besides, an approach for prediction of donor splice sites using sum of absolute error criterion has also been proposed.
