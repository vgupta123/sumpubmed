forty-seven qtls were identified,  <dig> coinciding with major genes and qtls that have been consistently found in the same populations when studied individually and  <dig> were new.
seven key agronomic characters  were analyzed in  <dig> progenies from crosses between occidental commercial genotypes and various exotic lines including accessions of other prunus species.
a substantial part of the qtls observed  would not have been detected in crosses between only commercial materials, showing the high value of exotic lines as a source of novel alleles for the commercial gene pool.
these results are first-hand information for breeders and a step forward towards the implementation of dna-informed strategies to facilitate selection of new cultivars with improved productivity and quality.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
our strategy also provided estimations on the narrow sense heritability of each character, and the estimation of the qtl genotypes of each parent for the different qtls and their breeding value.
breeding is facilitated by knowledge of the inheritance of the key traits that are often of a quantitative nature.
in this article we propose the use of a multi-progeny mapping strategy that used pedigree information and bayesian approaches that supports a more precise and complete survey of the available genetic variability.
