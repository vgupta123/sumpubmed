using microsatellite and mtdna data, we examined genetic diversity, spatial differentiation, interregional gene flow, and effective population sizes in the critically endangered saimaa ringed seal , which is endemic to the large but highly fragmented lake saimaa in southeastern finland.
microsatellite diversity within the subspecies  ranks among the lowest thus far recorded within the order pinnipedia, with signs of ongoing loss of individual heterozygosity, reflecting very low effective subpopulation sizes.
fragmentation can intensify these genetic adversities and, therefore, dispersal and gene flow among subpopulations within an isolated population is often essential for maintaining its viability.
bayesian assignment analyses of the microsatellite data revealed clear genetic differentiation among the main breeding areas, but interregional structuring was substantially weaker in biparentally inherited microsatellites  than in maternally inherited mtdna , indicating a sevenfold difference in the gene flow mediated by males versus females.

our results demonstrate that population structures of endangered animals cannot be predicted based on data on even closely related species or subspecies.
genetic structuring in the population appears to arise from the joint effects of multiple factors, including small effective subpopulation sizes, a fragmented lacustrine habitat, and behavioural dispersal limitation.
