we conclude that shc blockade in lps-primed dc leads to the development of tolerogenic dc via src-dependent stat <dig> activation and that adaptor protein shc might play a pivotal role in mediating immunogenic and tolerogenic properties of dcs.
we further demonstrate that shc blockade on lps-treated dcs results in significant increase of the overall stat <dig> phosphorylation and the relative levels of phospho-stat <dig> in the nuclear fraction.
we aimed to evaluate the immune-regulatory role of shc in rat bone marrow-derived dcs in the maturation process triggered by lps.
we found that, in response to lps, expression of shc proteins was induced and that neutralization of shc inhibited the lps-induced transient phosphorylation of p52shc on ptyr239/ <dig> in dcs of lewis  rats.
stat <dig> activation by lps with or without shc blockade was totally abolished by su <dig>  a selective src family kinases inhibitor, underscoring the critical role of src-mediated activation.
