sequence alignment suggested that tanac <dig> might be located on chromosome 2bs.
germination and root length assays of transgenic plants demonstrated that tanac <dig> overexpression plants had enhanced tolerances to high salinity and dehydration, and exhibited an aba-hypersensitive response.
moreover, tanac <dig> overexpression plants accumulated lesser malondialdehyde , h2o <dig>  while had higher superoxide dismutase  and catalase  activities under high salinity and/or dehydration stress.
tanac <dig> was expressed at a higher level in the leaves, and expression levels were much higher in senescent leaves, indicating that tanac <dig> might be involved in the senescence process.
our results demonstrate that tanac <dig> plays important roles in the senescence process and response to salt and drought stresses.
tanac29-overexpression plants were subjected to salt and drought stresses for examining gene functions.
when grown in the greenhouse, tanac29-overexpression plants showed the same tolerance response to salt and drought stresses at both the vegetative and reproductive period, and had delayed bolting and flowering in the reproductive period.
nac  transcription factors play important roles in plant biological processes, including phytohormone homeostasis, plant development, and in responses to various environmental stresses.
aba signal pathway and antioxidant enzyme systems are involved in tanac29-mediated stress tolerance mechanisms.
a novel nac transcription factor gene, designated tanac <dig>  was isolated from bread wheat .
to investigate tolerant mechanisms involved in the salt and drought responses, expression of related marker genes analyses were conducted, and related physiological indices were also measured.
