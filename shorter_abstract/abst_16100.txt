the human foxi <dig> gene codes for a transcription factor involved in the physiology of the inner ear, testis, and kidney.
of the multiple functions of foxi <dig>  its role in kidney-mediated water-electrolyte homeostasis is the most obvious candidate for explaining a climate-related adaptation.
sequence-based neutrality tests were not significant in europeans, east asians or yorubas.
additionally, we explored for signals of natural selection within humans by sequencing the gene in  <dig> europeans,  <dig> east asians and  <dig> yorubas and by analysing snp variation in a  <dig> mb region centered on foxi <dig> in  <dig> worldwide human populations from the hgdp-ceph diversity panel.
we present evidence for recent positive selection in the foxi <dig> gene region in africa.
we sought to confirm this finding by using an extended set of orthologous sequences.
a functionally relevant snp, as well as several snps either on the putatively selected core haplotypes or with significant ihs or xp-rsb values, displayed allele frequencies strongly correlated with the absolute geographical latitude of the populations sampled.
however, the long range haplotype  test, as well as the ihs and xp-rsb statistics revealed significantly extended tracks of homozygosity around foxi <dig> in africa, suggesting a recent episode of positive selection acting on this gene.
the genome sequences recently available from other primate and non-primate species showed that foxi <dig> divergence patterns are compatible with neutral evolution.
