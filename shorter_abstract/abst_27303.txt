the model uses sequence profiles constructed from log-odds scores of mono- and di-nucleotides and nucleotide compositions.
sequence profiles of log-odds scores of mono- and di-nucleotides were much more powerful features than nucleotide compositions in finding protein-binding regions in rna sequences.
but, a slight performance gain was obtained when using the sequence profiles along with nucleotide compositions.
lopo cross validation showed a lower performance than the 10-fold cross validation, but the performance remains high .
since actual mrna sequences have more non-binding regions than protein-binding regions, we tested the model on several datasets with different ratios of protein-binding regions to non-binding regions.
we developed a new support vector machine  model for predicting protein-binding regions in mrna sequences.
these are preliminary results of ongoing research, but demonstrate the potential of our approach as a powerful predictor of protein-binding regions in rna.
motivated by the increased amount of data on protein-rna interactions and the availability of complete genome sequences of several organisms, many computational methods have been proposed to predict binding sites in protein-rna interactions.
the model was evaluated by standard 10-fold cross validation, leave-one-protein-out  cross validation and independent testing.
10-fold cross validation with a balanced dataset achieved a sensitivity of  <dig> %, a specificity of  <dig> %, an accuracy of  <dig> %, a positive predictive value  of  <dig> %, a negative predictive value  of  <dig> % and a matthews correlation coefficient  of  <dig> .
the best performance of the model was obtained in a balanced dataset of positive and negative instances.
in testing the model on independent datasets, it achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % and an mcc of  <dig> .
however, most computational methods are limited to finding rna-binding sites in proteins instead of protein-binding sites in rnas.
recent computational methods for finding protein-binding sites in rnas have several drawbacks for practical use.
