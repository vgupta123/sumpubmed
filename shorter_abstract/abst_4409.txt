from these  <dig> proteins, the phobius algorithm predicted that  <dig> proteins have no transmembrane domains, and the big-pi predictor identified  <dig> proteins as having no glycosylphosphatidylinositol  modification sites.
the yeast kluyveromyces lactis is considered a promising host for heterologous protein production.
an ideal system to address the secretion of a desired protein could be exploited among the native proteins in certain physiological conditions.
because yeasts naturally do not secrete as many proteins as filamentous fungi, they can produce secreted recombinant proteins with few contaminants in the medium.
the conditions to favor expression were obtained by searching gene ontology terms and using graph theory.
wolf psort predicted that the k. lactis secretome consists of  <dig> putative proteins, excluding subcellular targeting.
most of the transcription factors are related to responses to stress such as drug, acid and heat resistance, as well as nitrogen limitation, and may be useful for inducing maximal expression of potential extracellular proteins.
signalp v <dig> identified  <dig> proteins with n-terminal signal peptides.
to this end, we predicted protein subcellular locations and correlated the resulting extracellular secretome with the transcription factors that modulate the cellular response to a particular environmental stimulus.
to explore the potential kluyveromyces lactis extracellular secretome, four computational prediction algorithms were applied to  <dig> predicted k. lactis proteins from the genome database.
protein secretion is a cell translocation process of major biological and technological significance.
a public database of k. lactis secreted proteins and their transcription factors are presented.
by applying algorithms to the completed k. lactis genome sequence, such a system could be selected.
