thirty-eight isolates were first typed at species level by pcr amplification of 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacers using universal primers that anneal within 16s and 23s genes, followed by restriction digestion analyses of pcr amplicons .
an expression cassette was assembled onto the pcr <dig> -topo vector by cloning the promoter, leader peptide, cell wall anchor and terminator sequences derived from the laminin binding s-layer protein gene of l. crispatus strain f <dig>  .
the use of lactic acid bacteria as vehicles to delivery antigens to immunize animals is a promising issue.
gastric acid and bile salts tolerance, production of antagonistic substances against pathogenic microorganisms, and adhesive ability to gut epithelium are other important characteristics that make these bacteria useful for oral immunization.
bacteria isolated on de man, rogosa and sharpe medium  from different gastrointestinal portions of broiler chicks were evaluated for their resistance to artificial gastric acid and bile salts, production of hydrogen peroxide, and cell surface hydrophobicity.
lactobacillus isolated from gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens and selected for probiotic characteristics can be genetically modified by introducing an expression cassette into the lbs locus.
