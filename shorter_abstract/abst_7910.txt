these two phages are also related to p. aeruginosa phages vb_pae-kakheti_ <dig> , pa <dig>  and vb_paes_sch_ab <dig>  and more distantly related to burkholderia cepacia complex phage kl <dig>  which together make up a taxonomic sub-family.
both phages exhibit unusually broad host ranges capable of infecting bacteria across taxonomic orders.
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and complete genome sequencing and analysis indicates that phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are closely related but different phages, sharing  <dig>  % identity over  <dig>  % of their genomes.
one potential treatment solution to the current antibiotic resistance dilemma is “phage therapy”, the clinical application of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacteria.
the isolation and characterization of phages able to infect two completely different species of bacteria is an exciting discovery, as phages typically can only infect related bacterial species, and rarely infect bacteria across taxonomic families, let alone across taxonomic orders.
transmission electron microscopy of the phage dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> morphology reveals that they belong to the siphoviridae family of bacteriophages.
