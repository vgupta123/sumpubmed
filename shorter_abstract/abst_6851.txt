together, our data suggest safb <dig> will play an important physiological role in the central nervous system regulating synaptic function.
these genes regulate splicing, axonal and synaptic function, and are associated with neuropsychiatric disease, suggesting that safb <dig> is an important regulator of key neuronal processes.
safb <dig> is a rna binding protein implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular processes such as the regulation of transcription, stress response, dna repair and rna processing.
we found that safb <dig> regulates dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons and hence provide empirical evidence supporting this conclusion.
to further investigate the association of safb <dig> with splicing we used exon array analysis and found safb <dig> knockdown mediated the statistically significant up- and downregulation of alternative exons.
further analysis using rnamotifs to investigate the frequency of association between the motif pairs  and alternative spliced exons found there was a highly significant correlation with downregulated exons.
iclip analysis found safb <dig> binding was enriched, specifically in exons, ncrnas, 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions.
