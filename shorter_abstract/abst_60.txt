the pepito vector is significantly reduced in size, contains only one transcription unit and 60% less cpg motives in comparison to pepi- <dig>  it exhibits major advantages compared to the original pepi- <dig> plasmid, including higher transgene expression levels and increased colony-forming efficiencies in vitro, as well as more persistent transgene expression profiles in vivo.
the original pepi- <dig> vector contains two mammalian transcription units and a total of  <dig> cpg islands, which are located predominantly within the vector elements necessary for bacterial propagation and known to be counterproductive for persistent long-term transgene expression.
the episomal replication of the prototype vector pepi- <dig> depends on a transcription unit starting from the constitutively expressed cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter  and directed into a  <dig> bp long matrix attachment region sequence  derived from the human Î²-interferon gene.
the novel vector pepito can be considered suitable as an improved vector for biotechnological applications in vitro and for non-viral gene delivery in vivo.
