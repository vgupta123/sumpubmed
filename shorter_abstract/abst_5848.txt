we presented, for the first time, comprehensive transcriptome and proteome datasets for red sea nauplii.
genes related to translation, oxidative phosphorylation and cytoskeletal development were highly abundant.
the proteins associated with development, stress responses and osmoregulation showed the most significant differences between the two larval populations studied.
the synergistic overexpression of heat shock and osmoregulatory proteins may facilitate larval survival in intertidal habitats or in extreme environments.
a nauplii larval transcript dataset, containing  <dig>  predicted open reading frames , was constructed and used as a reference for the proteome analysis.
the barnacle balanus amphitrite is widely distributed in marine shallow and tidal waters, and has significant economic and ecological importance.
we also investigated itraq-based protein expression patterns to reveal the molecular basis of nauplii development, and to gain information on larval survival strategies in the red sea marine environment.
we observed remarkable plasticity in the proteome of red sea larvae.
however, a lack of genome information has hindered elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of development, settlement and survival strategies in extreme marine environments.
