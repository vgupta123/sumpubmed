computational analysis of the survey sequences provided global information on the abundant repetitive sequences in soybean.
genome surveys using conventional sequencing techniques are powerful, particularly for detecting sequences present in many copies per genome.
we have created an annotated, online database of sequences present in multiple copies in the soybean genome.
the sequence was used to determine the copy number across regions of large genomic clones or contigs and discover higher-order structures within satellite repeats.
this approach provides a potential aid to conventional or shotgun genome assembly, by allowing rapid assessment of copy number in any clone or clone-end sequence.
high throughput  <dig> sequencing provides an alternative method by which much information can be gained quickly and cheaply from high-coverage surveys of genomic dna.
the low bias of pyrosequencing against repeat sequences is demonstrated by the overall composition of the survey data, which matches well with past estimates of repetitive dna content obtained by dna re-association kinetics .
extensive computational and database tools are available to mine genomic and genetic databases for model organisms, but little genomic data is available for many species of ecological or agricultural significance, especially those with large genomes.
