fourteen nqs displayed higher activity against bloodstream trypomastigotes of t. cruzi than benznidazole.
further experiments using biochemical and molecular approaches are needed to better characterize ros participation in the mechanism of action of these nqs.
the strong redox effect of nq <dig> could be associated to the presence of the acetyl group in its structure facilitating quinone reduction, as previously demonstrated by electrochemical analysis.
nq <dig> led also to an increase in the percentage of parasites labeled with dhe, indicative of ros production, possibly the cause of the observed mitochondrial swelling.
the treatment with nqs also induced the appearance of large endoplasmic reticulum profiles surrounding different cellular structures and of myelin-like membranous contours, morphological characteristics of an autophagic process.
the absence of oxidative stress in nq1-, nq9- and nq12-treated parasites could be due to the existence of more than one mechanism of action involved in their trypanocidal activity, leaving ros generation suppressed by the detoxification system of the parasite.
further assays with nq <dig>  nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> showed inhibition of the proliferation of axenic epimastigotes and intracelulluar amastigotes interiorized in macrophages and in heart muscle cells.
naphthoquinones  are privileged structures in medicinal chemistry due to the biological effects associated with the induction of oxidative stress.
the present study evaluated the activities of sixteen nqs derivatives on trypanosoma cruzi.
at ic <dig> concentration, nq <dig> totally disrupted the ΔΨm of about 20% of the parasites, suggesting the induction of a sub-population with metabolically inactive mitochondria.
nq <dig>  nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> induce an autophagic phenotype in t. cruzi epimastigoted, as already observed with others nqs.
nq <dig> was the most active nq against both proliferative forms of t. cruzi.
