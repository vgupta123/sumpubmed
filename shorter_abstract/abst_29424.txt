in this four period crossover study, we compared the effect of four treatments: placebo, robenacoxib once or twice daily and ketoprofen once daily concomitantly with furosemide in seven healthy cats.
plasma renin activity , plasma and urinary aldosterone concentrations, glomerular filtration rate  and 24 h urinary volumes, electrolytes and eicosanoids , renal injury biomarker excretions  were measured.
co-localization of cox isoenzymes in md cells supports the functional data reported here.
immunohistochemistry on post-mortem renal specimens, obtained from a different group of cats that died naturally of non-renal causes, suggested constitutive cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> co-localization in many renal structures including the macula densa .

plasma creatinine increased with all treatments except placebo, whereas gfr was significantly decreased from baseline only with ketoprofen.
we propose in vivo characterisation of isoform roles in a furosemide model by administering non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  with differing selectivity profiles: robenacoxib  and ketoprofen .
urinary aldosterone excretion increased with all treatments but this increase was inhibited by 75 % with ketoprofen and 65 % with once daily robenacoxib compared to placebo.
