the approach allows for the addition of external data, particularly imputation data, resulting in a flexible environment that is suitable for different applications.
currently, however, such studies are still infeasible using a straightforward sequencing approach; as a result, recently a few multiplexing schemes have been suggested, in which a small number of ana pools are sequenced, and the results are then deconvoluted using compressed sensing or similar approaches.
recent advances in sequencing technologies set the stage for large, population based studies, in which the ana or rna of thousands of individuals will be sequenced.
additionally, we demonstrate the use of our framework for the detection of cancer fusion genes from rna sequences.
these methods, however, are limited to the detection of rare variants.
