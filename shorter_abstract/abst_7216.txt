the emergence of the usa <dig> mrsa genetic background among community associated s. aureus infections  in the usa was followed by the disappearance of usa <dig> ca-mrsa isolates.
we observed differences in the genetic content of usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains, as well as significant differences of in vitro and in vivo gene expression of mobile elements in a lung pneumonia model.
staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality through its ability to cause a number of human infections including bacteremia, pneumonia and soft tissue infections.
this is the first study to document the global transcription differences between usa <dig> and usa <dig> strains during both in vitro and in vivo growth.
we examined the in vitro gene expression profiles by microarray hybridization and the in vivo transcriptomes during lung infection in mice of a usa <dig> and a usa <dig> mrsa strain by performing complete genome qrt-pcr analysis.
importantly, we also observed the up-regulation of prophage genes in usa <dig>  during mouse lung infection , suggesting that these prophages may play an important role in vivo by contributing to the elevated virulence characteristic of the usa <dig> clone.
