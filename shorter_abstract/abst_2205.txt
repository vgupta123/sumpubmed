analysis and comparison of ar/r selectivity filters suggest that rice and maize mips could transport more diverse solutes than arabidopsis mips.
a subgroup of rice and maize nips has small residues in three of the four positions in the ar/r tetrad, resulting in a wider constriction.
the former is related to structural stability and the later can be linked to functional diversity.
structure-based sequence alignments were generated and the residues in the helix-helix interfaces were analyzed.
thus the mip members show conservation in helix-helix interfaces and diversity in aromatic/arginine selectivity filters.
more than  <dig> mip sequences have been identified in arabidopsis thaliana, maize and rice.
seventeen tip, nip and sip members from rice and maize have ar/r signatures that are not found in arabidopsis.
homology models of  <dig> mips from all three plant species were built.
ar/r regions were analyzed and compared between the three plant species.
plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , nod26-like intrinsic protein  and small and basic intrinsic proteins  are subfamilies of plant mips.
we have structurally characterized  <dig> rice and  <dig> maize mips and compared them with that of arabidopsis.
these mip members could transport larger solute molecules.
plant mips are believed to be important in cell division and expansion and in water transport properties in response to environmental conditions.
small residues  are found to be highly conserved as a group in the helix-helix interface of mip structures.
small residues are group-conserved in the helix-helix interface of mip structures and they seem to be important for close helix-helix interactions.
