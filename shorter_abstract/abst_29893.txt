evaluating whether and how the between-farm association frequencies impact on the risk of between-farm transmission will be the focus of future work.
this comparison showed how systematic biases in the demographic characterisation of a network, resulting from targeted sampling procedures, can bias the derived picture of between-host connectivity within the network.
exposing the effect of such biases on the geographical distribution of network properties could help target future poultry network data collection exercises.
avian influenza  control planning in great britain  provides one example where network data for the poultry industry , targeted large premises and is consequently demographically biased.
the fitted statistical models were extrapolated to the great britain poultry register ; this dataset is more representative of the poultry industry but lacks network information.
we recommend ranking geographical regions, based on relative confidence in extrapolated estimates, for prioritising further data collection.
when sampling network data, an incomplete description of the population may arise leading to biased estimates of between-host connectivity.
