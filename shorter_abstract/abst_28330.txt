the characteristic residues  and conserved cysteine residues are located in the extracellular regions and in the third to seventh transmembrane domains.
chemokines, a group of small and structurally related proteins, mediate chemotaxis of various cell types via chemokine receptors.
the cxcr <dig> has in general a constitutive expression in organs/tissues examined, whereas its expression was significantly up-regulated in immune organs and down-regulated in brain, indicating its potential role in immune response and central nervous system.
in mammals, seven different cxc chemokine receptors denoted as cxcr <dig> to cxcr <dig> have been reported.
the expression of gccxcr <dig> was significantly modulated by immunostimulants such as peptidoglycan , lipopolysaccharide , polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt  and phytohaemagglutinin .
the cdna sequence of grass carp cxcr <dig>  consists of  <dig> bp with a  <dig> bp 5' untranslated region  and a  <dig> bp 3' utr, with an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding  <dig> amino acids which are predicted to have seven transmembrane helices.
real-time pcr analysis showed that gccxcr <dig> was expressed in all tested organs/tissues and its expression level was the highest in trunk kidney, followed by in the spleen.
in the present study, the genomic sequence of cxcr <dig> was isolated from the grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella.
the grass carp gene consists of two exons, with one intervening intron, spaced over  <dig> bp of genomic sequence.
the cdna and genomic sequences of cxcr <dig> have been successfully characterized in a teleost fish, the grass carp.
phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that the gccxcr <dig> is clustered with those in other teleost fish and then in chicken and mammals.
the deduced amino acid sequence shows  <dig> - <dig> % identities with cxcr <dig> of mammals, avian and other fish species.
