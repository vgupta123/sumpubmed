read mappability as measured by the proportion of singletons increases steadily up to the length scale around  <dig> bp.
comparison with other databases indicates that the  <dig> regions can be broadly classified into two types: those containing line transposable elements and those containing segmental duplications.
to address this question, we evaluate the k-mer distribution of the human reference genome.
although a longer read is more likely to be uniquely mapped to the reference genome, a quantitative analysis of the influence of read lengths on mappability has been lacking.
the frequency distributions of k-mers exhibit long tails with a power-law-like trend, and rank frequency plots exhibit a concave zipfâ€™s curve.
the amount of non-unique sequence  in a genome directly affects the difficulty of read alignment to a reference assembly for high throughput-sequencing data.
