the aquaporins are a family of integral membrane proteins composed of two subfamilies: the orthodox aquaporins, which transport only water, and the aquaglyceroporins, which transport glycerol, urea, or other small solutes.
unlike other aquaporins, xenopus oocytes expressing aqp <dig> in the plasma membrane failed to transport water, glycerol, urea, or ions.
aqp <dig> has a unique distribution in brain, appearing in purkinje cell dendrites, hippocampal neurons of ca <dig> and ca <dig>  and cerebral cortical neurons.
aqp <dig> is functionally distinct from other proteins of the aquaporin superfamily and could represent a new aquaporin subfamily.
two recently described aquaporins, numbers  <dig> and  <dig>  appear to be more distantly related to the other mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins.
immunofluorescent staining of purkinje cells indicates that aqp <dig> is intracellular.
