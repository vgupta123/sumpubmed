the regulatory complexity may strongly correlate with gene function, as different evolutionary forces must act on the regulatory systems under different biological conditions.
we described and contrasted several hypotheses that provide a deeper insight into how transcriptional complexity might have been emerged during evolution.
we identified a class of functions that are associated with either high or low promoter conservation in mammals.
we detected a significant tendency that points to complex and adaptive processes were associated with higher promoter conservation, despite the fact that they have emerged relatively recently during evolution.
by conducting a rank correlation analysis between functional annotation and upstream sequence alignment scores obtained by human-mouse and human-dog comparison, we found a significantly greater conservation of the upstream sequence of genes involved in development, cell communication, neural functions and signaling processes than those involved in more basic processes shared with unicellular organisms such as metabolism and ribosomal function.
considering conservation as a functional signature, we hypothesize a higher density of cis-regulatory elements upstream of genes participating in complex and adaptive processes.
in particular, a proximal promoter region contains a large number of regulatory elements that control the expression of its downstream gene.
this observation persists after controlling for g+c content.
although many studies have focused on identification of these elements, a broader picture on the complexity of transcriptional regulation of different biological processes has not been addressed in mammals.
