however, substantial amounts of intronic transcriptional activity has been reported in ribozero protocols, raising issues regarding their potential nuclear origin and the impact on the actual sequence depth in exonic regions.
using hek <dig> human cells as source material, we assessed here the impact of the two commonly used rna extraction methods and of the library construction protocols  on 1) the relative abundance of intronic reads and 2) on the estimation of gene expression values.
we could show that the combination of trizol-based rna extraction with rrna depletion sequencing protocols led to the largest fraction of intronic reads, after the sequencing of the nuclear transcriptome.

the recent introduction of ribosomal rna depletion protocols, such as ribozero, has extended the view of the polyadenylated transcriptome to the poly- fraction of the rna.
gene expression analysis by rna sequencing is now widely used in a number of applications surveying the whole transcriptomes of cells and tissues.
