during their lifetime, conifer trees are exposed to numerous herbivorous insects.
the weevil feeding caused large-scale changes in the pine transcriptome.
here, we present the results of our studies on the transcriptional response and the volatile compounds production of scots pine  upon the large pine weevil  feeding.
the presented results are the first ones obtained by the use of a microarray platform with an extended coverage of pine transcriptome .
among the up-regulated genes, we could identify genes involved in signal perception, signalling pathways, transcriptional regulation, plant hormone homeostasis, secondary metabolism and defence responses.
many of the plant’s defence reactions are activated upon an insect attack, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not entirely understood yet, in particular in conifer trees.
the obtained data provide an important insight into the transcriptional response of conifer trees to insect herbivory and illustrate the massive changes in the host transcriptome upon insect attacks.
transcriptional response of scots pine to the weevil attack was investigated using a novel customised  <dig>  k pinus taeda microarray.
interestingly, we could not observe any correlation between the increased production of the terpenoid compounds and expression levels of the terpene synthase-encoding genes.
the weevil feeding on stem bark of pine significantly increased the total emission of volatile organic compounds from the undamaged stem bark area.
