we propose a novel ppi extraction technique called ppispotter by combining deterministic annealing-based ssl and an al technique to extract protein-protein interaction.
by conducting experiments with three different ppi corpuses, we show that ppispotter is superior to the other techniques incorporated into semi-supervised svms such as random sampling, clustering, and transductive svms by precision, recall, and f-measure.
in addition, we extract a comprehensive set of features from medline records by natural language processing  techniques, which further improve the svm classifiers.
both active learning and semi-supervised svms have recently been applied to extract ppi automatically.
in this paper, we explore combining the al with the ssl to improve the performance of the ppi task.
in our feature selection technique, syntactic, semantic, and lexical properties of text are incorporated into feature selection that boosts the system performance significantly.
