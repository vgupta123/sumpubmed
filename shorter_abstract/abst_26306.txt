we proposed a new method bayestyping <dig> to assign hla alleles for pacbio circular consensus sequencing reads using bayes’ theorem.
human leukocyte antigen  genes are critical genes involved in important biomedical aspects, including organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases.
computer scientists have developed such methods for various ngs platforms, such as illumina, roche  <dig> and ion torrent, based on the characteristics of the reads they generate.
the method was applied to simulated data of the three loci hla-a, hla-b and hla-drb <dig>  the experimental results showed its capability to tolerate the disturbance of sequencing errors and external noise reads.
the pacbio system has the longest read length among available ngs platforms, and therefore is the only platform capable of having exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of hla genes on the same read to unequivocally solve the ambiguity problem caused by the “phasing” issue.
the gene family contains the most polymorphic genes in humans and the difference between two alleles is only a single base pair substitution in many cases.
the bayestyping <dig> method could overcome the problems of hla typing using pacbio reads, which mostly arise from sequencing errors of pacbio reads and the divergence of hla genes, to some extent.
