understanding cellular structure and organization, which plays an important role in biological systems ranging from mechanosensation to neural organization, is a complicated multifactorial problem depending on genetics, environmental factors, and stochastic processes.
this map shows  <dig> areas of overlap with previous studies looking at bone strength and  <dig> areas not previously associated with bone.
we measured  <dig> femurs from a f <dig> cross experiment in mice without the growth hormone  and characterized more than  <dig> million osteocyte lacunae .
the results were then correlated with genetic markers in a process called quantitative trait localization .
the flexible infrastructure offers a full spectrum of shape, distribution, and connectivity metrics for cellular networks and can be adapted to a wide variety of materials ranging from plant roots to lung tissue in studies requiring high sample counts and sensitive metrics such as the drug-gene interactions and high-throughput screening.
in this manuscript we present a pipelined approach using a fully automated framework based on synchrotron-based x-ray tomographic microscopy  for performing a full 3d characterization of millions of substructures.
