we reveal a climate-correlated diversity loss below the species level, a process that could render the species more vulnerable to future environmental changes and affect its evolutionary potential.
the stretch of atlantic coast between north africa and north iberia is ideal for studying the relationship between species distribution and climate change as it includes the distributional limits of a considerable number of both cold- and warm-water species.
this is a remarkable case of genetic uniqueness of a vanishing cryptic genetic clade .
importantly, the analysis of existing and extinct population samples clearly distinguished two genetically different groups, a northern and a southern clade.
moreover, we genetically characterized with microsatellite markers previously sampled extinct and extant populations in order to estimate resulting cryptic genetic erosion.
because of the range contraction, the southern group is currently represented by very few extant populations.
this southern edge range shift is thus causing the loss of a distinct component of the species genetic background.
coastal sst warming data over the last three decades revealed a significant increase in temperature along most of the studied coastline, averaging  <dig> Â°c/decade.
we compared temporal changes in distribution of the canopy-forming alga fucus vesiculosus with historical sea surface temperature  patterns to draw links between range shifts and contemporary climate change.
