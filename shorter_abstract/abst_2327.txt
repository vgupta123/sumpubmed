we demonstrated by light and confocal laser microscopy that for shorter time periods the sodium salt of 8-bromoadenosine-camp  and for longer incubation periods 8--camp  exerted the greatest effects of all compounds tested here on formation of continuous tight junction strands in huvec.
pcpt-camp and, to a lesser extend, 8-br-camp/na improved formation of continuous tight junction strands and decreased paracellular permeability in primary huvec.
we here compared the effect of cyclic 3'-5'-adenosine monophosphate  and its derivates on formation and stabilization of tight junctions and on alterations in paracellular permeability in huvec.
we concluded that under these conditions huvec represent a feasible in vitro model to study formation and disassembly of endothelial tight junctions and to characterize tight junction-associated proteins
endothelial tight and adherens junctions control a variety of physiological processes like adhesion, paracellular transport of solutes or trafficking of activated leukocytes.
consequently, primary cultures of endothelial cells often lose their specific junctional pattern and fail to establish tight monolayer in vitro.
this is also true for endothelial cells isolated from the vein of human umbilical cords  which are widely used as model for endothelial cell-related studies.
