mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable number tandem repeat  typing is a reliable and reproducible method for differentiation of mtb isolates.
using hgdi, seven miru loci,  were found to be "highly discriminatory" , four miru loci  were "moderately discriminatory" , and one locus  was "poorly discriminatory" .
we propose that miru typing could be used to estimate the phylogenetic relatedness amongst prevalent cas <dig> strains, for which miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to be the most discriminatory.
the central asian strain <dig>  genogroup of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is the most prevalent in pakistan, india and bangladesh.
we performed standard  <dig> loci based miru-vntr typing on previously spoligotyped cas <dig> strains and 'unique' strains in order to evaluate its discriminatory power for these isolates.
the discriminatory index for each of the loci was calculated using the hunter gaston discriminatory index .
twelve loci based miru- vntr typing was used to type <dig> cas <dig> and  <dig> 'unique' mtb strains.
