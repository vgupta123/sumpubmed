to better understand the molecular basis of non-genetic microsomia, we undertook transcriptome profiling of both male and female livers from small and normal size mice at birth.
after a high-fat diet, microsomic mice were less prone to obesity, showing a better glucose tolerance and lower blood pressure.
finally, using embryo transfer of embryos of different quality and age, we identified a putative preimplantation origin of this non-genetic microsomia.
regardless of diet, adult mice born with microsomia showed a significantly lower body weight and size, and differences in the weight of several organs of microsomic adult mice compared to normal birth weight adults were found.
we used isogenic mice maintained in standard conditions to analyze how natural non-genetic microsomia  is produced in inbred mice and its long term effect on health.
neonatal microsomia is not always a risk factor for adult metabolic syndrome,  neonatal non-genetic microsomia displays changes in the expression of important epigenetic genes and changes in liver mrna transcription profile at birth, exaggerating sexual dimorphism, and  random preimplantation phenotypic variability could partially explain body birth weight variation in isogenic lines.
mice were phenotyped by weight, size, blood pressure, organ size, their response to a glucose challenge, and survival rates.
