the qrt-pcr results of target genes showed that differentially expressed mirnas negatively regulated their target genes.
reciprocal hybrids between solanum lycopersicum cv.
furthermore, gene ontology  annotation indicated that those target genes are primarily involved in metabolic processes.
significantly different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids were observed, including fruit shape index, single fruit weight and plant height.
reciprocal hybrids showing different phenotypes have been well documented in previous studies, and many factors accounting for different phenotypes have been extensively investigated.
however, less is known about whether the profiles of small rnas differ between reciprocal hybrids and how these small rnas affect gene expression and phenotypes.
to better understand this mechanism, the role of small rnas on phenotypes in reciprocal hybrids was analysed.
then, through the high-throughput sequencing of small rnas, we found that the expression levels of  <dig> known mirnas were highly variable between the reciprocal hybrids.
this study showed that the profiles of small rnas differed between the reciprocal hybrids, and differentially expressed genes were also observed based on the different phenotypes.

subsequently, a total of  <dig> target genes were predicted to correspond with these differentially expressed mirnas.
finally, differentially expressed mirnas, such as mir156f and 171a, and their target genes were analysed by qrt-pcr, and their expression levels were well correlated with the different phenotypes.
moreover, the expression of target genes was well correlated with the observations of different phenotypes.
these findings may aid in elucidating small rnas contribute significantly to different phenotypes through epigenetic modification during reciprocal crossing.
