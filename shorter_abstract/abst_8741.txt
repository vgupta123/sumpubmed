strain rue61a is an isolate from sewage sludge able to utilize quinaldine  as sole carbon and energy source.
the genome of strain rue61a contains numerous genes associated with osmoprotection, and a high number of genes coding for transporters.
rue61a reflects the saprophytic lifestyle and nutritional versatility of the organism and a strong adaptive potential to environmental stress.
bacteria of the genus arthrobacter are ubiquitous in soil environments and can be considered as true survivalists.
apart from quinaldine utilization, strain rue61a has a limited set of aromatic degradation pathways, enabling the utilization of 4-hydroxy-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, which are characteristic products of lignin depolymerization, via ortho cleavage of protocatechuate.
plasmid parue <dig> is proposed to contribute to the resistance of arthrobacter sp.
remarkably, degradation of anthranilate exclusively proceeds via a coa-thioester pathway.
it encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes for the uptake and utilization of various sugars and organic nitrogen compounds.
rue61a consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> ,495â€‰bp with an average g + c content of  <dig> %, the circular  <dig> -bp plasmid parue <dig>  and the linear  <dig> -bp plasmid parue <dig> that was already published.
a. aurescens tc- <dig> is the closest sequenced relative of strain rue61a.
the genome provides insight into the molecular basis of the versatility and robustness of this environmental arthrobacter strain.
the circular plasmid parue <dig> and the linear plasmid parue <dig> contribute to heavy metal resistance and to the ability to degrade quinaldine, respectively.
