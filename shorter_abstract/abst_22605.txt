further analysis suggests that the segmental organization first seen in chromosome  <dig> is present throughout the genome, with repeat-poor  regions alternating with repeat-rich  regions.
of these,  <dig> were considered as usable markers, and utilized in the construction of a happy map.
markers developed from chromosomally-assigned genes were then integrated into the happy map and this aided the assignment of a number of linkage groups to their respective chromosomes.
bac-end sequences and contigs from whole genome sequencing were also integrated to improve and validate the happy map.
this resulted in an integrated happy map consisting of  <dig> linkage groups that covers approximately half of the estimated 60â€‰mb genome.
we suggest that these features may be related to the known ability of this parasite to rapidly develop drug resistance.
this paper describes the application of a whole genome mapping method to improve the assembly of the genome of e. tenella from shotgun data, and to help reveal its overall structure.
a preliminary assessment of copy-number variation  between strains of e. tenella was also carried out.
evidence of copy-number variation between strains was also uncovered.
the emerging picture is of a very unusual genome architecture displaying inter-strain copy-number variation.
in order to increase the value of the genome sequence data and aid in the effort to gain a better understanding of the eimeria tenella genome, we constructed a whole genome map for the parasite.
a total of  <dig> contigs representing  <dig> % of the whole genome assembly sequences  were selected and subjected to marker selection.
subsequently,  <dig> happy markers were developed and typed.
