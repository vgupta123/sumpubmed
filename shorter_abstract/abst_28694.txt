sec-mals experiments showed that hnek <dig> conformation is dependent on its activation/phosphorylation status, a higher phosphorylation degree corresponding to a bigger stokes radius.
our data present the first low resolution 3d structure of hnek <dig> protein in solution.
human nek <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are involved in the control of mitotic spindle formation, acting together in a mitotic kinase cascade, but their mechanism of regulation remain elusive.
comparative molecular modeling together with disorder prediction analysis also revealed a flexible disordered n-terminal domain for hnek <dig>  which we found to be important to mediate interactions with diverse partners.
saxs, comparative modeling and sec-mals analysis revealed that hnek <dig> is a monomeric kinase of slightly elongated shape and a short unfolded n-terminal domain.
circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed our in silico predictions of secondary structure content and thermal stability shift assays revealed a slightly higher stability of wild-type hnek <dig> compared to the activation loop mutant hnek <dig>
in mammalians they represent an evolutionarily conserved family of  <dig> serine/threonine kinases, with 40-45% amino acid sequence identity to the aspergillus nidulans mitotic regulator nima within their catalytic domains.
saxs experiments showed that hnek <dig> is a monomer of a mostly globular, though slightly elongated shape.
