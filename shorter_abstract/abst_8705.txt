a strategy to alleviate this problem is to enhance adaptive capacities to face heat exposure using thermal manipulation  during embryogenesis.
gene ontology, clustering and network building strategies were then used to identify pathways affected by tm and heat challenge.
the aim of this study was to determine the effects of tm  and of a subsequent heat challenge  applied on d <dig> on gene expression in the pectoralis major muscle .
meat type chickens have limited capacities to cope with high environmental temperatures, this sometimes leading to mortality on farms and subsequent economic losses.
tm broilers displaying low tb may have lower metabolic intensity in the muscle, resulting in decreased metabolic heat production, whereas modifications in vascularization may enhance heat loss.
in the tm/c comparison, de genes were involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, cell proliferation, vascularization and muscle growth; when comparing heat-exposed chickens to their own controls, tm broilers developed more specific pathways than c, especially involving genes related to metabolism, stress response, vascularization, anti-apoptotic and epigenetic processes.
these specific changes could in part explain the better adaptation of tm broilers to heat.
a chicken gene expression microarray  was used to compare muscle gene expression profiles of control  and tm chickens  reared at 21 °c and at 32 °c  in a dye-swap design with four comparisons and  <dig> broilers per treatment.
this study improved the understanding of the long-term effects of tm on pm muscle.
real-time quantitative pcr  was subsequently performed to validate differential expression in each comparison.
