dimension reduction is a critical issue in the analysis of microarray data, because the high dimensionality of gene expression microarray data set hurts generalization performance of classifiers.
we demonstrate a framework for selecting feature subsets from all the newly extracted components, leading to reduced classification error rates on the gene expression microarray data.
not only the top features newly extracted by pca or pls are important, therefore, feature selection should be performed to select subsets from new features to improve generalization performance of classifiers.
experimental results illustrate that our proposed framework is effective to select feature subsets and to reduce classification error rates.
principle component analysis  and partial least squares  are two frequently used feature extraction methods, and in the previous works, the top several components of pca or pls are selected for modeling according to the descending order of eigenvalues.
here we have considered both an unsupervised method pca and a supervised method pls for extracting new components, genetic algorithms for feature selection, and support vector machines and k nearest neighbor for classification.
while in this paper, we prove that not all the top features are useful, but features should be selected from all the components by feature selection methods.
