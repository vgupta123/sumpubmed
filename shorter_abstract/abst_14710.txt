we did not find a significant difference between mirna signature of both groups.
here, we compared the mirna signature in wilms tumor patients prior and after preoperative chemotherapy according to siop protocol  <dig>
our results provide evidence for a blood-born wilms tumor mirna signature largely independent of four weeks preoperative chemotherapy treatment.
however both, wilms tumor patients prior and after chemotherapy showed a mirna signature different from healthy controls.
the signature of wilms tumor patients prior to chemotherapy showed an accuracy of  <dig> % and of patients after chemotherapy an accuracy of  <dig> %, each as compared to healthy controls.
blood-born mirna signatures have recently been reported for various tumor diseases.
