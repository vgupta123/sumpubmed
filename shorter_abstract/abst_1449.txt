for each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of o. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models arabidopsis thaliana and saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of homo sapiens.
many kinase clades in o. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas tkl and abc <dig> clades were expanded.
we also identified kinases that have been lost in a. thaliana but retained in o. tauri.
we conclude that o. tauri satisfies our two central requirements.
the greatly reduced kinome of o. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes.
several of its kinases are more closely related to h. sapiens orthologs than s. cerevisiae is to h. sapiens.
we conducted phosphoproteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases.
