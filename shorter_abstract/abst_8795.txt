these observations suggest that different sequences can share similar native topology with different stabilizing interactions and that the sequences of the prion and doppel proteins may have diverged under different evolutionary constraints resulting in different folding and stabilization mechanisms.
our analysis shows that prion and doppel have two different cores stabilizing the native state and that the relative contribution of the nucleus to the global stability of the protein for doppel is sensitively higher than for prp.
doppel is a protein that shares a similar native fold, but lacks the scrapie isoform.
understanding the molecular determinants of these different behaviours is important both for biomedical and biophysical research.
