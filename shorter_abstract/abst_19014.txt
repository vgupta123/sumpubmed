while in the non-diffusible case for the most part, spatial signalling reflects the temporal signalling behaviour, in the diffusible cases, we see significant differences between spatial and temporal signalling characteristics.
our results demonstrate that the presence of diffusible elements in the networks provides important constraints and capabilities for signalling.
our results provide a systematic basis for understanding spatial signalling in networks and the role of diffusible elements therein.
spatial signal transduction plays a vital role in many intracellular processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, polarity generation and cell division.
in all these cases, the driving signal has spatial variation.
these networks include coherent and incoherent feedforward, positive and negative feedback, cyclic motifs, monostable switches, bistable switches and negative feedback oscillators.
it is increasingly being recognized that a conceptual basis for studying spatial signal transduction in signalling networks is necessary.
in this work we examine spatial signal transduction in a series of standard motifs/networks.
it also provides a framework for starting to understand the organization and regulation of spatial signal transduction in individual processes.
furthermore it is being increasingly realized that the spatial dimension to signalling may play an important role in other apparently purely temporal signal transduction processes.
this provides many insights into the signal transduction capabilities and constraints in such networks and suggests ways in which cellular signalling and information processing is organized to conform to or bypass those constraints.
