a total of  <dig> actinobacterial strains were isolated from the marine sediments collected from various sites of port blair bay where no collection has been characterized previously.
the enhanced salt, ph and temperature tolerance of the actinobacterial isolates along with their capacity to secrete commercially valuable primary and secondary metabolites emerges as an attractive feature of these organisms.
majority of the isolates were found to produce industrially important enzymes such as amylase, protease, gelatinase, lipase, dnase, cellulase, urease and phosphatase, and also exhibited substantial antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
high diversity of marine actinobacteria was isolated and characterized in this work including undescribed species and species not previously reported from emerald andaman and nicobar islands, including streptomyces griseus, streptomyces venezuelae and saccharopolyspora salina.
the aim of the present study was to screen the actinobacteria for their characterization and identify the potential sources for industrial and pharmaceutical byproducts.
these results are reported for the first time from these emerald islands and expand the scope to functionally characterize novel marine actinobacteria and their metabolites for the potential novel molecules of commercial interest.

among  <dig> isolates, three strains  were found to generate appreciable extent of surfactant, amylase, cellulase and protease enzyme.
moreover, niot-vkkma <dig>  niot-vkkma <dig> and niot-vkkma <dig> synthesized  <dig>  u/ml,  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml amylase;  <dig>  u/ml,  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml of cellulase and  <dig>  u/ml,  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml of protease enzyme, respectively.
