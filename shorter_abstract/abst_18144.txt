we propose a non-parametric probabilistic model, similar to a document topic model, for detecting transcriptional programs, groups of cooperative transcription factors and co-regulated genes.
the analysis results in transcriptional programs which generalise both transcriptional modules and tf-target gene incidence matrices and provide a higher-level summary of these structures.
we discovered just  <dig> transcriptional programs that effectively summarised the action of  <dig> transcription factors on these genes.
one transcriptional program has a significant overlap with a reference set of cell cycle specific transcription factors.
the transcriptional programs it identifies potentially represent common mechanisms of regulatory control across the genome.
even if binding motifs for transcription factors are known, the task of finding binding sites by scanning sequences is plagued by false positives.
one way to improve the detection of binding sites from motifs is by taking cooperativity of transcription factor binding into account.
it simultaneously predicts which genes are co-regulated and which sets of transcription factors cooperate to achieve this co-regulation.
the programs we discovered enable biologists to choose new genes and transcription factors to study in specific transcriptional regulatory systems.
the method is independent of prior specification of training sets of genes, for example, via gene expression data.
transcriptional regulation is an important part of regulatory control in eukaryotes.
our method is able to pick out higher order structure from noisy sequence analyses.
