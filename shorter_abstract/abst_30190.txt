root hair-specific overexpression of wild-type pin <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> greatly inhibited root hair growth by depleting auxin levels in the root hair cell, whereas overexpression of m <dig> phosphorylation-defective pin mutants failed to inhibit root hair growth.
consistent with this root hair phenotype, the pm localization of m <dig> phosphorylation-defective pin <dig> and pin <dig> was partially disrupted, resulting in less auxin efflux and restoration of root hair growth.
however, the mutant pin <dig> protein levels were restored by wortmannin treatment almost to the wild-type pin <dig> level, indicating that the m <dig> motif of pin <dig>  unlike that of other pins, is implicated in pin <dig> trafficking to the vacuolar lytic pathway.
these results suggest that the m <dig> phosphorylation motif has been functionally conserved to modulate the intracellular trafficking of long-hl pins, but its specific function in trafficking has diverged among pin members.
pin-formed  efflux carriers contribute to polar auxin transport and plant development by exhibiting dynamic and diverse asymmetrical localization patterns in the plasma membrane .
recently, we reported that a phosphorylatable motif  in the pin3-hl is necessary for the polarity, intracellular trafficking, and biological functions of pin <dig>  in this study, using the root hair system for pin activity assay, we investigated whether this motif has been functionally conserved among long-hl pins.
