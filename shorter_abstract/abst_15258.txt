for demonstration purposes we apply our workflow to integrate two signaling pathways  from the biomodels database.
to support this task, we describe a semi-automatic workflow based on established software tools.
the reparameterization step is crucial, if the goal is to obtain a model that can reproduce the data explained by the individual models.
systems biology has motivated dynamic models of important intracellular processes at the pathway level, for example, in signal transduction and cell cycle control.
