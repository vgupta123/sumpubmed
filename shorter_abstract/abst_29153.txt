altogether, these results demonstrate that, in the archaeal domain, previously unrecognized archaea-specific che proteins are essential for relaying taxis signaling to the flagellar apparatus.
while the signal transduction system is conserved throughout archaea and bacteria, the archaeal flagellar apparatus is different from the bacterial one.
in-frame deletion strains for all three proteins were generated and analyzed as follows: a) photophobic responses were measured by a computer-based cell tracking system b) flagellar rotational bias was determined by dark-field microscopy, and c) chemotactic behavior was analyzed by a swarm plate assay.
the second targets the flagellar motor switch in order to modulate the switching frequency in response to external stimuli.
genes coding for duf <dig> proteins, however, were found to be integral parts of chemotaxis gene regions across the archaeal domain, and they were not detected in other genomic context.
the proteins constituting the flagellar motor and its switch in archaea have not yet been identified, and the connection between the bacterial-like chemotaxis signal transduction system and the archaeal motility apparatus is unknown.
two molecular systems drive this process: the motility apparatus and the chemotaxis signal transduction system.
strains deleted for the heat_pbs protein or one of the duf <dig> proteins proved unable to switch the direction of flagellar rotation.
heat_pbs proteins could be identified in the chemotaxis gene regions of all motile haloarchaea sequenced so far, but not in those of other archaeal species.
the first consists of the flagellum, the flagellar motor, and its switch, which allows cells to reverse the rotation of flagella.
