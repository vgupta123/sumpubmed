many small laboratories are interested in the characterization of a small number of proteins, e.g., how posttranslational modifications change under different conditions.
it is meant for small scale mass spectrometry laboratories that are interested in posttranslational modifications of known proteins.
the program and a tutorial are freely available for academic users at .
unmatched peaks can be further analyzed for unexpected modifications by searches against a local version of the unimod database.
they can also be analyzed for unexpected cleavages, a highly useful feature for proteins that undergo maturation by proteolytic cleavage, creating new n- or c-terminals.
we have developed a software tool called masssorter for administrating and analyzing data from peptide mass fingerprinting experiments on proteins with known amino acid sequences.
additional tools exist for visualization of the results, like sequence coverage, accuracy plots, different types of statistics, 3d models, etc.
two central and related tasks of proteomics are protein identification and protein characterization.
