this study demonstrates that the etec virulence regulator rns is required for the expression of all known 5b fimbriae.
since rns is also known to control the expression of additional etec fimbriae, including those within subclasses 5a and 5c, the inactivation or inhibition of rns could be an effective strategy to prevent etec infections.
dnase i footprinting revealed a rns binding site adjacent to the - <dig> hexamer of each fimbrial promoter.
the cs <dig> and pcfo <dig> fimbrial promoters carry a second rns binding site centered at - <dig> , relative to the rns-dependent transcription start site.
mutagenesis of either site reduced rns-dependent transcription from each promoter indicating that the molecules bound to these sites apparently function independently of one another, with each having an additive effect upon fimbrial promoter activation.
in this study we show that rns positively regulates the expression of these other subclass 5b members.
virulence is also dependent upon fimbrial adhesins that facilitate colonization of the small intestine.
