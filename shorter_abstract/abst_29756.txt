we also applied our method in a drug response study and found its performance to be better than regular screening methods.
however, results from high throughput analysis are often barely reproducible due to small sample size.
however, the raw data is either unavailable or hard to integrate due to different experimental conditions, thus there is an emerging need to develop a method for “knowledge integration” in high-throughput data analysis.
a new rank is generated based on two initial ranks:  knowledge based rank; and  marginal correlation based rank.
