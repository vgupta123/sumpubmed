splice variants from the akap <dig> gene  are vital components of neuronal and cardiac phosphatase complexes, ion channels, cardiac ca2+ handling and renal water transport.
a-kinase anchoring proteins  are molecular scaffolding proteins mediating the assembly of multi-protein complexes containing camp-dependent protein kinase a , directing the kinase in discrete subcellular locations.
species analyses of akap <dig> splice variants shows the ancestral akap <dig> splice variant is akap7α, while the ancestral long form akap <dig> splice variant is akap7γ.
this akap <dig> molecular evolution study shows that these vital scaffolding proteins developed in ancestral vertebrates and that independent mutations in the akap <dig> genes of rodents and early primates has resulted in the recent formation of akap7δ, a splice variant of likely lesser importance in humans than currently described.
akap <dig> gene alignments and two dimensional western analyses indicate that akap7γ is produced from an internal translation-start site that is present in the akap7δ cdna of mice and humans but absent in rats.
