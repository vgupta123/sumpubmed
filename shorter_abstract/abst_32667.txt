thus, there is no guarantee that the estimated null component will be no greater than the mixture density as it should be.
we show that it is necessary to estimate the mixture density and empirical null component simultaneously.
they have not been implemented for the differential analysis of 2d gel data.
in contrast to the published estimation method, we propose to estimate the mixture and null densities simultaneously using a constrained estimation approach, which relies on an iteratively re-weighted least-squares algorithm.
the proposed constrained estimation method always yields valid estimates and more stable results.
the estimation of the mixture density does not take into account assumptions about the null density.
the assumption about the null density is naturally taken into account in the estimation of the mixture density.
differential analysis of 2d gel images aims at finding proteins that change under different conditions, which leads to large-scale hypothesis testing as in microarray data analysis.
two-component empirical bayes  models have been widely discussed for large-scale hypothesis testing and applied in the context of genomic data.
the two-component eb model is a very useful for large-scale hypothesis testing.
the proposed estimation approach proposed can be applied to other contexts where large-scale hypothesis testing occurs.
two-dimensional polyacrylomide gel electrophoresis  is a powerful tool for analyzing the proteome of a organism.
we present an implementation of a two-component eb model for the analysis of 2d gel images.
this strategy is illustrated using a set of 2d gel images from a factorial experiment.
we demonstrate how to implement a two-component eb model for analyzing a set of 2d gel images.
in proteomic analysis, the theoretical null density is often not appropriate.
in the literature, the mixture and null densities of the test statistics are estimated separately.
