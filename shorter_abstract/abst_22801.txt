we also showed a specific binding of prpsc to the mucosal side of fish intestine in the absence of an active uptake of the prion protein through the intestinal wall.
these results indicate that scrapie 139a, and possibly bse, is quickly removed from fish tissues despite evidence of a prion like protein in fish and of a specific binding of prpsc to the mucosal side of fish intestine.
there is concern that pigs, poultry and fish bred for human consumption and fed with infected mbm would eventually develop bse or carry residual infectivity without disease.
scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy  belongs to the group of animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy .
in the framework of a eu-granted project we have challenged two species of fish largely used in human food consumption, rainbow trout  and turbot , with a mouse-adapted tse strain , to assess the risk related to oral consumption of tse contaminated food.
none of the fish tissues taken at different time points after oral or parenteral inoculation was able to provoke scrapie disease after intracerebral inoculation in recipient mice.
however, a few recipient mice were positive for prpsc and spongiform lesions in the brain.
fish challenged with a large amount of scrapie mouse brain homogenate by either oral or parenteral routes, showed the ability to clear the majority of infectivity load.
in trout, we also checked the "in vitro" ability of the pathological isoform of the mouse prion protein  to cross the intestinal epithelium when added to the mucosal side of everted intestine.
