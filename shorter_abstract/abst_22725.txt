beast analyses indicate that most sister species pairs originated during the pleistocene, suggesting that repeated glacial cycling may have played an important role in the recent diversification of this group.
molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that pleistocene-era climatic oscillations have played an important role in the speciation of this largely forest-dwelling group.
while these results uphold the recognition of philantomba, they do not support the monotypic savanna-specialist genus sylvicapra, which as sister to the giant duikers leaves cephalophus paraphyletic.
findings indicate strong support for four major lineages within the subfamily, all of which date to the late miocene/early pliocene.
phylogenies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bayesian analysis of concatenated mitochondrial, nuclear and combined datasets.
furthermore, several red duiker sister species pairs appear to be either paraphyletic  or exhibit evidence of mitochondrial admixture , consistent with their recent divergence and/or possible hybridization with each other.
our results also reveal the most well supported species phylogeny for the subfamily to date, but also highlight several areas of inconsistency between our current understanding of duiker taxonomy and the evolutionary relationships depicted here.
a total of  <dig> bp of sequence data was obtained from two mitochondrial genes and four nuclear introns.
the first of these to diverge was the dwarf duiker genus philantomba, followed by the giant, eastern and western red duiker lineages, all within the genus cephalophus.
duikers in the subfamily cephalophinae are a group of tropical forest mammals believed to have first originated during the late miocene.
these findings may therefore prove particularly relevant to future conservation efforts, given that many species are presently regulated under the convention for trade in endangered species.
