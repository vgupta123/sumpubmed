among them, matrix factorization  is advantageous for clustering gene expression patterns from dna microarray experiments, as it efficiently reduces the dimension of gene expression data.
here we evaluated the clustering performance of orthogonal and non-orthogonal mfs by a total of nine measurements for performance in four gene expression datasets and one well-known dataset for clustering.
in conclusion, the clustering performance of orthogonal and non-orthogonal mfs was appropriately evaluated for clustering microarray data by comprehensive measurements.
this study showed that non-orthogonal mfs have better performance than orthogonal mfs and k-means for clustering microarray data.
non-orthogonal mfs tended to show better clustering-quality and prediction-accuracy indices than orthogonal mfs as well as a traditional method, k-means.
specifically, we employed a non-orthogonal mf algorithm, bsnmf , that applies bi-directional sparseness constraints superimposed on non-negative constraints, comprising a few dominantly co-expressed genes and samples together.
non-orthogonal mfs including bsnmf showed also good performance in the functional enrichment test using gene ontology terms and biological pathways.
although several mf methods have been proposed for clustering gene expression patterns, a systematic evaluation has not been reported yet.
