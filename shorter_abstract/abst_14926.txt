we solve the long-standing debate about the origin of cuckoo eggs found on the nest rim: we gained the first direct video-recording evidence that eggs found on the nest rim were mislaid by parasites and not ejected by hosts.
although previous studies revealed that redstarts selectively eject experimental non-mimetic eggs , the hosts never ejected naturally-laid cuckoo eggs or cuckoo eggs cross-fostered into naturally non-parasitised nests.
in our highly parasitised nest-box population  only  <dig> % of cuckoo eggs were laid into the nest cup and incubated by redstarts.
in a long-term study , we explored a unique system between the brood parasitic common cuckoo  and its host, the common redstart  which is exceptional among all cuckoo hosts due to being a cavity nester.
surprisingly, cuckoo chicks either growing solitarily or with redstart chicks did not differ in their fledging success.
review of data from this and other study sites  demonstrates high variability in rejection rates and shows that populations facing higher parasitism rates reject parasitic eggs with higher frequencies.
host nests shifted availability to later into the breeding season from  <dig> to  <dig> and cuckoos followed this trend by also shifting their timing of parasitism.
this suggests that the sight of the laying cuckoo female is the primary cue that triggers egg rejection  in this host.
