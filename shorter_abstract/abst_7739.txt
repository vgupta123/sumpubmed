traditional methods of analysing gene expression data often include a statistical test to find differentially expressed genes, or use of a clustering algorithm to find groups of genes that behave similarly across a dataset.
the utility of coxpress is demonstrated using two publicly available microarray datasets.
coxpress can be used to find groups of genes that display differential co-expression patterns in microarray datasets.
here we describe coxpress, an r package that allows researchers to identify groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed.
however, these methods may miss groups of genes which form differential co-expression patterns under different subsets of experimental conditions.
