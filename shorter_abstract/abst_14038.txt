manool also is a minor diterpene of this species and the main diterpene of related salvia species.
most of the commercially-produced sclareol is derived from cultivated clary sage  and extraction of the plant material.
in clary sage, sclareol mainly accumulates in essential oil-producing trichomes that densely cover flower calices.
based on previous general knowledge of diterpene biosynthesis in angiosperms, and based on mining of our recently published transcriptome database obtained by deep 454-sequencing of cdna from clary sage calices, we cloned and functionally characterized two new diterpene synthase  enzymes for the complete biosynthesis of sclareol in clary sage.
sclareol is a diterpene natural product of high value for the fragrance industry.
a class ii ditps  produced labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate as major product from geranylgeranyl diphosphate  with some minor quantities of its non-hydroxylated analogue, -copalyl diphosphate.
a class i ditps  then transformed these intermediates into sclareol and manool, respectively.
sslpps and ssss are two monofunctional ditpss which, together, produce the diterpenoid specialized metabolite sclareol in a two-step process.
its labdane carbon skeleton and its two hydroxyl groups also make it a valued starting material for semisynthesis of numerous commercial substances, including production of ambroxÂ® and related ambergris substitutes used in the formulation of high end perfumes.
