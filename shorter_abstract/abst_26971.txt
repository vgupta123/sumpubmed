the drawback is that under a heavy-tailed model analytical expressions for the optimal superposition no longer exist.
we develop two iterative procedures, an expectation maximization algorithm and a gibbs sampler, to estimate the local weights, the optimal superposition, and the parameters of the heavy-tailed distribution.
the standard dissimilarity measure for protein structures is the root mean square deviation  of representative atom positions such as Î±-carbons.
to circumvent this problem we work with a scale mixture representation, which implies a weighted rmsd.
a scale mixture representation facilitates the fitting of these distributions and enables outlier-tolerant superposition.
to do so, we model non-rigid displacements in protein structures with outlier-tolerant probability distributions.
protein structure comparison is a central issue in structural bioinformatics.
these distributions exhibit heavier tails than the gaussian distribution underlying standard rmsd minimization and thus accommodate highly divergent structural regions.
we present a probabilistic method for robust superposition and comparison of protein structures.
heavy-tailed distributions are well-suited to describe large-scale conformational differences in protein structures.
applications demonstrate that heavy-tailed models capture differences between structures undergoing substantial conformational changes and can be used to assess the precision of nmr structures.
our method aims to identify the largest structurally invariant core.
how to evaluate optimal fits becomes a matter of debate, if the structures contain regions which differ largely - a situation encountered in nmr ensembles and proteins undergoing large-scale conformational transitions.
