our results suggest that dpscs from huntington monkeys retain asc properties.
to examine if mutant huntingtin  protein impacts dpsc properties, we have established dpscs from tooth germ of transgenic monkeys that expressed both mutant htt and green fluorescent protein  genes , and from a monkey that expressed only the gfp gene , which served as a control.
although mutant htt and oligomeric htt aggregates were overtly present in rhd/g-dpscs, all rhd/g-dpscs and rg-dpscs shared similar characteristics, including self-renewal, multipotent differentiation capabilities, expression of stemness and differentiation markers, and cell surface antigen profile.
thus dpscs derived from individuals with genetic disorders such as hd could be a potential source of personal stem cells for therapeutic purposes.
