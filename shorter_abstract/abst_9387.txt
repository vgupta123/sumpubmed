the transcriptional response of p. berghei to dha treatment in vivo in infected mice is similar to the p. falciparum in vitro culture ring and trophozoite responses, in which ribosomal protein genes are notably down-regulated.
a similar pattern of trophozoite transcriptomic change was observed from rna-seq data.
microarray data from dha-treated p. falciparum trophozoite stage parasites revealed a response pattern that is overall less trophozoite-like and more like the other stages of asexual development.
to address this question, we performed a transcriptomic study of dihydroartemisinin  response in p. falciparum k <dig> strain and in p. berghei anka strain using microarray and rna-seq technology.
control of malaria is threatened by emerging parasite resistance to artemisinin and derivative drug  therapies.
rna-seq data from dha-treated p. falciparum rings reveal a more muted response, although there is considerable overlap of differentially expressed genes with dha-treated trophozoites.
no genes are differentially expressed in dha-treated p. falciparum schizonts.
the art response pattern is revealed clearly from rna-seq data, suggesting that this technology is of great utility for studying drug response in plasmodium.
