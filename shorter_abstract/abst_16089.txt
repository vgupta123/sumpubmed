we show that both the epigenetic context and underlying sequences can be used to classify nucleosomal regions, with highly significant accuracy, as likely to either contain h2a.z or canonical histone h2a.
their presence on dna influences many cellular processes, such as transcription, dna replication, and dna repair.
its localization to specific genomic loci in human cells is presumed to depend either on the underlying dna sequence or on a certain epigenetic modification pattern.
nucleosomes are nucleoproteic complexes, formed of eight histone molecules and dna, and they are responsible for the compaction of the eukaryotic genome.
we analyzed the differences in histone post-translational modifications and dna sequences near nucleosomes that do or do not contain h2a.z.
