initial step of Î²-oxidation is catalyzed by acyl-coa dehydrogenase in prokaryotes and mitochondria, while acyl-coa oxidase primarily functions in the peroxisomes of eukaryotes.
unlike other bacteria acyl-coa oxidase and catalase activities were also increased in strain b <dig> by addition of alkane.
we hypothesized that alkane degradation pathways in thermophilic microorganisms could be premature and useful to understand their evolution.
oxidase reaction accompanies emission of toxic by-product reactive oxygen molecules including superoxide anion, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities are essential to detoxify them in the peroxisomes.
in the present study, we identified novel membrane proteins  and superoxide dismutase  whose production levels were significantly increased upon alkane degradation.
this eukaryotic-type alkane degradation pathway in thermophilic bacterial cells might be a vestige of primitive living cell systems that had evolved into eukaryotes.
