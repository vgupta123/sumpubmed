however, a. planci larvae have undistinguished morphological features compared with other asteroid larvae, hence it has been difficult to discriminate a. planci larvae in plankton samples without species-specific markers.
also, no tools are available to reveal the dispersal pathway of a. planci larvae.
to obtain genomic information for these purposes, the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome of a. planci and its putative sibling species, a. brevispinus were determined and their characteristics discussed.
the complete mtdna of a. planci and a. brevispinus are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in size, respectively.
the a + t contents of a. planci and a. brevispinus on their l strands that encode the majority of protein-coding genes are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively and are lower than that of a. pectinifera .
the percent similarity of nucleotide sequences between a. planci and a. brevispinus is found to be highest in the co <dig> and co <dig> regions  and lowest in nd <dig> gene  among the  <dig> protein-coding genes.
the gene arrangement, base composition, codon usage and trna structure of a. planci are similar to those of a. brevispinus.
however, there are significant variations between a. planci and a. brevispinus.
they contain  <dig> proteins,  <dig> rrna, and  <dig> trna genes and the putative control region in the same order as the asteroid, asterina pectinifera.
the crown-of-thorns starfish, acanthaster planci , has been blamed for coral mortality in a large number of coral reef systems situated in the indo-pacific region.
therefore the development of highly polymorphic genetic markers has the potential to overcome these difficulties.
complete mtdna sequences are useful for the study of phylogeny, larval detection and population genetics.
these values fall within the length variation range reported for other metazoan mitochondrial genomes.
because of its high fecundity and the long duration of the pelagic larval stage, the mechanism of outbreaks may be related to its meta-population dynamics, which should be examined by larval sampling and population genetic analysis.
