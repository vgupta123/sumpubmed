tested against all available mouse-human and zebrafish-human orthologs, we demonstrate that cat combines the specificity and speed of the best intra-species algorithms, like blat and sim <dig>  with the sensitivity of the best inter-species tools, like genewise.
here we present a new algorithm called cat .
the first group is used for intra-species alignments, among which are successful ones with high specificity and speed.
