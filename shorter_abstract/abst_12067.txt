the protein content of the cell pellets was higher in ebf cultured in medium containing hs than fbs.
large variations were found in the ability of fbs and hs to support growth and differentiation of ebf in monolayer culture.
indications of growth-promoting actions, increasing passage number as well as maintaining fibroblast morphology were found rather in fbs than in hs.
primary ebf were cultured on non-collagen coated flasks without serum or in the presence of fetal bovine serum  or horse serum  or in serum depleted medium.
airway fibroblasts have become a critical addition to all facets of structural lung tissue changes such as in human asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but little is known about their role in the equine recurrent airway obstruction, a disease that resembles to the human asthma.
