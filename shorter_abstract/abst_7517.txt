the entire genomes of t nigroviridis and d rerio are now available, and this has made it possible to check whether a mosaic structure associated with isochore properties can be found in these fishes.
however during more than  <dig> years of analysis, isochore characteristics have been studied and many important biological properties have been associated with the isochore structure of human genomes.
therefore, the gc content is the main property that allows the detection of isochore but more biological properties have to be taken into account.
among other vertebrates the presence of isochores depends upon the taxon; isochore are clearly present in crocodiles and turtles but fish genome seems very homogeneous on gc content.
the gc content is an excellent indicator of isochores in heterogeneous genomes as mammals.
the segmentation we obtained were well correlated with gc content and other properties associated to gc content such as gene density, the number of exons per gene and the length of introns.
in this study, hidden markov models were trained on fish genes  which were classified by using the isochore class of their human orthologous.
this method allows detecting isochores in homogeneous genomes.
