most studies on the origin and evolution of microrna in the human genome have been focused on its relationship with repetitive elements and segmental duplications.
furthermore, novel genomic regions were found to contain microrna paralogs for microrna families previously analyzed to be related to segmental duplications.
these novel microrna families expanded in the human genome were mostly embedded in or close to proteins with conserved functions.
together, we found that small duplication events could also contribute to microrna expansion, which could provide us novel insights on the evolution of human genome structure and function.
we found that for microrna families expanded in the human genome,  <dig> families are specific to the primate lineage, and nine are non-specific, respectively.
furthermore, besides the alu element, l <dig> elements could also contribute to the origination of microrna paralog families.
however, duplication events at a smaller scale  could also contribute to microrna expansion, as demonstrated in this study.
using comparative genome analysis and bioinformatics methods, we found nine novel expanded microrna families enriched in short duplicated sequences in the human genome.
two microrna families  appear to be further expanded in the human genome, and were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
