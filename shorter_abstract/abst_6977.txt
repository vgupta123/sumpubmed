we suggest a novel functional role for dna methylation in the transcribed region as a key determinant capable of restraining the capacity of a gene to respond to internal/external cues.
for arabidopsis, there are over  <dig>  microarray hybridizations representing many different experimental conditions on affymetrixâ„¢ ath <dig> gene chips alone.
remarkably, housekeeping genes were best distinguished from hypervariable genes by differences in methylation status in their transcribed regions.
we provide an example of this negative relationship using genes encoding tca cycle enzymes, by contrasting their regulatory responsiveness to nitrate and methylation status in their transcribed regions.
microarray technology is a widely used approach for monitoring genome-wide gene expression.
our findings suggest a prominent role for epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression in plants.
our results indicate that the arabidopsis transcriptome is largely established during development and is comparatively stable when faced with external perturbations.
the largest differences in gene expression were observed when comparing samples obtained from different organs.
we classified and compared control and treatment hybridizations and determined differential gene expression.
we defined "gene responsiveness" as the number of comparisons in which a gene changed its expression significantly.
moreover, methylation in the transcribed region was inversely correlated  with gene responsiveness on a genome-wide scale.
this huge amount of data offers a unique opportunity to infer the principles that govern the regulation of gene expression in plants.
