the framework and its source code are freely available, together with documentation and other resources, being illustrated with well documented case studies.
on the other hand, in the context of systems biology research, biological network visualization has reinforced its role as a core tool in understanding biological processes.
these tools are particularly interesting for me, since they allow overlaying phenotype simulation results or elementary flux modes over the networks.
over the last years, several methods for the phenotype simulation of microorganisms, under specified genetic and environmental conditions have been proposed, in the context of metabolic engineering .
these methods provided insight on the functioning of microbial metabolism and played a key role in the design of genetic modifications that can lead to strains of industrial interest.
the framework is based on an abstract layer, where the network is represented as a bipartite graph containing minimal information about the underlying entities and their desired relative placement.
an user-interface makes it possible to edit, manipulate and query nodes in the network, providing tools to visualize diverse effects, including visual filters and aspect changing .
