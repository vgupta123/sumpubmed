serotyping of  <dig> isolates identified complex 4b as the most prevalent , followed by 1/2a , and pfge analysis of  <dig> isolates showed a highly diverse l. monocytogenes population in ruminant herds.
within-herd prevalence investigated by individually analysing  <dig> sheep and  <dig> cattle detected  <dig> % of faecal shedders in sheep and  <dig> % in cattle.
these results suggested that cattle represent a potentially important reservoir for l. monocytogenes in the basque country, and highlighted the complexity of pathogen control at the farm level.
faecal samples from  <dig> animals per herd were collected from  <dig> herds  in the basque country and screened in pools by an automated enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay  to estimate the prevalence of positive herds.
listeria monocytogenes is among the most important foodborne bacterial pathogens due to the high mortality rate and severity of the infection.
the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and strain diversity of l. monocytogenes in healthy ruminants and swine herds.
l. monocytogenes is a ubiquitous organism occasionally present in the intestinal tract of various animal species and faecal shedding by asymptomatically infected livestock poses a risk for contamination of farm environments and raw food at the pre-harvest stages.
l. monocytogenes was isolated from  <dig> % of dairy cattle,  <dig> % beef cattle and  <dig> % sheep herds, but not from swine.
