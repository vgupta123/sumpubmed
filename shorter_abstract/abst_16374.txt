experimental results on rna-seq data generated from blood cell tissue of three hapmap individuals show that our methods yield increased accuracy compared to several widely used methods.
massively parallel transcriptome sequencing  is becoming the method of choice for studying functional effects of genetic variability and establishing causal relationships between genetic variants and disease.
furthermore, detection and genotyping of single nucleotide variants  requires statistical models that are robust to variability in read coverage due to unequal transcript expression levels.
the open source code implementing our methods, released under the gnu general public license, is available at http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/software/ngstools/.
