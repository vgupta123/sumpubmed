modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-dna interaction data available is static.
drem  <dig>  is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode.
combined, these changes improve the ability of drem  <dig>  to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.
drem  <dig>  provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks.
the dynamic regulatory events miner  uses a hidden markov model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors  activate genes and what genes they regulate.
first, we provide static interaction data for additional species.
with version  <dig>  a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced.
finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features.
however, several issues were not addressed by the original version.
