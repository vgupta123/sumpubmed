to better understand the unknown yet likely polygenic architecture in psoriasis, we applied a linear mixed model to quantify the variation in the liability to psoriasis explained by common genetic markers  in a han chinese population.
we also show that the variance explained by each chromosome is linearly correlated to its length , and quantify the impact of a polygenic effect on the prediction and diagnosis of psoriasis.
psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with a known genetic component.
we discuss these results in the context of the strong association between hla variants and psoriasis.
our results suggest that psoriasis has a substantial polygenic component, which not only has implications for the development of genetic diagnostics and prognostics for psoriasis, but also suggests that more individual variants contributing to psoriasis may be detected if sample sizes in future association studies are increased.
however, these markers explained only a small fraction of the estimated heritable component of psoriasis.
our previously published psoriasis genome-wide association study identified dozens of novel susceptibility loci in han chinese.
we explored the polygenic genetic architecture of psoriasis using genome-wide association data from  <dig>  han chinese individuals.
