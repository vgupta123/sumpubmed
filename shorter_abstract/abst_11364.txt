we compared the predicted amino acid sequences of  <dig> mips from several algae species of the phylum heterokontophyta  with the sequences of mips from other organisms.
these proteins are important in cells and organisms because they allow for passive transmembrane transport of water and other small, uncharged polar molecules.
the mip sequences of the studied chromists fell into several clusters that belonged to different groups of mips from a wide variety of organisms from different kingdoms.
two of these proteins belong to plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , four of them belong to glpf-like intrinsic proteins , and one of them belongs to a specific mipe subfamily from green algae.
