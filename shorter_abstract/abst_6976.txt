the dispensable genome disclosed by the pangenomic analysis seems to be a reservoir of new traits that have mainly been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and could confer evolutionary advantages over strains lacking them.
in industrialized cities l. pneumophila is commonly encountered in refrigeration towers and water pipes.
although many efforts have been made to eradicate legionella from buildings, it still contaminates the water systems.
we identified:  three islands related to anti-drug resistance systems;  a system for transport and secretion of heavy metals;  three systems related to dna transfer;  two crispr  systems, known to provide resistance against phage infections, one similar in the lens and alcoy strains, and another specific to the paris strain; and  seven islands of phage-related proteins, five of which seem to be strain-specific and two shared.
