similarly we confirm tmem <dig> up-regulation in the hypothalamus by rna in situ hybridization and western blot.
this links for the first time the hypothalamic-gonadal axis with this important regulator of inhibitory synapse formation.
the results implicate for the first time several transcription factors , proteases , and the orphan 10-transmembrane transporter tmem <dig> in the biology of gpr54/kisspeptin function in the hypothalamus.
the transcriptional networks regulated by these proteins in the hypothalamus have yet to be explored by genome-wide methods.
we show here, using  <dig> million exon mouse arrays  and quantitative polymerase chain reaction  validation to analyse microdissected hypothalamic tissue from gpr <dig> and kiss <dig> knockout mice, the extent of transcriptional regulation in the hypothalamus.
taken together, global transcriptional profiling shows that loss of gpr <dig> and kisspeptin are not fully equivalent in the mouse hypothalamus.
