we conclude that the zebrafish is an attractive model for the study of the kcnq  superfamily of genes, and are important to processes involved in neuronal excitability, cardiac anomalies, epileptic seizures, and hearing loss or tinnitus.
kcnqx genes encode slowly activating-inactivating k+ channels, are linked to physiological signal transduction pathways, and mutations in them underlie diseases such as long qt syndrome , epilepsy in adults , benign familial neonatal convulsions in children , and hearing loss or tinnitus in humans .
we analyzed zebrafish genomic clones containing putative kcnq <dig> sequences to identify transcripts and protein for this highly conserved member of the kcnq channel family.
using zebrafish genome resources as the source of putative kcnq sequences, we investigated the expression of kcnq1- <dig> in heart, brain and ear tissues.
