this strategy can be used to physically map duplicate loci, provide order information for loci in a small genetic interval or with no genetic recombination, and loci with conflicting hybridization-based information.
these results were integrated with bac fingerprint data generated by the arizona genomics institute  and the arizona genomics computational laboratory  to assemble the bac contigs using the fingerprinted contigs  software and contribute to the construction and anchoring of the physical map.
a total of  <dig> markers  anchored bac contigs to their genetic map positions.
five types of pcr-based sts markers were screened to assess potential uses for the bac pools.
the quality of the bac dna pools and their utility for identifying bacs containing target genomic sequences was tested using  <dig> pcr-based sts markers.
molecular markers serve three important functions in physical map assembly.
we employed a six-dimensional bac pooling strategy in combination with a high-throughput pcr-based screening method to anchor the maize genetic and physical maps.
the results can be viewed on the integrated map of maize  <cit> .
the requirement for six replicate positive amplifications makes this a robust method for use in large genomes with high amounts of repetitive dna such as maize.
first, they provide anchor points to genetic maps facilitating functional genomic studies.
