the hitherto unknown molecular background for black colour in dahlia is here presented.
not in all cultivars the same step of the anthocyanin pathway is affected, but the lack of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase activity is frequently observed and this seems to be based on the suppression of the transcription factor dvivs.
high activities were observed for all enzymes from the anthocyanin pathway whereas fns ii activity could not be detected or only to a low extent in  <dig> of  <dig> cultivars.
in the majority of black cultivars this is due to decreased flavone accumulation and thus a lack of competition for flavanones as the common precursors of flavone formation and the anthocyanin pathway.
more than  <dig>  cultivars of garden dahlia  are available showing flower colour from white, yellow and orange to every imaginable hue of red and purple tones.
flower colour in dahlia is a result of the accumulation of red anthocyanins, yellow anthochlors  and colourless flavones and flavonols, which act as copigments.

black cultivars accumulate high amounts of anthocyanins, but show drastically reduced flavone contents.
quantitative real-time pcr showed that fns ii expression in black cultivars is low compared to other cultivars.
no differences between black and red cultivars were observed in the expression of transcription factors ivs and possible regulatory genes wdr <dig>  wdr <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  3rmyb and del or the structural genes of the flavonoid pathway.
the low fns ii activity is reflected by decreased fns ii expression.
cdna clones and genomic clones of fns ii were isolated.
despite the suppression of fht expression, flavanone 3-hydroxylase  enzyme activity was clearly present in the yellow and white cultivars.
independently from the colour type, heterologous expression of the cdna clones resulted in functionally active enzymes.
fns ii possesses one intron of varying length.
