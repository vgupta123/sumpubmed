however, few studies have been performed to understand and follow viral gene expression, as it has been done in vertebrate herpesviruses.
massive mortality outbreaks affecting pacific oyster  spat in various countries have been associated with the detection of a herpesvirus called ostreid herpesvirus type  <dig> .
initial results provided information on  the virus cycle of oshv- <dig> based on the kinetics of viral dna replication and transcription and  host defense mechanisms against the virus.
in this work, experimental infection trials of c. gigas spat with oshv- <dig> were conducted in order to test the susceptibility of several bi-parental oyster families to this virus and to analyze host-pathogen interactions using in vivo transcriptomic approaches.
the divergent response of these oyster families in terms of mortality confirmed that susceptibility to oshv- <dig> infection has a significant genetic component.
two families with contrasted survival rates were selected.
moreover, the present study showed a positive correlation between viral dna amounts and the level of expression of selected oyster genes.
in the two selected families, the detected amounts of viral dna and rna were significantly different.
a total of  <dig> viral genes and five host genes were monitored by real-time pcr.
this result suggests that pacific oysters are genetically diverse in terms of their susceptibility to oshv- <dig> infection.
