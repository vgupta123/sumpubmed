the number of sulfur atoms in a molecule was correlated with the odor quality descriptors “garlic,” “fish,” and “decayed,” and large and structurally complex molecules were perceived to be more pleasant.
towards this goal, we tested the olfactory perception of  <dig> structurally and perceptually diverse molecules at two concentrations using a panel of  <dig> healthy human subjects.
using this dataset, we replicated several previous correlations between molecular features of the stimulus and olfactory perception.
many subjects used commercial products to describe familiar odorants, highlighting the role of prior experience in verbal reports of olfactory perception.
while there has been some progress in predicting the pleasantness and intensity of an odorant, perceptual data for a larger number of diverse molecules are needed to improve current predictions.
our work reveals robust correlations between molecular features and perceptual qualities, and highlights the dominant role of familiarity and experience in assigning verbal descriptors to odorants.
understanding the relationship between a stimulus and how it is perceived reveals fundamental principles about the mechanisms of sensory perception.
we discovered a number of correlations in intensity perception between molecules.
in addition, subjects were asked to apply  <dig> semantic odor quality descriptors to these stimuli, and were offered the option to describe the smell in their own words.
while this stimulus-percept problem is mostly understood for color vision and tone perception, it is not currently possible to predict how a given molecule smells.
nonspecific descriptors like “chemical” were applied frequently to unfamiliar odorants, and unfamiliar odorants were generally rated as neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
