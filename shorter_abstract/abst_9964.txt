to this end, the mass spectra of unlabeled metabolites measured in two media are necessary: in a minimal medium containing only derivatized metabolites and chemicals for derivatization, and in a complete cell incubated medium.
if d in the complete medium is greater than that in the minimal medium in at least one peak, then unchanged d is subtracted from the raw spectra of the labeled metabolite.
however, extracting such information requires special care, such as a correction for naturally occurring isotopes, or overlapping mass spectra of various components of the cell culture medium.
for some metabolites/fragments in the case  d was found to decrease when the tested substance was 13c labeled, and this isotopic effect also can be corrected automatically, if the user provides a measured spectrum of the substance in which the 13c labeling is known a priori.
