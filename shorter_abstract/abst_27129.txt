the rubber tree, hevea brasiliensis, is a species native to the brazilian amazon region and it supplies almost all the worldâ€™s natural rubber, a strategic raw material for a variety of products.
the results obtained in this study will contribute to the h. brasiliensis genetic breeding program focused on improving of disease resistance and latex yield.
then,  <dig>  single nucleotide variation  and  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  loci were discriminated from the sequences.
for  <dig> , the nucleotide variation at the predicted genomic location was confirmed, thus validating the different steps from sequencing to the in silico detection of the snvs.
one of the major challenges for developing rubber tree plantations is adapting the plant to biotic and abiotic stress.

this is the first study of the h. brasiliensis transcriptome, covering a wide range of tissues and organs, leading to the production of the first developed snp markers.
from  <dig> putative, mainly non-synonymous snvs located in cds sequences,  <dig> were checked for their ability to characterize  <dig> hevea genotypes by an allele-specific amplification technology.
transcriptome analysis is one of the main approaches for identifying the complete set of active genes in a cell or tissue for a specific developmental stage or physiological condition.
