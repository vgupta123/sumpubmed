analysis of sequence traces from the cnv identified that 63 bp reads bridging the breakpoint were present on both sides of the cnv, indicating that the cnv was generated by non-allelic homologous recombination using the 63 bp homologous sequences.
western blot analysis showed that the cnv results in a null allele of anxa <dig>  this association was replicated using a sample population size of  <dig> animals.
these results indicate that loss of maternal anxa <dig> causes embryonic mortality.
these results indicate that anxa <dig> is a maternal factor that is critical for embryo development.
although conception failures are mainly caused by embryonic mortality, the role of maternal genetic factors in the process remains unknown.
to identify cnv associated with embryonic mortality in japanese black cattle, we evaluated embryonic mortality as a categorical trait with a threshold model and conducted a genome-wide cnv association study for embryonic mortality using  <dig> animals.
we identified a deleted-type cnv ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp on bovine chromosome  <dig>  which was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> days after artificial insemination .
this study identified a deleted-type cnv encompassing anxa <dig> in cows that was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> days after ai.

however, conception rates in japanese black cattle have been gradually declining over the last two decades.
