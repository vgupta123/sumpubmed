we developed spang, a sparql client that has unique features for querying rdf datasets.
further, it enables combinatorial execution of multiple queries, each with a distinct target database.
although the powerful sparql protocol and rdf query language  provides a basis for exploiting rdf databases, writing sparql code is burdensome for users including bioinformaticians.
spang dynamically generates typical sparql queries according to specified arguments.
spang helps users to exploit rdf datasets by generation and reuse of sparql queries through a simple interface.
these features facilitate easy and effective access to rdf datasets and integrative analysis of distributed data.
this client will enhance integrative exploitation of biological rdf datasets distributed across the web.
toward improved interoperability of distributed biological databases, an increasing number of datasets have been published in the standardized resource description framework .
it can also call sparql template libraries constructed in a local system or published on the web.
