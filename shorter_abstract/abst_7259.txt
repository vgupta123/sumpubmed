we discuss how association of gal4-mof with the msl or nsl proteins could explain our results.
mof was fused to the dna binding domain of gal <dig> and targeted to the promoter region of uas-reporter genes in drosophila.
in the presence of gal4-mof, h4k16ac levels were enriched over uas-lacz and uas-arm-lacz reporter genes.
targeting mof to reporter genes led to transcription enhancement and acetylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  histone acetyltransferase activity was required for the full transcriptional response.
the latter utilizes the constitutive promoter from the arm gene to drive lacz expression.
immunostaining of polytene chromosomes showed that gal4-mof co-localized with msl <dig> to many sites on the x chromosome in male but not female nuclei.
however, in female nuclei that express msl <dig>  gal4-mof co-localized with msl <dig> to many sites on polytene chromosomes but dsred expression was reduced.
the msl complex is bound within active genes on the male x chromosome with a 3' bias.
however, dsred rna levels were about seven times higher in female than male larvae.
mof also associates with the non-specific lethal or nsl complex.
mutation of conserved active site residues in mof  reduced hat activity in vitro and uas-dsred activation in drosophila.
in contrast, the nsl complex is enriched at promoter regions of many autosomal and x-linked genes in both sexes.
in male drosophila melanogaster, the male specific lethal  complex is somehow responsible for a two-fold increase in transcription of most x-linked genes, which are enriched for histone h <dig> acetylated at lysine  <dig> .
incorporation of gal4-mof into the msl complex in males led to a lower transcription enhancement of uas-dsred but not uas-arm-lacz genes.
in contrast to the strong induction of uas-dsred expression, uas-arm-lacz expression increased by about 2-fold in both sexes.
