previous studies of m. agalactiae have shown it to be unusually homogeneous and there are currently no available epidemiological techniques which enable a high degree of strain differentiation.
some correlation was found between geographical origin and the vntr type of the isolates.
we have investigated the genetic diversity of  <dig> m. agalactiae isolates of wide geographic origin using vntr analysis and compared it with pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and random amplified polymorphic dna  analysis.
mycoplasma agalactiae is the main cause of contagious agalactia, a serious disease of sheep and goats, which has major clinical and economic impacts.
we have developed variable number tandem repeat  analysis using the sequenced genome of the m. agalactiae type strain pg <dig>  the pg <dig> genome was found to be replete with tandem repeat sequences and  <dig> were chosen for further analysis.
vntr analysis revealed unexpected diversity within m. agalactiae with  <dig> different vntr types discovered.
vntr analysis represents a useful, rapid first-line test for use in molecular epidemiological analysis of m. agalactiae for outbreak tracing and control.
simpson's index of diversity was calculated to be  <dig>  for pfge and  <dig>  for vntr analysis.
