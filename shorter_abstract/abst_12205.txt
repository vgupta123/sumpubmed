synthesis of colloidal thorium dioxide has been modified and its use as a suitable stain of acidic mucopolysaccharides and other anionic biopolymers from bacteria, either as whole mount preparations or as preembedment labels, is described.
bacterial outer cell wall layers, have been analysed at the ultrastructural level with electron energy loss spectroscopy  and electron spectroscopic imaging , leading to excellent contrast and signal strength for these extracellular biopolymers.
application of cationic hydrous tho <dig> colloids for tracing acidic groups of the bacterial surface and/or eps has been shown to be rather effective by transmission electron microscopy.
because of its high electron density and its good diffusibility it stains and outlines electro-negative charges within these biopolymers.
synthesis of cationic hydrous thorium dioxide colloids  has been originally described by m√ºller  <cit>  and groot  <cit>  and these have been used by groot to stain acidic glucosaminoglycans for ultrastructure research of different tissues by conventional transmission electron microscopy.
