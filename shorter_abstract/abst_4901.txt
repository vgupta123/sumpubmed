flowering time is a domestication trait of glycine max and varies in soybeans, yet, a gene for flowering time variation has not been associated with soybean domestication.
in light of the evolution of the gia gene, soybean domestication history for an early flowering phenotype is discussed.
h <dig> was genetically derived from h <dig>  and it was dominant and widely distributed among cultivated soybeans, whereas in wild populations, the ortholog of this domesticated haplotype h <dig> was only found in yellow river basin with a low frequency.
we further determined that the differences in gene expression of the three gmgia haplotypes were not correlated to flowering time variations in cultivated soybeans.
in the present work, we revealed that the geographic evolution of the giganteaa  haplotypes in g. max  and glycine soja .
three gia haplotypes  were found among cultivated soybeans and their wild relatives, yet an additional  <dig> diverse haplotypes were observed in wild soybeans.
however, only the truncated gmgia h <dig> could partially rescue gi- <dig> arabidopsis from delayed flowering in transgenic plants, whereas both gmgia h <dig> and h <dig> haplotypes could significantly repress flowering in transgenic arabidopsis with a wild-type background.
