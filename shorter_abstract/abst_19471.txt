this approach utilizes linear regression models of non-normalised hybridisation data to define methylation status.
mlda has advantages for analyzing methylation data from cpg island microarrays, since there is a clear rational for the definition of methylation status, it uses dmh data without between-group normalisation and is less influenced by cross-hybridisation of loci.
the study of such microarray data sets should ideally account for the specific biological features of dna methylation and the non-symmetrical distribution of the ratios of unmethylated and methylated sequences hybridised on the array.
log-transformed signal intensities of unmethylated controls on the microarray are used as a reference.
the signal intensities of dna samples digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes and mock digested are then transformed to the likelihood of a locus being methylated using this reference.
we have therefore developed a novel algorithm tailored to this type of data, methylation linear discriminant analysis .
hypermethylation of promoter cpg islands is strongly correlated to transcriptional gene silencing and epigenetic maintenance of the silenced state.
differential methylation hybridisation  is one technique used for genome-wide dna methylation analysis.
