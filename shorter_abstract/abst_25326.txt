senescence marker protein- <dig> , whose expression declines during aging in rat liver, has been proposed as an important aging marker.
mutation in sry site  showed maximum increase in reporter activity among these three sites.
twenty eight transcription factor binding sites have been identified by dnase i footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
this region contains cdxa, gata <dig> and sry transcription factor binding sites.
dna-protein interactions, mutation analysis and luciferase reporter assay studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of smp <dig> gene.
individual mutation of these three sites showed increase in reporter activity.
therefore, we suggest that sry like protein may be acting as a strong repressor of smp <dig> gene along with cdxa and gata- <dig>  we also report that mutation of both sp <dig>  and a c/ebpÎ²  transcription binding site located adjacent to each other on smp <dig> gene promoter, causes a significant enhancement in reporter activity than individual mutation, thus may be causing the repression of smp <dig> promoter activity.
transient transfection of 5' and 3' -deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region between -128/+ <dig> bp is sufficient to drive promoter activity.
we have mapped an essential regulatory region between - <dig> to - <dig> bp which causes a drastic decline of reporter activity.
