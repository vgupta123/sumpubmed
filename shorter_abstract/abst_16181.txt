this demonstrated a role of chemokine signaling during development of skeletal muscles.
previous reports emphasized co-operation of sdf1a and cxcr4b.
the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> and its ligand sdf <dig> are implicated in migration of several cell lineages, including appendicular muscles.
we found that during early myogenesis sdf1a co-operates with the second cxcr <dig> of zebrafish â€“ cxcr4a resulting in the commitment of myoblast to form fast muscle.
