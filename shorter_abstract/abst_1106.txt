this study describes  <dig> micrornas identified by deep sequencing of small rna isolated from tissues of the black flying fox, pteropus alecto, a confirmed natural reservoir of the human pathogens hendra virus and australian bat lyssavirus.
of the micrornas identified, more than  <dig> are unique amongst vertebrates, including a subset containing mutations in critical seed regions.
bats are a major source of new and emerging viral diseases.
micrornas are likely to play major roles in regulating virus-host interaction in bats, via dampening of inflammatory responses , and directly limiting the extent of viral replication, either through restricting the availability of essential factors or by controlling apoptosis.
clusters of rapidly-evolving micrornas were identified, as well as micrornas predicted to target genes involved in antiviral immunity, the dna damage response, apoptosis and autophagy.
