while cutting-edge machine learning techniques can recover these networks, exploring and interpreting the rewiring behavior is challenging.
information visualization shines in this type of exploratory analysis, motivating the development oftvnviewer , a visualization tool for dynamic network analysis.
many biological processes are context-dependent or temporally specific.
in this paper, we demonstrate visualization techniques for dynamic network analysis by using tvnviewer to analyze yeast cell cycle and breast cancer progression datasets.
