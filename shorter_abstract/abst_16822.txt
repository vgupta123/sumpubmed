to understand the organization and evolution of the p. monodon genome, a fosmid library consisting of  <dig>  colonies and was constructed, equivalent to  <dig> -fold coverage of the  <dig>  gb genome.
we found that microsatellite sequences were highly abundant in the p. monodon genome, comprising  <dig> % of the total length.
in particular, long and dense microsatellite sequences as well as abundant wssv-like sequences highlight the uniqueness of genome organization of penaeid shrimp from those of other taxa.
these results provide substantial improvement to our current knowledge not only for shrimp but also for marine crustaceans of large genome size.
high abundance of microsatellite sequences were also found in the transcribed regions.
the redundancy of various repeat types in the p. monodon genome illustrates its highly repetitive nature.
yet, we barely know anything about their genomic structure.
approximately  <dig>  mb of fosmid end sequences  from  <dig>  non-redundant reads representing  <dig> % of the p. monodon genome were obtained for repetitive and protein-coding sequence analyses.
approximately  <dig> % of the fess contained protein-coding sequences, and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein  gene and the innexin  <dig> gene homologues appear to be present in high abundance in the p. monodon genome.
overall, various types of repeats comprise  <dig> % of the p. monodon genome in length.
the black tiger shrimp  is one of the most important aquaculture species in the world, representing the crustacean lineage which possesses the greatest species diversity among marine invertebrates.
