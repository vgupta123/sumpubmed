multiple regression analysis indicated that endogamy in calves was associated with increased cd8+ t and cd21+ b lymphocytes, and decreased γδhigh t cells in peripheral blood.
calves with higher endogamy had higher levels of cd8+ t lymphocytes, whereas calves with lower endogamy had lower levels of γδlow t cells.
mitochondrial dna allows the separation of american zebu  and evaluate the effect of mitochondrial dna on productive traits of cattle.
however, the effect of endogamy and mitochondrial dna  on the immune system remains unclear.
cows with medium and lower endogamy had a lower percentage of b lymphocytes and γδlow t cells and cows with lower endogamy had higher levels of γδ t cells and γδhigh t cells, as well as the cd4+/cd48+ cell ratio.
age, endogamy, milk yield, and origin of mtdna were measured and their influence on immunological parameters was evaluated.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between endogamy, mtdna and immune parameters.
these results demonstrated for the first time that endogamy influences the immune system of cattle.
older cows had increased cd4+ t cells, decreased cd21+ and γδhigh t cells as well as increased cd4+/cd8+ and t/b ratio.
