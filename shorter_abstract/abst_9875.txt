this study aimed to explore the carriage rate of enterococci in the oral cavity of tunisian children and their antimicrobial susceptibility to a broad range of antibiotics together with their adherence ability to abiotic and biotic surfaces.
in this study,  <dig> e. faecalis  and  <dig> e. faecium  were detected.
among the  <dig> isolated e. faecalis,  <dig> strains  were slime producers and  <dig> strains were non-producers.
our result showed that  <dig> e. faecalis and  <dig> e. faecium strains adhered strongly to hep- <dig> as well as to a <dig> cells.
drugs resistance and strong biofilm production abilities together with a high phenotypic adhesion to host cells are important equipment in e. faecalis and e. faecium which lead to their oral cavity colonization and focal infections.
among the  <dig> e. faecium,  <dig> strains were slime producers.
enterococci are increasingly associated with opportunistic infections in humans but the role of the oral cavity as a reservoir for this species is unclear.
all the tested strains were able to adhere to at least one of the two tested cell lines.
