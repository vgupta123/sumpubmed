we therefore undertook this study to determine management and environmental factors in feedlots that influence the prevalence and environmental load of g. duodenalis cysts in fecal material deposited by feedlot cattle in the central and western united states.
management practices could be employed that would limit the probability that feedlot cattle shed g. duodenalis in their feces and therefore potentially limit contamination of their environment.
giardia duodenalis cysts were identified and counted using direct immunofluorescent microscopy.
g. duodenalis may have a deleterious effect on animal growth and performance, therefore its potential as a production limiting organism should not be discounted.
removing manure before placing a new group of cattle in a pen was associated with a decreased prevalence of g. duodenalis in fecal pats.
giardia duodenalis is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite that has emerged as a significant opportunistic human pathogen.
the estimated overall point prevalence of g. duodenalis was  <dig> %, representing feedlots from a wide range of climates and management systems.
higher environmental temperatures, increased animal density, and increased time in the feedlot were associated with a lower prevalence of g. duodenalis.
