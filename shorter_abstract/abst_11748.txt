advantages of this combination strategy, based on a similarity parameter for the identification of weak binding chemical entities, are illustrated in this work with the discovery of a new lead compound for nf-kappab.
the results obtained sustain the concept that the docking performance is predictive of a biochemical activity.
the transcription factor nf-kappab is a very interesting target molecule for the design on anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic drugs.
we enhanced the simple docking procedure by means of a sort of combined target- and ligand-based drug design approach.
further biochemical analyses based on emsa were performed and biological effects were tested on the compound exhibiting the best docking score.
all experimental analysis were in fairly good agreement with molecular modeling findings.
