large scale expression profiling through rpkm showed major transcriptome changes in response to temperature reflecting alterations in major biological processes and metabolic pathways, and provided insight of gc content and ssr markers.
large scale expression profiling through "read per exon kilobase per million ", showed changes in several biological processes and metabolic pathways including cytochrome p450s , udp-glycosyltransferases  and those associated with picrosides biosynthesis.
a total of  <dig>  assembled transcript sequences were obtained, with an average coverage of  <dig>  and average length of  <dig> .
study generated transcriptome of p. kurrooa at two different temperatures.
available  and in-house developed bioinformatics tools were used for assembly and annotation of transcriptome.
is an endangered plant species of medicinal importance.
analysis also identified putative cyps and ugts that could help in discovering the hitherto unknown genes associated with picrosides biosynthesis.
rpkm data were validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using a set of  <dig> genes, wherein  <dig> genes behaved in accordance with the two expression methods.
in order to gain insight into temperature mediated molecular changes, high throughput de novo transcriptome sequencing and analyses were carried out at 15°c and 25°c, the temperatures known to modulate picrosides content.
the transcriptome information of this species is limited with the availability of few hundreds of expressed sequence tags  in the public databases.
