the tnbs model of rat colitis has been described in detail at the transcriptome level.
the results were successfully validated in a subset of genes by real-time pcr.
we have characterized this model at the genomic level using a longitudinal approach.
six control rats were compared with colitic animals at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after tnbs administration .
trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid  induced rat colitis is one of the most widely used models of inflammatory bowel disease , a condition whose aetiology and pathophysiology are incompletely understood.
most genes were affected at more than one time point.
they were related to a number of biological functions, not only inflammation/immunity but also transport, metabolism, signal transduction, tissue remodeling and angiogenesis.
