more information about phyloxml itself, the xsd schema, as well as tools implementing and supporting phyloxml, is available at .
we developed a xml language, named phyloxml, for describing evolutionary trees, as well as various associated data items.
phyloxml is an xml language defined by a complete schema in xsd that allows storing and exchanging the structures of evolutionary trees as well as associated data.
gene trees used in comparative genomics or phylogenomics are usually annotated with taxonomic information, genome-related data, such as gene names and functional annotations, as well as events such as gene duplications, speciations, or exon shufflings, combined with information related to the evolutionary tree itself.
for example, in studies concerned with organismal relationships, tree nodes are associated with taxonomic names, whereas tree branches have lengths and oftentimes support values.
phyloxml provides elements for commonly used items, such as branch lengths, support values, taxonomic names, and gene names and identifiers.
evolutionary trees are central to a wide range of biological studies.
the data standards currently used for evolutionary trees have limited capacities to incorporate such annotations of different data types.
