it has been suggested that such complexes on dna represents a novel form of dna damage to cells.
in this report, we characterise the cytotoxicity and dna damage induced by the bisdioxopiperazine icrf- <dig> by a combination of genetic and molecular approaches.
accordingly, when yeast cells were exposed to equitoxic concentrations of icrf- <dig> and m-amsa, the expression of dna damage-inducible genes showed higher levels of induction after exposure to m-amsa as compared to icrf- <dig>  most importantly, icrf- <dig> stimulated homologous recombination in spd <dig> hamster lung fibroblast cells to lower levels than m-amsa at all cytotoxicity levels tested, showing that the mechanism of action of bisdioxopiperazines differs from that of classical topoisomerase ii poisons in mammalian cells.
our results point to important differences in the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by bisdioxopiperazines and topoisomerase ii poisons, and suggest that bisdioxopiperazines kill cells by a combination of dna break-related and dna break-unrelated mechanisms.
furthermore, complementation of the xrcc <dig> deficiency in irs1sf cells fully abrogated hypersensitivity towards both drugs.
while exposure of human small cell lung cancer  oc-nyh cells to m-amsa strongly induced Î³h2ax, exposure to icrf- <dig> resulted in much less induction, showing that icrf- <dig> generates fewer dna double strand breaks than m-amsa.
by utilizing a panel of saccharomyces cerevisiae single-gene deletion strains, homologous recombination was identified as the most important dna repair pathway determining the sensitivity towards icrf- <dig>  however, sensitivity towards m-amsa depended much more on this pathway.
homologous recombination  defective irs1sf chinese hamster ovary  cells showed increased sensitivity towards icrf- <dig>  while their sensitivity towards m-amsa was increased even more.
