paralogous gene copies within this segmental duplication can be aligned with genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize.
although these gene copies are preserved on both chromosomes, their expression patterns have diverged.
the recent duplication of a large chromosomal segment coupled with the high density of disease resistance gene clusters makes this the most recently evolved part of the rice genome.
because the resistance and defense response genes, enriched on these chromosomes relative to the whole genome, also occur in clusters, they provide a preferred target for breeding durable disease resistance in rice and the isolation of their allelic variants.
a total of  <dig>  non-transposable element related genes are present on these chromosomes.
when the gene order of rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was compared to wheat gene loci, significant synteny between these orthologous regions was detected, illustrating the presence of conserved genes alternating with recently evolved genes.
a three-mb segment on both chromosomes resulted from a duplication  <dig>  million years ago , the most recent large-scale duplication in the rice genome.
