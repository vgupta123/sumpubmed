for identification of immune-related genes in asian seabass lates calcarifer, an important marine foodfish species, we injected bacterial lipopolysaccharide , a commonly used elicitor of innate immune responses to eight individuals at the age of  <dig> days post-hatch and applied the suppression subtractive hybridization  technique to selectively amplify spleen cdna of differentially expressed genes.
of which,  <dig> transcripts were unknown/novel genes and the remaining  <dig> were similar to  <dig> known genes and  <dig> unannotated mrna sequences available in public databases.
the obtained immune-related genes may allow for a better understanding of immunity in asian seabass, carrying out detailed functional analysis of these genes and developing strategies for efficient immune protection against infections in asian seabass.
sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of  <dig> ests from two ssh libraries yielded  <dig> unique transcripts.
the present study identified  <dig> unique transcripts upon lps challenge for the first time in asian seabass by using ssh, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.
some of the identified transcripts are vertebrate homologues and others are hitherto unreported putative defence proteins.
innate immunity system is the first line of host defense in opposing pathogenic organisms or any other foreign material.
a total of  <dig> transcripts were classified to the category "response to stimulus" and  <dig> to "immune system process".
quantitative real-time pcr confirmed the differential expression of these genes after lps challenge.
fish diseases caused by pathogens are limiting their production and trade, affecting the economy generated by aquaculture.
