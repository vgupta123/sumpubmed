to determine associations between perioperative mortality after surgery for traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, medical records of  <dig> cats and  <dig> dogs that underwent diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy were reviewed.
for cats and dogs that underwent surgery for traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, increased anesthetic duration, increased duration of surgical procedure, concurrent soft tissue injuries, concurrent soft tissue and orthopedic injuries, and perioperative oxygen dependence were associated with increased mortality.
animals with concurrent soft tissue injuries had a  <dig>  times greater odds of mortality than those without soft tissue injury .
animals with concurrent soft tissue and orthopedic injuries had a  <dig>  times greater odds of mortality than those without soft tissue and orthopedic injuries .
for cats and dogs, increased duration of anesthesia and surgical procedure were associated with increased mortality .
the combined perioperative survival rate was  <dig> % .
