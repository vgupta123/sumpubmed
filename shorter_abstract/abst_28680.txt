aeromonas salmonicida and philasterides dicentrarchi are two pathogens that affect turbot culture causing serious economic losses to the turbot industry.
a total of  <dig> cdnas partially sequenced from three different cdna libraries of turbot  infected with aeromonas salmonicida, philasterides dicentrarchi and from healthy fish were analyzed.
a collection of  <dig> high-quality ests was generated representing  <dig> unique turbot sequences.
a large proportion of defence/immune-related genes were identified, many of them regulated in response to specific pathogens.
in contrast to other cultured flatfish, very few genomic resources are available in this species.
a total of  <dig> microsatellites, with  <dig> having sufficient flanking sequences for primer design, and  <dig> putative snps were identified from these est resources in turbot.
little is known about the molecular mechanisms for disease resistance and host-pathogen interactions in this species.
blast searches with public databases detected significant similarity  in  <dig>  sequences and  <dig> of them  could be functionally annotated.
three immune-relevant tissues  were sampled at several time points in the infection process for library construction.
in this work, thousands of ests for functional genomic studies and potential markers linked to ests for mapping ) are provided.
