in contrast, vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  transcript levels were not affected during infection of resistant vitis riparia or susceptible v. vinifera with plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of downy mildew, suggesting regulation of vvnpr <dig> activity at the protein level.
constitutive expression of vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  monitored in leaves of v. vinifera cv chardonnay was found to be enhanced by treatment with benzothiadiazole, a sa analog.
two cdnas named vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  were isolated from vitis vinifera cv chardonnay, encoding proteins showing 55% and 40% identity to arabidopsis npr <dig> respectively.
in this system, vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  expression was sufficient to trigger the accumulation of acidic sa-dependent pathogenesis-related proteins pr <dig> and pr <dig>  but not of basic chitinases  in the absence of pathogen infection.
overexpression of vvnpr <dig> has thus the potential to enhance grapevine defensive capabilities upon fungal infection.
in order to study defense response signalling to pathogens in vitis vinifera, we took advantage of its recently completed genome sequence to characterize two putative orthologs of npr <dig>  a key player in salicylic acid -mediated resistance to biotrophic pathogens in arabidopsis thaliana.
interestingly, when vvnpr <dig>  or atnpr <dig> were transiently overexpressed in vitis vinifera leaves, the induction of grapevine pr <dig> was significantly enhanced in response to p. viticola.
as a consequence, manipulating vvnpr <dig> and other signalling elements could open ways to strengthen disease resistance mechanisms in this crop species.
in conclusion, our data identified grapevine homologs of npr <dig>  and their functional analysis showed that vvnpr <dig>  and vvnpr <dig>  likely control the expression of sa-dependent defense genes.
grapevine protection against diseases needs alternative strategies to the use of phytochemicals, implying a thorough knowledge of innate defense mechanisms.
however, signalling pathways and regulatory elements leading to induction of defense responses have yet to be characterized in this species.
