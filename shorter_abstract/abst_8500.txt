the alanine racemases gene from s. pneumoniae  was amplified by pcr and cloned and expressed in escherichia coli.
in an alanine racemases photometric assay, specific activities of  <dig>  and  <dig>  u mg- <dig> were determined for the conversion of d- to l-alanine and l- to d-alanine, respectively.
the enzyme shows sufficient homology with other alanine racemases to allow its integration into our ongoing structure-based drug design project.
clinical isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia or otitis media often display resistance to two or more antibiotics.
alanine racemase, a ubiquitous enzyme among bacteria and absent in humans, provides the essential cell wall precursor, d-alanine, which forms part of the tetrapeptide crosslinking the peptidoglycan layer.
we have isolated and characterized the alanine racemase gene from the opportunistic human pathogen s. pneumoniae.
the  <dig> amino acid,  <dig> da dimeric enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and preliminary crystals were obtained.
racemic activity was demonstrated through complementation of an alr auxotroph of e. coli growing on l-alanine.
given the need for new therapeutics, we intend to investigate enzymes of cell wall biosynthesis as novel drug targets.
