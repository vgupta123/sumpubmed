the actinopterygian gal- <dig> genes, in contrast, did not acquire the non-coding motif and underwent positive selection.
having previously observed a phylogenetic constraint on gal- <dig> structure across vertebrates, we asked whether evolutionary changes of gal- <dig> could have critically contributed to the origin of the tetrapod pattern.
among vertebrates with paired appendages, chondrichthyan fins typically have one or more cartilage plates and many repeating parallel endoskeletal elements, actinopterygian fins have more varied patterns of nodules, bars and plates, while tetrapod limbs exhibit tandem arrays of few, proximodistally increasing numbers of elements.
