in bohv- <dig> genome two major immediate early genes  are present, ie <dig> and ie <dig>  ie <dig> is an essential gene because its removal from the viral genome renders the virus unable to replicate, whereas for ie <dig> no many functional information are available.
although the real function of bohv-4ie <dig> is still elusive, a new bohv- <dig> genome gene locus as a target site for the insertion of foreign dna and resulting in the attenuation of the virus has been revealed.
in this work, ie <dig> contribution in initiating and maintaining bohv- <dig> lytic replication was assessed generating a recombinant bohv- <dig> genome lacking of ie <dig> gene, bohv-4Δie <dig>  in contrast to bohv-4ie <dig> deleted mutant, bohv-4Δie <dig> infectious replicating viral particles  could be reconstituted following viral dna electroporation in permissive cells.
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  is a gammaherpesvirus whose genome was cloned as bacterial artificial chromosome  and exploited as a gene delivery vector for vaccine purposes.
