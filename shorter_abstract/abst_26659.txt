populations from each side of the contact zone showed depressed genetic diversity and very strong differentiation .
here we conduct a multi-locus field study to investigate a contact zone between two lineages of green toads with an estimated divergence time of  <dig>  my, and report results from preliminary experimental crosses.
genetic patterns at the contact zone are molded by drift and selection.
local effective sizes are reduced by the geography and history of the contact zone, b. balearicus populations being at the front wave of a recent expansion .
selection against hybrids likely results from intrinsic genomic causes , possibly reinforced by local adaptation .
our results, show that these lineages have evolved almost complete reproductive isolation after some  <dig>  my of divergence, contrasting sharply with evidence from laboratory experiments that some anuran species may still produce viable f <dig> offspring after >  <dig> my of divergence.
little is known about secondary contacts of recently diverged anuran species.
one key question in evolutionary biology deals with the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation.
preliminary experimental crosses point to a slightly reduced fitness in f <dig> hybrids, a strong hybrid breakdown in backcrossed offspring  and a complete and early mortality in f <dig> .
