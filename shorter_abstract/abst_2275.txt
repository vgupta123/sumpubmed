slight variations in the smai-pfge pattern of the clinical mrsa isolates belonging to this clone were traced back to differences in the sizes of the sccmec j <dig> regions and/or to a  <dig> -kb deletion extending from iss* to the right end iss.
an extremely low level methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  belonging to st <dig>  circulates among intravenous drug users in the zurich area.
this clone carried a new  <dig> -kb element, termed sccmecn <dig>  containing a class b mec complex , a truncated tn <dig> harbouring the dfra gene, and a fusb <dig> gene, conferring methicillin, trimethoprim and low level fusidic acid resistance, respectively.
mrsa clones carrying the shorter sccmec with the  <dig> -kb deletion were usually ciprofloxacin resistant, while strains with the complete sccmecn <dig> were co-trimoxazole resistant or had no additional resistances.
