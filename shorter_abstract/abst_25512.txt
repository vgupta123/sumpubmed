it appears that this process is accelerated in the tissue fragments compared to intact tissue.
recent studies in vivo indicate that short-term regulation of lipoprotein lipase  in rat adipose tissue is post-translational and occurs by a shift of the lipase protein towards an inactive form under the influence of another gene with short-lived message and product.
when explants of rat epididymal adipose tissue were incubated, lpl mass and activity decreased rapidly.
addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors to the incubation medium slowed down the decrease of lpl mass.
the decrease of lpl mass and activity that occurs when explants of rat adipose tissue are incubated is due to proteolysis of extracellular lpl.
the objective of the present study was, therefore, to explore if explants of adipose tissue could be used for studies of the regulatory process.
fragmentation of the labelled lipase occurred in conditioned medium and this process was virtually abolished by two mmp inhibitors.
