we pose and solve the population sequencing design problem and subsequently apply standard optimization techniques that maximize the discovery probability.
specifically, optimal processing occurs at constant values of the per-sample redundancy, refuting current notions that sample size should be selected outright.
optimal project-wide redundancy and sample size are then shown to be inversely proportional to the desired variant frequency.
our results largely concur with the empirical design of the thousand genomes project, though they furnish some additional refinement.
the optimization principles reported here dramatically simplify the design process and should be broadly useful as rare-variant projects become both more important and routine in the future.
we find that parameter values characteristic of rare-variant projects lead to a general, yet remarkably simple set of optimization rules.
