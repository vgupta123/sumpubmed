results of the characterization studies, and the high degree of identity with human germline genes, altogether make this anti-ricin scfv, or an igg derived from it, a likely candidate for use in humans to minimize effects caused by ricin intoxication.
anti-ricin antibodies provide the only known therapeutic against ricin intoxication.
the neutralization capacity of 43rca compared favourably with that of polyclonal anti-deglycosylated a chain  iggs, obtained from hyperimmune mouse serum, which were more efficient than any monoclonal at our disposal.
43rca had a high, picomolar affinity  and neutralized ricin efficiently .
it is easily extracted from a ubiquitously grown plant, ricinus communis, and thus readily available for use as a bioweapon .
