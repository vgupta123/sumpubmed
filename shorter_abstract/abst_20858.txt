high kappa ic and % values of gene promoters were also directly associated with the most frequent genetic diseases.
the arrangement of chromosomes according to kappa ic values of promoters, shows a striking symmetry between the chromosome length and the structure of promoters located on them.
in order to measure the structural similarity of gene promoters, we used two-dimensional image-based patterns obtained through kappa index of coincidence  and % values.
the center of weight of each promoter pattern indicated a structure similarity between promoters of each chromosome.
in this hypothesis, heterochromatin and euchromatin domains exchange dna sequences according to a difference in the rate of slipped strand mispairing and point mutations.
taking into consideration these observations, a general hypothesis for the evolutionary dynamics of the genome has been proposed.
our findings are based on comprehensive data from transcriptional regulatory element database and a new computer model whose core is using kappa index of coincidence.
gene promoters have guided evolution processes for millions of years.
to fully understand the connections between homo sapiens chromosomes and their gene promoters, we analyzed  <dig> promoter sequences using our kappa index of coincidence method.
furthermore, the proximity of chromosomes seems to be in accordance to the structural similarity of their gene promoters.
in this paper we showed that gene promoters appear to be specific to each chromosome.
furthermore, the proximity between chromosomes seems to be in accordance to the structural similarity of their gene promoters.
