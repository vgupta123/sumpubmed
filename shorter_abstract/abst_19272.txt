to identify a spectrum of mutations, after long-term propagation, we combined whole genome sequencing  and oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization  analysis of a c. elegans strain that was propagated, in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf-1/mad <dig>  for a total of  <dig> generations, with samples taken for long term storage  in generations  <dig> and  <dig>  we compared the genomes of f <dig> and f <dig> strains and identified  <dig> substitutions,  <dig> indels,  <dig> duplications, and  <dig> deletions larger than 20 bp.
whole and partial chromosome losses or gains and structural chromosome changes are hallmarks of human tumors.
phenotypic analysis of this strain revealed remarkable fitness recovery indicating that mutations, which have accumulated in the strain, are not only tolerated but also cooperate to achieve long-term population survival in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf- <dig>  furthermore, deletions larger than 20 bp were the only variants that frequently occurred in g-rich dna.
we showed that  <dig> of the possible  <dig> predicted monog/c tracts, larger than 14 bp, were deleted in unc- <dig> mdf- <dig> such-4; dog-1 f <dig> .
in caenorhabditis elegans, faithful transmission of g-rich dna is ensured by the dog-1/fancj deadbox helicase.
here, we identified variants that accumulated in c. elegans’ genome after long-term propagation in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf- <dig>  we showed that dna sequences, with g4-forming potential, are vulnerable to deletion-formation in this genetic background.
