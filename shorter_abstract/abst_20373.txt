a network construction was created and links between the selected mirs, the predicted targets as well as the possible interactions among them and other proteins were built up.
hepatocellular carcinoma  is an aggressive epithelial tumor which shows very poor prognosis and high rate of recurrence, representing an urgent problem for public healthcare.
then, enrichment annotation analysis was performed revealing significant clusters, including some playing a role in ion transporter activity, regulation of receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, protein import into nucleus, regulation of intracellular protein transport, regulation of cell adhesion, growth factor binding, and regulation of tgf-beta/smad signaling pathway.
because of the thousands of potential interactions between a single mir and target mrnas, bioinformatics prediction tools are very useful to facilitate the task for individuating and selecting putative target genes.
in addition, we describe an established bioinformatics approach to highlight putative target genes and protein interaction networks where they are involved.
the mirs were subjected to four of the most used predictions tools and  <dig> predicted target genes were identified.
in this study, we combined mirna expression analysis, obtained by an in vivo hcc mouse model, with a bioinformatics-based workflow.

new genes, pathways and protein interactions, putatively involved in hcc initiation and progression, were identified and explored.
