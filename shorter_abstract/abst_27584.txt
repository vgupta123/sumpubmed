this promoter is the putative bovine homologue of the human u6- <dig> snrna promoter, and features a number of functional sequence elements that are characteristic of these types of pol.
to develop a shrna expression vector specifically for bovine rnai applications, we identified and characterised a novel bovine u <dig> small nuclear rna  promoter from bovine sequence data.
we have mined data from the bovine genome sequencing project to identify a functional bovine u <dig> promoter and used the promoter sequence to construct a shrna expression vector.
the use of this native bovine promoter in shrna expression is an important component of our future development of rnai therapeutic and transgenic applications in bovine species.
the promoter was then used to express shrnas, which resulted in the efficient knockdown of an exogenous reporter gene and an endogenous bovine gene.
a pcr based cloning strategy was used to incorporate this promoter sequence into plasmid vectors along with shrna sequences for rnai.
