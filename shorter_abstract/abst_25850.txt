the objective of this study is to compare in vitro the photodynamic effect of methylene blue , rose bengal  and curcumin  in combination with white light on the cariogenic microorganism s. mutans, s. sanguis and c. albicans.
c. albicans required higher concentrations of all photosensitizers to obtain a fungicidal effect, being mb the most efficient and cur ineffective.
antimicrobial photodynamic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to suppress subgingival species.
photodynamic therapy with mb, rb and cur inhibited  <dig> log  <dig> the growth of both bacteria but at different concentrations:  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml rb were needed to photoinactivate s. mutans and s. sanguis, respectively;  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml mb for both species; whereas higher cur concentrations  were required to obtain the same reduction in s. mutans and s. sanguis viability respectively.
photodynamic therapy with rb, mb and cur and white light is effective in killing s. mutans and s. sanguis strains, although mb and rb are more efficient than cur.
this results from the balance among streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans in the dental biofilm.
not all the photosensitizers have the same photodynamic effect against the different microorganims.
incubation time had no effect in all experiments.
