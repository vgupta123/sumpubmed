we evaluated an inter-specific gh Ã— gb recombinant inbred line  population for fiber characteristics in  <dig> independent experiments under field and glasshouse conditions.
qtl analyses were performed on a per-site basis by composite interval mapping.
the consistent chromosomal regions contributing to fiber quality traits constitute good candidates for the further dissection of the genetic and genomic factors underlying important fiber characteristics, and for marker-assisted selection.
most consistent meta-clusters were identified for fiber color on chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  fineness on c <dig>  and fiber length on c <dig>
sites were located on  <dig> continents and  <dig> countries and some locations were analyzed over multiple years.
the two tetraploid species, g. barbadense  and g. hirsutum , differ significantly in their fiber properties, the former having much longer, finer and stronger fibers that are highly prized.
among the  <dig> putative qtls ,  <dig> had a lod exceeding permutation based thresholds.
a meta-analysis of more than a thousand putative qtls was conducted with metaqtl software to integrate qtl data from the ril and  <dig> backcross populations  and to compare them with the literature.
the ril population displayed a large variability for all major fiber traits.
cotton fibers  are the premier natural fibers for textile production.
coincidence in qtl location across data sets was assessed for the fiber trait categories strength, elongation, length, length uniformity, fineness/maturity, and color.
