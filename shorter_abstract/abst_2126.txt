statistical analysis of data obtained was performed by mann whitney test.
statistical analysis of data obtained revealed that only the levels of anti-ttg- <dig> iga immunoreactivity in patients with mm were significantly higher than these obtained in healthy controls
the higher serum iga immunoreactivity to gliadin was found in 14/ <dig> patients and in one of control people.
the aim of this work was to assess whether some of food antigens contribute to the imbalance of immune response by screening the sera of mm patients for their immunoreactivity to food constituent gliadin, to tissue transglutaminase- <dig>  and to ro/ssa antigen.
the enhanced serum igg immunoreactivity to ross√Ä antigen was found in 9/ <dig> analyzed mm patients' sera.
data obtained showed the existence of the enhanced serum immunoreactivity to gliadin, ttg- <dig> and ro/ssa antigens in some patients with mm.
sera from  <dig> patients with mm in various stages of disease, before, or after some cycles of conventional therapy were analyzed by commercial binding site elisa tests.
multiple myeloma  is a clonal b-cell disorder with many immunological disturbances.
the enhanced iga immunoreactivity to ttg- <dig> was found in 10/ <dig> patients' sera, while 4/ <dig> patients had higher serum igg immunoreactivity.
these at least partially could contribute to the immunological imbalance frequently found in this disease.
the control group consisted of  <dig> healthy volunteers.
