elucidating the genetic basis of human diseases is a central goal of genetics and molecular biology.
prodige implements a novel machine learning strategy based on learning from positive and unlabeled examples, which allows to integrate various sources of information about the genes, to share information about known disease genes across diseases, and to perform genome-wide searches for new disease genes.
prodige implements a new machine learning paradigm for gene prioritization, which could help the identification of new disease genes.
while traditional linkage analysis and modern high-throughput techniques often provide long lists of tens or hundreds of disease gene candidates, the identification of disease genes among the candidates remains time-consuming and expensive.
we propose prodige, a novel algorithm for prioritization of disease genes.
efficient computational methods are therefore needed to prioritize genes within the list of candidates, by exploiting the wealth of information available about the genes in various databases.
