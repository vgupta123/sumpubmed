this method decreases the search space of predicting gene regulatory networks without degrading the solution accuracy compared with the greedy hill climbing  method.
bayesian networks  have been widely used to estimate gene regulatory networks.
the results demonstrate that this approach can predict regulatory networks with reduced computational time without degrading the solution accuracy compared with the ghc method.
in this paper, we present a novel bn-based deterministic method with reduced computational time that allows cyclic structures.
the first problem is that bn-based methods require huge computational time to estimate large-scale networks.
many bn methods have been developed to estimate networks from microarray data.
the order of computational time is the cube of number of genes.
we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for all known gene regulatory networks and their expression profiles.
