the temporally diverse nature of these events suggests that an epigenetic memory of the plants' apomixis status exists throughout its life cycle, which triggers, during multiple life cycle phases, temporally distinct processes that accelerate reproduction.
whether meiosis and sexual es formation also occur precociously in facultative apomicts  has not been studied.
we determined onset timing of meiosis and sexual es formation for  <dig> sorghum bicolor genotypes, many of which produced 2n es facultatively.
genotype differences for onset timing of meiosis and sexual es formation, relative to ovule development, were highly significant.
genotypes that produced these aposporous es underwent meiosis and sexual es formation precociously.
the present study adds meiosis and sexual es formation to floral induction, apomictic es formation, and parthenogenesis as processes observed to occur precociously in apomictic plants.
a major source of variation in timing of sexual germline development was presence or absence of apomictic es, which formed from nucellar cells  in some genotypes.
in many apomicts, 2n es form precociously during ovule development.
