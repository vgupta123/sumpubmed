myc is thus the first transcription factor, whose functional role has been experimentally established in echinoderm regeneration.
the major obstacle for understanding these molecular pathways has been the lack of functional genomic studies on regenerating adult echinoderms.
here, we employ rna interference-mediated gene knockdown to characterize the role of myc during the early  post-injury response in the radial nerve cord of the sea cucumber holothuria glaberrima.
the specific function of this gene, however, remained unknown.
adult echinoderms can completely regenerate major parts of their central nervous system even after severe injuries.

even though this capacity has long been known, the molecular mechanisms that drive fast and complete regeneration in these animals have remained uninvestigated.
here we demonstrate that knockdown of myc inhibits dedifferentiation of radial glia and programmed cell death, the two most prominent cellular events that take place in the regenerating sea cucumber nervous system shortly after injury.
in this study, we show that myc overexpression is required for proper dedifferentiation of radial glial cells and for triggering the programmed cell death in the vicinity of the injury.
