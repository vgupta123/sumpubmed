for x. volvulus, x. perforans, and x. affinis there was evidence of ancient establishment in numerous regions, but also of abundant recent introductions into previously colonized areas.
the introduction rate of invasive species has accelerated dramatically in recent times due to human activity , with a steadily growing pool of widespread tramp species.
our results indicate that current human-aided transoceanic dispersal has strongly affected the genetic makeup of three of the species in this study.
however, current biogeographical patterns of all four species are equally, if not more strongly, influenced by ancient establishment on different continents.
for x. ferrugineus, we found clear biogeographical structuring of old clades, but little evidence for recent successful introductions.
the unique combination of reproductive traits and broad host plant usage pre-adapts these beetles for colonizing of new areas.
