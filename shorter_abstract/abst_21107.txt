genomic dna was extracted from male and female  s. mansoni adults and sequenced with a genome analyzer .
the majority of w-specific sequences are repeats .
arbitrarily selected w-specific sequences were confirmed by pcr.
we used this method to identify sex-specific sequences of the human blood fluke schistosoma mansoni.
primers designed for unique and repetitive sequences allowed to reliably identify the sex of both larval and adult stages of the parasite.
sequences are available at the ncbi sequence read archive http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/sra/ under study accession number sra <dig> .
emerging methods of massive sequencing that allow for rapid re-sequencing of entire genomes at comparably low cost are changing the way biological questions are addressed in many domains.
