antioxidant defense mechanisms were also analysed.
our results indicate that growth capacity in urine is not a property of abu strains.
human urine is a very complex growth medium that could be perceived by certain bacteria as a stressful environment.
however, e. coli isolates respond very differently to this stressful environment.
uropathogenic strains of escherichia coli cause symptomatic infections whereas asymptomatic bacteriuria  strains are well adapted for growth in the human urinary tract, where they establish long-term bacteriuria.
in addition, no correlation between tbars level and the phylogroup or pathogenic group is apparent.
to investigate a possible imbalance between endogenous oxidative response and antioxidant mechanisms, lipid oxidative damage estimated as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  content was evaluated in twenty-one e. coli belonging to various pathovars and phylogenetic groups.
in strain abu  <dig>  on one hand, the increased level of endogenous reactive oxygen species may be responsible for adaptive mutations.
the growth of abu strain  <dig> was associated with a high level of tbars and more active antioxidant defenses that reduce the imbalance.
during exponential growth in urine, tbars level differs between strains, without correlation with the ability to grow in urine which was similarly limited for commensal, abu and uropathogenic strains.
on the other hand, a more active antioxidant defense system could increase the capacity to colonize the bladder.
