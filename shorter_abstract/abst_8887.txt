the conservation score is implemented as a real time application designed to be integrated into other tools.
the conservation score improves the prediction of linear motifs, by discarding those matches that are unlikely to be functional because they have not been conserved during the evolution of the protein sequences.
the latter are involved in protein interactions and formation of regulatory complexes.
it is therefore desirable to efficiently predict linear motifs with some degree of accuracy, yet sequence database searches return results that are not significant.
it is currently accessible via a web service or through a graphical interface.
they are assembled from globular domains, segments of natively disordered polypeptides and short linear motifs.
on our benchmarking, the method accurately scores 86% of the known positive instances, while distinguishing them from random matches in 78% of the cases.
