terms describing individual side effects reported in sider are clustered with a semantic similarity measure into term clusters .
although both methods yield explicit models, inductive-logic programming method performs relational learning and is able to exploit not only drug properties but also background knowledge.
comparison of the two machine-learning methods shows that the inductive-logic-programming method displays a greater sensitivity than decision trees and successfully exploit background knowledge such as functional annotations and pathways of drug targets, thereby producing rich and expressive rules.
drug side effects represent a common reason for stopping drug development during clinical trials.
maximal frequent itemsets are extracted from the resulting drug x tc binary table, leading to the identification of what we call side-effect profiles .
improving our ability to understand drug side effects is necessary to reduce attrition rates during drug development as well as the risk of discovering novel side effects in available drugs.
these rules are successfully used for predicting seps associated with new drugs.
integration of background knowledge concerning both chemical and biological spaces has been combined with a relational learning method for discovering rules which explicitly characterize drug-sep associations.
frequent seps are explored on the basis of integrated drug and target descriptors using two machine learning methods: decision-trees and inductive-logic programming.
