mhc class i molecules present peptides derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic t cells, whereas mhc class ii molecules stimulate cellular and humoral immunity through presentation of extracellularly derived peptides to helper t cells.
incorporation of information about the residues flanking the peptide-binding core is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy.
nn-align is trained using a novel training algorithm that allows for correction of bias in the training data due to redundant binding core representation.
here, we present a novel artificial neural network-based method, nn-align that allows for simultaneous identification of the mhc class ii binding core and binding affinity.
the method is evaluated on a large-scale benchmark consisting of six independent data sets covering  <dig> human mhc class ii alleles, and is demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art mhc class ii prediction methods.
the nn-align method is competitive with the state-of-the-art mhc class ii peptide binding prediction algorithms.
the major histocompatibility complex  molecule plays a central role in controlling the adaptive immune response to infections.
identification of which peptides will bind a given mhc molecule is thus of great importance for the understanding of host-pathogen interactions, and large efforts have been placed in developing algorithms capable of predicting this binding event.
