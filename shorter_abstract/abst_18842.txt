among bones building the axial and appendicular skeleton, the mandible is characterized by unique morphological and functional traits.
serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor i  and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase  was also measured.
all the investigated morphometric, densitometric and mechanical parameters of the right and left mandibular halves were not significantly different .
the aim of the study was to evaluate morphological, densitometric and mechanical properties of mandible in 5-month-old polish merino sheep.
three-point bending test was applied to determine mechanical properties.
using computed tomography cross-sectional scans of the mandible, cross-sectional area, second moment of inertia, mean relative wall thickness and cortical index were determined.
however, positive correlations between the other investigated morphometric, densitometric and mechanical parameter of mandible were found .
there was no correlation of final body weight, mvbmd, cbca-ha, bap and igf-i with all the analyzed parameters of mandible .
relationships between morphological, densitometric and mechanical parameters of the mandible indicate that the elaborated experimental model may serve for further studies on metabolic responses of skeletal system to physiological, nutritional, pharmacological, toxicological and environmental factors.
using quantitative computed tomography, volumetric bone mineral density  and calcium hydroxyapatite density of the cortical bone , mean vbmd  and total bone volume were determined.
