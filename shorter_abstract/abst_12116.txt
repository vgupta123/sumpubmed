in these cells, il- <dig> can activate at least three classical signalling pathways, jak/stat, ras/map kinase and the pi 3-kinase.
it is of interest to note that our results suggest that cell survival induced by il- <dig> required pi 3-kinase and jak/stat pathway activation, but not map kinase.
in this study, we demonstrated the expression of il- <dig> receptor in cortical neurons, and analyzed its influence on amyloid β -treated cells.
viability assays indicated that il- <dig> might play a neuroprotective role in cells treated with aβ fibrils.
several studies have demonstrated the expression of il- <dig> in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and cortices in normal mouse brain, suggesting a physiological role of il- <dig> in the central nervous system.
although there is evidence indicating that il- <dig> is expressed in some neuronal populations, its physiological role in these cells is poorly known.
