the affinity of this antibody for egfrviii peptide is  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> m- <dig> as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
unfortunately many of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against egfrviii have cross reactivity to wild type egfr or other non-specific proteins.
egfrviii expression has been seen in many tumor types including glioblastoma multiforme , breast adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, but has been rarely observed in normal tissue.
it results from the in frame deletion of exons 2- <dig> and the generation of a novel glycine residue at the junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this novel juxtaposition of amino acids within the extra-cellular domain of the egf receptor creates a tumor specific and immunogenic epitope.
this recombinant antibody thus holds great potential to be used as a research reagent and diagnostic tool in research laboratories and clinics because of its high quality, easy viability and unique versatility.
in this study, we have developed a recombinant antibody that is specific for egfrviii, has little cross reactivity for the wild type receptor, and which can be easily produced.
we initially designed a recombinant antibody with two anti-egfrviii single chain fv's linked together and a human igg <dig> fc component.
this mutated recombinant antibody, called rabdmviii, specifically detects egfrviii expression in egfrviii expressing cell lines as well as in egfrviii expressing gbm primary tissue by western blot, immunohistochemistry  and immunofluorescence  and facs analysis.
egf receptor variant iii  is the most common variant of the egf receptor observed in human tumors.
it does not recognize wild type egfr in any of these assays.
