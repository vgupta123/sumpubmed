the negative effects of mating with a colourful male on offspring viability may contribute to maintaining the heritable variation under strong directional sexual selection.
here we explored the additive genetic correlations between carotenoid-based male ornament colouration, female fecundity and juvenile survival rate in the three-spined stickleback  to test the possibility that attractiveness genes reduce important fitness components in the bearers not expressing the sexual trait.
a problem regarding these indirect genetic mechanisms is how sufficient genetic variation in the traits subject to sexual selection is maintained within a population.
there was a strong positive genetic correlation between female fecundity and juvenile viability.
male sexual attractiveness  as well as female fecundity and juvenile viability showed heritable variations in the three-spined stickleback.
however, red sexual signal of male sticklebacks was negatively genetically correlated with juvenile survival, suggesting genetic conflict between attractiveness and viability.
the strength of indirect sexual selection may be weaker than previously thought due to the hidden genetic conflicts.
there was no significant correlation between attractiveness of brothers and fecundity of sisters, suggesting no intra-locus sexual conflict.
thus, females can gain indirect benefits by mating with an attractive male.
