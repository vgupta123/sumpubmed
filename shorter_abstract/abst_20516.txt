est-driven prediction identified  <dig>  genes  which, according to the origin of est sets, were associated with defense responses in the reference genome.
we demonstrated that heterologous est mapping may be efficiently used to reveal genes involved in host defense responses to pathogens.
profiles of defense-related genes, obtained by mapping of heterologous est, represent putative arabidopsis homologs of the corresponding species.
yet, computer- generated gene profiling using expressed sequence tags  represents a valuable alternative to microarrays, which allows efficient discovery of homologous sequences in evolutionarily different species and comparison of gene sets on the whole genome scale.
microarray technology helped to accumulate an immense pool of data on gene expression changes in response to different environmental factors.
in this study, we used publicly available est database derived from different plant species infected with a variety of pathogens, to generate an expression profile of homologous genes involved in defense response of a model organism, arabidopsis thaliana.
comparison of these profiles in pairs and locating common genes allowed estimating similarity between defense-related gene sets of different plant species.
their expression levels were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction during infection with yellow strain of cucumber mosaic virus, a compatible virus systemically infecting arabidopsis.
