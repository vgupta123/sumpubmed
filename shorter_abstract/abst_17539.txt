comparison of the two dna sources from each individual showed an average concordance rate of  <dig> %.
the creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines  through epstein-barr virus  transformation of b-lymphocytes can result in a valuable biomaterial for cell biology research and a renewable source of dna.
we generated over  <dig>  gb of mappable sequence to a 125x read coverage per sample.
sanger sequencing of a subset of the remaining discordant variants did confirm the presence of de novo mutations arising in lcls.
these results suggest that lcls are an appropriate representation of the genetic material of the donor and suggest that ebv transformation can result in low-level generation of de novo mutations.
we performed whole exome sequencing on a tetrad family using dna derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and lcls from each individual.
by lowering the variant calling parameters, the concordance rate between the paired samples increased to  <dig> %.
while lcls have been used extensively in cellular and genetic studies, the process of cell transformation and expansion during culturing may introduce genomic changes that may impact their use and the interpretation of subsequent genetic findings.
