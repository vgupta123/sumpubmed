previously we observed that the mutant frequency in the liver of rats gavaged with riddelliine was 3-fold higher than that in the control group.
pyrrolizidine alkaloids  are probably the most common plant constituents that poison livestock, wildlife, and humans worldwide.
riddelliine-induced gene expression profiles in livers of big blue transgenic rats were determined.
these results provided further insight into the mechanisms involved in toxicity and carcinogenesis after exposure to riddelliine, and permitted us to investigate the interaction of gene products inside the signaling networks.
molecular analysis of the mutants indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the mutational spectra from riddelliine-treated and control rats.
by analysis with the ingenuity pathway analysis network, we found that these significantly changed genes were mainly involved in cancer, cell death, tissue development, cellular movement, tissue morphology, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and cellular growth and proliferation.
we further analyzed the genes involved in metabolism, injury of endothelial cells, liver abnormalities, and cancer development in detail.
the alterations in gene expression were directly related to the pathological outcomes reported previously.
riddelliine was used to investigate the genotoxic effects of pas via analysis of gene expression in the target tissue of rats in this study.
rat whole genome microarray was used to perform genome-wide gene expression studies.
