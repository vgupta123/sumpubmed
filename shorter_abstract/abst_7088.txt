zooming allows the modeler to work on different levels of model granularity, and enables a direct interpretation of how modifications to the model on one level affect the model on other levels in the hierarchy.
the method extends the applicability of the method that was previously developed for zooming of linear biochemical models to nonlinear models.
furthermore, it is of great advantage if we can translate predictions from the reduced model to the original model.
unlike conventional methods for model reduction our method enables the mapping of predictions by the reduced model to the corresponding detailed predictions by the original model.
the method is based on proper lumping of state variables interacting on short time scales and on the computation of fraction parameters, which serve as the link between the reduced model and the original model.
however, each component of a mechanistic model has a clear biochemical interpretation, and it is desirable to conserve as much of this interpretability as possible in the reduction process.
we illustrate the advantages of the proposed method by applying it to two biochemical models.
we introduce a novel method for reduction of biochemical models that is compatible with the concept of zooming.
the second model describes glucose transport across the cell membrane in baker's yeast.
in this paper we present a novel method for model reduction that generates reduced models with a clear biochemical interpretation.
