with the increasing quantity and availability of genomic data, there is an increased burden to provide useful visualization and analysis tools for comparison of multiple collinear genomes such as the large panels of model organisms which are the basis for much of the current genetic research.
our tool illustrates genome-sequence similarity through a mosaic of intervals representing local phylogeny, subspecific origin, and haplotype identity.
genome browsers are a common tool used by biologists to visualize genomic features including genes, polymorphisms, and many others.
however, existing genome browsers and visualization tools are not well-suited to perform meaningful comparative analysis among a large number of genomes.
unlike previous genome browsers and viewers, ours allows for simultaneous and comparative analysis.
we demonstrate our genome browser for an extensive set of genomic data sets composed of almost  <dig> distinct mouse laboratory strains.
dynamic visualizations adjust to scale and data content making analysis at variable resolutions and of multiple data sets more informative.
in addition, we provide local phylogenetic trees as an alternate visualization to assess local variations.
comparative analysis is facilitated through reordering and clustering of tracks, which can vary throughout the genome.
