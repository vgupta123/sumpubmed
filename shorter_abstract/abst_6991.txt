constitutive expression of tabass <dig> in arabidopsis bass2- <dig> mutant complemented the mevastatin-sensitive phenotype that reflects the deficiency of transporting pyruvic acid into chloroplast.
however, whether pyruvate transporters are involved in salt response has not been studied so far.
here, we answered this issue by assessing the function of a wheat pyruvate transporter in salt response.
pyruvic acid is the precursor of abscisic acid  and other chemicals that are synthesized in chloroplast, some of which are involved in the response to salt.
the transportation of pyruvic acid into chloroplast is mediated by pyruvate transporters.
arabidopsis constitutively expressing tabass <dig> also exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress.

overexpression of tabass <dig> enhanced salinity tolerance and reactive oxygen species scavenging in wheat.
however, the enhanced salinity tolerance of tabass <dig> overexpression arabidopsis was abolished when abi <dig> expression was restored to the level of wild-type through overexpressing abi <dig>
our work demonstrates that tabass <dig> enhances salinity tolerance of plants via modulating abi <dig> expression.
