at first, we performed next-generation sequencing to identify ncrnas in chicken pgcs, and we performed ab initio predictive analysis to identify putative pirnas in pgcs.
recent high-throughput techniques have identified several classes of ncrnas, including micro rnas , small-interfering rnas , and piwi-interacting rnas .
the aim of this study was to identify different types of small ncrnas particularly pirnas, and the role of pirna pathway genes in the protection of chicken primordial germ cells .
our results increase the understanding of pgc-expressed pirnas and the role of pirna pathway genes in the protection of germ cells.

after knockdown of ciwi and cili, we examined their effects on the expression of six putative pirna-linked genes and dna double-strand breakage in pgcs.
the knockdown of ciwi and cili upregulated chicken repetitive  <dig>  element and rap2b, a member of ras oncogene family, and increased dna double-strand breakage in pgcs.
genes, rnas, and proteins play important roles during germline development.
subsequently, we knocked down two known pirna pathway genes of chicken, piwi-like protein  <dig>  and  <dig> , in pgcs using sirnas.
