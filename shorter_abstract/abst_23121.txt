mapping, sequencing of the mutated locus and complementation studies revealed cce <dig> to encode the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase , avrpphb sensitive 1-like  <dig> .
validation with t-dna mutants revealed that, besides pbl <dig>  another rlck, botrytis-induced kinase  <dig> , is also required for mamp/damp-induced calcium elevations.
a future challenge would be to identify the substrates of these various rlcks, in order to elucidate their signaling role between the receptor complexes at the plasma membrane and downstream cellular signaling components.
they all show reduced calcium levels after elicitation with peptides representing bacteria-derived mamps  and endogenous damp , but a normal response to chitin octamers.
kinase activities of pbl <dig> derived from three of the cce <dig> alleles are abrogated in vivo.
we characterized here the “changed calcium elevation 5”  mutant, where five allelic cce <dig> mutants were isolated.

it remains to be investigated if the many other rlcks encoded in the arabidopsis genome affect early calcium signal transduction – perhaps in dependence on the type of mamp/damp ligands.
using mamp-induced rise in cellular calcium levels as one of the earliest biochemical readouts, we initiated a genetic screen for components involved in early mamp signaling in arabidopsis thaliana.
