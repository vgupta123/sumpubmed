however, the exact mechanism of toxicity is still unclear.
moreover, we could observe that induction of mutant atxn <dig> leads to a decrease in the levels of catalase, a key enzyme in detoxifying hydrogen peroxide produced from dismutation of superoxide anions.
most importantly, we found that treatment with a general anti-oxidant or inhibitors of nox complexes reduced both the aggregation and toxicity of mutant atxn <dig>  in contrast, atxn <dig> aggregation was aggravated by treatments promoting oxidative stress.
common mechanisms of disease pathogenesis suggested for polyq disorders include aggregation of the polyq protein and induction of oxidative stress.
in this study we show that expression of polyq expanded atxn <dig> in a novel stable inducible cell model first results in a concomitant increase in ros levels and aggregation of the disease protein and later cellular toxicity.
our results demonstrates that oxidative stress contributes to atxn <dig> aggregation as well as toxicity and show that anti-oxidants or nox inhibition can ameliorate mutant atxn <dig> toxicity.
spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  is one of nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine  expansions.
the increase in ros could be completely prevented by inhibition of nadph oxidase  complexes suggesting that atxn <dig> directly or indirectly causes oxidative stress by increasing superoxide anion production from these complexes.
this could also contribute to the generation of oxidative stress.
