in silico approaches have become a practicable and relatively inexpensive alternative during the last decade, although testing putative ssr markers still is time consuming and expensive.
up to now, although a number of programs have been developed to identify ssrs in est sequences, no software can detect putatively polymorphic ssrs.
surprisingly, the frequency of polymorphic ssrs was much higher in the short ssrs.
experimental methods to develop ssr markers are laborious, time consuming and expensive.
in many species only a relatively small percentage of ssr markers turn out to be polymorphic.
the pipeline includes pcr-primer design for the putatively polymorphic ssr markers, taking into account single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the flanking regions, thereby improving the success rate of the potential markers.
sequence information is obtained from public est databases derived from heterozygous individuals and/or at least two different genotypes.
a large number of polymorphic ssrs were identified using publicly available est sequences of potato, tomato, rice, arabidopsis, brassica and chicken.
we have developed polyssr, a new pipeline to identify polymorphic ssrs rather than just ssrs.
polyssr is a very effective tool to identify polymorphic ssrs.
when combined with the new sequencing technologies polyssr will have a big impact on the development of polymorphic ssrs in any species.
in est databases a large redundancy of sequences is present, which may contain information on length-polymorphisms in the ssr they contain, and whether they have been derived from heterozygotes or from different genotypes.
this is particularly true for markers derived from expressed sequence tags .
