using up-to-date imaging methods, we here present morphological details of the mouthparts and the thoracopods of  <dig> million years old specimens of urda rostrata.
therefore, mouthpart and thoracopod morphology indicate a parasitic lifestyle of urda rostrata.
mouthparts are of a sucking-piercing-type morphology, similar to the mouthparts of representatives of ectoparasitic isopods in groups such as aegidae or cymothoidae.
based on morphological details, urda seems deeply nested within the parasitic isopods of the group cymothoida.
finally, the specimens reported herein represent the oldest parasitic isopods known to date.
this modern-day variability of lifestyles is not reflected in isopod fossils so far, mostly as the life habits of many fossil isopods are still unclear.
a rather common group of fossil isopods is urda .
although some of the specimens of different species of urda are considered well preserved, crucial characters for the interpretation of their lifestyle , have so far not been accessible.
