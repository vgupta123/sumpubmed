this paper presents estgt , an estg programming and simulation environment.
when executing a program, the tool generates the corresponding lineage trees as well as the internal states values, which can then be analyzed either through the tool’s gui or using matlab’s command-line environment.
transition rule probabilities and rates, however, can depend on global parameters such as population size, generation count and elapsed time.
we have previously presented a formal language for describing population dynamics based on environment-dependent stochastic tree grammars .

an estg program consists of a set of stochastic tree grammar transition rules that are context-free.
simulated lineage trees can be used to validate various hypotheses in silico and to predict the behavior of dynamical systems under various conditions.
in addition, each individual may have an internal state, which can change during transitions.
written under matlab environment, the tool also enables to easily integrate the output data within the user’s downstream analysis.
the presented tool allows researchers to use existing biological knowledge in order to model the dynamics of a developmental process and analyze its behavior throughout the historical events.
