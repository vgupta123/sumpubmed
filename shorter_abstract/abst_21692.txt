concerns are often raised about the accuracy of microarray technologies and the degree of cross-platform agreement, but there are yet no methods which can unambiguously evaluate precision and sensitivity for these technologies on a whole-array basis.
the effective precision of the two-color platforms is improved by allowing for probe-specific dye-effects in the statistical model.
the method evaluates the precision and responsiveness of each microarray platform on a whole-array basis, i.e., using all the probes, without the need to match probes across platforms.
the method consists of an easy-to-construct titration series of rna samples and an associated statistical analysis using non-linear regression.
all four platforms are shown to have satisfactory precision but the commercial platforms are superior for resolving differential expression for genes at lower expression levels.
an experiment is conducted to assess and compare four widely used microarray platforms.
the results demonstrate good precision and sensitivity for all the platforms, but highlight the need for improved probe annotation.
for probes which can be matched across platforms, the cross-platform variability is decomposed into within-platform and between-platform components, showing that platform disagreement is almost entirely systematic rather than due to measurement variability.
