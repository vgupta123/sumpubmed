histological analysis of the hbf showed hyphal elements intertwined indicative of the biofilm phenotype.
recent studies have shown that there is a relationship between biofilm formation and poor clinical outcomes in patients infected with biofilm proficient strains.
here we have investigated a panel of clinical isolates in an attempt to evaluate their phenotypic and transcriptional properties in an attempt to differentiate and define levels of biofilm formation.
biofilm formation was shown to be heterogeneous; with isolates being defined as either high or low biofilm formers  based on different biomass quantification.
transcriptional analysis of  <dig> genes implicated in biofilm formation showed no significant differential expression profiles between lbf and hbf, except for cdr <dig> at  <dig> and 24 h. cluster analysis showed similar patterns of expression for different functional classes of genes, though correlation analysis of the 4 h biofilms with overall biomass at 24 h showed that  <dig> genes were correlated with high levels of biofilm, including als <dig>  eap <dig>  cph <dig>  sap <dig>  plb <dig>  cdr <dig> and zap <dig>
our findings show that biofilm formation is variable amongst c. albicans isolates, and categorising isolates depending on this can be used to predict how pathogenic the isolate will behave clinically.
these findings are important when developing biofilm-specific diagnostics as these could be used to predict how best to treat patients infected with c. albicans.
we have shown that looking at individual genes in less informative than looking at multiple genes when trying to categorise isolates at lbf or hbf.
hbf isolates were more resistance to amphotericin b  treatment than lbf, but not voriconazole .
these categories could also be differentiated using a cell surface hydrophobicity assay with 24 h biofilms.
