we also show that it detects growth-defect and growth-advantage genes previously shown to impair or enhance growth when disrupted.
a 4-state hmm provides an improved way of analyzing tn-seq data and assessing different levels of essentiality that enables not only the characterization of essential and non-essential genes, but also genes whose disruption leads to impairment  of growth.
we evaluate the performance of a 4-state hmm on a sequence dataset of m. tuberculosis transposon mutants.
we propose a novel method for analyzing sequence data from transposon mutant libraries using a hidden markov model , along with formulas to adapt the parameters of the model to different datasets for robustness.
this approach allows for the clustering of insertion sites into distinct regions of essentiality across the entire genome in a statistically rigorous manner, while also allowing for the detection of growth-defect and growth-advantage regions.
we show that the hmm produces results that are highly correlated with previous assignments of essentiality for this organism.
