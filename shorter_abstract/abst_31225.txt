their functional impact, however, remains poorly understood.
like other structural variants, transposable element insertions can be highly polymorphic across individuals.
we describe a high-throughput method for genotyping transposable element insertions and other types of structural variants that can be assayed by breakpoint pcr.
this method can benefit a wide range of applications from the routine genotyping of animal and plant populations to the functional study of structural variants in humans.
the method relies on next-generation sequencing of multiplex, site-specific pcr amplification products and read count-based genotype calls.
