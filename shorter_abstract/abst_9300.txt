<dig> dmps are unique to term vs preterm delivery, of which  <dig> dmps do not relate to gestational age as such.
the  <dig> dmps that correlate with advancing gestational age  include  <dig> dmps that match with two previously reported studies on ucb methylation.
this study identifies  <dig> dmps in ucb dna of neonates which do not relate to gestational age or any other clinical variable recorded and are specific to idiopathic preterm delivery.
after quality control, conclusions were based on  <dig> term and  <dig> idiopathic preterm born neonates.
pathway analysis indicated enrichment of genes involved in calcium signalling, myometrial contraction and relaxation pathways.
the analysis identifies  <dig> statistically significant dmps between preterm and term deliveries of which  <dig> dmps are also attributable to clinical variables other than preterm versus term delivery.
two-thirds of preterm deliveries are idiopathic.
preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
to identify methylation differences specific to idiopathic preterm delivery, we assessed genome-wide dna methylation changes in  <dig> umbilical cord blood samples  using the 450Â k illumina methylation array.
the initiating molecular mechanisms behind spontaneous preterm delivery are unclear.
dna methylation changes can be exploited as markers to identify spontaneous preterm delivery.
a dmp on myl <dig>  encoding myosin light chain  <dig>  is a robust candidate for the identification of idiopathic preterm labour as it is identified by all  <dig> independent studies.
the differentially methylated positions  specific for preterm/term delivery, neonatal sex, use of oxytocin and mode of initiation of labor were calculated by controlling the fdr p value at  <dig> .
additionally,  <dig> neonatal sex specific dmps,  <dig> dmps specific to the induction of labour and  <dig> dmps specific to the mode of initiation of labor were also identified.
