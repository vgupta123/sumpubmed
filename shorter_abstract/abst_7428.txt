the construction of plasmid-less marker-less strains has many advantages for the further practical exploitation of these bacteria in industry.
such producer strains are usually constructed by sequential chromosome modifications including deletions and integration of genetic material.
the developed dual-in/out strategy is a rather straightforward, but convenient combination of previously developed recombination methods: phages site-specific and general red/et-mediated.
this strategy, entitled as dual-in/out, based on the initial red-driven insertion of artificial φ80-attb sites into desired points of the chromosome followed by two site-specific recombination processes: first, the φ <dig> system is used for integration of the recombinant dna based on selective marker-carrier conditionally-replicated plasmid with φ80-attp-site, and second, the λ system is used for excision of inserted vector part, including the plasmid ori-replication and the marker, flanked by λ-attl/r-sites.
