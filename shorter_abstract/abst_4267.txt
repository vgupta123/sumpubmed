changes that affect igf1r occupancy have predictable effects on igf1-induced proliferation and our model captured these effects.
while an attractive therapeutic target, the igf system is complex with two receptors , two ligands , and at least six high affinity igf-binding proteins  that regulate the bioavailability of igf ligands.
the insulin-like growth factor  system impacts cell proliferation and is highly activated in ovarian cancer.
ovcar <dig>  an immortalized ovarian cancer cell line, were found to be sensitive to igf <dig>  with the dose of igf <dig>  a more reliable predictor of cell response than ligand concentration.
examining how different components of the igf system influence cell response will be critical to improve our understanding of the igf signaling network in ovarian cancer.

we hypothesized that a quantitative balance between these different network components regulated cell response.
to explore how different variables  impacted cell response, a mass-action steady-state model was developed.
examination of the model revealed that the level of igf1-igf1r complexes per cell was directly proportional to the extent of proliferation induced by igf <dig>  model analysis suggested, and experimental results confirmed, that igfbps present during igf <dig> treatment significantly decreased igf1-mediated proliferation.
