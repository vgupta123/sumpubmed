prior studies in yeast suggest that the topology of protein-protein interaction networks generated from physical interaction assays can offer important insight into protein function.
since the topology of bacteria co-conservation protein-protein interaction networks has not previously been studied in depth, we first perform such an analysis for co-conservation networks in e. coli k <dig>  next, we demonstrate one way in which network connectivity measures and global and local function distribution can be exploited to predict protein function for previously uncharacterized proteins.
our results showed, like most biological networks, our bacteria co-conserved protein-protein interaction networks had scale-free topologies.
we found that the distribution of node connectivity varied by functional category and could be informative for function prediction.
our results indicated that some properties of the physical yeast interaction network hold in our bacteria co-conservation networks, such as high connectivity for essential proteins.
our study has shown co-conservation based networks to exhibit a scale free topology, as expected for biological networks.
however, the high connectivity among protein complexes in the yeast physical network was not seen in the co-conservation network which uses all bacteria as the reference set.
by integrating of functional information from different annotation sources and using the network topology, we were able to infer function for uncharacterized proteins.
