we hypothesized that alterations in connexin <dig> expression and localization in the mouse heart might be induced by ventricular pacing over a short period of time.
cardiac insults such as ischemia, infarction, hypertrophy and dilatation are often accompanied by altered abundance and/or localization of the connexin <dig> gap junction protein, which may predispose towards arrhythmic complications.
our data suggest that short-term pacing is associated with incipient changes in the expression of the connexin <dig> gap junction, possibly including decreased production and a slowed rate of degradation.
this murine model may facilitate the study of early molecular changes induced by pacing and may ultimately assist in the development of strategies to prevent gap junction remodeling and the associated arrhythmic complications of cardiac disease.
the subdiaphragmatic approach was used to pace a series of wild type mice for six hours before the hearts were removed for analysis.
short-term pacing resulted in a significant reduction in connexin <dig> mrna abundance, a partial redistribution of connexin <dig> from the sarcolemma to a non-sarcolemmal fraction, and accumulation of ubiquitinated connexin <dig> without a significant change in overall connexin <dig> protein levels.
