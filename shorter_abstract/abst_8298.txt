the method was robust toward small differences in initial structures , although large displacements of catalytic residues often resulted in substrate poses that did not pass the geometric filter criteria.
after a second round of docking the same substrate into the geometry-optimised structures, productive poses are identified by geometric filter criteria and ranked by their docking scores.
here we present a predictive and robust method to model substrate specificity and enantioselectivity of lipases and esterases that uses reaction intermediates and incorporates protein flexibility.
substrate-imprinted docking was applied in order to model  enantioselectivity of candida antarctica lipase b and a w104a mutant,  enantioselectivity and substrate specificity of candida rugosa lipase and burkholderia cepacia lipase, and  substrate specificity of an acetyl- and a butyrylcholine esterase toward the substrates acetyl- and butyrylcholine.
first, when trying to model catalysis a reaction intermediate of the substrate is expected to provide more valid information than the ground state of the substrate.
substrate-imprinted docking starts with covalent docking of reaction intermediates, followed by geometry optimisation of the resulting enzyme-substrate complex.
second, the incorporation of protein flexibility is essential for reliable predictions.
