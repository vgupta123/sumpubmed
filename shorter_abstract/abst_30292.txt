furthermore, mmtv-deaf- <dig> transgenic mammary glands were found to have elevated levels of rac <dig> mrna, suggesting that it is a bona fide target.
transgenic mammary glands overexpressing deaf- <dig> exhibited a modest side-branching phenotype, accompanied by an increase in the number of brdu-positive cells and a decrease in the proportion of pra-expressing cells.
although proliferation was enhanced in deaf- <dig> transgenic mice, overexpression of this gene was not sufficient to induce the formation of mammary tumors.
here we investigated the influence of deaf- <dig> on human and mouse mammary epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo and identified a potential target gene.
affymetrix gene profiling studies revealed rac <dig> as a potential target gene and quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed that rac <dig> was upregulated by deaf- <dig> in immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells.
in addition, our studies identified rac <dig>  encoding a small rho-like gtpase, as a potential target of deaf- <dig> in mouse mammary epithelial cells.
we have demonstrated that overexpression of deaf- <dig> enhances the proliferation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro and mouse epithelial cells in vivo.
overexpression of deaf- <dig> in human breast epithelial mcf10a cells enhanced cell proliferation in the mammary acini that develop in 3d cultures.
the transcription factor deaf- <dig> has been identified as a high affinity binding partner of the lim-only protein lmo <dig> that plays important roles in mammary gland development and breast cancer.
to investigate the effects of deaf- <dig> on mammary gland development and oncogenesis, we generated mmtv-deaf- <dig> transgenic mice.
