the spectra generated through such analyses are typically confounded by noise of various types, obscuring the signals and hindering downstream statistical analysis.
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is one of the primary tools in metabolomics analyses, where it is used to track and quantify changes in metabolite concentrations or profiles in response to perturbation through disease, toxicants or drugs.
by avoiding the use of a template or reference spectrum, pcans allows for the creation of a consensus spectrum that enhances the signals within the spectra while maintaining sample-specific features.
we characterize the performance of pcans by aligning simulated nmr spectra, which have been provided with user-defined amounts of chemical shift variation as well as inter-group differences as would be observed in control-treatment applications.
we describe a novel approach, termed progressive consensus alignment of nmr spectra , for the alignment of nmr spectra.
finally, we further evaluate this approach in the alignment of real mouse urine spectra and demonstrate its ability to improve downstream pca and pls analyses.
