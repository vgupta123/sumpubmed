the implications of these results range from the improvement of porcine meat quality traits to the application of the pig as an animal model of human metabolic diseases.
a total of  <dig>  putative unannotated protein-coding sequences were identified in the 20% of reads which mapped in intergenic regions.
with this in mind, we have used massive, parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the porcine adipose tissue transcriptome architecture in six iberian x landrace crossbred pigs showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition .
pathway analysis related these genes to biological functions and canonical pathways controlling lipid and fatty acid metabolisms.
in pigs, adipose tissue is one of the principal organs involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism.
these results will help in the identification of genetic variants at loci that affect fatty acid composition traits.
high-throughput rna sequencing was used to generate a whole characterization of adipose tissue  transcriptome.
in concordance with the phenotypic classification of animals, the major metabolic pathway differentially modulated between groups was de novo lipogenesis, the group with more pufa being the one that showed lower expression of lipogenic genes.
