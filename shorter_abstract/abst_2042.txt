with the rapid increase in the number of new protein structures, the need for automated and accurate methods for protein classification is increasingly important.
furthermore, for protein domains that belong to new domain families, our method is able to produce clusters that closely correspond to the new families in scop  <dig> .
in our evaluation with scop  <dig> , our method correctly classifies  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of new domains at family, superfamily, and fold levels.
these components allow us to accurately classify proteins into known folds, to detect new protein folds, and to provide a way of clustering the new folds.
the method is effective in classifying new domains and suggesting new domain families, and it is also very efficient.
in this paper we present a unified framework for protein structure classification and identification of novel protein structures.
the framework consists of a set of components for comparing, classifying, and clustering protein structures.
as a result, our method can also be used to suggest new classification groups that contain novel folds.
