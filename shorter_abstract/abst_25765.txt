if we initiate a sound by our own motor behavior, the n <dig> component of the auditory event-related brain potential  that the sound elicits is attenuated compared to the n <dig> elicited by the same sound when it is initiated externally.

it has been suggested that this n <dig> suppression results from an internal predictive mechanism that is in the service of discriminating the sensory consequences of oneâ€™s own actions from other sensory input.
as the n1-suppression effect is becoming a popular approach to investigate predictive processing in cognitive and social neuroscience, it is important to exclude an alternative interpretation not related to prediction.
if attention causes the n1-suppression effect, then manipulating attention should affect the effect for self-initiated sounds.
the present results support the assumption that the n1-suppression effect for self-initiated sounds indicates the operation of an internal predictive mechanism.
furthermore, while attention had an influence on the n1a, n1b, and n1c components, the n1-suppression effect was confined to the n1b and n1c subcomponents suggesting that the major contribution to the auditory n1-suppression effect is circumscribed to late n <dig> components.
to test this hypothesis, we manipulated the allocation of attention to the sounds in different blocks: attention was directed either to the sounds, to the own motor acts or to visual stimuli.
