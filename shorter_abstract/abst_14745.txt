recently an isolated population of seal salamanders, desmognathus monticola, was discovered on the ozark plateau, ~ <dig> km west of its broad continuous distribution in the appalachian mountains of eastern north america.
by intensively sampling this genetically diverse region we located haplotypes identical to the ozark isolate.
these critical haplotypes only occur in <  <dig> % of the native distribution and nca excluding them suggest that the ozark population is a natural relict.
our study demonstrates the importance of considering comparative phylogeographic information for locating critical haplotypes when distinguishing native from introduced species.
despite its broad distribution in the appalachian mountains, the primary haplotype diversity of d. monticola is restricted to less than  <dig> % of the distribution in the extreme southern appalachians, where genetic diversity is high for other co-distributed species.
using nested clade analysis  we test whether the ozark isolate results from population fragmentation  or long distance dispersal .
nested clade analysis supports the hypothesis that the ozark population was introduced, but it was necessary to include haplotypes that are less than or equal to  <dig> % divergent from the ozark population in order to arrive at this conclusion.
diagnosing a species as introduced may require locating nearly identical haplotypes in the known native distribution, which may be a major undertaking.
our analyses suggest that the isolated population of d. monticola from the ozarks is not native to the region and may need to be extirpated rather than conserved, particularly because of its potential negative impacts on endemic ozark stream salamander communities.
