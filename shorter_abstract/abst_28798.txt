they regulate signalling though inhibition of phosphatases and induction of the activity of stress activated protein kinases, which themselves modulate feedbacks to insulin signalling and foxo.
we have developed a model of insulin signalling in rodent adipocytes that includes both transcriptional feedback through the forkhead box type o  transcription factor, and interaction with oxidative stress, in addition to the core pathway.
insulin and oxidative stress combined produce a lower degree of activation of insulin signalling than insulin alone.
fasting  and weak oxidative stress upregulate antioxidant defences while stronger oxidative stress leads to a short term activation of insulin signalling but if prolonged can have other effects including degradation of the insulin receptor substrate  and foxo.
at high insulin the protective effect of moderate oxidative stress may disappear.
oxidative stress can have effects that are both up- and down-regulatory on insulin signalling.
