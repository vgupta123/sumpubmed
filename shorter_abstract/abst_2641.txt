disruption of atraptor1b yields plants with a wide range of developmental defects: roots are thick and grow slowly, leaf initiation and bolting are delayed and the shoot inflorescence shows reduced apical dominance.
flowering plant development is wholly reliant on growth from meristems, which contain totipotent cells that give rise to all post-embryonic organs in the plant.
to identify genes that regulate meristem-based growth, we considered homologues of raptor proteins, which regulate cell growth in response to nutrients in yeast and metazoans as part of a signaling complex with the target of rapamycin  kinase.
the data implicate the tor signaling pathway, a major regulator of cell growth in yeast and metazoans, in the maintenance of growth from the shoot apical meristem in plants.
these results provide insights into the ways in which tor/raptor signaling has been adapted to regulate plant growth and development, and indicate that in plants, as in other eukaryotes, there is some raptor-independent tor activity.
atraptor transcripts accumulate in dividing and expanding cells and tissues.
