the glycolytic pathway consists of ten enzymatic steps which appear to be universal amongst eukaryotes.
our phylogenetic analyses of all of these enzymes revealed at least four cases where the relationship of the trimastix genes to homologs from other species is at odds with accepted organismal relationships.
however, it has been shown that the origins of these enzymes in specific eukaryote lineages can differ, and sometimes involve lateral gene transfer events.
although lateral gene transfer events likely account for these anomalies, with the data at hand we were not able to establish with confidence the bacterial donor lineage that gave rise to the respective trimastix enzymes.
thus, despite widespread conservation of the glycolytic biochemical pathway across eukaryote diversity, in a number of protist lineages the enzymatic components of the pathway have been replaced by lateral gene transfer from disparate evolutionary sources.
we have conducted an expressed sequence tag  survey of the anaerobic flagellate trimastix pyriformis to investigate the nature of the evolutionary origins of the glycolytic enzymes in this relatively unstudied organism.
a number of the glycolytic enzymes of trimastix have been transferred laterally from bacteria instead of being inherited from the last common eukaryotic ancestor.
glycolysis and subsequent fermentation is the main energy source for many anaerobic organisms.
