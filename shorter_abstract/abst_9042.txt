bisulphite dna modification results in sequence alterations  and a general sequence complexity reduction as cytosines become underrepresented.
the development of pcr-based methylation assays on bisulphite modified dna heralded a breakthrough in speed and sensitivity for gene methylation analysis.
currently, the database contains primer records for the most popular pcr-based methylation analysis methods to study human, mouse and rat epigenetic modifications.
we have developed two integrated and freely available web-tools for pcr based methylation analysis.
dna methylation plays an important role in development and tumorigenesis by epigenetic modification and silencing of critical genes.
apart from the primer specificity analysis tool, we have also developed a public database termed methprimerdb for the storage and retrieval of validated pcr based methylation assays.
methblast allows in silico assessment of primer specificity in pcr based methylation assays that can be stored in the methprimerdb database, which provides a search portal for validated methylation assays.
