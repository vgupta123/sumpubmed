altogether,  <dig> genome wide significant  qtl regions for androstenone in subcutaneous fat were obtained from the ldla study in landrace and  <dig> gws qtl regions in duroc.
ldla analysis revealed that  <dig> of these qtl regions, located on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were obtained in both breeds.
the aim of this study was to use high-density genome wide association  in combination with linkage disequilibrium-linkage analysis  to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with boar taint compounds and related sex steroids in commercial landrace  and duroc  breeds.
boar taint is observed in a high proportion of uncastrated male pigs and is characterized by an unpleasant odor/flavor in cooked meat, primarily caused by elevated levels of androstenone and skatole.
this is the first report applying the porcine  <dig> k snp array for simultaneous analysis of boar taint compounds and related sex hormones, using both gwa and ldla approaches.
the gws qtls for skatole obtained by ldla are located at ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>
for skatole,  <dig> and  <dig> qtls were gws in the ldla analysis for landrace and duroc respectively, with  <dig> of these detected in both breeds.
most qtls for skatole do not negatively affect other sex hormones and should be easier to implement into the breeding scheme.
in an independent sample, although the majority of qtls are breed specific.
androstenone is a steroid produced in the testis in parallel with biosynthesis of other sex steroids like testosterone and estrogens.
