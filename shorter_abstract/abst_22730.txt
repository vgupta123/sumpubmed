these results show that regulatory mirnas exist in agronomically important trifoliate orange and may play an important role in citrus growth, development, and response to disease.
moreover, four target genes including one encoding irx <dig> copper ion binding/oxidoreductase and three genes encoding nb-lrr disease resistance protein have been experimentally verified by detection of the mirna-mediated mrna cleavage in c. trifoliata.
deep sequencing of short rnas from c. trifoliata flowers and fruits identified  <dig> new potential mirnas and  <dig> highly conserved mirna families, indicating that specific mirnas exist in c. trifoliata.
these sequences had not been earlier described in other plant species and accumulation of the  <dig> novel mirnas were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis.
in addition, five mirna* sequences were also sequenced.
we also identified  <dig> novel mirna candidates whose precursors were all potentially generated from citrus ests.
there have been extensive studies to discover mirnas and analyze their functions in model plant species, such as arabidopsis and rice.
based on sequence similarity and hairpin structure prediction, we found that  <dig>  reads representing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> highly conserved mirna families, have perfect matches to known mirnas.
potential target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel mirnas.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads representing  <dig> , <dig> distinct sequences were obtained from a short rna library generated from small rna extracted from c. trifoliata flower and fruit tissues.
