the first objective of the present study was to identify tissue-specific and tissue-consistent qtls for fatty acid composition in backfat and intramuscular fat, combining linkage mapping and gwas approaches and conducted under single and multitrait models.
the analyses with multitrait models allowed identifying for the first time with a formal statistical approach seven different regions with pleiotropic effects on particular fatty acids in both fat deposits.
the results obtained so far seem to point out different genetic control of fatty acid composition conditional on the fat deposits.
the single model analyses, linkage and gwas, revealed over  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomal regions,  <dig> of them identified here for the first time, specifically associated to the content of diverse fatty acids in bf and imf, respectively.
although most of the detected regions were tissue-specific, supporting the hypothesis that the major part of genes affecting fatty acid composition differs among tissues, seven chromosomal regions showed tissue-consistent effects.
porcine fatty acid composition is a key factor for quality and nutritive value of pork.
several qtls for fatty acid composition have been reported in diverse fat tissues.
complementary genome scans have confirmed several chromosome regions previously associated to fatty acid composition in backfat and intramuscular fat, but even more, to identify new ones.

a second aim was to identify powerful candidate genes for these tissue-consistent qtls, using microarray gene expression data and following a targeted genetical genomics approach.
some powerful candidate genes and regions were identified such as the pbx <dig>  rgs <dig>  trib <dig> and a transcription regulatory element close to elovl <dig> gene to be further studied.
other detected pleiotropic regions included one on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig>  two on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig> and c18: <dig>  one on ssc <dig> for c20: <dig> and the last one on ssc <dig> for c16: <dig>  finally, a targeted eqtl scan focused on regions showing tissue-consistent effects was conducted with longissimus and fat gene expression data.
