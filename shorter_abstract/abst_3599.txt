these modifications to the tmv-based expression vector system have made tmv vectors an easier, more reliable and more cost-effective way to produce recombinant proteins in plants.
these improvements should facilitate the production of recombinant proteins in plants for both research and product development purposes.
co-introduction  of this t-dna along with a 35s promoter driven gene for the rna silencing suppressor p <dig>  from tomato bushy stunt virus  resulted in essentially complete infection of the infiltrated plant tissue with the tmv vector by  <dig> days post infiltration .
similar levels of recombinant protein were detected in systemically infected plant tissue 10– <dig> dpi.
we have constructed a cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter-driven tmv expression vector that can be delivered as a t-dna to plant cells by agrobacterium tumefaciens.
these expression levels were  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than the most efficient 35s promoter driven transient expression systems described to date.
recombinant protein expression levels in plants from tobacco mosaic virus -based vectors are much higher than those possible from plant promoters.
the tmv vector produced between  <dig> and  <dig> micrograms of recombinant protein per gram of infiltrated tissue by  <dig> dpi.
however the common tmv expression vectors are costly, and at times technically challenging, to work with.
therefore it was a goal to develop tmv expression vectors that express high levels of recombinant protein and are easier, more reliable, and more cost-effective to use.
plants are increasingly being examined as alternative recombinant protein expression systems.
