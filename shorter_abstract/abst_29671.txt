when defining otus , scientists must balance a trade-off between computational efficiency and biological accuracy, as accurately estimating an environment's phylogenetic composition requires computationally-intensive analyses.
dnaclust can also produce multiple sequence alignments for every cluster, allowing users to manually inspect clustering results, and enabling more detailed analyses of the clustered data.
given a set of sequences and a sequence similarity threshold, dnaclust creates clusters whose radius is guaranteed not to exceed the specified threshold.
the performance of dnaclust improves as the similarity threshold is increased  making it well suited for rapidly removing duplicates and near-duplicates from a dataset, thereby reducing the size of the data being analyzed through more elaborate approaches.
