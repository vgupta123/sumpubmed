murfp <dig> acted as a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of murf activity but was a potent inhibitor when murf was pre-incubated with udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm or atp.
we propose that murfp <dig> exploits udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm-induced structural changes for better interaction with the enzyme.
murf catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between d-alanyl-d-alanine  and the cell wall precursor uridine 5'-diphosphoryl n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid  with the concomitant hydrolysis of atp to adp and inorganic phosphate, yielding udp-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide.
we present the first peptide inhibitor of murf, an enzyme that should be exploited as a target for antimicrobial drug development.
murfp <dig> exerts its inhibitory action by interfering with the utilization of d-ala-d-ala by the murf amide ligase enzyme.
as murf acts on a dipeptide, we exploited a phage display approach to identify peptide ligands having high binding affinities for the enzyme.
screening of a phage display 12-mer library using purified p. aeruginosa murf yielded to the identification of the murfp <dig> peptide.
to develop antibacterial agents having novel modes of action against bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, we targeted the essential murf enzyme of the antibiotic resistant pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa.
