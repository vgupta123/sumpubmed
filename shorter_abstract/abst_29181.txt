we investigated spatial and temporal expression of cln <dig> messenger ribonucleic acid  using in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  and northern blotting.
the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent material in many tissues, especially in neurons.
expression of cln <dig> in the developing and mature brain suggests roles for cln <dig> in maturation, differentiation and supporting the survival of different neuronal populations.
the relevance of cln <dig> up-regulation in hippocampal neurons of kindled mice should be further explored.
in prenatal embryos cln <dig> is most prominently expressed in the developing gastrointestinal tract, dorsal root ganglia  and brain.
