despite the fact that rna crystals tend to diffract poorly, there is a dearth of reports on the application of dehydration methods to improve the diffraction quality of rna crystals.
we use dehydration techniques with a free mounting system  to recover the poor diffraction quality of rna crystals.
the method we describe herein could serve as a general tool to improve diffraction quality of rna crystals to facilitate structure determinations.
these approaches were applied to rna constructs that model various rna-mediated repeat expansion disorders.
post-crystallization dehydration methods, applying either vapor diffusion or humidity control devices, have been widely used to improve the diffraction quality of protein crystals.
