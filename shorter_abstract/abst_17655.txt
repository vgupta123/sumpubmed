recent studies have elucidated the effect of chromatin structure on molecular evolution of genomic dna.
divergence of transcription factor binding sites is considered to be an important source of regulatory evolution.
the associations between transcription factor binding sites and phenotypic diversity have been investigated in many model organisms.
with the availability of genome-wide nucleosome map in yeast species, it is thus desirable to investigate their impact on transcription factor binding site evolution.
here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of nucleosome positioning in the evolution of transcription factor binding sites.
we compared the transcription factor binding site frequency in nucleosome occupied regions and nucleosome depleted regions in promoters of old  and young  genes; and in duplicate gene pairs.
finally, using transcription factor binding site-directed mutagenesis experiment, we confirmed the difference in the impact of binding site changes on expression at these regions.
we demonstrated that nucleosome occupied regions accommodate greater binding site variations than nucleosome depleted regions in young genes and in duplicate genes.
the binding sites at nucleosome occupied regions exhibited a consistently higher evolution rate than those at nucleosome depleted regions, corroborating the difference in the selection constraints at the two regions.
this finding was confirmed by measuring the difference in evolutionary rates of binding sites in sensu stricto yeasts at nucleosome occupied regions and nucleosome depleted regions.
finally, through site-directed mutagenesis experiment, we found that binding site gain or loss events at nucleosome depleted regions may cause more expression differences than those in nucleosome occupied regions.
though the profound impact of nucleosome positions on gene regulation has been reported, their influence on transcriptional evolution is still less explored.
