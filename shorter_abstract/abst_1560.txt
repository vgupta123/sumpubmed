the data reported here is the first source of genome-wide differential transcriptome sequence in two genotypes of a. squamosa, and identifies several candidate genes related to seed development.
these could be potential candidates for transcript based microsatellite analysis in a. squamosa.
the present work provides early-stage fruit specific transcriptome sequence resource for a. squamosa.
this repository will serve as a useful resource for investigating the molecular mechanisms of fruit development, and improvement of fruit related traits in a. squamosa and related species.
assembled unigenes were functionally annotated by querying against the protein sequences of five different public databases , with an e-value cut-off of 10− <dig>  a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes did not match any known protein in the nr database.
approximately  <dig>  million high-quality clean reads were obtained in the cdna library from the developing fruits of both the genotypes, with an average length of about 568 bp.
a massive pyrosequencing  of transcriptome from early stages of fruit development  was performed to produce expression datasets in two genotypes, sitaphal and nmk- <dig>  that show a contrast in the number of seeds set in fruits.
several of the unigenes representing pathways related to primary and secondary metabolism, and seed and fruit development expressed at a higher level in sitaphal, the densely seeded cultivar in comparison to the poorly seeded nmk- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  motifs were identified respectively in the two genotypes.
these sequences could be genes specific to annona sp.
the contig sequence data of all the four stages of each genotype were combined into larger units resulting into  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, with a mean size of more than  <dig> kb.
