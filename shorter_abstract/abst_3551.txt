low quality sequences were removed and after clustering and contig assembly,  <dig> unique placenta and  <dig>  unique testis sequences remained.
although peromyscus has been studied extensively under both field and laboratory conditions, research has been limited by the lack of molecular resources.
the  <dig>  peromyscus placenta and testis ests described here significantly expands the molecular resources available for the genus.
approximately 82% of all ests were identified using the blastx algorithm to mus and rattus, and  <dig> â€“ 54% of all ests could be assigned to a biological process gene ontology category in either mus or rattus.
mice of the genus peromyscus are found in nearly every habitat from alaska to central america and from the atlantic to the pacific.
in this study we describe the generation of two cdna libraries, one from placenta and one from testis, characterize the resulting ests, and describe their utility for mapping the peromyscus genome.
average lengths of placenta and testis ests were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively.
of the primers that were tried 54% provided useful assays for genotyping on interspecific backcross and whole-genome radiation hybrid cell panels.
because the peromyscus genome organization resembles the rattus genome more closely than mus we examined the distribution of the peromyscus ests across the rat genome finding markers on all rat chromosomes except the y. approximately 40% of all ests were specific to only one location in the mus genome and spanned introns of an appropriate size for sequencing and snp detection.
