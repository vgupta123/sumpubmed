ex-srnas from one healthy individual were isolated using five different isolation kits: qiagen circulating nucleic acid kit, thermofisher scientific ambion trizol ls reagent, qiagen mirneasy, qiasymphony rna extraction kit and the exiqon mircury rna isolation kit.
small non-coding ribonucleic acids , specifically micrornas  and their variant isoforms , and transfer rna -derived small rnas  comprise a repertoire of molecules particularly promising in this regard.
a total of  <dig> small rna sequencing  libraries were constructed, sequenced and compared using a rigorous bioinformatics approach.
however, the circulating nucleic acid kit consistently generated the fewest number of reads mapped to the genome, as compared to the best-performing method, ambion trizol, which mapped 10% of the mirnas,  <dig> % of the tdrs and  <dig> % of the osrnas.
the circulating nucleic acid kit had the greatest mirna isolation variability, but had the lowest isolation variability for other rna classes .
