in order to develop markers with broad applicability, we designed a bioinformatic approach aimed at avoiding multigenic families while identifying intron positions conserved across metazoan phyla.
we developed a program facilitating the identification of epic loci which allowed slight variation in intron position.
the influence of several factors on amplification success was investigated.
our new method now makes it possible to  rapidly isolate a set of epic markers for any phylum, even outside the animal kingdom, and thus,  compare genetic diversity at potentially homologous polymorphic loci between divergent taxa.
success rate was not related to the phylogenetic relatedness of a taxon to the groups that most influenced primer design, showing that these epic markers are extremely conserved in animals.
despite the impressive growth of sequence databases, the limited availability of nuclear markers that are sufficiently polymorphic for population genetics and phylogeography and applicable across various phyla restricts many potential studies, particularly in non-model organisms.
unfortunately, most of the few known epic  loci are restricted to vertebrates or belong to multigenic families.
remarkably, five of the introns successfully amplified in all of the metazoan genera tested .
