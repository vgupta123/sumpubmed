moreover, the conditions of synthesis closely resemble the natural ones, and all the artifacts accompanying the chemical synthesis of dna are thus eliminated.
with this approach, a synthetic, extremely long dna fragment can be obtained by means of a multiple assembly reaction .
the long, precisely labeled dna duplexes obtained behave in very much the same manner as natural dna and are beyond the range of chemical synthesis.
restriction endonucleases are widely applied in recombinant dna technology.
an enzymatic method for synthesizing long double-stranded dna labeled with the halogen derivatives of nucleobases  with 1-bp accuracy has been put forward and successfully tested on three different dna fragments containing the 5-bromouracil  residue.
