our findings also highlight the metabolic plasticity of b. xylanisolvens towards dietary fibres that contributes to its competitive fitness within the human gut ecosystem.
diet and particularly dietary fibres have an impact on the gut microbiome and play an important role in human health and disease.
this study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms of pectin degradation by the prominent human gut symbiont bacteroides xylanisolvens.
the mutant showed strong growth reduction, thus confirming that pul  <dig> plays a major role in pectin degradation.
this study shows the existence of six puls devoted to pectin degradation by b. xylanisolvens, one of them being particularly important in this function.

considering that hg is the most abundant moiety  within pectin, the importance of pul  <dig> was further investigated by insertion mutagenesis into the susc-like gene.
hence, this species deploys a very complex enzymatic machinery that probably reflects the structural complexity of pectin.
pectin is a highly consumed dietary fibre found in fruits and vegetables and is also a widely used additive in the food industry.
likewise, little is known on gut pectinolytic bacteria and their enzyme systems.
transcriptomic analyses of b. xylanisolvens xb1a grown on citrus and apple pectins at mid- and late-log phases highlighted six polysaccharide utilization loci  that were overexpressed on pectin relative to glucose.
wider functional and ecological studies are needed to understand how dietary fibers and especially plant cell wall polysaccharides drive the composition and metabolism of the fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic community within the gut microbial ecosystem.
