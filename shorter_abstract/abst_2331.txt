continuous time markov chains  is a widely used model for describing the evolution of dna sequences on the nucleotide, amino acid or codon level.
the first algorithm is based on an eigenvalue decomposition of the rate matrix , the second on uniformization , and the third on integrals of matrix exponentials .
in applications past evolutionary events  are unaccessible and the past must be inferred from dna sequence data observed in the present.
we find that they have similar accuracy and that expm is the slowest method.
we describe and implement three algorithms for computing linear combinations of expected values of the sufficient statistics, conditioned on the end-points of the chain, and compare their performance with respect to accuracy and running time.
