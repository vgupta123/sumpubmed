we classified the gpcrs in the fugu genome and our analysis of its  <dig> membrane-bound receptors, available on the public databases as well as from literature, detected  <dig> gpcrs that were grouped into five main families according to the grafs classification system .
on comparison of the gpcr information from the fugu genome with those in the human and chicken genomes, we detected  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  orthology in gpcrs among the fugu-human genomes and fugu-chicken genomes, respectively.
the japanese teleost fugu has been identified as one of the smallest vertebrate genomes and a compact model to study the human genome, owing to the great similarity in its gene repertoire with that of human and other vertebrates.
the evolutionary comparison of gpcr sequences between key vertebrate classes of mammals, birds and fish will help in identifying key functional residues and motifs so as to fill in the blanks in the evolution of gpcrs in vertebrates.
this study reveals the position of pisces in vertebrate evolution from the gpcr perspective.
fugu can act as a reference model for the human genome for other protein families as well, going by the high orthology observed for gpcrs between fugu and human.
