in contrast to p. aeruginosa, both burkholderia species contain these three genes necessary for rhamnolipid production within a single gene cluster.
finally, a double Î”rhla mutant that is completely devoid of rhamnolipid production is incapable of swarming motility, showing that both gene clusters contribute to this phenotype.
orthologs of rhla, rhlb and rhlc, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids in p. aeruginosa, have been found in the non-infectious burkholderia thailandensis, as well as in the genetically similar important pathogen b. pseudomallei.
produce rhamnolipids containing 3-hydroxy fatty acid moieties with longer side chains than those described for p. aeruginosa.
additionally, the rhamnolipids produced by b. thailandensis contain a much larger proportion of dirhamnolipids versus monorhamnolipids when compared to p. aeruginosa.
our results also demonstrate the very impressive tensio-active properties these long-chain rhamnolipids possess in comparison to the well-studied short-chain ones from p. aeruginosa.
separate mutations in both rhla alleles, which are responsible for the synthesis of the rhamnolipid precursor 3-alkanoic acid, prove that both copies of the rhl gene cluster are functional, but one contributes more to the total production than the other.
the rhamnolipids produced by b. thailandensis reduce the surface tension of water to  <dig> mn/m while displaying a critical micelle concentration value of  <dig> mg/l.
collectively, these results add another burkholderia species to the list of bacteria able to produce rhamnolipids and this, by the means of two identical functional gene clusters.
despite this high interest, only very few studies have focused on the production of rhamnolipids by burkholderia species.
furthermore, two identical, paralogous copies of this gene cluster are found on the second chromosome of these bacteria.
