since its discovery, rnai has become a powerful biological technique for gene function studies and drug discovery.
we also found that functional shrnas have less probability for their 3' terminals to be involved in mrna secondary structure formation.
our three-phase algorithm was developed to design sirna on a whole-genome scale based on those identified characteristics of functional sirna.
rna interference  is a cellular mechanism in which a short/small double stranded rna induces the degradation of its sequence specific target mrna, leading to specific gene silencing.
further analysis of the shrna dataset of  <dig> designs reveals that the high free energy states of the two terminals have the largest positive impact on the shrna efficacy.
functional shrnas prefer high free energy states at both terminals.
high free energy states of the two terminals were found to be the largest positive impact factor on shrna efficacy.
in addition, the accessibility of the 3' terminal is another key factor to shrna efficacy.
