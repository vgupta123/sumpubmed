in this paper, we propose the enzymetracker, a web-based laboratory information management system for sample tracking, as an open-source and flexible alternative that aims at facilitating entry, mining and sharing of experimental biological data.
the enzymetracker was designed to be easy to use and offers many benefits over spreadsheets, thus presenting the characteristics required to facilitate acceptance by the scientific community.
in many laboratories, researchers store experimental data on their own workstation using spreadsheets.
our system features a number of tools to visualize and annotate experimental data, and export highly customizable reports.
it has been successfully used for  <dig> months on a daily basis by over  <dig> scientists.
the enzymetracker features online spreadsheets and tools for monitoring numerous experiments conducted by several collaborators to identify and characterize samples.
standard spreadsheets are also error-prone, as data do not undergo any validation process.
