these genes act as dosage suppressors of a synthetic growth defect caused by some mutations in the sup <dig> and sup <dig> genes encoding erf <dig> and erf <dig>  respectively.
extra copies of tef <dig> and tef <dig> can also suppress the temperature sensitivity of some sup <dig> and sup <dig> mutants and reduce nonsense codon readthrough caused by these omnipotent suppressors.
such effects were not shown for extra copies of tef <dig>  which encodes eef1a, thus indicating that they were not due to eef1a activation.
termination of translation in eukaryotes is controlled by two interacting polypeptide chain release factors, erf <dig> and erf <dig>  while erf <dig> recognizes nonsense codons, erf <dig> facilitates polypeptide chain release from the ribosome in a gtp-dependent manner.
besides termination, both release factors have essential, but poorly characterized functions outside of translation.
the data obtained demonstrate involvement of the translation elongation factor eef1b in modulating the functions of translation termination factors and suggest its possible role in gdp for gtp exchange on erf <dig>
besides, overproduction of eef1bα reduces nonsense codon readthrough in the strain carrying suppressor trna.
as a result, the genes for γ  and α  subunits of the translation elongation factor eef1b, known to catalyze the exchange of bound gdp for gtp on eef1a, were revealed.
