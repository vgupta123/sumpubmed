generated set of chickpea ests serves as a resource of high quality transcripts for gene discovery and development of functional markers associated with abiotic stress tolerance that will be helpful to facilitate chickpea breeding.
however, very limited number of molecular markers and candidate genes are available for undertaking molecular breeding in chickpea to tackle these stresses.
hierarchical clustering of  <dig> selected contigs provided clues about stress- responsive candidate genes and their expression profile showed predominance in specific stress-challenged libraries.
a total of  <dig>  sequences containing  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  were identified and  <dig> new est-ssr markers were developed.
functional annotation of unigenes based on blastx analysis showed that  <dig> %  had significant similarity  to sequences in the non-redundant uniprot database.
blastn analysis of unique sequences with ests of four legume species  and three model plant species  provided insights on conserved genes across legumes as well as novel transcripts for chickpea.
this study reports generation and analysis of comprehensive resource of drought- and salinity-responsive expressed sequence tags  and gene-based markers.
recognition sites for restriction enzymes were identified for  <dig>  snps in  <dig> contigs.
chickpea , an important grain legume crop of the world is seriously challenged by terminal drought and salinity stresses.
mapping of gene-based markers in chickpea will also add more anchoring points to align genomes of chickpea and other legume species.
