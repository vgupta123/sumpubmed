the pka antagonist blocked the da induced increases in lp ia gmax, whereas the epac agonist did not induce an increase in lp ia gmax.
alternatively, a 1 hr application of da  generates a persistent  increase in ia gmax in the same neuron, through a mechanistic target of rapamycin  dependent translational mechanism.
8-bromo-camp induced an increase in ia gmax, which was blocked by rapamycin.
the d1r- pka axis, along with erk and mtor are necessary for the persistent increase in lp ia induced by high affinity d1rs.
these data suggest that dopaminergic tone regulates ion channel density in a concentration and time dependent manner.
a 10 min application of 5-100 μm da decreases lp ia by producing a decrease in ia maximal conductance  and a depolarizing shift in ia voltage dependence through a camp-protein kinase a  dependent mechanism.
we found that disrupting normal modulatory tone decreased lp ia.
erk antagonism blocked the da induced persistent increase in lp ia.
to determine if increased camp mediated the persistent effect of 5nm da, we applied the camp analog, 8-bromo-camp alone or with rapamycin for 1 hr, followed by wash and tevc.
finally we tested whether extracellular signal regulated kinase  activity was necessary for the persistent effect by co-application of erk antagonists pd <dig> or u <dig> with da.
