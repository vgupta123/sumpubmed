this resulted in the formation of biofilms on the cell monolayer after incubations of  <dig> and 48Â h. the biofilms can be stained with fluorescent probes, such as a lectin against the polymer of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine present in the biofilm matrix, and easily observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

it has been shown that a. pleuropneumoniae can form biofilms on abiotic surfaces .
in this paper, we describe a method to grow a. pleuropneumoniae biofilms on the sjpl cell line, which represents a biotic surface.
this is the first protocol that describes the formation of an a. pleuropneumoniae biofilm on a biotic surface.
although in vitro models are extremely useful to gain information on biofilm formation, these models may not be representative of the conditions found at the mucosal surface of the host, which is the natural niche of a. pleuropneumoniae.
a non-hemolytic, non-cytotoxic mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae was used in our assays and this allowed the sjpl cell monolayers to be exposed to a. pleuropneumoniae for longer periods.
the advantage of this protocol is that it can be used to study biofilm formation in a context of host-pathogen interactions.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium and a member of the pasteurellaceae family.
this bacterium is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, which is a highly contagious respiratory disease causing important economical losses to the worldwide pig industry.
