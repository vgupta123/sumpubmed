we report a cdna sequence for an opossum ces and present evidence for ces <dig> and ces <dig> like genes expressed in opossum liver and intestine and for distinct gene locations of five opossum ces genes,ces <dig>  ces <dig> , ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  phylogenetic and sequence alignment studies compared the predicted amino acid sequences for opossum ces with those for human, mouse, chicken, frog, salmon and drosophila ces gene products.
amino acid sequences for opossum ces <dig> and three ces <dig> gene products revealed conserved residues previously reported for human ces <dig> involved in catalysis, ligand binding, tertiary structure and organelle localization.
phylogenetic studies indicated the gene duplication events which generated ancestral mammalian ces genes predated the common ancestor for marsupial and eutherian mammals, and appear to coincide with the early diversification of tetrapods.
we also discuss the likely sequence of gene duplication events generating multiple ces genes during vertebrate evolution.
carboxylesterases  perform diverse metabolic roles in mammalian organisms in the detoxification of a broad range of drugs and xenobiotics and may also serve in specific roles in lipid, cholesterol, pheromone and lung surfactant metabolism.
distinct gene locations for opossum ces <dig> , three ces <dig> genes  and a ces <dig> gene  were observed on chromosome  <dig>  opossum ces <dig> and multiple ces <dig> genes were expressed in liver and intestine.
the deduced amino acid sequence for an opossum cdna was consistent with its identity as a mammalian ces <dig> gene product .
phylogenetic analyses produced congruent phylogenetic trees depicting a rapid early diversification into at least five distinct ces gene family clusters: ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  molecular divergence estimates based on a bayesian relaxed clock approach revealed an origin for the five mammalian ces gene families between 328â€“ <dig> mya.
