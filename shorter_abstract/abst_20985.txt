specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the protein data bank  along with the mutational data in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer , graphpac identifies new mutational clusters in well known oncogenes such as egfr and kras.
we propose a novel methodology that increases our power to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary structure via a graph theoretical approach.
further, by utilizing graph theory to account for the tertiary structure, graphpac discovers clusters in dpp <dig>  nrp <dig> and other proteins not identified by existing methods.
graphpac provides an alternative to ipac and an extension to current methodology when identifying potential activating driver mutations by utilizing a graph theoretic approach when considering protein tertiary structure.
for oncogenes specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of "driver" mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis.
using graphpac, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods.
further, due to recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and their resulting tumors, a variety of approaches have been developed to identify potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and mutational clustering.
