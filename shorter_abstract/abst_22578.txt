nop <dig>  also known as pih <dig>  has been shown to be a constituent of the r2tp  and to participate in box c/d snornp assembly by its interaction with nop <dig>  the molecular function of nop <dig>  however, has not yet been described.

box c/d snornps are responsible for rrna methylation and processing, and are formed by snornas and four conserved proteins, nop <dig>  nop <dig>  nop <dig> and snu <dig>  the snornp assembly is a stepwise process, involving other protein complexes, among which the r2tp and hsp <dig> chaperone.
based on the results shown here, we propose a model for the assembly of box c/d snornp, according to which r2tp complex is important for reducing the affinity of nop <dig> for snorna, and for the binding of the other snornp subunits.
