central contributions are rich use of features derived from the training data at multiple levels of granularity, a focus on correctly identifying entity boundaries, and the innovative use of several external knowledge sources including full medline abstracts and web searches.
this system was entered in the biocreative comparative evaluation and achieved a precision of  <dig>  and recall of  <dig>  in the "open" evaluation and a precision of  <dig>  and recall of  <dig>  in the "closed" evaluation.
we present a maximum-entropy based system incorporating a diverse set of features for identifying gene and protein names in biomedical abstracts.
