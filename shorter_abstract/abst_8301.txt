miner allows biologists to explore the dependencies influencing the expression of individual genes in a gene expression data set in the form of decision, model or regression trees, using their domain knowledge to guide the exploration and formulate hypotheses.
miner is being adopted by several of our collaborators and has already led to the discovery of a new significant regulatory relationship with subsequent experimental validation.
this approach has been used successfully with rna microarray data but is applicable to other quantitative data produced by high-throughput technologies such as proteomics and "next generation" dna sequencing.
multiple trees can then be summarised in the form of a gene network diagram.
we have developed miner , an application that combines multivariate non-linear tree learning of individual gene regulatory dependencies, visualisation of these dependencies as both trees and networks, and representation of known biological relationships based on common gene ontology annotations.
numerous approaches have been proposed, most of which attempt only "one-shot" reconstruction of the whole network with no intervention from the user, or offer only simple correlation analysis to infer gene dependencies.
