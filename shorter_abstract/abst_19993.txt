this study provides the first insight into gene expression in venom glands from m. gibbosus scorpion.
up to this moment, no information on the gene characterization of m. gibbosus is available.
in this work, we generated the first catalogue of the gene expression and genomic organization of toxins from m. gibbosus.
a cdna library was generated from the venom glands and subsequently analyzed .
sequence analysis of a new ktx precursor provides evidence to validate a new ktx subfamily .
transcrof toxin genes of scorpion species have been published.
our result represents a relevant contribution to the knowledge of toxin transcripts and complementary information related with other cell function proteins and venom peptide transcripts.
transcriptome analysis is a powerful strategy that provides complete information of the gene expression and molecular diversity of the venom glands .

a second part of this work involves the genomic organization of three meg-chlorotoxin-like genes .
genomic dna sequence reveals close similarities  with the sole genomic organization of chlorotoxins ever reported .
the genomic organization of the chlorotoxin genes may help to understand the diversity of this gene family.
