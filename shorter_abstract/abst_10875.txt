the microtiter plate array system is well suited to the study of protein kinase substrates, antigens, binding molecules, and inhibitors since these all can be quantitatively studied at a single uniform, reproducible interface.
mass spectrometric analyses of the released peptides showed homogeneous peaks of the expected molecular weights.
finally, peptides based on known substrate specificities of c-src and related enzymes were synthesized in microtiter plate array format and were phosphorylated by c-src with the predicted specificities.
synthetic peptides have played a useful role in studies of protein kinase substrates and interaction domains.
synthetic peptide arrays and libraries, in particular, have accelerated the process.
this paper describes a process for synthesis of peptides and phosphopeptides on microtiter plate wells that overcomes previous limitations and demonstrates utility in determination of the epitope of an autophosphorylation site phospho-motif antibody and utility in substrate utilization assays of the protein tyrosine kinase, p60c-src.
the ability of this method to interface with various robotics and instrumentation is highly flexible since the microtiter plate is an industry standard.
