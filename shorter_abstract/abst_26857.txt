atx displayed a unique efficacy with respect to stimulation of sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits.
atx activates voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunits at an undefined recognition site and stimulates sodium influx in neurons.
given the unique pharmacological properties of atx interaction with sodium channel α-subunits, decoding the molecular determinants and mechanism of action of antillatoxin may provide further insight into sodium channel gating mechanisms.
however, the pharmacological properties and selectivity of atx on the sodium channel α-subunits were not fully characterized.
atx produced sodium influx in cells expressing each sodium channel α-subunit, whereas two other sodium channel activators, veratridine and brevetoxin- <dig>  were without effect.
atx also produced robust ca2+ influx relative to other sodium channel activators in the calcium-permeable deaa mutant of rnav <dig>  α-subunit.
antillatoxin  is a structurally unique lipopeptide produced by the marine cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula.
in this study, we characterized the pharmacological properties and selectivity of atx in cells heterologously expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  or rnav <dig>  α-subunits by using the na+ selective fluorescent dye, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate.
the efficacy of atx was distinctive inasmuch as it was not shared by activators of neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig> on vgsc α-subunits.
