it is consistent with previous knowledge, and provides finer details.
we identify species-specific cps and show that their relative abundance is high only in fish and frog, suggesting relevance to water-soluble odorants.
selecting cps according to their evolutionary age, we bicluster ors and cps for each species.
evolutionary age is used to track the history of cp acquisition in the collection of mammalian or families within horde .
using cps we are able to establish remote homology relations between ors and non-or gpcrs.
we identify major cp gain in tetrapods and major losses in reptiles.
clean biclustering emerges when using relatively novel cps.
olfactory receptors  form the largest multigene family in vertebrates.
the cp method provides a novel perspective that reveals interesting traits in the evolution of olfactory receptors.
