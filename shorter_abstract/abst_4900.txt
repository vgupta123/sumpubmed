meanwhile, the activity of pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenas was significantly increased, while the activity of α-phosphoglucose mutase, udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and glucosyltransferase was not affected.
to overcome this problem, pma production from jerusalem artichoke tubers was successfully performed.
with the simplified medium, pma production was obviously stimulated, which would be associated with the improved activity of pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenas.
the jerusalem artichoke medium for pma and pullulan co-production contained only 100 g/l hydrolysate sugar, 30 g/l caco <dig> and 1 g/l nano <dig>  compared with the glucose medium, the jerusalem artichoke medium resulted in a higher pma concentration  and a lower pullulan concentration  in a 5 l bioreactor.
in this study, an economical co-production system for pma and pullulan from jerusalem artichoke was developed.
the medium for pma and pullulan co-production was significantly simplified when jerusalem artichoke tubers were used.

poly  is a water-soluble polyester with many attractive properties in medicine and food industries, but the high cost of pma fermentation has restricted its further application for large-scale production.
to assay the economic-feasibility, large-scale production in a 1 t fermentor was performed, yielding  <dig>  g/l pma and  <dig>  g/l pullulan.
additionally, a valuable exopolysaccharide, pullulan, was co-produced with pma by aureobasidum pullulans ha-4d.
