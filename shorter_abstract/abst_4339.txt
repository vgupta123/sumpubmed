we also found very strong concordance between e. verticillata clades and wolbachia infection status, and the predicted effects of wolbachia on both mtdna diversity and evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotypes.
the results also indicate that wolbachia strains infecting e. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial dna.
our study reveals that the pollinating wasp e. verticillata on f. microcarpa has diverged into three cryptic species, and wolbachia may have a role in this divergence.
we found that all wasps were morphologically identified as eupristina verticillata, but diverged into three clades with  <dig> - <dig> % mtdna divergence and  <dig> - <dig> % nuclear gene divergence.
in addition, wolbachia can affect host mitochondrial dna evolution, because of the linkage between wolbachia and associated mitochondrial haplotypes, and thus confound host phylogeny based on mtdna.
previous research has shown that fig wasps have the highest incidence of wolbachia infection in all insect taxa, and wolbachia may have great influence on fig wasp biology.
therefore, we look forward to understanding the influence of wolbachia on mitochondrial dna evolution and speciation in fig wasps.
they may evolve from insect speciation induced or facilitated by wolbachia which can manipulate host reproduction and induce reproductive isolation.
figs and fig-pollinating wasp species usually display a highly specific one-to-one association.
