an expanded tree approach consists of adding missing species to random locations within their clade.
we propose algorithms for both randomly expanding trees and calculating distance matrices.
thus, the random expansion and processing of multiple phylogenetic trees can be used to estimate the phylogenetic uncertainty through a simulation procedure.
our results open up the possibility of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty in evolutionary and ecological analyses of large datasets.
however, most phylogenetic trees are incomplete with regard to species sampling, which may critically compromise analyses.
in this paper, we present efficient algorithms and implementations for randomly expanding and processing phylogenetic trees so that simulations involved in comparative phylogenetic analysis with uncertainty can be conducted in a reasonable time.
the code may be used as a standalone program or as a shared object in the r system.
the information contained in the topology of the resulting expanded trees can be captured by the pairwise phylogenetic distance between species and stored in a matrix for further statistical analysis.
phylogenetic comparative analyses usually rely on a single consensus phylogenetic tree in order to study evolutionary processes.
some approaches have been proposed to integrate non-molecular phylogenetic information into incomplete molecular phylogenies.
because of the computational burden required, unless this procedure is efficiently implemented, the analyses are of limited applicability.
we made available the source code, which was written in the c++ language.
