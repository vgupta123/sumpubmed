additionally, the ksga knockout strain showed an increased sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
we have analyzed ksga’s contribution to ribosome biogenesis and cell growth in staphylococcus aureus.
overexpression of a catalytically inactive ksga mutant was deleterious in the knockout strain but not the wild-type strain; this negative phenotype disappeared at low temperature.
our results in s. aureus are in contrast to results previously described in e. coli, where the catalytically inactive protein showed a negative phenotype in the presence or absence of endogenous ksga.
we found that deletion of ksga in s. aureus led to a cold-sensitive growth phenotype, although ksga was not as critical for ribosome biogenesis as it was shown to be in e. coli.
understanding of ksga’s important role in ribosome biogenesis has been recently expanded in escherichia coli; these studies help explain why ksga is so highly conserved and also suggest ksga’s potential as an antimicrobial drug target.
this work extends the study of ksga, allowing comparison of this aspect of ribosome biogenesis between a gram-negative and a gram-positive organism.
