protein-protein interactions play a critical role in protein function.
completion of many genomes is being followed rapidly by major efforts to identify interacting protein pairs experimentally in order to decipher the networks of interacting, coordinated-in-action proteins.
identification of protein-protein interaction sites and detection of specific amino acids that contribute to the specificity and the strength of protein interactions is an important problem with broad applications ranging from rational drug design to the analysis of metabolic and signal transduction networks.
these approaches include: data mining using support vector machines, threading through protein structures, prediction of conserved residues on the protein surface by analysis of phylogenetic trees, and the conservatism of conservatism method of mirny and shakhnovich.
in order to increase the power of predictive methods for protein-protein interaction sites, we have developed a consensus methodology for combining four different methods.
we developed a consensus method for predicting protein-protein interface residues by combining sequence and structure-based methods.
results obtained on a dataset of hydrolase-inhibitor complexes demonstrate that the combination of all four methods yield improved predictions over the individual methods.
