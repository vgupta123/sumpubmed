we observed a gradual increase of paternal sirna expression in the early stages of kernels and an expected 2: <dig> maternal to paternal ratio in 7-dap endosperm via sequencing of small interfering rna  transcriptomes in developing kernels ) and endosperms  from the maize b <dig> and mo <dig> reciprocal crosses.
additionally, gene ontology terms of “response to auxin stimulus”, “response to brassinosteroid stimulus” and “regulation of gene expression” were enriched with genes harboring 10-dap specific sirnas, whereas those of “nutrient reservoir activity”, “protein localization to vacuole” and “secondary metabolite biosynthetic process” were enriched with genes harboring 15-dap specific sirnas.
a subset of sirnas subjected to imprinted expression pattern in maize developing endosperm, and they are likely correlated with certain imprinted gene expression.
additionally, sirnas might influence nutrient uptake and allocation processes during maize endosperm development.
additionally,  <dig> imprinted sirna loci were identified in the endosperm, with the majority  being maternally expressed at  <dig> dap.
moreover,  <dig> out of  <dig> imprinted genes harbored imprinted sirna loci within their 2-kb flanking regions, a significant higher frequency than expected based on simulation analysis.
