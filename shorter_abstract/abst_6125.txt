moreover, lifeact-mturquoise <dig> expression in adult animals allowed the identification of various cell types as well as cellular boundaries.
we used fluorescent probes expressed in vivo to investigate the dynamics of nematostella development.
utilizing fluorescent probes in vivo helped to identify a concentrated ‘flash’ of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> around the nucleus, immediately prior to cytokinesis in developing embryos.
lifeact-mturquoise <dig>  a fluorescent cyan f-actin probe, can be visualized within microvilli along the cellular surface throughout embryonic development and is stable for two months after injection.
the cnidarian model, nematostella vectensis, is a unique system in which embryology and regeneration are both studied, making it an ideal candidate to develop in vivo imaging techniques.

co-expression of lifeact-mturquoise <dig> with end-binding protein <dig>  fused to mvenus or tdtomato-nls allows for the visualization of cell-cycle properties in real time.
