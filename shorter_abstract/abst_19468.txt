his second parity rule stating that the base proportions of double-stranded dna are also reflected in single-stranded dna  is more obscure, likely because its biological basis and significance are still unresolved.
human mitochondrial dna does not demonstrate such intra-strand parity, and we consider how its different functional drivers may relate to our theory.
