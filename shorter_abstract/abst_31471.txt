however, a closer investigation of individual gene expression profiles identified genes that were specifically modulated by defoliation at each stage, reflecting the uncoupling of metabolic processes such as flavonoid biosynthesis, cell wall and stress metabolism, from the general ripening program.
the specific transcriptional modifications we observed following defoliation at different time points allow the identification of the developmental or metabolic processes affected in berries thus deepening the knowledge of the mechanisms by which these agronomical practices impact the final berry ripening traits.
the selective removal of grapevine leaves around berry clusters can improve the quality of ripening fruits by influencing parameters such as the berry sugar and anthocyanin content at harvest.
we found that pre-bloom defoliation improved berry quality traits such as sugar and anthocyanin content, whereas defoliation at veraison had a detrimental effect, e.g.
moreover, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis to explore the impact of these defoliation treatments on berry transcriptome.
we removed the basal leaves from vitis vinifera l. cv sangiovese shoots at the pre-bloom and veraison stages, and investigated responses such as shoot growth, fruit morphology and composition compared to untreated controls.
the outcome depends strongly on the timing of defoliation, which influences the sourceâ€“sink balance and the modified microclimate surrounding the berries.
less anthocyanin and higher incidence of sunburn damage.
