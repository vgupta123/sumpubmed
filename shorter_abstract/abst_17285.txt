it is now popularly accepted that there was an “rna world” in early evolution of life.
in the rna world, such a takeover may have been triggered by the emergence of some ribozyme favoring the formation of deoxynucleotides.
it shows that an rna-by-dna genetic takeover may be triggered by the emergence of a nucleotide reductase ribozyme with a moderate activity in a pure rna system.
in relation to the subsequent evolution, an advanced system with a larger genome, which uses dna as genetic material and rna as functional material, is modeled – the system cannot sustain if the nucleotide reductase ribozyme is “turned off” .
several virtues of dna  – higher stability against hydrolysis, greater suitability as template and higher fidelity in replication, should have, each in its own way, all been significant for the genetic takeover in evolution.
this idea has a direct consequence that later on there should have been a takeover of genetic material – rna by dna.
however, since genetic material carries genetic information, the “source code” of all living activities, it is actually reasonable to question the plausibility of such a “revolutionary” transition.
the transition may initially have been “weak”, but could have been reinforced by environmental changes unfavorable to rna , and would have ultimately become irreversible accompanying the genome’s enlargement.
due to our inability to model relevant “primitive living systems” in reality, it is as yet impossible to explore the plausibility and mechanisms of the “genetic takeover” by experiments.
