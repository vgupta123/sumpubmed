in the vehicle-treated group, electrophysiological recordings showed that h-reflex disappeared at 24 h after the last pyridoxine treatment.
in the results of immunohistochemistry, the ngf plasmid administration efficiently expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and significantly increased the pyridoxine-induced reduction of calcitonin gene-related peptide  immunoreactive neurons, but not in substance p immunoreactive neurons, in the dorsal root ganglia.
given these results, we reason that ngf gene therapy in pyridoxine induced neuropathic dogs does not induce neuropathic pain with this dosage, even with increasing the expression of cgrp.
only in the vehicle-treated group, weight loss occurred, while ngf plasmid inoculation significantly improved this physical abnormalities.
nerve growth factor  is known not only as a major factor for neuronal plasticity but also as a pain stimulator.

for pain assessment, physical examination and electrophysiological recording were performed.
in this study, the pain induced by ngf gene therapy was evaluated.
