the open reading frame of the hmgcr-1b transcript potentially encodes  <dig> additional amino acids at the n-terminus, compared with hmgcr-1a.
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  was used to examine the mrna levels of hmgcr in different tissues; hmgcr-1a was the most highly expressed variant in most tissues, with the exception of the skin, esophagus, and uterine cervix, in which hmgcr-1b was the most highly expressed transcript.
atorvastatin treatment of hepg <dig> cells resulted in increased hmgcr-1b mrna levels, but unaltered proximal promoter activity compared to untreated cells.
further studies are needed to investigate whether hmgcr splice variants identified in this study are physiologically functional.
in contrast, hmgcr-1c showed a more restricted transcription pattern, but was also induced by atorvastatin treatment.
alternative splicing of hmgcr has been implicated in the control of cholesterol homeostasis.
