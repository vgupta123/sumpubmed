written in java, treebuilder3d is a platform-independent, open source application, which may be useful in analysis of large-scale gene expression data.
the program allows loading expression data as plain text files and visualizing the relative differences of the analyzed datasets in 3-dimensional space using various distance metrics.
visualizing the results in a 3-dimentional space may further enhance these techniques.
we designed and built treebuilder3d, an interactive viewer for visualizing the hierarchical relationships between expression profiles such as sage libraries or microarrays.
