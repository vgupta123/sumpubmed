plasma adiponectin levels rose in mice treated with bvt <dig> and this was found to be both the hexameric and the high molecular weight multimeric forms of adiponectin.
cortisone is transformed to its active form cortisol, via 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig>  this study sought to ascertain if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> with a new selective inhibitor, bvt <dig>  affects the concentrations of circulating adiponectin with concomitant effects on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.
the differences seen in adiponectin between bvt <dig> and bvt <dig> could be explained by different pharmacodynamics exerted by the compounds in different tissues in the body.
seven days of treatment with the 11β hsd1-inhibitor bvt <dig> decreased basal insulin levels but no changes in glucose tolerance were seen.
increases in adiponectin concentrations may be an integral component in the mechanism of action of this new11β hsd <dig> inhibitor and may be a useful marker of efficacy during the clinical development of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor compounds.
kkay mice were treated with bvt <dig> , rosiglitazone  or vehicle once daily for ten days.
