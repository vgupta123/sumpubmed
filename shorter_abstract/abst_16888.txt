from each of four healthy individuals we generated long rna  profiles from total and ribosomal-rna depleted rna preparations, as well as short rna  profiles.
the data are available through a local mirror of the ucsc genome browser and can be accessed at:
we observed a strong correlation between mrnas identified by rna-seq and microarray for well-expressed mrnas, but rnaseq identified many more transcripts of lower abundance and permitted discovery of novel transcripts.
surprisingly, ribosomal-rna depletion significantly and adversely affected estimates of the relative abundance of transcripts.
our analyses revealed diverse classes of non-coding rnas, including: pervasive antisense transcripts to protein-coding loci; numerous, previously unreported and abundant micrornas; retrotransposons; and thousands of novel un-annotated long and short intronic transcripts, an intriguing finding considering the anucleate nature of platelets.
estimates of genome-wide platelet rna expression using microarrays have provided insights to the platelet transcriptome but were limited by the number of known transcripts.
