more importantly, the identification of numerous interspecific genetic variations provides the basis and is very practical for future introgression breeding.
the results presented herein provide a valuable genomic resource for new insights into the genetics and breeding of cotton.
3â€“ <dig>  based on the new data sets, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees that showed a high concordance to the phylogeny of diploid and polyploid cottons.
the comprehensive analysis of dna polymorphisms provided invaluable insights into the different tetraploid cotton species.
using slaf-seq, a large number of dna polymorphisms were identified.
intriguingly, gene ontology  enrichment analysis revealed that a number of significant terms were related to reproduction in g. barbadense acc.
a large amount of interspecific genetic variations were identified, and some of them were validated by the single-strand conformation polymorphism  method, which will be applied in introgression genetics and breeding with g. hirsutum cv.
understanding the genomic variation of tetraploid cotton species is important for exploitation of the excellent characteristics of wild cotton and for improving the diversity of cotton in breeding.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads,  <dig>  specific length amplified fragment  tags and  <dig>  high-quality dna polymorphisms were identified using specific length amplified fragment sequencing , including  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels between the reference genome  and the five tetraploid cotton species.
however, the discovery of dna polymorphisms in tetraploid cotton genomes has lagged behind other important crops.
