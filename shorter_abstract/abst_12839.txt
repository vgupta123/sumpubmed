in this study, we imaged photon emission from plant leaves.
we were able to carry out time course imaging of both delayed chlorophyll fluorescence from whole leaves, and of low level wound-induced luminescence that we showed to be localised to sites of tissue damage.
we developed a novel configuration of a cooled charge-coupled device  for 2-dimensional imaging of light emission from biological material.
methods for imaging this ultra-weak luminescence have previously been limited by the sensitivity of the detection systems used.
the equipment allowed short integration times for image acquisition, providing high resolution spatial and temporal information on bioluminescence.
