the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the rctcap enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  developed in this study are  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, compared with the results from ifas on  <dig> sera samples from pigs.
the indirect elisa that we developed with rctcap, the recombinant capsid fragment containing the 217–342 nt repeat domain, was sensitive, specific, and suitable for the large-scale detection of p <dig> infections in swine.

because p <dig> has high homology to porcine circovirus type  <dig>  at the nucleotide level, the c-terminal portion of the capsid protein , a discriminative antigen, was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system.
