emb-lpd ebs grow to a larger size than npd ebs and express reduced gata <dig> transcription factor  at mrna and protein levels, similar to emb-lpd pe derivative visceral yolk sac tissue in vivo in later gestation.
we analysed histone modifications at the gata <dig> promoter in emb-lpd ebs using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
consistent with these changes, histone deacetylase hdac- <dig>  but not hdac- <dig>  gene expression was upregulated in emb-lpd ebs.
we found significant reduction in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation and rna polymerase ii binding compared with npd ebs, all markers of reduced transcription.
we use embryonic stem  cell lines established previously from emb-lpd and npd blastocysts that were differentiated into embryoid bodies  with outer pe-like layer.
first, these data demonstrate es cells and ebs retain and propagate nutritional programming adaptations in vitro, suitable for molecular analysis of mechanisms, reducing animal use.
here, we investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying nutritional programming of pe that may contribute to its altered phenotype, stabilised during subsequent development.
other histone modifications, h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  were unaltered.
second, they reveal maternal diet induces persistent changes in histone modifications to regulate gata <dig> expression and pe growth and differentiation that may affect lifetime health.
