in contrast very little is known about the physiology of nitrate transport towards different plant tissues and in particular at the leaf level.
obtained results provide for the first time evidence that a saturable and substrate-inducible nitrate uptake mechanism operates in cucumber leaves.
the quantity and activity of plasma membrane  h+-atpase of the vesicles isolated from leaf tissues of nitrate-treated plants for 12 h  increased with respect to that observed in the vesicles isolated from n-deprived control plants, thus suggesting an involvement of this enzyme in the leaf nitrate uptake process similar to that described in roots.
net nitrate uptake by roots of nitrate-depleted cucumber plants proved to be substrate-inducible and biphasic showing a saturable kinetics with a clear linear non saturable component at an anion concentration higher than 2 mm.
however the question about the molecular entity responsible for the transport of nitrate into leaf cells therefore still remains unresolved.
at the leaf level, nitrate treatment modulated the expression of csha <dig>  highlighting a main putative role of this isogene in the process.
nitrate uptake by leaf discs of cucumber plants showed some similarities with that operating in the roots .
the mechanism of nitrate uptake in leaves of cucumber  plants was studied and compared with that of the root.
molecular analyses suggest the involvement of a specific isoform of pm h+-atpase  and nrt <dig> transporter  in root nitrate uptake.
however, it did not exhibit typical biphasic kinetics and was characterized by a higher km with values out of the range usually recorded in roots of several different plant species.
the mechanisms by which nitrate is transported into the roots have been characterized both at physiological and molecular levels.
