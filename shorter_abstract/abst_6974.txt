our results suggest that candidate subgenome-specific loci are randomly located across the genomes, and that there are small- to large-scale structural variations among the subgenomes.

although it is the most widely consumed berry crop in the world, its complex genome structure has hindered its genetic and genomic analysis, and thus discrimination of subgenome-specific loci among the homoeologous chromosomes is needed.
comparative analysis of the homoeologous linkage groups revealed differences in genome structure among the subgenomes.
the  <dig>  loci were located on  <dig> unique positions  on the linkage map.
the mapped snps and ssr loci on the linkage map are expected to be seed points for the construction of pseudomolecules in the octoploid strawberry.
in the present study, we identified candidate subgenome-specific single nucleotide polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  loci, and constructed a linkage map using an s <dig> mapping population of the cultivar ‘reikou’ with an istraw <dig> axiom® snp array and previously published ssr markers.
the ‘reikou’ linkage map consisted of  <dig>  loci  spanning  <dig>  cm of  <dig> linkage groups.
