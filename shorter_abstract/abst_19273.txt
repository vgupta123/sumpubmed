we reasoned that the decision of flies to land somewhere in order to achieve aggregation is based on simultaneous integration of signals  during their flight.
this behavioural ecology constitutes an excellent model for analyzing simultaneous processing of neurosensory information.
on the basis of what flies do in nature, we designed laboratory tests to analyze the phenomenon of neuronal coincidence.
