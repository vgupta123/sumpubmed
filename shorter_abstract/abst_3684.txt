yet absence of a s-adenosyl-methionine synthetase in chlamydia, the conserved enzyme involved in the synthesis of the methyl donor s-adenosyl-l-methionine, raises a doubt concerning the activity of the ksga homolog in these organisms.
the presence of a functional rrna dimethylase enzyme belonging to the ksga family in chlamydia presents an excellent chemotherapeutic target with real potential.
c. trachomatis growth was sensitive to ksm and we were able to isolate a ksm resistant mutant of c. trachomatis containing a frameshift mutation in ksga, which led to the formation of a shorter protein with no activity.
all sequenced genomes of chlamydia reveal a ksga homolog in each species, including c. trachomatis.
expression of the c. trachomatis l <dig> ksga ortholog restored ksm sensitivity to the e. coli ksga mutant, suggesting that the chlamydial ksga homolog has specific rrna dimethylase activity.
growth of the c. trachomatis ksga mutant was negatively affected in cell culture highlighting the importance of the methylase in the development of these obligate intracellular and as yet genetically intractable pathogens.
they are responsible for the post-transcriptional transfer of two methyl groups to two universally conserved adenosines located near the 3'end of the small subunit rrna and participate in ribosome maturation.
lack of the dimethylated adenosines following ksga inactivation confers resistance to kasugamycin  in e. coli.
