eiptope mapping led to the identification of a “core sequence” responsible for antibody recognition within the peptide.
in vitro microneutralization experiments showed that anti-chimeric vlps sera were able to neutralize not only ev <dig> of genotype c <dig> but also ev <dig> of genotype a. neonatal mice model confirmed the neutralizing ability of anti-chimeric vlps sera.
the chimeric vlps have a great potential to be a novel vaccine candidate with a broad cross-protection against different ev <dig> genotypes.
expression of fusion proteins in e. coli resulted in the formation of chimeric virus-like particles .
immunization of chimeric vlps is able to elicit antibodies displaying a broad neutralizing activity against different genotypes of ev <dig> in vitro.
mice immunized with the chimeric vlps elicited anti-vp4n <dig> antibody response.
