these differences in metabolic potential lead to several testable hypotheses about physiology and metabolism of microbes from these ecosystems.
metagenomics also has the potential to identify significantly different metabolic potential in different environments.
this analysis reveals those subsystems that are more, or less, represented in the different environments that are compared.
subsystems that were overrepresented in the sargasso sea and acid mine drainage metagenome when compared to non-redundant databases were identified.
the methodology described herein applies statistics to the comparisons of metabolic potential in metagenomes.
