atherosclerosis affects aorta, coronary, carotid, and iliac arteries most frequently than any other body vessel.
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released in the blood flux were investigated in parallel.
activation of the jak/stat pathway is confirmed by the up-regulation of il- <dig>  stat <dig>  isgf3g and il10ra genes in coronary and carotid plaques.
plaque presence and diffusion is revealed by circulating factors that can mediate systemic reaction leading to plaque rupture and thrombosis.
there may be common molecular pathways sustaining this process.
high levels of rantes, il-1ra, mip-1alpha, mip-1beta, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  pdgf-bb, vegf and ifn-gamma were found in plasma of atherosclerotic patients and might also be integrated in the molecular networks underlying atherosclerotic modifications of these vessels.
moreover, cav- <dig> is involved in smc differentiation and dyslipidemia confirming the importance of lipid homeostasis in the atherosclerotic phenotype.
caveolae and jak/stat pathways, and s100a9/s100a <dig> interacting proteins are certainly involved in the development of vascular disease.
the functional network constructed in our research is an evidence of the central role of stat protein and the caveolae system to contribute to preserve the plaque.
we found that the system of caveolae is directly connected with genes that respond to hormone receptors, and indirectly with the apoptosis pathway.
