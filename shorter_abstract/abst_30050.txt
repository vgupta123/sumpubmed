an ensemble clustering method has the ability to perform consensus clustering over the same set of genes from different microarray datasets by combining results from different clustering methods into a single consensus result.
one recently described bi-copam method can analyse expressions of the same set of genes from various microarray datasets while using different clustering methods, and then combine these results into a single consensus result whose clustersâ€™ tightness is tunable from tight, specific clusters to wide, overlapping clusters.
additionally, we have demonstrated the usefulness of the bi-copam-based approach, which may be helpful for the analysis of other groups of  datasets from other species and systems for the exploration of global genetic co-expression.
most strikingly, average expression profiles of those clusters are consistently negatively correlated in all of the forty datasets while neither profile leads or lags the other.
therefore, it is possible that this mostly uncharacterised cluster and the ribosomal biogenesis cluster are transcriptionally oppositely regulated by some common machinery.
the biological processes of most of the genes in the second cluster are either unknown or apparently unrelated although they show high connectivity in protein-protein and genetic interaction networks.
this has been adopted in a novel way over genome-wide data from forty yeast microarray datasets to discover two clusters of genes that are consistently co-expressed over all of these datasets from different biological contexts and various experimental conditions.
the first cluster is enriched with ribosomal biogenesis genes.
