in other terms, the fixation probability of altruistic genes can be higher than those of a selfish ones, even though altruists have a smaller fitness.
the lower fitness implies that altruists should be selected against, which is in contradiction with their widespread presence is nature.
the above results are obtained both by numerical and analytical calculations.
analytical results are obtained in the limit of large populations.
moreover when populations are geographically structured, the altruists advantage can be highly amplified and the fixation probability of selfish genes can tend toward zero.
