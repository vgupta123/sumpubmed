the present study investigated the potential of bovine whartonâ€™s jelly mesenchymal stromal cells  to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype and support robust bohv- <dig> replication.
these findings constitute a remarkable contribution to the in vitro study of neurotropic viruses.
bovine herpesvirus type  <dig> , frequently lethal in cattle, is associated with significant agricultural economic losses due to neurological disease.
the results demonstrated the ability of bwj-mscs to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype in vitro and support productive bohv- <dig> replication.
this work may pave the way for bwj-mscs to be used as an alternative to animal models in the study of bohv- <dig> biology.
following bohv- <dig> inoculation, there were low rates of cell detachment, good cell viability at  <dig> h post-infection , and small vesicles developed along neuronal branches.
in particular, neural invasion and proliferation are two of the factors important in bohv- <dig> infection.
