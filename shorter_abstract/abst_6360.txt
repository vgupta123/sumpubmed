hypocrea jecorina  is a filamentous ascomycete of industrial importance due to its hydrolases .
the optimal conditions and templates for the chromatography step were chosen according to the results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay performed under repressing conditions, which yielded a dna-protein complex specific to the agaa-box .
with the results from these analyses, we eliminated all but three candidate proteins.
we identified a putative transcription factor that is potentially involved in repressing xylanase  <dig> expression.
thus, we succeeded in identifying novel, putative transcription factors for the regulation of xylanase expression in h. jecorina.
the regulation of gene expression can influence the composition of the hydrolase cocktail, and thus, transcription factors are a major target of current research.
we generated this protein with in vitro translation and used an emsa to demonstrate the existence of an agaa-box-specific protein-dna complex.
we used streptavidin affinity chromatography to isolate the xylanase promoter-binding protein  <dig> .
we compared the identified peptides to sequences in the h. jecorina genome and predicted in silico the function and dna-binding ability of the identified proteins.
