different methods were assessed on a benchmark set of  <dig> disease names manually mapped to mesh terms.
although the uniprot knowledgebase is not a medical-oriented database, it contains information on more than  <dig>  human proteins involved in pathologies.
however, these annotations are not standardized, which impairs the interoperability between biological and clinical resources.
in order to make these data easily accessible to clinical researchers, we have developed a procedure to link diseases described in the uniprotkb/swiss-prot entries to the mesh disease terminology.
this study is a first attempt to link proteins in uniprotkb to the medical resources.
we mapped disease names extracted either from the uniprotkb/swiss-prot entry comment lines or from the corresponding omim entry to the mesh.
using the same procedure, more than  <dig>  disease names in swiss-prot were mapped to mesh with comparable efficiency.
