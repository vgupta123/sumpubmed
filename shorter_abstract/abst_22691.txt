the insect cell line is a critical component in the production of recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression system and new cell lines hold the promise of increasing both quantity and quality of protein production.
ao <dig> cells grew rapidly in stationary culture with a population doubling time of  <dig>  hr, and ao <dig> cells were readily adapted to serum-free medium  and to a suspension culture system.
among  <dig> rapidly growing lines, cell line  <dig>  was selected for further analysis, based on susceptibility to acmnpv infection and production of secreted alkaline phosphatase  from a baculovirus expression vector.
ao <dig> cells were highly susceptible to acmnpv infection, similar to infectivity of sf <dig> cells.
ao <dig> cells represent a highly productive new insect cell line that will be useful for heterologous protein expression and other applications in biotechnology.
seventy cell lines were established by single-cell cloning from a primary culture of cells derived from eggs of the black witch moth .
analysis of ao <dig> and a parental ascalapha odorata cell line indicated that these lines were free of the alphanodavirus that was recently identified as an adventitious agent in high five cell lines.
