this fact has motivated the effort to develop a comprehensive biodiversity inventory for the churchill region by coupling dna barcoding with morphological studies.
because most  sequence clusters at coi corresponded with a named taxon, dna barcoding reliably identifies spiders in the churchill fauna.
because it is positioned on the ecotone between tundra and boreal forest, the churchill area is a strategic locality for the analysis of shifts in faunal composition.
arctic ecosystems, especially those near transition zones, are expected to be strongly impacted by climate change.
most species displayed little intraspecific sequence variation  in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  gene, but four species showed considerably higher values , suggesting cryptic species.
few cryptic species of spiders were detected, a result contrasting with the prevalence of undescribed species in several other terrestrial arthropod groups at churchill.
<dig> species were detected among  <dig> spiders analyzed, tripling the count for the churchill region.
three species new to canada were detected: robertus lyrifer , baryphyma trifrons , and satilatlas monticola .
the present study represents one element of this effort; it focuses on analysis of the spider fauna at churchill.
this study provides the first comprehensive dna barcode reference library for the spider fauna of any region.
the first description of the female of s. monticola was also presented.
