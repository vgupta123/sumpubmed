the integrated model of the circadian clock circuit and aba-regulated environmental sensing allowed us to explain multiple experimental observations on the timing and stomatal responses to genetic and environmental perturbations.
the transcriptional regulator toc <dig>  is a founding component of the gene circuit in the plant circadian clock.
we extended the mathematical model of the plant clock gene circuit by incorporating the repression of multiple clock genes by toc <dig>  observed experimentally.
recent results show that toc <dig> suppresses transcription of multiple target genes within the clock circuit, far beyond its previously-described regulation of the morning transcription factors lhy  and cca <dig> .
these results crystallise a new role of toc <dig> as an environmental sensor, which both affects the pace of the central oscillator and modulates the kinetics of downstream processes.
increased aba levels lengthen the free-running period of the clock, consistent with the experimental data.
