the accessory gene pool shapes species-specific traits.
it is also influenced by reductive genome evolution and horizontal gene transfer.
a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer appears to be gene translocations leading to remodeling of bacteriophages in combination with broad tropism.
<dig> classes of unique and shared genes were analyzed in b. intermedia, b. murdochii, b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli.
the largest number of unique genes was found in b. intermedia and b. murdochii.
a  <dig>  kb plasmid was found in b. intermedia strain pws/at.
within the brachyspira genomes, genes had been translocated and also frequently switched between leading and lagging strands, a process that can be followed by different at-skews in the third positions of synonymous codons.
the plasmid was also present in the b. murdochii strain but not in nine other brachyspira isolates.
brachyspira intermedia can cause production losses in chickens and strain pws/at now becomes the fourth genome to be completed in the genus brachyspira.
in general, hypothetical protein annotations are overrepresented among the unique genes.
colonize the intestines of some mammalian and avian species and show different degrees of enteropathogenicity.
