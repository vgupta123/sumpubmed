to demonstrate practical relevance, we utilize mutation information from text to evaluate a novel solvation energy based model for the prediction of stabilizing regions in membrane proteins.
in 71% reported phenotypes were in compliance with the model predictions, supporting a relation between mutations and stability issues in membrane proteins.
vice versa, we could show that gene recognition improved from 77% to 91% f-measure when considering mutation information given in the text.
we developed a rule- and regular expression-based protein point mutation retrieval pipeline for pubmed abstracts, which shows an f-measure of 87% for the mutation retrieval task on a benchmark dataset.
we present a reliable approach for the retrieval of protein mutations from pubmed abstracts for any set of genes or proteins of interest.
the automated retrieval and integration of information about protein point mutations in combination with structure, domain and interaction data from literature and databases promises to be a valuable approach to study structure-function relationships in biomedical data sets.
in order to link mutations to their proteins, we utilize a named entity recognition algorithm for the identification of gene names co-occurring in the abstract, and establish links based on sequence checks.
