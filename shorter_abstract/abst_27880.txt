finally we observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic processes on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation on the other hand.
we carried out large-scale transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal model e. siliculosus to cu stress, and compared these data to results known for other abiotic stressors.
concomitantly, cu stress specifically activated a set of genes coding for orthologs of abc transporters, a p1b-type atpase, ros detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents.
most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they face frequent environmental changes, including exposure to toxic levels of heavy metals such as copper .
brown algae are sessile macro-organisms of great ecological relevance in coastal ecosystems.

comparisons with data from green plants indicate that some processes involved in cu and oxidative stress response are conserved across these two distant lineages.
of particular interest for future research is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species -, myo-inositol-, and oxylipin signaling.
this comparison demonstrates that cu induces oxidative stress in e. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between cu and h2o <dig> treatments.
they evolved independently from land plants and other multicellular lineages, and therefore hold several original ontogenic and metabolic features.
