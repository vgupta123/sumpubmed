activation of expression by both metals in roots is primarily localized to the xylem parenchyma cells.
gus expression in ni2+ treated seedlings was localized in roots, particularly in the root-shoot transition zone.
in shoots gus expression was prominently present in the vasculature of leaves, and floral parts.
our studies establish that a  <dig> bp dna fragment upstream of the bjmtp <dig> translational start site is sufficient for the specific activation by ni2+ and cd2+ of bjmtp <dig> expression primarily in roots.
this study is the first to identify specific ni2+ and cd2+ transcriptional regulation and tissue localization of bjmtp <dig>
here we present data on the transcriptional regulation and localization of expression of the homologous gene bjmtp <dig> in brassica juncea.
our goal in this study is to determine the transcriptional regulation of mtp <dig> in order to start to better understanding the physiological role of mtp <dig> in b. juncea.
though b. juncea lacks the ability to hyperaccumulate metals, its relatively high biomass, rapid growth and relatedness to true metal hyperaccumulating plants makes it a promising starting point for the development of plants for phytoremediation.
steady-state mrna levels of bjmtp <dig> were found to be enhanced  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -fold in five-day-old b. juncea seedlings after exposure to ni2+, cd2+ or zn2+, respectively.
this was also reflected in enhanced gus activity in b. juncea seedlings transformed with bjmtp <dig> promoter::gusplus after exposure to these metals over a similar range of toxicities from mild to severe.
however, no increase in gus activity was observed after exposure of seedlings to cold or heat stress, nacl or hydrogen peroxide.
in four- week- old transgenic plants bjmtp <dig> promoter activity also primarily increased in roots in response to ni2+ or cd2+ in plants transformed with either gus or mrfp <dig> as reporter genes, and expression was localized to the secondary xylem parenchyma.
