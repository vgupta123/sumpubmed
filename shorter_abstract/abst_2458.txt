asynchronous inference of regulatory networks  provides gene signaling network inference using more practical assumptions about the microarray data.
by learning correlation patterns for the changes in microarray values from all pairs of samples, accurate network reconstructions can be performed with data that is normally available in microarray experiments.
previous work has used time series microarray data to infer gene signaling networks given a large number of accurate time series samples.
microarray data available for many biological experiments is limited to a small number of arrays with little or no time series guarantees.
when several samples are averaged to examine differences in mean value between a diseased and normal state, information from individual samples that could indicate a gene relationship can be lost.
by focussing on the changes between microarray samples, instead of absolute values, increased information can be gleaned from expression data.
