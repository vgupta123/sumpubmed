a combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning strategy is needed to construct domain ontologies and lexicons and to ultimately achieve automated semantic annotation of morphological descriptions.
large volumes of morphological descriptions of whole organisms have been created as print or electronic text in a human-readable format.
this paper attempts to examine the hindering factors by identifying the mismatches between existing research and the characteristics of morphological descriptions.
this paper reviews the techniques that have been used for automated annotation, reports exploratory results on characteristics of morphological descriptions as a genre, and identifies challenges facing automated annotation systems.
based on these criteria, the paper proposes an overall strategy for converting descriptions of various taxon groups with the least human effort.
this cannot be done without a sound strategy and a close partnership between and among information scientists and biologists.
further, we suggest that each effort in creating a new description or annotating an individual description collection should be shared and contribute to the "biodiversity information commons" for the semantic web.
