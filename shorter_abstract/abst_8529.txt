gene cnvs were assessed in three full-sib families from species with  <dig> gb genomes, i.e., white and black spruce, and interior spruce - a natural hybrid.
we propose that cnvs make a qualitatively distinct contribution to adaptation which could be important for short term change.
the hybrid family presented significantly fewer cnvs, suggesting that the admixture of two species within one genome reduces the occurrence of cnvs.
a genome-scale understanding of cnvs is available in a few plants but none are wild species, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their genome biology and evolutionary role.
we developed a reliable cnv detection method for species lacking contiguous reference genome.
the approach we developed is of particular interest in non-model species lacking a reference genome.
we discovered hundreds of gene cnvs in each species,  <dig> in total, which were enriched in functions related to stress and defense responses and narrow expression profiles, indicating a potential role in adaptation.
