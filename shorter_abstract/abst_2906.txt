lam genotypes were ubiquitous and predominated among both rflp clusters and new patterns, suggesting ongoing transmission and adaptative evolution in paraguay.
we present a picture of the biodiversity of mycobacterium tuberculosis in paraguay, an inland south american country harboring  <dig> million inhabitants with a tuberculosis notification rate of 38/ <dig> .
lineages currently thriving in paraguay may reflect local host-pathogen adaptation of strains introduced during past migrations from europe.
concordant clustering by is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  and spoligotyping identified transmission in specific settings such as the tacumbu jail in asuncion and aboriginal communities in the chaco.
our study contributed to the database  <dig> new sits and  <dig> orphan spoligopatterns.
spoligopatterns of  <dig> strains matched  <dig> shared international types  already present in an updated version of spoldb <dig>  the global spoligotype database at pasteur institute, guadeloupe.
