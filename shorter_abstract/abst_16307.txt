quantitative pcr assays, requiring minimal amounts of lcm rna, were developed to determine rna quality and concentration.
we obtained  <dig> μg of labeled complementary rna on average after linear amplification of about  <dig> ng of total rna.
differential expression of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme a racemase  and hepsin was confirmed using quantitative pcr.
rnase inhibitor was included in solutions used to stain frozen tissue sections for lcm, which improved rna quality significantly.
superscript ii™ reverse transcriptase was replaced with superscript iii™, and speedvac concentration was eliminated to optimize linear amplification.
to discover prostate cancer biomarkers, we profiled gene expression in benign and malignant cells laser capture microdissected  from prostate tissues and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinomas.
here we present methods developed, optimized, and validated to obtain high quality gene expression data.
