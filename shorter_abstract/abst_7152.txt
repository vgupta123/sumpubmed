a high-density soybean genetic map was constructed and used to identify several qtls that were shown to influence six yield-related and two quality traits.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
with rad-sequencing, some novel qtls and important qtl clusters for both yield-related and quality traits were identified based on a new, high-density bin linkage map.
a total of  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were detected for the rils that were integrated into  <dig> recombination bin units, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
twenty six qtls were identified for the first time, with a single qtl  in a 56 kb region explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variation, and an additional  <dig> of these were novel, stable qtls.
forty seven qtls for yield-related traits and  <dig> qtls for grain quality traits were found to be distributed on  <dig> chromosomes in the 2 year studies.

moreover,  <dig> qtl hotpots on four different chromosomes were identified for the correlated traits.
