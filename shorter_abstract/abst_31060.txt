postharvest fruit conservation relies on low temperatures and manipulations of hormone metabolism to maintain sensory properties.
we have employed genome wide transcriptional profiling to investigate the effects of gibberellic acid application and cold storage on harvested peaches.
gene set enrichment demonstrated a predominant role of cold storage in repressing the transcription of genes associated to cell wall metabolism.

time course transcriptional analyses demonstrate the large contribution of gene expression regulation on the biochemical changes leading to woolliness in peach.
cellular and developmental process gene ontologies were overrepresented among the differentially regulated genes, whereas sequences in cell death and immune response categories were underrepresented.
application of gibberellic acid at the initial stages of pit hardening impairs woolliness incidence, however the mechanisms controlling the response remain unknown.
overall, our results provide insights on the mechanisms controlling the complex phenotypes associated to postharvest textural changes in peach and suggest that hormone mediated reprogramming previous to pit hardening affects the onset of chilling injuries.
in contrast, genes involved in hormone responses exhibited a more complex transcriptional response, indicating an extensive network of crosstalk between hormone signaling and low temperatures.
