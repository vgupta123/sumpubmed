in general the sequence constraints on the serpin-fold itself are loose.
we collated  <dig> orthologues to the d. melanogaster serpins from the other  <dig> drosophilid genomes and used synteny to find further family members, raising the total to  <dig>  or 71% of the number of orthologues expected assuming complete conservation across all  <dig> drosophilid species.
the conservation of different family members varied widely across the  <dig> sequenced drosophilid genomes.
the critical reactive centre loop  sequence, including the target proteinase cleavage site, is strongly conserved in inhibitory serpins, although there are  <dig> exceptional sets of orthologues in which the evolutionary constraints are looser.
we derive a consensus hinge motif, for drosophilid inhibitory serpins, which differs somewhat from that of the vertebrate consensus.
currently, it is not known whether orthologous, inhibitory serpin genes retain the same target proteinase specificity within the drosophilid lineage, nor whether they give rise to non-inhibitory serpin-fold proteins or other, more diverged, proteins.
conversely, the rcl of non-inhibitory serpin orthologues is less conserved, with  <dig> exceptions that presumably bind to conserved partner molecules.
non-inhibitory serpins appear to derive from inhibitory serpins, but not the reverse.
in general, inhibitory serpins rarely change their range of proteinase targets, except by a duplication/divergence mechanism.
many of these serpins have a conserved "hinge" motif characteristic of active proteinase inhibitors.
however, a substantial proportion  lacks this motif and represents non-inhibitory serpin-fold proteins of unknown function.
