these four compounds were capable of inhibiting pdr5p atpase activity by more than 90%, they demonstrated ic <dig> values less than 2 μm and had an uncompetitive pattern of pdr5p atpase activity inhibition.
these organotellurides did not demonstrate cytotoxicity against human erythrocytes or s. cerevisiae mutant strains  even in concentrations above 100 μm.
resistance to fluconazole, a commonly used azole antifungal, is a challenge for the treatment of fungal infections.
when tested at 100 μm, they could reverse the fluconazole resistance expressed by both the s. cerevisiae mutant strain that overexpress pdr5p and a clinical isolate of candida albicans.
resistance can be mediated by overexpression of abc transporters, which promote drug efflux that requires atp hydrolysis.
the pdr5p abc transporter of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well-known model used to study this mechanism of antifungal resistance.
we have identified four organotellurides that are promising candidates for the reversal of drug resistance mediated by drug efflux pumps.
among the tested compounds, four contained a tellurium-butane group and shared structural similarities that were absent in the other tested compounds: a lateral hydrocarbon chain and an amide group.
