intracellular plant immune receptors called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat  proteins contain a central nucleotide-binding  domain followed by a series of leucine-rich repeats , and are key initiators of plant defense responses.
these composite immune receptors are thought to arise from fusions between nlrs and additional domains that serve as “baits” for the pathogen-derived effector proteins, thus enabling pathogen recognition.
we hypothesize that nlr-ids that we revealed provide clues to the host proteins targeted by pathogens, and that this information can be deployed to discover new sources of disease resistance.
we have examined nlr fusions that occur in multiple plant families and identified that some domains show re-occurring integration across lineages.
however, recent studies demonstrated that nlrs with non-canonical domain architectures play an important role in plant immunity.
