the combined strip and touchdown protocol proved to be a convenient and reliable method of testing for multiple viruses in a routine setting.
results by immunofluorescence were available after an average of 4â€“ <dig> hours while molecular strip results were available within  <dig> hours, considerably faster than viral culture.
immunofluorescence and virus culture are the main methods used to diagnose acute respiratory virus infections.
the touchdown protocol with pre-dispensed primer master-mixes was suitable for replacing virus culture for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses which were negative by immunofluorescence.
to overcome this problem we developed a diagnostic molecular strip which combined a generic nested touchdown protocol with in-house primer master-mixes that could recognise  <dig> common respiratory viruses.
over an  <dig> month period a total of  <dig> specimens were tested by both immunofluorescence and the molecular strip.
a total of  <dig> viruses were detected in the study from  <dig> patients and  <dig> quality control specimens:  <dig> by immunofluorescence and  <dig> using the molecular strip.
viruses were recovered from a number of specimen types including broncho-alveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal secretions, sputa, post-mortem lung tissue and combined throat and nasal swabs.
diagnosing these infections using nucleic acid amplification presents technical challenges, one of which is facilitating the different optimal annealing temperatures needed for each virus.
