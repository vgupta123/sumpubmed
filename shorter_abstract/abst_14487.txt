in gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is composed of an asymmetric lipid bilayer of phopspholipids and lipopolysaccharides, and the transmembrane proteins that reside in this membrane are almost exclusively β-barrel proteins.
based on the finding that the differences between the recognition motifs of almost all organisms are small, we assume that heterologous overexpression of almost all omps should be feasible in e. coli and other gram-negative bacterial model organisms.

for both of these organism groups, we describe the specific sequence requirements that are at the basis of the observed difference.
it recognizes its substrates, unfolded outer membrane proteins , through a c-terminal motif that has been speculated to be species-specific, based on theoretical and experimental results from only two species, escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis, where it was shown on the basis of individual sequences and motifs that omps from the one cannot easily be over expressed in the other, unless the c-terminal motif was adapted.
we were able to verify the incompatibility reported between escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis, using clustering techniques based on the pairwise hellinger distance between sequence spaces for the c-terminal motifs of individual organisms.
this is relevant especially for biotechnology applications, where recombinant omps are used e.g.
in order to determine whether this species specificity is a general phenomenon, we undertook a large-scale bioinformatics study on all predicted omps from  <dig> fully sequenced proteobacterial strains.
we noticed that the amino acid position reported to be responsible for this incompatibility between escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis does not play a major role for determining species specificity of omp recognition by the bam complex.
