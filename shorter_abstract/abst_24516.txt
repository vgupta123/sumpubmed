enteric escherichia coli survives the highly acidic environment of the stomach through multiple acid resistance  mechanisms.
the regulation of the multiple ar systems and their coordination with broader cellular metabolism has not been fully explored.
our data identified all previously in vivo confirmed direct interactions and revealed several others previously inferred from gene expression data.
this model predicts a novel mechanism for ar <dig> by which the decarboxylation enzymes of ar <dig> are used with internally derived glutamate.
these connections underlie and experimentally validated model of ar <dig> in which the decarboxylation enzymes of ar <dig> are used with internally derived glutamate.
our data demonstrate that nac and csir directly modulate ar, and leads to a regulatory network model in which all four tfs participate in coordinating acid resistance, glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism.

our data suggest that the regulatory network underlying ar is complex and deeply interconnected with the regulation of gaba and glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism.
we utilized a combination of chip-seq and gene expression analysis to experimentally map the regulatory interactions of four tfs: nac, ntrc, ompr, and csir.
this hypothesis makes several testable predictions that we confirmed experimentally.
