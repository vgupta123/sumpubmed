a case in point is periodontal disease, which is the most widespread oral disease in dogs.
previous molecular based studies have identified the bacterial species associated with periodontal disease in dogs; however without cultured strains from many of these species it has not been possible to study whether they play a role in the disease process.
if untreated the disease results in significant pain, eventual loss of the dentition and potentially an increased risk of systemic diseases.
this guided media optimization approach enabled the purification of  <dig> species,  <dig> of which we had previously been unable to cultivate in isolation.
to our knowledge this is the first time this combination of qpcr guided media optimization, strategic screening and helper strain support has been used successfully to isolate previously uncultured bacteria.
this gap has essentially become the rate limiting step in determining how the knowledge of which species are present in a sample can be applied to understand the role of these species in an ecosystem or disease process.
using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction  directed approach a range of microbiological media were screened and optimized to enrich for previously uncultivated target species.
in cases where the target species were not cultivable in isolation, helper strains grown underneath a nitrocellulose membrane were used to provide the necessary growth factors.
this approach can be applied to any uncultured bacterial species where knowledge of their nutritional requirements or low relative abundance impedes their isolation.
