this work reports a novel data mining approach to discover patterns of multiple phenotypic associations over  <dig> anthropometric and biochemical traits in kare and a new analytical scheme for gwas of multivariate phenotypes defined by the discovered patterns.
the use of the multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for the pleiotropic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiological pathway.

noteworthy findings were that the significant associations included a mis-sense mutation , a frame shift mutation  and snps in splicing sites .
the patterns of the phenotypic associations were informative to draw relations between plasma lipid levels with bone mineral density and a cluster of common traits  related to metabolic syndrome .
the six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci  that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized ms and even tumor susceptibility.
this methodology applied to the gwas for multivariate phenotype highldlhightg derived from the predicted patterns of the phenotypic associations.
