two-transcript classifiers have the potential to reliably classify diverse human diseases, through analysis of both local diseased tissue and the immunological response assayed through blood-borne leukocytes.
the tsp classifier thus represents a simple yet robust method to differentiate between diverse phenotypic states based on gene expression profiles.
in this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of the tsp approach in the identification of diagnostic classifiers for a number of human diseases including bacterial and viral infection, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, crohn's disease, and transformed ulcerative colitis.
the algorithm identified multiple predictive gene pairs for each phenotype, with cross-validation accuracy ranging from  <dig> to nearly  <dig> percent, and high sensitivity and specificity observed in most classification tasks.
the experimental simplicity of this method results in measurements that can be easily translated to clinical practice.
the 'top-scoring pair'  classification method identifies pairs of genes whose relative expression correlates strongly with phenotype.
we examined transcriptional profiles from both solid tissues and blood-borne leukocytes.
several diseases of solid tissues could be reliably diagnosed through classifiers based on the blood-borne leukocyte transcriptome.
