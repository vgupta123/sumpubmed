we participated in the biocreative task  <dig>  which addressed the annotation of proteins into the gene ontology  based on the text of a given document and the selection of evidence text from the document justifying that annotation.
the evaluation results indicate that the method for expanding words associated with go nodes is quite powerful; we were able to successfully select appropriate evidence text for a given annotation in 38% of task  <dig>  queries by building on this method.
our architecture proved not to be very successful on the evidence text component of the task, in the configuration used to generate the submitted results.
the initial results show promise for both of the methods we explored, and we are planning to integrate the methods more closely to achieve better results overall.
we approached the task utilizing several combinations of two distinct methods: an unsupervised algorithm for expanding words associated with go nodes, and an annotation methodology which treats annotation as categorization of terms from a protein's document neighborhood into the go.
