we have implemented clips-1d, which predicts a role in catalysis, ligand-binding, or protein structure for residue-positions in a mutually exclusive manner.
for ligand-binding sites, prediction quality was lower , because binding sites and structurally important residue-positions share conservation and abundance values, which makes their separation difficult.
clips-1d is available as a web service at http://www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de/.
it generates hypotheses about residue-positions important for a set of homologous proteins and focuses on conservation and abundance signals.
by analyzing a multiple sequence alignment, the algorithm scores conservation as well as abundance of residues at individual sites and their local neighborhood and categorizes by means of a multiclass support vector machine.
this is why our algorithm computes residue-specific p-values, which allow for the statistical assessment of each individual prediction.
however, with respect to sequence information, many functionally and structurally important sites are hard to distinguish and consequently a large number of incorrectly predicted functional sites have to be expected.
several sequence-based algorithms exist, which predict functionally important sites.
this is why we were interested to design a new classifier that differentiates between functionally and structurally important sites and to assess its performance on representative datasets.
for structurally important sites, prediction quality was considerably higher .
clips-1d is a classifier, whose prediction quality has been determined separately for catalytic sites, ligand-binding sites, and structurally important sites.
