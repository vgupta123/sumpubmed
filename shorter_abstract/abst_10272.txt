the upregulation of some of these srnas were also observed when s. typhimurium was challenged by ampicillin ; or when klebsiella pneumoniae was challenged by tigecycline .
small rnas are overexpressed as a result of antibiotic exposure in s. typhimurium where the same molecules are upregulated in a related species or after exposure to different antibiotics.
genome analysis found that syj <dig> and syj <dig> mapped between the 16s and 23s rrna encoding genes.
syj <dig>  is encoded upstream of the tbpayabkyabj operon and is classed as a riboswitch, whilst its role in antibiotic stress-response appears independent of its riboswitch function.
despite mounting evidence for the importance of srnas in stress response, their role upon antibiotic exposure remains unknown.
in this study, we sought to determine firstly, whether differential expression of srnas occurs upon antibiotic exposure and secondly, whether these srnas could be attributed to microbial tolerance to antibiotics.
bacteria employ complex transcriptional networks involving multiple genes in response to stress, which is not limited to gene and protein networks but now includes small rnas .
these findings imply that the srna mediated response is a component of the bacterial response to antibiotic challenge.
a small scale srna cloning strategy of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl <dig> challenged with half the minimal inhibitory concentration of tigecycline identified four srnas  which were reproducibly upregulated in the presence of either tigecycline or tetracycline.
