we propose that the unusual pattern of eef1a, eef1bα and efl presence and absence can be explained by a ratchet-like process: if either eef1a or eef1bα diverges beyond functionality in the presence of efl, the system is unable to return to the ancestral, eef1a:eefbα-driven state.
sequence conservation and homology modeling analyses indicate several sequence regions that may be responsible for efl’s lack of requirement for eef1bα.
surprisingly, eef1a is not universally present in eukaryotes, being replaced by the paralog efl independently in multiple lineages.
