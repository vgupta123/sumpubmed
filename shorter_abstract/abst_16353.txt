we find that, similarly to c. elegans, p. pacificus males are generated at low frequencies from self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and are relatively poor mating partners.
the results indicate that there is no evidence of any selection acting very strongly on p. pacificus males.
here we determine various parameters that influence outcrossing in the hermaphroditic nematode pristionchus pacificus and compare them to the better known caenorhabditis elegans.
evolution of selfing can be associated with an increase in fixation of deleterious mutations, which in certain conditions can lead to species extinction.
these nematode species are distinct in terms of genetic diversity, which could be explained by differences in outcrossing rates.
furthermore, crosses between different isolates reveal that hybrids have lower brood sizes than the pure strains, which is a sign of outbreeding depression.
in contrast to c. elegans, p. pacificus has lower brood sizes and the male x-bearing sperm is able to outcompete the x-nullo sperm.
