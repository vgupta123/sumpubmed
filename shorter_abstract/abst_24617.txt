using rna-sequencing of the whole brain, we identified  <dig> genes showing differential expression with racemic fluoxetine treatment.
fluoxetine can modulate anxiety in a stereospecific manner or with equal efficacy regardless of stereoisomer depending on the mechanism of action .
our results demonstrate that fluoxetine reduces anxiety-related behaviors in wild-derived zebrafish and alters their neurogenomic state.
several neuropeptides  showed consistent expression patterns with the alleviation of stress and anxiety when anxiety-related behavior was reduced with fluoxetine treatment.
in this study we present data showing the behavioral and whole brain transcriptome changes with fluoxetine treatment in wild-derived zebrafish and suggest additional molecular mechanisms of this widely-prescribed drug.
this study provides data that could help identify common molecular mechanisms of fluoxetine action across animal taxa.
zebrafish are an emerging and valuable translational model for understanding human health related issues such as anxiety.
with gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses, we identified lipid and amino acid metabolic processes, and steroid biosynthesis among other terms to be over-enriched.
studies have shown that in humans and other animals, treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  can reduce anxiety and anxiety-related behaviors.
