in this study we used predicted mirna-gene interactions to analyse mrna gene expression microarray data to predict mirnas associated with particular diseases or conditions.
we applied this to three different microarray datasets, a papillary thyroid carcinoma dataset, an in-house dataset of lipopolysaccharide treated mouse macrophages, and a multi-tissue dataset.
using a database of mirna target predictions from targetscan, targetscans, pictar4way pictar5way, and miranda and combining these data with gene expression levels from sets of microarrays, this method produces a ranked list of mirnas associated with a specified split in samples.
we describe a technique to integrate gene expression data and mirna target predictions from multiple sources.
here we combine correspondence analysis, between group analysis and co-inertia analysis  to determine which mirnas are associated with differences in gene expression levels in microarray data sets.
they control gene expression by either inhibiting translation or inducing mrna degradation.
micrornas  are non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by binding to the messenger rna  of protein coding genes.
