we conclude that we simply cannot determine if a large portion of the genes have a common history.
too few morphological characters are useful for conducting conclusive phylogenetic analyses at the highest taxonomic level.
our phylogenetic analyses do not support tree-thinking.
the selection of congruent markers is thus a fundamental step in simultaneous analysis of many genes.
in addition, none of these datasets can be considered free of lateral gene transfer.
these results have important conceptual and practical implications.
heat map analyses were used to investigate the congruence of orthologues in four datasets .
this conclusion is a direct consequence of tree-thinking: if gene inheritance conforms to a tree-like model of evolution, sampling more of these molecules will provide enough phylogenetic signal to build the tree of life.
