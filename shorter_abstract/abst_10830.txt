the mitochondrial sequence data support a close relationship of annelida and sipuncula.
the first complete mitochondrial genome of a member of sipuncula, sipunculus nudus, is presented.
besides sequence information, mitochondrial gene order may add phylogenetically useful information, too.
the mitochondrial gene order  resembles that of annelids, but shows several derivations so far found only in sipuncula.
sequence based phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial protein-coding genes results in significant bootstrap support for annelida sensu lato, combining annelida together with sipuncula, echiura, pogonophora and myzostomida.
these results complement findings from recent phylogenetic analyses of nuclear encoded genes as well as a report of a segmental neural patterning in sipuncula.
also the most parsimonious explanation of changes in gene order favours a derivation from the annelid gene order.
mitochondrial genomes are a valuable source of data for analysing phylogenetic relationships.
