this study focused on morphological diagnoses for larvae occurring in the churchill, manitoba area, representing the largest larval association effort for the caddisflies at any given locality thus far.
this endeavor to identify immature life stage for the caddisflies enabled the development of morphological diagnoses, production of photographs and an appropriate taxonomic key to facilitate larval species analyses in the area.
the present study collected an additional  <dig> new species records for the churchill area, increasing the total trichoptera richness to  <dig> species.
we were able to associate  <dig> larval taxa, comprising  <dig> % of the churchill area trichoptera taxa.
the morphological analysis should be useful for determination of material from the churchill area.
the north american trichoptera larvae are poorly known at the species level, despite their importance in the understanding of freshwater fauna and critical use in biomonitoring.
