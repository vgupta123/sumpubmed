current influenza vaccines are trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated split or subunit vaccines administered intramuscularly, or live attenuated influenza vaccines  adapted to replicate at temperatures below body temperature and administered intranasally.
in the near future influenza vaccines for human use will also be available from adherent mdck or vero cell cultures, but a scalable suspension process may facilitate production and supply with vaccines.
moreover, the process is fast with peak titers obtained  <dig> h post infection and easily scalable to industrial volumes as neither microcarriers nor medium replacements are required.
by now, licensed laiv are produced in embryonated chicken eggs.
overall, this study demonstrates that age <dig> cr.pix cells support replication of laiv strains in a chemically-defined medium using a simple process without medium exchanges.
it is shown that a medium exchange is not required for infection and that maximum virus titers are obtained for 1 × 10- <dig> trypsin units per cell.
<dig> l bioreactor cultivations showed that 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml can be infected without a cell density effect achieving titers of 1 ×  <dig> virions/ml after  <dig> h.
