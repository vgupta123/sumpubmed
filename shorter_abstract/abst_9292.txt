intriguingly, jacusa captures most a→i events from rrd comparisons of rna sequencing data derived from drosophila and hek- <dig> data sets.
in practice, jacusa shows higher recall and comparable precision in detecting a→i sites from rna-dna comparisons, while showing higher precision and recall in rna-rna comparisons.
our software jacusa detects single nucleotide variants by comparing data from next-generation sequencing experiments .
this performance margin is highest for the rna-rna comparison scenario.
even more surprising, condition-specific editing events, which would show up as differences in rna-rna comparisons  and depend on particular cellular states, are rarely discussed in the literature.
jacusa outperforms other algorithms in terms of the f measure, which combines precision and recall, in all benchmark scenarios.
jacusa has a higher recall and comparable precision for detecting true editing sites in rdd comparisons of hek- <dig> data.
we further validated jacusa’s performance by testing its ability to detect a→i events using sequencing data from a human cell culture experiment and publicly available rna-seq data from drosophila melanogaster heads.
the most common rna editing modification is the single base substitution  that is catalyzed by the members of the adenosine deaminases that act on rna  family.
the performance of jacusa has been carefully evaluated and compared to other variant callers in an in silico benchmark.
