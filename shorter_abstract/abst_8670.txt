we assessed several imputation methods on three data sets containing replicate measurements, and found that weighted methods performed better than non-weighted methods.
many imputation methods have been suggested, some na√Øve and other more sophisticated taking into account correlation in data.
we suggest a different approach in which a continuous spot quality weight is built into the imputation methods, allowing for smooth imputations of all spots to larger or lesser degree.
most of these tools require complete data, but measurement values are often missing a way to overcome the problem of incomplete data is to impute the missing data before analysis.
hence, they are depending on a cutoff separating poor spots from good spots.
microarray technology has become popular for gene expression profiling, and many analysis tools have been developed for data interpretation.
