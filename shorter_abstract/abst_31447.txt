fluorescent and luminescent reporter genes have become popular tools for the real-time monitoring of gene expression in living cells.
we show that the mrna and protein concentration profiles predicted from the models agree quite well with direct measurements obtained by northern and western blots, respectively.
the results have wide applicability for the analysis of gene expression in bacteria and may be extended to higher organisms.
we present a rigorous method for deriving relative protein synthesis rates  and protein concentrations by means of kinetic models of gene expression.
the results show that large differences in protein half-lives, more than mrna half-lives, may be critical for the interpretation of reporter gene data in the analysis of the dynamics of regulatory systems.
the paper contributes to the development of sound methods for the interpretation of reporter gene data, notably in the context of the reconstruction and validation of models of regulatory networks.
we experimentally and computationally validate this approach in the case of the protein fis, a global regulator of transcription in escherichia coli.
however, mathematical models are necessary for extracting biologically meaningful quantities from the primary data.
