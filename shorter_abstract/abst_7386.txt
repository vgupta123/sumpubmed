furthermore, we quantitatively compare the results of four of the presented methods based on publicly available data sets.
however, despite their common root in mathematical optimization, they vastly differ in the types of experimental data being integrated, the background knowledge necessary for their application, the granularity of their regulatory model, the concrete paradigm used for solving the optimization problem and the data sets used for evaluation.
in various settings, these methods produced promising results in terms of estimating transcription factor activity and identifying key biomarkers for specific phenotypes.
the results show that all methods seem to find biologically relevant information.
here, we review five recent methods of this class in detail and compare them with respect to several key properties.
recently, several algorithms have been proposed which model genome-wide gene regulation as sets of  equations over the activity and relationships of transcription factors, genes and other factors.

gene regulation is one of the most important cellular processes, indispensable for the adaptability of organisms and closely interlinked with several classes of pathogenesis and their progression.
