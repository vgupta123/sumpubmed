to confirm that the sorghum dart markers behave in a mendelian manner, we constructed a genetic linkage map for a cross between r931945-2- <dig> and is  <dig> integrating dart and other marker types.
the genetic linkage map had an average marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm, with an average dart marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm.
we have successfully developed dart markers for sorghum bicolor and have demonstrated that dart provides high quality markers that can be used for diversity analyses and to construct medium-density genetic linkage maps.
the genotyping array was used to analyse a diverse set of sorghum genotypes and screening a recombinant inbred lines  mapping population.
the high number of dart markers generated in a single assay not only provides a precise estimate of genetic relationships among genotypes, but also their even distribution over the genome offers real advantages for a range of molecular breeding and genomics applications.
diversity arrays technology  is a cost effective hybridisation-based marker technology that offers a high multiplexing level while being independent of sequence information.
the sequential nature of gel-based marker systems entails low throughput and high costs per assay.
commonly used marker systems such as ssr and snp are also dependent on sequence information.
over  <dig> markers detected variation among  <dig> accessions used in a diversity analysis.
in total,  <dig> markers could be placed on the integrated linkage map, which spanned  <dig>  cm.
cluster analysis discriminated well between all  <dig> genotypes.
these limitations result in high cost per data point and significantly limit the capacity of breeding programs to obtain sufficient return on investment to justify the routine use of marker-assisted breeding for many traits and particularly quantitative traits.
