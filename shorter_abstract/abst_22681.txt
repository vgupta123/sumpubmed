for the prediction of mitochondrion-located proteins, integration via a two-layer decision tree clearly outperforms simpler methods, as it allows emphasis of biologically relevant features such as the mitochondrial targeting peptide and transmembrane domains.
each tool performs well on certain data sets, but their predictions often disagree for a given protein.
in order to develop a method for enhanced prediction of subcellular localization, we integrated the outputs of available localization prediction tools by several strategies, and tested the performance of each strategy with known mitochondrial proteins.
since the individual tools each have particular strengths, we set out to integrate them in a way that optimally exploits their potential.
the accuracy obtained  surpasses by far the individual tools.
we developed an approach that enhances the prediction accuracy of mitochondrial proteins by uniting the strength of specialized tools.
dozens of tools are available for predicting protein location in the eukaryotic cell.
the combination of machine-learning based integration with biological expert knowledge leads to improved performance.
the method we present here is applicable to various subcellular locations, but tailored for predicting whether or not a protein is localized in mitochondria.
our approach is easy to implement, and applicable to predicting subcellular locations other than mitochondria, as well as other biological features.
knowing the subcellular location of proteins provides clues to their function as well as the interconnectivity of biological processes.
