characterization of the binding behavior of the sera after immunization by competitive elisa suggested that the humoral immune response is mainly directed against the fusion partner elp.
the results show that spidroin-based biopolymers can induce humoral immune responses that are dependent on the fusion partner and the overall protein structure.
in addition, cytocompatibility studies with murine embryonic fibroblasts indicated that recombinant spidroin-based biopolymers, in solution or as coated proteins, are well tolerated.
all known spider silk proteins, so-called spidroins, reveal a composite nature of silk-specific units, allowing the recombinant production of individual and combined segments.
the elastic penetration moduli of layered proteins were analyzed for different spidroin-based biopolymers.
spider silk is a tear-resistant and elastic biopolymer that has outstanding mechanical properties.
additionally, exiguous immunogenicity is anticipated for spider silks.
therefore, spider silk represents a potential ideal biomaterial for medical applications.
furthermore, cytocompatibility assays gave no indication of spidroin-derived cytotoxicity, suggesting that recombinant produced biopolymers composed of spider silk-like repetitive elements are suitable for biomedical applications.
