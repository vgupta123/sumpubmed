here we show a molecular link between nuclear fallout , an adaptor of rab11-gtpase to the microtubule motor proteins during recycling endosome  trafficking, and apkc, a pivotal kinase in the regulation of cell polarity.

we demonstrate that apkc phosphorylates nuf modifying its subcellular distribution.
we demonstrate that active apkc interacts with nuf, phosphorylating it and, as a result, modifying its subcellular distribution.
accordingly, in apkc mutants nuf and rab <dig> accumulate apically indicating altered re delivery.
thus, we provide a novel link between cell polarity regulation and traffic control in epithelia.
moreover, apical apkc concentration is reduced in nuf mutants, suggesting apkc levels are maintained by recycling.
cell polarity, essential for cell physiology and tissue coherence, emerges as a consequence of asymmetric localization of protein complexes and directional trafficking of cellular components.
when we block exocytosis, by means of exocyst-sec mutants, apkc accumulates inside the cells.
we show that apkc localization in the apico-lateral cortex is dynamic.
we propose a regulatory loop by which nuf promotes apkc apical recycling until sufficient levels of active apkc are reached.
