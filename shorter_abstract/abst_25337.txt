while it was known that genes re-insert into non-orthologous positions of plant genomes, they appear to re-insert also within retrotransposons, potentially providing an important role for retrotransposons in the evolution of gene function.
here, we compared the composition and organization of tes within five orthologous chromosomal regions among three grass species: maize, sorghum, and rice.
retrotransposons are commonly occurring eukaryotic transposable elements .
we identified a total of  <dig> full or fragmented ltr retrotransposons in these regions.
as a percentage of the total cumulative sequence in each species, ltr retrotransposons occupy  <dig> % of the maize,  <dig> % of the rice, and  <dig> % of the sorghum regions.
unforeseen was the finding of intact genes embedded within ltr retrotransposons.
using the contiguous sequence of the orthologous regions, we detected  <dig> retrotransposons with intact target duplication sites and both ltr termini.
here, we show that 74% of these elements inserted into their host genome less than  <dig> million years ago and that many retroelements expanded in size by the insertion of other sequences.
by comparing the orthologous chromosomal regions of closely related species, the effects of tes on the evolution of plant genomes can be studied in detail.
