we show that expression ratios are occasionally distorted by amplification using the affymetrix small sample protocol version  <dig> due to a disproportional shift in intensity across biological samples.
on the other hand, only 69% of the more moderate ratios  in the unamplified group have a p-value below 10e- <dig> in the amplified group.
our analysis also suggests that, overall, limma shows better overlap of genes found to be significant in the amplified and unamplified groups than the z-scores statistics.
this occurs when a shift in one sample cannot be reflected in the other sample because the intensity would lie outside the dynamic range of the scanner.
this becomes more critical for less pronounced ratios where the evidence for differential expression is not strong.
rna amplification is necessary for profiling gene expression from small tissue samples.
we conclude that microarray analysis of amplified samples performs best at detecting differences in gene expression, when these are large and when limma statistics are used.
indeed, statistical analysis by limma suggests that up to 87% of the genes with the largest and therefore most significant ratios  in the unamplified group have a p-value below 10e- <dig> in the amplified group.
interestingly, such distortions most commonly result in smaller ratios with the consequence of reducing the statistical significance of the ratios.
previous studies have shown that the t <dig> based amplification techniques are reproducible but may distort the true abundance of targets.
