typical metagenomic analyses are run to associate to a condition  a pool of bacteria, whose eubiotic/dysbiotic potential is assessed either by α-diversity, a measure of the varieties populating the microbiome, or by firmicutes to bacteroides ratio, associated to systemic inflammation, and finally by manual and direct inspection of bacteria’s biological functions, when known.
our results, applied to human gi-microbiome data exemplify how this layer of information provides additional insights into treatments’ impact on the gi microbiome, allowing to characterize a more physiologic effects of prednisone versus methotrexate, two treatments for rheumatoid arthritis  a complex autoimmune systemic disease.

these approaches lead to results sometimes difficult to interpret in terms of the evolution towards a specific microbial composition, harmed by large areas of unknown.
