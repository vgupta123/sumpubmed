bordetella dermonecrotic toxin  causes the turbinate atrophy in swine atrophic rhinitis, caused by a bordetella bronchiseptica infection of pigs, by inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation.
components in the extracellular matrix are known to regulate activities of various growth factors by binding and liberating them in response to alterations in the extracellular environment.
similarly, the fibronectin-based extracellular matrix may function as a temporary storage system for dnt, enabling small amounts of the toxin to efficiently affect target tissues or cells.
a cellular component cross-linked with dnt conjugated with a cross-linker was identified as fibronectin by mass spectrometry.
several lines of evidence suggested that dnt interacts with fibronectin not directly, but through another cellular component that remains to be identified.
how such small amounts can affect target tissues is unknown.
the colocalization was observed in not only dnt-sensitive cells but also insensitive cells, indicating that the fibronectin network neither serves as a receptor for the toxin nor is involved in the intoxicating procedures.
fluorescence microscopy revealed that dnt associated with a fibrillar structure developed on cultured cells.
