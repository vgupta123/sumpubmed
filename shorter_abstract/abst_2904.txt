no significant results were obtained by survival analysis, even if basal-like tumours had a more favourable prognosis than luminal-like lesions.
stage and grade showed independent associations with survival in the multivariate regression, while molecular subtype grouping and histological type did not show associations.
the panel of antibodies identified only three tumour groups  in the dog.
no difference in the percentage of molecular subtypes was found between simple and complex/mixed carcinomas .
even though canine mammary tumours may be a model of human breast cancer, the existence of the same carcinoma molecular subtypes in women awaits confirmation.
canine mammary carcinomas show high molecular heterogeneity, which would benefit from a classification based on molecular differences.
the present study aimed to apply an immunohistochemical panel  in a series of canine malignant mammary tumours to verify the molecular-based classification, its correlation with invasion and grade, and its use as a prognostic aid in veterinary practice.
most luminal-like a and basal-like tumours were grade  <dig> carcinomas, while the percentage of luminal b tumours was higher in grades  <dig> and  <dig> .
human breast cancer is classified by gene expression profile into subtypes consisting of two hormone  receptor-positive types  and three hormone receptor-negative types .
