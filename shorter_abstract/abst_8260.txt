based on the observation that the human genome encodes par <dig>  but bovine and rodent genomes do not, par <dig> exon sequences from  <dig> different primate species were cloned and sequenced.
the recently identified parvulin par <dig> contains an additional n-terminal domain whose occurrence and function was the focus of the present study.
taken together, the dna binding parvulin par <dig> is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the most recently evolved mitochondrial prepeptide known to date, thus adding a novel protein constituent to the mitochondrial proteome of hominidae.
par <dig> was imported into mitochondria in a time and membrane potential-dependent manner, where it reached the mitochondrial matrix.
par <dig> and par <dig> associated with isolated human, rat and yeast mitochondria at low salt concentrations, but only the par <dig> mitochondrial association was resistant to higher salt concentrations.
in contrast to par <dig>  endogenous par <dig> was found in mitochondrial and membrane fractions of human cell lysates.
fluorescence of egfp fusions of par <dig>  but not par <dig>  co-localized with mitochondrial staining.
par <dig> is encoded in the genomes of hominidae species including humans, but is absent from other mammalian species.
