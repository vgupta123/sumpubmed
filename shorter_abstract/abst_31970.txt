we determined with high confidence that  <dig> % of the genomes were identical, with no reproducible changes in structural variation  or insertion/deletion polymorphisms .
a detailed analysis of the genetic alterations introduced by ebv transformation is highly relevant, as it will inform on the usefulness and limitations of this approach.
we used whole genome sequencing to assess the genomic signature of a low-passage lymphoblastoid cell line .
a total of  <dig>  gb of sequence were generated from the cell line and  <dig>  gb from the normal genomic dna.

our results suggest that, at this level of resolution, the lcl is genetically indistinguishable from its genomic counterpart and therefore their use in clinical research is not likely to introduce a significant bias.
a detailed analysis of whole genomes can be now achieved with next generation sequencing.
although the mechanism of transformation and immortalization by ebv is relatively well known at the transcriptional and proteomic level, the genetic consequences of ebv transformation are less well understood.
epstein barr virus  transformation is a widely used strategy in clinical research to obtain an unlimited source of a subjectâ€™s dna.
