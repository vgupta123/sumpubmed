the main gene pathways affected were, cellular growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, cellular and tissue morphology and development, inflammation and metabolic exchange.
the objective of this study was to investigate whether differences in endometrial gene expression during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle exist between crossbred beef heifers ranked as either high  or low fertility  ) using the affymetrix® 23 k bovine gene chip.
this study highlights, some of the molecular mechanisms potentially controlling uterine endometrial function during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle, which may contribute to uterine endometrial mediated impaired fertility in cattle.
microarray analysis of endometrial tissue collected on day  <dig> of the estrous cycle detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between hf  and lf  animals.
conception rates for each of the four rounds of ai were within a normal range: 70– <dig> %.
