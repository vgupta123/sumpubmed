critically, it provides the typical end user with an intuitive interface for developing and sharing custom visualizations of developmental processes.
this will add the key ability to navigate and understand the developmental events that result in the coordinated and precise emergence of anatomy, particularly the wiring of the nervous system.
the wormguides mobile app enables users to navigate a 3d model depicting the nuclear positions of all cells in the developing embryo.
information about ancestry, fate and gene expression can be used to label cells and craft customized visualizations that highlight cells as potential players in an event of interest.
intuitive tools are needed to navigate the spatial structure of complex tissue, collate large data sets and existing knowledge with this spatial structure and help users derive hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.
ultimately the app will incorporate a detailed time lapse record of cell shape, beginning with neurons.
toward this goal we have developed wormguides, a mobile application that presents a 4d developmental atlas for caenorhabditis elegans.
the mobile app is available for android and ios platforms.
