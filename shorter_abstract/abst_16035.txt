this observational prospective study was aimed at determining how cd4+ t, cd8+ t and b cell subsets varied in hiv-exposed but uninfected  children at different ages.
heu and huu children had similar proportions of all b cell subsets at all ages.
at 6 months of age, heu children had a lower percentage of total cd4+ t cells compared to huu children and a lower proportion of naïve cd8+ t cells but higher percentage of effector memory cd8+ t cells compared to huu children.
however, it is not well known whether in utero exposure to the virus and the subsequent exposure to cotrimoxazole  prophylaxis affect the cell mediated immune system of the children.
venous blood samples were collected  <dig> monthly and analysed for different subsets of cd8+ t, b cells and totalcd4+ t cells.

heu children received daily ctx prophylaxis beginning at 6 weeks of age until when 12 months of age.
the study showed that the subtle variations in cd4+ and cd8+ t cell subsets observed at 6 months do not last beyond 12 months of age, suggesting that heu children have a robust cell-mediated immune system during first year of life.
