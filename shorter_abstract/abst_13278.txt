deletion of gcn <dig> in myo1Δ abolished eif2αp phosphorylation, and showed a severe growth defect.
these results indicate that post-transcriptional control is important in the myo1Δ stress response and possibly other stresses in yeast.
to explore the post-transcriptional regulation of the myo1Δ stress response,  <dig>  differentially regulated ribosome-bound mrnas were identified by microarray analysis of which  <dig> were co-regulated by transcription and translation.
down and up regulation of selected ribosomal protein and cell wall biosynthesis mrnas was validated by their distribution in polysomes from wild type and myo1Δ strains.
the presence of p-bodies in myo1Δ strains suggests that the process of mrna sequestration is active, however, the three representative down regulated rp mrnas, rps8a, rpl <dig> and rpl7b were present at equivalent levels in dcp2p-mch-positive immunoprecipitated fractions from myo1Δ and wild type cells.
western blot analysis revealed accumulation of the phosphorylated form of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  and a reduction in the steady state levels of the translation initiation factor eif4gp in myo1Δ strains.
four categories of mrna were significantly affected - protein biosynthesis, metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and unknown functions.
saccharomyces cerevisiae myosin type ii-deficient  strains remain viable and divide, despite the absence of a cytokinetic ring, by activation of the pkc1-dependent cell wall integrity pathway .
inhibition of translation initiation factor eif2α  in these strains was by gcn2p-dependent phosphorylation.
these same rp mrnas were also selectively co-precipitated with eif2α-p in myo1Δ strains.
selective co-immunoprecipitation of rp mrnas with eif2α-p in myo1Δ strains suggests a novel mode of translational regulation.
