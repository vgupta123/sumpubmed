in order to investigate the electrogenic microbial community in the anode biofilm, it was morphologically analyzed by electron microscopy, and community members were phylogenetically identified by 16s rrna gene clone-library analyses.
electron microscopy revealed that filamentous cells and rod-shaped cells with prosthecae-like filamentous appendages were abundantly present in the biofilm.
electricity-generating microorganisms were enriched by subculturing biofilms that attached onto anode electrodes.
a laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell  was inoculated with rice paddy field soil and fed cellulose as the carbon and energy source.
fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed that the rhizobiales population represented rod-shaped cells with filamentous appendages and constituted over 30% of the total population.
despite the development of efficient mfc reactors, the microbiology of electricity generation remains to be sufficiently understood.
bacteria affiliated with the rhizobiales constituted the major population in the cellulose-fed mfc and exhibited unique morphology with filamentous appendages.
microbial fuel cells  are devices that exploit microorganisms to generate electric power from organic matter.
they are considered to play important roles in the cellulose-degrading electrogenic community.
filamentous cells and appendages were interconnected via thin filaments.
an electric current of  <dig>  ma was generated from the first enrichment culture, and ratios of the major metabolites  became stable after the forth enrichment.
