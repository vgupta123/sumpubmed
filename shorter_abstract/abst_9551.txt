taken together these results support a model where the ifitm <dig> protein family and rig-i all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.
in particular, avian ifitm <dig> showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection.
chickens  lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssrna, rig-i and the gene for an important rig-i binding protein, rnf <dig>  these differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks.
in ducks, ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens.
clustering of gene expression profiles suggests ifitm <dig> and  <dig> have an anti-viral response and ifitm <dig> may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion.
in particular, h <dig> and h <dig> haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry.
ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains.
we also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons.
