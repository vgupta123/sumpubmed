most of the rna editing sites can restore amino acid conservation, increase hydrophobicity, and even influence protein structures.
ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest seed plants and has an important evolutionary position.

the g. biloba chloroplast genome possesses the highest number of rna editing events reported so far in a seed plant.
determining the patterns and distribution of rna editing in the ancient plant provides insights into the evolutionary trend of rna editing, and helping us to further understand their biological significance.
similar purifying selections constitute the dominant evolutionary force at the editing sites of essential genes, such as the psa, some psb and pet groups, and a positive selection occurred in the editing sites of nonessential genes, such as most ndh and a few psb genes.
all of the editing sites were c-to-u conversions, which mainly occurred in the second codon position, biased towards to the u_a context, and caused an increase in hydrophobic amino acids.
rna editing mainly occurs in chloroplasts and mitochondrial genomes, and the number of editing sites varies in terrestrial plants.
in this paper, we investigated  <dig> protein-coding genes in the chloroplast genome of g. biloba and identified  <dig> editing sites, which is the highest number of rna editing events reported in a gymnosperm.
finally, the evolutionary tendencies of rna editing in different gene groups were estimated using the nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate selection mode.
rna editing could change the secondary structures of  <dig> proteins, and create or eliminate a transmembrane region in five proteins as determined in silico.
