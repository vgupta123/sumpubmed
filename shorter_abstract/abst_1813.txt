the position of atmrp <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  flanked by two other mrp genes,  suggests that atmrp <dig> is part of a cluster involved in metal tolerance, although additional functions in planta cannot be discarded.
this gene, located on chromosome  <dig>  is bordered by atmrp <dig> and atmrp <dig>  using real-time quantitative pcr  and the gus reporter gene, we found that this gene is essentially expressed during early seedling development, in the apical meristem and at initiation point of secondary roots, especially in xylem-opposite pericycle cells where lateral roots initiate.
in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> genes encoding abc transporters have been identified.
