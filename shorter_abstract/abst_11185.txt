adp-ribosylation factor  <dig>  appeared to be the most robust reference for normalizing gene expression data across different tissues and is therefore proposed as a relevant reference gene for further gene expression analysis in the pacific oyster.
this newly designed microarray was used to study the transcriptome of male and female gonads, mantle, gills, posterior adductor muscle, visceral ganglia, hemocytes, labial palps and digestive gland.
research using the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas as a model organism has experienced rapid growth in recent years due to the development of high-throughput molecular technologies.
microarray data also accurately identified reference genes whose mrna level appeared stable across all the analyzed tissues.
this study provides a new transcriptomic tool for studies of oyster biology, which will help in the annotation of its genome and which identifies candidate reference genes for gene expression analysis.
these genes reflect major tissue-specific functions at the molecular level, such as tissue formation in the mantle, filtering in the gills and labial palps, and reproduction in the gonads.
