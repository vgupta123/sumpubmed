we demonstrate how choice of pathway structure and centrality measurement, as well as the presence of key genes, affects pathway significance.
our method can benefit the systematic analysis of biological pathways and help to extract more meaningful information from gene expression data.
second, nodes rather than genes form the basic unit of pathways, such that one node can be composed of several genes and one gene may reside in different nodes.
we emphasize two improvements of our method over current methods.
first, allowing for the diversity of genesâ€™ characters and the difficulty of covering gene importance from all aspects, we set centrality as an optional parameter in the model.
by comparing our methodology to the original enrichment method using both simulation data and real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in finding new pathways from biological perspective.
thus, finding important pathways that underlie biological problems helps researchers to focus on the most relevant sets of genes.
biological pathways are important for understanding biological mechanisms.
a systematic and extensible pathway enrichment method in which nodes are weighted by network centrality was proposed.
