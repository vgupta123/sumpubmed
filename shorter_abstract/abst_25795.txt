expression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> was induced rapidly by stress conditions generated by liquid infiltration or spraying.
it has been previously shown that arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  which encode two structurally similar wrky transcription factors, are induced by pathogen infection and salicylic acid .
however, the role of the two wrky transcription factors in plant disease resistance has not been directly analyzed.
stress-induced expression of wrky <dig> was further elevated by pathogen infection and sa treatment.
functional analysis based on t-dna insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines indicates that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and wrky <dig> has a negative effect on plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens.
to determine directly their role in plant disease resistance, we have isolated t-dna insertion mutants and generated transgenic overexpression lines for wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  both the loss-of-function mutants and transgenic overexpression lines were examined for responses to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea.
although disruption of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> did not have a major effect on plant response to p. syringae, overexpression of wrky <dig> greatly enhanced plant susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen and suppressed pathogen-induced pr <dig> gene expression.
the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutants exhibited more severe disease symptoms and support higher fungal growth than wild-type plants after botrytis infection.
