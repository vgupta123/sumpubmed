given the important role of il- <dig> in inflammation, we measured its serum levels in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients.
il- <dig> expression was higher in over 65Â years old patients compared to age-matched controls , whereas in younger subjects no statistically significant differences were detected between patients and controls .
osteoporotic patients exhibited elevated levels of serum il- <dig> compared with healthy controls .
no statistically significant differences were found between il- <dig> levels in patients affected by mild  compared to severe  osteoporosis , neither between fractured and unfractured osteoporotic women .
il- <dig> is a proinflammatory cytokine mediating multiple immune functions, whose involvement in a wide range of diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases and cutaneous lymphomas, is now emerging.
we showed for the first time an increase of il- <dig> serum levels in postmenopausal women with decreased bmd.
in fifty-six postmenopausal females with osteoporosis and  <dig> healthy controls, bone mineral density  measurements were performed by using calcaneal quantitative ultrasound  technique, confirmed at the lumbar spine and hip by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry .
