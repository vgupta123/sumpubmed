we used the drosophila embryo as a system to investigate the regulation of components of the zonula adherens during apoptosis.
arm is cleaved by caspases in embryo extracts and we provide evidence that the caspase- <dig> homolog drice cleaves arm in vitro and in vivo.
to further understand the role of caspase-mediated cleavage of arm, we examined potential caspase cleavage sites and found that drice cleaves arm at a unique dqvd motif in the n-terminal domain of the protein.
our data suggest that n-terminal truncation of arm by caspases is evolutionarily conserved and thus might provide a principal mechanism involved in the disassembly of adherens junctions during apoptosis.
in epithelial tissues, apoptotic cells loose their apical/basal polarity and are extruded from the epithelium.
this study defines the specificity of caspase cleavage of arm in drosophila apoptotic cells.
mutation of the drice cleavage site in arm results in a protein that is not cleaved in vitro and in vivo.
cleavage by drice creates a stable protein fragment that remains associated with the plasma membrane early in apoptosis.
furthermore we provide evidence that cleavage of arm plays a role in the removal of de-cadherin from the plasma membrane during apoptosis.
