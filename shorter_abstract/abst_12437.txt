concomitant depletion of both sdc <dig> and med <dig> reversed enhanced cell adhesion triggered by med <dig> knockdown alone, confirming that med <dig> negatively regulates nsc cell adhesion by suppressing the expression of cell adhesion molecules.
med <dig> contributes to the maintenance of nsc identity through a functionally bipartite role in suppression and activation of gene expression programs dedicated to cell adhesion and g1/s phase cell cycle progression, respectively.
the rna polymerase ii transcriptional mediator subunit med <dig> is broadly implicated in vertebrate brain development, and genetic variation in human med <dig> is associated with x-linked intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders.
although prior studies have begun to elaborate the functional contribution of med <dig> within key neurodevelopmental pathways, a more complete description of med <dig> function in the developing nervous system, including the specific biological networks and cellular processes under its regulatory influence, remains to be established.
targeted depletion of med <dig> led to enhanced nsc adhesion and upregulation of cell adhesion genes, including syndecan  <dig> .

herein, we sought to clarify the global contribution of med <dig> to neural stem cell  biology through unbiased transcriptome profiling of mouse embryonic stem  cell-derived nscs following rnai-mediated med <dig> depletion.
on the other hand, med <dig> depletion in mns- <dig> nscs led to reduced expression of g1/s phase cell cycle regulators and a concordant g1/s phase cell cycle block without evidence of apoptosis, resulting in a severe proliferation defect.
med12-mediated suppression of nsc adhesion is a dynamically regulated process in vitro, enforced in self-renewing nscs and alleviated during the course of neuronal differentiation.
med <dig> may thus contribute to the regulatory apparatus that controls the balance between nsc self-renewal and differentiation, with important implications for med12-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.
