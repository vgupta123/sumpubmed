the olive tree is an oil-storing species, with pollen being the second most active site in storage lipid biosynthesis.
after tapetal cells lost their integrity, the caleosin-containing remnants of the tapetum filled the cavities of the mature pollen exine, forming the pollen coat.
the protein located on the outside might rather play a function in pollen-stigma interaction during pollen hydration and germination.
the pollen inner caleosin may be involved in ob biogenesis during pollen maturation.
the purpose of the present work was to characterize a caleosin expressed in the olive anther over different key stages of pollen ontogeny, as a first approach to unravel its biological function in reproduction.
during pollen maturation, caleosin levels progressively increased in the vegetative cell, concurrently with the number of oil bodies.
moreover, pegylation experiments supported the structural conformation model suggested for caleosins from seed oil bodies.
the pollen oil body-associated caleosin is synthesized by the vegetative cell, whereas the protein located on the pollen exine and its coating has a sporophytic origin.
as anthers developed, tapetal cells showed the presence of structures constituted by caleosin-containing lipid droplets closely packed and enclosed by er-derived cisternae and vesicles.
a  <dig> kda caleosin was identified in the anther tissues by western blot analysis.
the olive pollen caleosin was able to bind calcium in vitro.
caleosins were released to the anther locule and further deposited onto the sculptures of the pollen exine.
in the olive anther, a caleosin is expressed in both the tapetal and germ line cells, with its synthesis independently regulated.
in developing microspores, this caleosin was initially detected on the exine sculptures.
using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopic immunolocalization methods, the protein was first localized in the tapetal cells at the free microspore stage.
