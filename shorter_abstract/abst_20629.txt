of particular interest was the specific co-regulation of various members of the imd and jnk immune signaling pathways during malaria parasite invasion of the mosquito midgut epithelium.
the global transcriptomic responses of hemocytes to challenge with different species of bacteria and/or different stages of malaria parasite infection revealed discrete, minimally overlapping, pathogen-specific signatures of infection-responsive gene expression;  <dig> of these represented putative immunity-related genes including anti-plasmodium factors.
to further characterize the role of hemocytes in mosquito immunity, we undertook the first genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of adult female an.
while  <dig> transcripts were significantly enriched in hemocytes relative to whole adult female mosquitoes,  <dig> transcripts exhibited immune challenge-related regulation.
gambiae hemocytes following infection by two species of bacteria and a malaria parasite.
our genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of adult mosquito hemocytes reveals pathogen-specific signatures of gene regulation and identifies several novel candidate genes for future functional studies.
