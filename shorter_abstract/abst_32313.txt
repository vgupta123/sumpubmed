in this study we investigated the global impact of a dietary intervention on the gut ecology and metabolism in healthy humans.
the ability of the probiotic l. helveticus and b. longum strains to pass through the gastrointestinal tract was hypothesized on the basis of real-time pcr data.
the synbiotic food did not modify the overall structure of the gut microbiome, as indicated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis .
in the present study, we characterized the impact of one month intake of a synbiotic food, containing fructooligosaccharides and the probiotic strains lactobacillus helveticus bar <dig> and bifidobacterium longum bar <dig>  on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles of  <dig> healthy subjects.
furthermore, the canonical discriminant analysis of principal coordinates  of gc-ms/spme profiles allowed a separation of the stool samples recovered before and after the consumption of the functional food.
the extent of short chain fatty acids , ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl acetate was significantly affected by the synbiotic food consumption.
in particular, the significant increase of scfa, ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl acetate following the feeding period suggests potential health promoting effects of the synbiotic food.
in spite of a stable microbiota, the intake of the synbiotic food resulted in a shift of the fecal metabolic profiles, highlighted by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry solid phase micro-extraction  analysis.
we demonstrated that the intake of a synbiotic food leads to a modulation of the gut metabolic activities with a maintenance of the gut biostructure.
functional foods are commonly used to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota contributing to the maintenance of the host health or prevention of disease.
the human gut harbors a diverse community of microorganisms which serve numerous important functions for the host wellbeing.
