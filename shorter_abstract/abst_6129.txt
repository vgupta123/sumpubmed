this has been accomplished mainly by annotation of structural and functional elements in the genome sequence, a process that has been centred in the gene concept and, as a consequence, biased toward protein coding sequences.
although some of the information on the transcriptome of many organisms may actually be artefacts or transcriptional noise, we argue that it can be experimentally evaluated and used to find and define biological functional elements on the genome.
bioinformatic analysis of nucleotide sequences that map to the mouse cpm locus suggests that, in addition to the mouse cpm mrna, it expresses at least  <dig> different transcripts, many of which seem to be non-coding rnas.
furthermore, one of these four extra transcripts shows expression patterns that differed considerably from the other ones and from the mouse cpm gene, suggesting that there may be more than one transcriptional unit in this locus.
this study supports the recent view that the majority of the genome is transcribed and that many of the resulting transcripts seem to be non-coding rnas from introns of genes or from independent transcriptional units.
here we analyzed the mouse carboxypeptidase m locus in this broader perspective in order to define the mouse cpm gene structure and evaluate the existence of other transcripts from the same genomic region.
in addition, we have confirmed the mouse cpm gene refseq sequence by rapid amplification of cdna ends  and directional cloning.
they are expressed in a tissue specific manner, indicating that they are not artefacts or transcriptional noise.
we randomly chose to evaluate experimentally four of these extra transcripts.
furthermore, the transcription of other functional rnas besides the protein coding rna from a specific genomic locus imposes extra care when designing and interpreting experiments involving genetic manipulations or expression detection and quantification.
