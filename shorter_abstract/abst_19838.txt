instead, nhlp sequences display the classic gly-gly cleavage motif and have c-terminal regions rich in heterocyclizable residues.
these results suggest that two large protein families, the nitrile hydratases and nif <dig>  have been retailored for secondary metabolism.
as exemplified by microcin b <dig> and streptolysin s, tomm precursors contain an n-terminal leader sequence and c-terminal core peptide.
the leader sequence contains binding sites for the posttranslational modifying enzymes which subsequently act upon the core peptide.
a new family of natural products has been described in which cysteine, serine and threonine from ribosomally-produced peptides are converted to thiazoles, oxazoles and methyloxazoles, respectively.
the functions of these natural products have yet to be elucidated, but it is probable that some will display valuable industrial or medical activities.
indeed, a number of cyanobacterial genomes show extensive n11p paralogous expansion, such as nostoc, prochlorococcus and cyanothece, which replace the tomm cluster with lanthionine biosynthetic machinery.
examination of candidate tomm precursors has revealed a subclass with an uncharacteristically long leader sequence closely related to the enzyme nitrile hydratase.
