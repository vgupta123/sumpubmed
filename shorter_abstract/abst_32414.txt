global transcriptional profiling has been successfully used to identify genes and regulatory pathways in secondary cell wall thickening in arabidopsis, but such transcriptome data is lacking in legumes.
a systematic microarray assay and high through-put real time pcr analysis of secondary cell wall development were performed along stem maturation in medicago truncatula.
this study provides a useful transcriptome and expression resource for understanding cell wall development, which is pivotal to enhance biomass production in legumes.
as a complementary approach to microarray, real-time pcr analysis was used to characterize the expression of  <dig>  transcription factors in the stem samples, and  <dig> of these were upregulated more than 5-fold during stem maturation.

gene co-expression network analysis was employed to identify transcription factors that may regulate the biosynthesis of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.
more than  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed during stem maturation, and were categorized into  <dig> expression clusters.
reverse genetics characterization of a cellulose synthase gene in cluster  <dig> confirmed its function in xylem development.
the b-zip, nac, wrky, c2h <dig> zinc finger , homeobox, and hsf gene families were over-represented.
among these,  <dig> transcription factor genes were correlated with lignin/cellulose biosynthesis, therefore representing putative regulators of secondary wall development.
