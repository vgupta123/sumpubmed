the results demonstrate the feasibility of pedigree-based studies to address challenging ecological and evolutionary questions in free-living populations, where genealogies can be traced only using molecular tools, and that significant increases in pedigree assignment power can be achieved by using higher numbers of markers.
however, there remain limitations to pedigree reconstruction in wild populations, particularly in systems where parent-offspring relationships cannot be directly observed, there is incomplete sampling of individuals, or molecular parentage inference relies on low quality dna from archived material.
we also show that  <dig>  fold differences can be detected between groups simulated to have differing reproductive success, and that it is possible to detect moderate heritability values for continuous traits  with more than 80% power when using  <dig> moderately to highly polymorphic markers.
here, we used microsatellite markers to reconstruct a multi-generation pedigree of wild atlantic salmon  using archived scale samples collected with a total trapping system within a river over a 10Â year period.
pedigree reconstruction using genetic analysis provides a useful means to estimate fundamental population biology parameters relating to population demography, trait heritability and individual fitness when combined with other sources of data.
we show that at least  <dig> microsatellites  are required to maximise parentage assignment and to improve the power to estimate reproductive success and heritability in this study system.
