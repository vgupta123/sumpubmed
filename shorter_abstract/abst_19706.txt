additionally, neutrophil depletion had no influence on indicators of ischemic brain damage including edema, hemorrhage, and infarct size.
while gelatinase  activity is increased after focal ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain, the relative contribution of neutrophils to the mmp activity and to the development of hemorrhagic transformation remains unknown.
the main finding of this study is that, in the absence of circulating neutrophils, mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> expression and activity are still up-regulated following focal cerebral ischemia.
while there were significant increases in gelatinase  expression and activity and edema formation associated with ischemia, neutrophil depletion failed to cause any change.
