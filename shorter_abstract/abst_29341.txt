the only parameter κ of ms <dig> seems to give reasonable results even for its default value, which can be a great advantage for sequence sets for which little information is available.
we show that our approach yields classifications of several sets of hiv/siv sequences that agree with the accepted taxonomy, even on usually discarded repetitive regions .
while multiple alignment is the first step of usual classification schemes for biological sequences, alignment-free methods are being increasingly used as alternatives when multiple alignments fail.
among the equivalence classes produced by the n-local decodings for all n, we select a  small number of "relevant" classes corresponding to variable length subwords that carry enough information to perform the classification.
the parameter n, for which correct values are data-dependent and thus hard to guess, is here replaced by the average repetitivity κ of the sequences.
