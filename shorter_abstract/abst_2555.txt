divergence estimates were assessed to determine potential factors that led to the rapid radiation of this lineage and its dominance of warmer open habitats.

the initial diversification of pacmad subfamilies was estimated to occur at  <dig>  mya.
understanding how these grasses are related and determining a cause for their rapid radiation allows for future predictions of grassland distribution in the face of a changing global climate.
complete plastome sequences provide greater support at deep nodes within the pacmad clade.
the divergence estimate of  <dig>  mya at the crown node of the pacmad clade coincides with the eocene-oligocene transition .
the eocene was a period of global cooling and drying, which led to forest fragmentation and the expansion of open habitats now dominated by these grasses.
phylogenomic analyses of complete plastomes provides resolution for deep relationships of pacmad grasses.
sanger sequencing was performed to determine the plastome of one species, hakonechloa macra, to provide a reference for annotation.
an autapomorphic ~1140 bp deletion was found in hakonechloa macra putatively pseudogenizing rpl <dig> and eliminating rpl <dig> from this plastome.
plastome sequences for  <dig> species of the pacmad grasses  were analyzed phylogenomically.
new plastomes were completely sequenced and characterized for  <dig> pacmad species.
next generation sequencing methods were used to provide complete plastome sequences for  <dig> species.
phylogenomic analyses support panicoideae as the sister group to the acmad clade.
