we conducted an in silico analysis of the four sequenced genomes, chose  <dig> representative ssnps and analysed the loci in  <dig> c. pneumoniae isolates.
we identified  <dig> different genotypes that were separated in four major clusters.
ssnps have proven useful as a sensitive marker to gain new insights into genetic diversity, population structure and evolutionary history of c. pneumoniae.
we studied the genetic diversity of c. pneumoniae by analysing synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  that are under reduced selection pressure.
a lack of detectable variation in  <dig> isolates emphasizes the extraordinary genetic conservation of this species and the high clonality of the population.
chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates in a biphasic life cycle within eukaryotic host cells.
this remarkable finding raised questions about the existence of distinguishable genotypes in correlation with geographical and anatomical origin.
