in this work, we present a method to efficiently discover regions of high similarity across multiple sequences without performing expensive sequence alignment.
in this paper, we show that quasi-alignments can be used to discover highly similar segments across multiple sequences from related or different genomes efficiently and accurately.
quasi-alignment-based algorithms can detect highly similar regions and conserved areas across multiple sequences.
experiments on a large number of unaligned 16s rrna sequences obtained from the greengenes database show that the method is able to identify conserved regions which agree with known hypervariable regions in 16s rrna.
currently, most analysis, especially the identification of conserved regions, relies heavily on multiple sequence alignment and its various heuristics such as progressive alignment, whose run time grows with the square of the number and the length of the aligned sequences and requires significant computational resources.
furthermore, the experiments show that the proposed method scales well for large data sets with a run time that grows only linearly with the number and length of sequences, whereas for existing multiple sequence alignment heuristics the run time grows super-linearly.
the method is based on approximating edit distance between segments of sequences using p-mer frequency counts.
since the run time is linear and the sequences are converted into a compact clustering model, we are able to identify conserved regions fast or even interactively using a standard pc.
then, efficient high-throughput data stream clustering is used to group highly similar segments into so called quasi-alignments.
