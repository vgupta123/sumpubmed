icge is a user-friendly r package which provides many functions related to this problem: identify the number of clusters using mixed variables, usually found by applied biomedical researchers; detect whether the data have a cluster structure; identify whether a new unit belongs to one of the pre-identified clusters or to a novel group, and classify new units into the corresponding cluster.
there are two key aspects to classification: the estimation of the number of clusters, and the decision as to whether a new unit  belongs to one of these previously identified clusters or to a new group.
the results show that icge could be very useful to a broad research community.
an important problem associated with gene classification is to discern whether the clustering process can find a relevant partition as well as the identification of new genes classes.
the functions in the icge package are accompanied by help files and easy examples to facilitate its use.
they attempt to partition the genes into groups exhibiting similar patterns of variation in expression level.
