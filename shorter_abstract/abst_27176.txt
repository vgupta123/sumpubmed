bioinformatic analysis using sequence arrays from dart-seq markers in linkage disequilibrium with rph <dig> am identified possible candidates for further gene cloning efforts and marker development at the rph9/rph12/rph <dig> am locus.
marker-trait association analysis of rphc in the ci 9214/stirling dh population using  <dig>  dart-seq markers identified a highly significant  single peak on the long arm of chromosome 5h .
phenotypic assessment of a ‘ci 9214’  x ‘stirling’   doubled haploid  population at the seedling stage using p. hordei pathotype 253p-, confirmed that rphc was monogenically inherited.
multipathotype tests and subsequent pedigree analysis determined that  <dig> related australian barley varieties  carry rphc and that the likely source of this resistance is via a czechoslovakian landrace lv-kvasice-na-morave transferred through common ancestral cultivars ‘hanna’ and ‘abed binder’.
it is vulnerable to numerous foliar diseases including barley leaf rust caused by the pathogen puccinia hordei.
a temporarily designated resistance locus rphcantala  identified in the australian hordeum vulgare l. cultivar ‘cantala’ displayed an intermediate to low infection type  against the p. hordei pathotype 253p- .
