the ion bond, van der waals force and hydrophobic interaction contributed to pfos binding to peptide chain of sa and to the groove bases of dna duplex.
this work provides a useful experimental method for further studying the toxigenicity of pfcs.
static quenching of the fluorescence of sa was observed when interacting with pfos, indicating pfos bound trp residue of sa.
health risk from exposure of perfluorochemicals  to wildlife and human has been a subject of great interest for understanding their molecular mechanism of toxicity.
in equilibrium dialysis assay, the bindings of pfos to sa correspond to the langmuir isothermal model with two-step sequence model.
itc results showed that all the interactions were spontaneous driven by entropy change.
in this work, the non-covalent interactions between perfluorooctane sulfonate  and serum albumin  and dna were investigated under normal physiological conditions, aiming to elucidate the toxigenicity of pfcs.
the non-covalent interactions of pfos with sa and dna alter their secondary conformations, with the physiological function of sa to transport vitamin b <dig> being inhibited consequently.
cd spectra of sa and dna changed obviously in the presence of pfos.
