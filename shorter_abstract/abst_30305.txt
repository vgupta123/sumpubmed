celda is a structure that can help to categorize cell types based on species, anatomical localization, subcellular structures, developmental stages and origin.
celda can semantically link diverse types of information about cell types.
it has been integrated within the research platform cellfinder, where it exemplarily relates cell types from liver and kidney during development on the one hand and anatomical locations in humans on the other, integrating information on all spatial and temporal stages.
the need for detailed description and modeling of cells drives the continuous generation of large and diverse datasets.
currently, ten existing ontologies and models are linked to celda through the top-level ontology biotop.
celda is primarily used as a representational framework for modeling, analyzing and comparing cells within and across species in cellfinder, a web based data repository on cells .
