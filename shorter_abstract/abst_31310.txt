we studied the role of plasminogen activation by sak in a skin infection model in mice and evaluated the impact of alpha-2-antiplasmin  deficiency on the spreading and proteolytic activity of s. aureus skin infections.
whereas the importance of fibrin generation for s. aureus virulence has been established, the role of sak remains unclear.
staphylococcus aureus  is a frequent cause of skin and soft tissue infections.

sak-mediated plasmin activity increased the local invasiveness of s. aureus, leading to larger lesions with skin disruption as well as decreased bacterial clearance by the host.
the species-selectivity of sak was overcome by adenoviral expression of human plasminogen.
even though fibrin and bacterial surfaces protected sak-mediated plasmin activity from inhibition by α2ap, the deficiency of α2ap resulted in increased bacterial spreading.
a unique feature of s. aureus is the combined presence of coagulases that trigger fibrin formation and of the plasminogen activator staphylokinase .
bacterial spread and density was assessed non-invasively by imaging the bioluminescence of s. aureus xen <dig>
sak contributes to the phenotype of s. aureus skin infections by enhancing bacterial spreading as a result of fibrinolytic and proteolytic activation.
sak-mediated plasmin also induced secondary activation of gelatinases, shown both in vitro and in lesions from the in vivo model.
