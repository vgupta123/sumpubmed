the lytic activities of plybt <dig> and its n-terminus were tested on bacteria.
endolysins produced by bacteriophages lyse bacteria, and are thus considered a novel type of antimicrobial agent.
the c-terminus of plybt <dig> might be a novel kind of cell wall binding domain.
bioinformatic analyses showed that endolysin plybt <dig> was composed of two functional domains, the n-terminal catalytic domain and the c-terminal cell wall binding domain.
the c-terminus of plybt <dig> bound to b. thuringiensis strain hd- <dig> and bacillus subtilis strain  <dig>  this cell wall binding domain might be novel, as its amino acid sequence showed little similarity to previously reported endolysins.
optimal conditions for plybt <dig> reactivity were ph  <dig>  and 50°c.
plybt <dig> showed potential as a novel antimicrobial agent at a relatively high temperature and had a broad lytic spectrum within the bacillus genus.
plybt <dig> showed high thermostability, with 40% of initial activity remaining following  <dig> h of treatment at 60°c.
both regions exhibited lytic activity, although plybt <dig> showed a higher lytic activity than the n-terminus.
in this study, the entire endolysin plybt <dig>  and both the n- and c-termini,were expressed in escherichia coli and then purified.
plybt <dig> exhibited activity against all bacillus strains tested from five different species, but was not active against gram-negative bacteria.
several endolysins from bacillus phages or prophages have previously been characterized and used to target bacillus strains that cause disease in animals and humans.
