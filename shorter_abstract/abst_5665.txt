hook proteins have been proposed to serve as adaptors for the association of cargos with dynein for transport on microtubules.
we propose that hook <dig> contributes to the establishment and maintenance of the pericentrosomal localization of aggresomes by promoting the microtubule-based delivery of protein aggregates to pericentriolar aggresomes.
linker proteins that can associate with the motor protein dynein, organelles, and microtubules are thought to contribute to the active maintenance of the juxtanuclear localization of many membrane bound organelles and aggresomes.
here we show that overexpression of hook <dig> promotes the accumulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator in aggresomes without altering its biochemical properties or its steady state level.
