yet, the expression of a specific target protein can be fine-tuned by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation to the corresponding mrna.
micrornas are very small non-coding rnas that interact with microrna recognition elements  on their target messenger rnas.
this phenomenon was observed not only in the hsa-mir-148a-regulated dnmt3b gene, but also in many target genes regulated by hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  and hsa-mir-181a.
the splicing-regulated mres are often highly repressive mres.
when a gene contains multiple mres in transcripts, such as the vegf gene, the splicing-regulated mres are again the highly repressive mres.
this fine-tuning mechanism revealed associations with highly repressive mre.
for example, the mre-free transcripts of many oncogenes, such as n-ras and others may escape microrna-mediated suppression in cancer tissues.
varying the concentration of a given microrna may influence the expression of many target proteins.
