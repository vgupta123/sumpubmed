differentiation of a keratinocyte is characterized by its continuously changing morphology concomitant with its movement from the basal layer to the surface, leading to a decreased average nuclei density throughout the tissue.
by contrast, the inverse nuclei density approach led to an increased resolution at early but heavily decreased resolution at late differentiation.
when studying five well-known differentiation related biomarkers in an epidermal neck sample only the resulting biomarker profiles incorporating the relative distance information of cells to the tissue borders  provided a high-resolution view on the whole process of keratinocyte differentiation.
in the joint approach this effect could be compensated again by incorporating distance information.
concluding, the distance approach appears well suited for comprehensively observing keratinocyte differentiation.
hence, we need to incorporate the information of the differentiation dependent protein expression in cell based systems biological models of tissue homeostasis.
this effect results from the heavy non-linear decay of dapi intensity per area, probably caused by cytoplasmic growth and chromatin decondensation.
the epidermal physiology results from a complex regulated homeostasis of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and death and is tightly regulated by a specific protein expression during cellular maturation.
such methods require measuring tissue differentiation quantitatively while correlating it with biomarker expression intensities.
we suppose that key mechanisms regulating tissue homeostasis probably depend more on distance information rather than on nuclei reorganization.
we integrated them with an immunofluorescent staining and image analysis method for tissue sections, automatically quantifying epidermal differentiation and measuring the corresponding expression of biomarkers.
