in this study, we examined the status of different subpopulations of tfh cells in peripheral circulation and their associations with various clinical characteristics of iga vasculitis .
according to the phenotypic expressions of different molecules, focus was given on six subpopulations of tfh cells: cd4+cxcr5+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+pd-1+, cd4+cxcr5+icoshighpd-1high, cd4+cxcr5+icos−pd-1+, and cxcr5+cd45ra−il-21+.
significantly higher frequencies of cd4+cxcr5+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+pd-1+, cd4+cxcr5+icoshighpd-1high and cxcr5+cd45ra−il-21+ tfh cells, as well as higher levels of plasma il- <dig>  were detected in igav patients compared to hc.
when the disease entered the remission stage following treatment, circulating levels of cd4+cxcr5+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+, cd4+cxcr5+icos+pd-1+, cd4+cxcr5+icoshighpd-1high and cxcr5+cd45ra−il-21+ tfh cells, as well as plasma il- <dig> levels were reduced.
among the six subpopulations of tfh cells, both cd4+cxcr5+icos+ and cxcr5+cd45ra−il-21+ significantly and positively correlated with serum iga and plasma il- <dig> levels, but only cxcr5+cd45ra−il-21+ significantly and negatively correlated with the serum c <dig> level.
tfh cells may differentially contribute to the development of igav or predict disease progression.

the frequencies of these six subpopulations and the circulating level of tfh-related cytokine interleukin  <dig>  were measured from  <dig> patients with igav and  <dig> healthy controls  by flow cytometry and flow cytometric bead array, respectively.
circulating follicular helper t  cells are a heterogeneous population of cd4+ helper t cells that promotes pathogenic immune responses in autoimmune diseases.
these findings provide novel insights in the pathogenesis of igav and may benefit treatment development targeting organ-specific presenting symptoms of igav.
