strains presented multi resistance to antimicrobial agents.
samples  were collected and analyzed in accordance with the epa method 1682/ <dig>  for positive serological reaction,  <dig> strains were selected for pcr analyses and detection of spvc, inva and ssel virulence genes, plasmid presence and resistance to antibiotics.
presented at least one of the three virulence genes mentioned above and 40% harboured plasmids.
salmonella typhimurium strains were isolated harbouring at least one of the following virulence genes: spvc, inva or ssel.
the results obtained demonstrated that salmonella spp.
this study aims to scrutinize salmonella spp.
the most prevalent serotype was salmonella infantis.
