the algorithms work with user-defined parameters, and we demonstrate that the parameter values chosen can strongly influence microsatellite distributions.
significant differences for all characteristics of microsatellites were observed among algorithms, but not among genomes, for both perfect and imperfect microsatellites.
since the algorithm used strongly influences empirical distributions, studies analyzing microsatellite evolution based on a comparison between empirical and theoretical size distributions should therefore be considered with caution.
our analysis was first conducted on the human x chromosome, and microsatellite distributions were characterized by microsatellite number, length, and divergence from a pure motif.
here, we compared the detection efficiency of five of them .
striking differences were detected for short microsatellites , regardless of motif.
