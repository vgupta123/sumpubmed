active and non-active cd patients showed lower numbers of total bifidobacterium and b. longum species in faeces and duodenal biopsies than controls, and these differences were particularly remarkable between active cd patients and controls.
samples  from a control age-matched group of children were also included for comparative purposes.
reductions in total bifidobacterium and b. longum populations were associated with both active and non-active cd when compared to controls.
correlations between levels of bifidobacterium and b. longum species in faecal and biopsy samples were detected in both cd patients and controls.
these bacterial groups could constitute novel targets for adjuvant dietary therapies although the confirmation of this hypothesis would require further investigations.
a total of  <dig> faecal samples  and  <dig> duodenal biopsy specimens of cd patients  were analysed.
b. catenulatum prevalence was higher in biopsies of controls than in those of active and non-active cd patients, whereas b. dentium prevalence was higher in faeces of non-active cd patients than in controls.
the objective of this study was to assess the possible relationships between the gut bifidobacteria composition and coeliac disease  in children.
