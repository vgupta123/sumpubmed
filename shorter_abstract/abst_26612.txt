among the viral proteins, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins constitute the major enzymatic components of the viral replication complex and are essential to the flavivirus life cycle.
the genus flavivirus encompasses more than  <dig> distinct species of arthropod-borne viruses, including several major human pathogens, such as west nile virus, yellow fever virus, japanese encephalitis virus and the four serotypes of dengue viruses .
we report here the results of a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the interactions between human host proteins and the flavivirus ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins.
using our screen results and literature curation, we performed a global analysis of the ns <dig> and ns <dig> cellular targets based on functional annotation with the gene ontology features.
the global analysis of the cellular targets revealed the enrichment of host proteins involved in rna binding, transcription regulation, vesicular transport or innate immune response regulation.
we proposed that the selective disruption of these newly identified host/virus interactions could represent a novel and attractive therapeutic strategy in treating flavivirus infections.
our virus-host interaction map provides a basis to unravel fundamental processes about flavivirus subversion of the host replication machinery and/or immune defence strategy.
our proteome mapping screen identified  <dig> human proteins interacting with ns <dig> or ns <dig> proteins or both.
