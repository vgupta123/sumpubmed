in addition, bmps can induce the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into various cell types, including chondroblasts and osteoblasts.
osteosarcoma cell lines were isolated from biopsies and excisions of animals with osteosarcoma and were characterized by the laboratory of biochemistry and biophysics, butantan institute.
we evaluated the regenerative potential of in vitro treatment with rhbmp- <dig> and found that both osteogenic induction and tumor regression occur in stem cells from canine bone marrow.
bmps play important roles in cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and inhibition of cell growth.
the bone morphogenetic proteins  belong to a unique group of proteins that includes the growth factor tgf-β.
the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of treatment with rhbmp- <dig> on the proliferation of canine mesenchymal stem cells  and the tumor suppression properties of rhbmp- <dig> in canine osteocarcoma  cells.
the mesenchymal stem cells were derived from the bone marrow of canine fetuses  and belong to the university of são paulo, college of veterinary medicine  stem cell bank.
after expansion, the cells were cultured in a 12-well transwell system; cells were treated with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells associated with rhbmp <dig>  expression of the intracytoplasmic and nuclear markers such as caspase- <dig>  bax, bad, bcl- <dig>  ki- <dig>  p <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  nanog, stro- <dig> were performed by flow citometry.
canine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells associated with rhbmp <dig> in canine osteosarcoma treatment: "in vitro" study
rhbmp- <dig> inhibits the proliferation capacity of ost cells by mechanisms of apoptosis and tumor suppression mediated by p <dig>
they also participate in the maturation of several cell types, depending on the microenvironment and interactions with other regulatory factors.
bmps can interfere with cell proliferation and the formation of cartilage and bone.
depending on their concentration gradient, the bmps can attract various types of cells and act as chemotactic, mitogenic, or differentiation agents.
we propose that rhbmp- <dig> has great therapeutic potential in bone marrow cells by serving as a tumor suppressor to increase p <dig> and the pro-apoptotic proteins bad and bax, as well as by increasing the activity of phosphorylated caspase  <dig>
