ten of these unigenes were found to be brassica-specific sequences, including two that originate from complex loci comprising gene clusters.
we assembled unigenes using ~ <dig>  est sequences, mainly from three species: b. napus, b. rapa and b. oleracea.
gene expression was analysed in reciprocal resynthesised b. napus lines and the b. oleracea and b. rapa lines used to produce them.
principal component analysis  clearly resolved the individual microarray datasets for b. rapa, b. oleracea and resynthesised b. napus.
quantitative differences in expression were observed between the resynthesised b. napus lines for  <dig> unigenes, most of which could be classified into non-additive expression patterns, including  <dig> that showed cytoplasm-specific patterns.
a large number of est sequences, derived from a range of different brassica species, are available in the public database, but no public microarray resource has so far been developed for these species.
they are related to arabidopsis thaliana, for which the first complete plant genome sequence was obtained and their genomes show extensive, although imperfect, conserved synteny with that of a. thaliana.
our studies demonstrated that the datasets obtained from the arrays can be used for typical analyses, including pca and the analysis of differential expression.
expression was detected across all four genotypes for  <dig>  unigenes, genome-specific expression patterns were observed for  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig> unigenes displayed other classes of expression pattern.
these were incorporated into the bac sequence annotation for the brassica rapa genome sequencing project, enabling the identification of cognate genomic sequences for a proportion of them.
the analysis showed that significant expression could consistently be detected in leaf tissue for  <dig>  unigenes.
the assembly was conducted with the aim of co-assembling ests of orthologous genes , but resolving assemblies of paralogous, or paleo-homoeologous, genes .
a 60-mer oligo microarray comprising  <dig>  probes was developed using the unigene sequences.
these would not be detectable using arrays designed using a. thaliana sequences.
the brassica species include an important group of crops and provide opportunities for studying the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy.
we further characterized the unigenes for which a genome-specific expression was observed and cognate genomic sequences could be identified.
we anticipate that some proportion of these will represent species-specific transcripts and the remainder will be the consequence of variation of sequences within the regions represented by the array probes.
