the identification of a molecular marker for canine osa is an important goal and the results reported here justify a larger study.
although statistical significance was not reached, a trend was identified between the lack of canine osa p <dig> expression and a shorter disease free interval.
the ability to identify canine osa cases most responsive to treatment is needed.
in humans, osa is also an aggressive tumor that is histologically and molecularly similar to canine osa.
we identified an antibody that binds canine p <dig> and developed a canine osa tissue microarray in order to test the hypothesis that p <dig> expression by canine osa tissue is predictive of clinical outcome following amputation and chemotherapy.
