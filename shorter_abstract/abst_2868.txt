furthermore, all positive samples came from areas with suboptimal climate for soft ticks.
however, these samples did not show a spatial clustering  and were of bad quality .
in a first attempt to assess the risk of a tick-wild boar transmission cycle in central europe that would further complicate eradication of the disease, over  <dig> pre-existing serum samples from wild boar hunted in four representative german federal states were investigated for the presence of antibodies directed against salivary antigen of ornithodoros erraticus ticks using an indirect elisa format.
these ticks can be part of asfv-transmission cycles, and in europe, o. erraticus was shown to be responsible for long-term maintenance of asfv in spain and portugal.
it is caused by asf virus , the only dna virus which can be efficiently transmitted by an arthropod vector, soft ticks of the genus ornithodoros.
african swine fever  is one of the most complex viral diseases affecting both domestic and wild pigs.

in  <dig>  the disease has been reintroduced into the european union, affecting domestic pigs and, importantly, also the eurasian wild boar population.
out of these samples,  <dig> reacted with moderate to high optical densities that could be indicative of tick bites in sampled wild boar.
in conclusion, the study did not provide stringent evidence for soft tick-wild boar contact in the investigated german federal states and thus, a relevant involvement in the epidemiology of asf in german wild boar is unlikely.
for this reason, false positive reactions are likely.
