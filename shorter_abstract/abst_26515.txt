similar to transporter inhibitors, morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> increased accumulation of fluorescent substrates in embryo tissue and sensitivity of embryos toward toxic compounds.
atpase assays with recombinant protein obtained with the baculovirus expression system confirmed that dye and toxic compounds act as substrates of zebrafish abcb <dig> and inhibitors block its function.
the compounds tested comprised model substrates of human abcb <dig>  namely the fluorescent dyes rhodamine b and calcein-am and the toxic compounds vinblastine, vincristine and doxorubicin; cyclosporin a, psc <dig>  mk <dig> and verapamil were applied as inhibitors.
with inhibitors present, levels of fluorescent dyes in embryo tissue and sensitivity of embryos to toxic substrates were generally elevated.
in mammals, abcb <dig> constitutes a cellular “first line of defense” against a wide array of chemicals and drugs conferring cellular multidrug or multixenobiotic resistance .
our data have important implications: abcb <dig> could affect bioavailability - and thus toxicologic and pharmacologic potency - of chemicals to zebrafish embryos and inhibition of abcb <dig> therefore causes chemosensitization, that is, enhanced sensitivity of embryos to toxicants.
we tested the hypothesis that an abcb <dig> ortholog serves as protection for the sensitive developmental processes in zebrafish embryos against adverse compounds dissolved in the water.
indication for abcb1-type efflux counteracting the accumulation of chemicals in zebrafish embryos comes from experiments with fluorescent and toxic transporter substrates and inhibitors.
we verified two predicted sequences from zebrafish, previously annotated as abcb <dig>  by cloning; our synteny analyses, however, identified them as abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  respectively.
these aspects should be considered in toxicologic and pharmacologic chemical screens with the zebrafish embryo, a major vertebrate model.
