principal component discriminant analysis , an adaptation of classical linear discriminant analysis  for high-dimensional data, has been selected as an example of a base learner.
the aggregating pcda learner can improve the prediction performance, provide more stable result, and help to know the variability of the models.
the performance of this approach was evaluated by simulation, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data sets.
the multiple versions of pcda models from repeated double cross-validation were aggregated, and the final classification was performed by majority voting.
