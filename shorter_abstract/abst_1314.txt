using the pc <dig> neuronal cell line, concentrations of cisplatin were chosen that induced moderate or strong neurite toxicity within  <dig> hrs but were not cytotoxic.
the effect of phenoxodiol on cisplatin induced neurite toxicity was assessed by measurement of neurite outgrowth.
addition of phenoxodiol at  <dig> nm or  <dig> μm showed no cytotoxicity and blocked the cisplatin induced neurite toxicity, while phenoxodiol at  <dig> μm was cytotoxic and enhanced neurite toxicity of cisplatin.
many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, are restricted in their potential anti-neoplastic effectiveness by their side effects, with one of the most problematic being induction of peripheral neuropathy.
pc <dig> cells are a commonly used neuronal cell model for examination of neurite outgrowth.
when cisplatin was added for  <dig> hrs, then washed out and the cells allowed to recover for  <dig> hrs, neurite outgrowth was not restored and addition of phenoxodiol did not further promote recovery or restore the cisplatin treated cells.
