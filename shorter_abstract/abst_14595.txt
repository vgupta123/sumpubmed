we describe the implementation of ss-wrapper , a package of wrapper applications that can parallelize similarity search applications on a linux cluster.
it takes into consideration load balancing between each node on the cluster to maximize resource usage.
this implementation does not alter the original program, so newly obtained programs and program updates should be accommodated easily.
benchmark experiments using qs-search to optimize blast and hmmpfam showed that qs-search accelerated the performance of these programs almost linearly in proportion to the number of cpus used.
using software such as the basic local alignment search tool  or hmmpfam to identify statistically significant matches between newly sequenced segments of genetic material and those in databases is an important task for most molecular biologists.
to take advantage of larger databases and more reliable methods, high performance computation becomes necessary.
used together, qs-search and ds-blast provide a flexible solution to adapt sequential similarity searching applications in high performance computing environments.
we have also implemented a wrapper that utilizes a database segmentation approach  that provides a complementary solution for blast searches when the database is too large to fit into the memory of a single node.
