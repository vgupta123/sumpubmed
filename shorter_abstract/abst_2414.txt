promoter analysis in transgenic arabidopsis plants revealed transcriptional activation of mir <dig> by fungal elicitors.
most studies on pathogen-regulated srnas have been conducted in arabidopsis plants infected with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae, or treated with the flagelin-derived elicitor peptide flg <dig> from p. syringae.
results here presented support a transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlying mir <dig> expression.
the results of this study also lay a foundation for the involvement of rddm processes through the activity of sirna <dig> and mir <dig> in mediating regulation of immune responses in arabidopsis plants.
this finding highlights the importance of mirna functioning in adaptive processes of arabidopsis plants to fungal infection.
microarray analysis revealed alterations on the accumulation of a set of srnas in response to elicitor treatment, including mirnas and small rna sequences derived from massively parallel signature sequencing.
in addition to known mirnas, microarray analysis allowed the identification of an elicitor-inducible small rna that was incorrectly annotated as a mirna.

sirna <dig> is detected in several plant species.
among the elicitor-regulated mirnas was mir <dig> which regulates argonaute <dig>  the core component of the rna-induced silencing complex involved in mirna functioning.
studies on arabidopsis mutants impaired in small rna biogenesis demonstrated that this srna, is a heterochromatic-sirna  named as sirna <dig>  hc-sirnas are known to be involved in rna-directed dna methylation .
small rnas , including small interfering rnas  and micrornas , have emerged as important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression.
mir <dig>  targeting chromomethylase <dig>  involved in rna-directed dna methylation  was also found to be regulated by fungal elicitors.
furthermore, transgenic plants expressing a gfp-mir <dig> sensor gene confirmed that the elicitor-induced mir <dig> is active.
accumulating evidence also reveals that srnas are involved in plant immunity.
