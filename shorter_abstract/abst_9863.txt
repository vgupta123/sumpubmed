ubiquitination serves multiple cellular functions, including proteasomal degradation and the control of stability, function, and intracellular localization of a wide variety of proteins.
to address the potential functional significance of the nedd4l common variant on nedd4l subcellular localization, nedd4l isoforms that either contained or lacked a c <dig> domain were tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, transfected into xenopus laevis kidney epithelial cells, and imaged by performing confocal microscopy on live cells.
the c2-containing isoform differentially affects the mobilization of enac subunits from intracellular pools and this trafficking step requires nedd4l ubiquitin ligase activity.
additionally, whereas the c2-containing nedd4l isoform is capable of shuttling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to calcium stimulus the c2-lacking isoform can not.
furthermore, the ability of the c2-containing isoform to influence Î²-enac mobilization from intracellular pools involves the nedd4l active site for ubiquitination.
we report that the presence or absence of this c <dig> domain exerts differential effects on the subcellular distribution of nedd4l, the ability of c <dig> containing and lacking nedd4l isoforms to mobilize in response to a calcium stimulus, and the intracellular transport of subunits of the nedd4l substrate, enac.
nedd4l isoforms that contain or lack a c <dig> domain target different intracellular locations.
moreover, our observations regarding differential function of the nedd4l isoforms may impact other aspects of physiology that involve this ubiquitin ligase.
nedd4l is a member of the hect class of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases.
we propose a model that describes how that functional variation may influence blood pressure.
this observation suggests a new mechanism for the requirement for the py motif in camp-mediated exocytosis of enac.
