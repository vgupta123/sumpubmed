here we investigated the possible role of chlamydia pneumoniae  in the pathogenesis of venous graft failure in an experimental animal model.
in conclusion, in a well defined animal model we present here for the first time evidence for a role of chlamydia pneumoniae in the process of venous graft failure.
like in atherosclerosis, common chronic infections caused by viruses and bacteria may contribute to this process of vein graft failure.
there were no significant differences in t-cell or macrophage influx.
based on the observation that the number of cells/Î¼m <dig> was also not altered, we conclude that cpn infection stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation by hereunto unknown molecular mechanisms, resulting in a significant increase in intimal hyperplasia.
cpn administration immediately after vein grafting resulted in a significant increase in medial cross-sectional area, wall thickness and total wall area.
although initially a successful procedure, long-term functionality is limited due to proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells.
