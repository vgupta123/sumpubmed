since uf volumetric measures are newly applied measures, it is necessary to cross-validate them using further neural and behavioral indicators of anxiety.
in a group of  <dig> subjects not reporting any history of psychiatric disorders, we identified a negative correlation between left uf volume and trait anxiety, a finding that is in line with previous results.
recent investigations of white matter  connectivity suggest an important role of the uncinate fasciculus , connecting anterior temporal areas including the amygdala with prefrontal-/orbitofrontal cortices, for anxiety-related processes.

the present study emphasizes the role of the left uf as candidate wm fiber bundle associated with anxiety-related processes and suggests that fiber bundle volume is a wm measure of particular interest.
on the other hand, volume of the left amygdala, which is strongly connected with the uf, was positively correlated with trait anxiety.
the uf-amygdala complex may be pivotal for the control of trait anxiety.
moreover, these results substantiate the structural relatedness of uf and amygdala by a non-invasive imaging method.
in addition, volumes of the left uf and left amygdala were inversely associated.
