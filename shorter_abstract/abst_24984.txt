the antibodies to double-stranded dna , histone , nuclear ribonucleoprotein , sjogren’s syndrome a , sjogren’s syndrome b  and smith antigen, jo- <dig>  scleroderma-associated antigen  and centromere , zona pellucid , adrenocortical antibodies ,rheumatoid factor , glomerular basement membrane , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , myeloperoxidase , proteinase  <dig> , thyroid microsomal antibody and antinuclear antibody were analyzed.
primary ovarian insufficiency  is heterogeneous disease defined by amenorrhea or premature depletion of ovarian follicles before the age of  <dig> years.
this study shows that the autoimmune antibodies jo- <dig> and pr <dig> were significantly higher in poi women group which suggested that these antibodies may have played special role in poi, but the evaluation of the exact pathways of them remains to be determined.
the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether women with poi have an elevated serum levels of autoimmunologic parameters.
among the  <dig> women with poi and  <dig> age-matched health controls, women with poi had significantly elevated circulation levels of jo- <dig> and pr <dig>  whereas circulation levels of anas, dsdna, histone, rnp, sm, scl- <dig>  ssa, ssb, cen, zp, aca, rf, gbm, pcna, mpo and tm antibodies were similar between the two groups.
