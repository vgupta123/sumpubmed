here we  investigated whether a north american philanthus species also employs prey embalming and  assessed the occurrence and morphology of a ppg among females of the subfamily philanthinae in order to elucidate the evolution of prey embalming as an antimicrobial strategy.
based on our results, we suggest that prey embalming has evolved as an antimicrobial strategy in and is restricted to the tribe philanthini, which seems to face exceptional threats with regard to fungal infestations of their larval provisions.
according to an ancestral state reconstruction, the complex ppg most likely evolved in the last common ancestor of the philanthini, thus representing an autapomorphy of this tribe.
prey embalming, as described for p. triangulum and t. elongatus, and now also for p. gibbosus, most probably requires a complex ppg.
we provide clear evidence that females of the north american philanthus gibbosus possess large ppgs and embalm their prey.
a formal statistical analysis based on defined characters of the glands confirmed that while all members of the derived tribe philanthini have large and complex ppgs, species of the two more basal tribes, cercerini and aphilanthopsini, possess simple and comparatively small glands.
the comparative analyses of  <dig> species from six genera of the philanthinae, using histological methods and 3d-reconstructions, revealed pronounced differences in gland morphology within the subfamily.
hymenoptera that mass-provision their offspring have evolved elaborate antimicrobial strategies to ward off fungal infestation of the highly nutritive larval food.
