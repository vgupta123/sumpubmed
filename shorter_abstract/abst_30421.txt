pairwise stochastic context-free grammars  are powerful tools for evolutionary analysis of rna, including simultaneous rna sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction, but the associated algorithms are intensive in both cpu and memory usage.
we outline several applications to the bioinformatics of rna sequence and structure, including waterman-eggert n-best alignments and progressive multiple alignment.
a program, stemloc, that implements these algorithms for efficient rna sequence alignment and structure prediction is available under the gnu general public license.
it is now possible to combine independent structural and alignment constraints of unprecedented general flexibility in pair scfg alignment algorithms.
