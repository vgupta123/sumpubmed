dynactin is a large multisubunit protein complex that enhances the processivity of cytoplasmic dynein and acts as an adapter between dynein and the cargo.
the absence of dynactin in certain species coincides with that of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain: organisms that do not encode cytoplasmic dynein like plants and diplomonads also do not encode the unique dynactin subunits.
especially in the metazoan lineage, several of the dynactin subunits were duplicated independently in different branches.
the most prominent example is the dynactin <dig> gene, which may code for up to  <dig> different isoforms due to three different transcription start sites and four exons that are spliced as differentially included exons.
the dynactin complex is a very ancient complex that most likely included all subunits in the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes.
phylogenetic trees of the various subunit sequences were used to reveal sub-family relationships and to reconstruct gene duplication events.
to reveal the evolution of dynactin across the eukaryotic tree the presence or absence of all dynactin subunits was determined in most of the available eukaryotic genome assemblies.
