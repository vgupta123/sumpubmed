by mapping our results together with data from previous studies on a molecular phylogeny we show that avian colour vision shifted between vs and uvs at least  <dig> times.
amino acid residues signifying uv sensitivity are found in the two most important spectral tuning sites  <dig> and  <dig> of pteroclidiformes and coraciiformes, in addition to the major clades, palaeognathae, charadriiformes, trogoniformes, psittaciformes and passeriformes, where they where previously known to occur.
single nucleotide substitutions can explain all these shifts.
we present genomic sequencing results of the sws <dig> gene from  <dig> avian orders.
colour vision in birds can be categorized into two classes, the ultraviolet  and violet sensitive .
however, the ancestral state of the avian sws <dig> opsinâ€™s spectral tuning sites cannot be resolved, since the palaeognathae are f <dig>  c <dig> while the neognathae are ancestrally s <dig>  s <dig>  the phylogenetic distribution of uvs and vs colour vision in birds is so complex that inferences of spectral sensitivities from closely related taxa should be used with caution.
the common ancestor of birds most likely had a vs phenotype.
their phylogenetic distributions have traditionally been regarded as highly conserved.
however, the complicated nature of acquiring spectral sensitivities from cone photoreceptors meant that until recently, only a few species had actually been studied.
