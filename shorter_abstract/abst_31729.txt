here, we have directly compared in vivo bioactivities of methoxylated and hydroxylated stilbenes in a whole organism using the roundworm caenorhabditis elegans, an advantageous experimental system for such studies due to its rapid lifecycle, genetic amenability and relatively low-cost.
these findings demonstrate that, for the group of stilbenes investigated, methoxylation generally increased bioactivity in vivo in a whole organism, with the exception of pinostilbene.
methoxylated stilbenes are metabolized more slowly, which may have a positive effect on in vivo bioactivity.
the potent activities of methoxylated stilbenes provide a basis for further investigations to identify in vivo targets for these compounds.
however, steady-state levels of three inhibitory methoxylated stilbenes did not directly correlate to their relative bioactivities.
toxicity towards c. elegans adults was observed for trimethoxylated and dimethoxylated stilbenes, as well as the monomethoxylated stilbene desoxyrhapontigenin.
differences in bioactivity in c. elegans adults did not appear to correlate with differential uptake.
many stilbenes also exhibit xenobiotic activities in animal cells, such as inhibition of cancer cell growth, neuroprotection, and immune modulation.
