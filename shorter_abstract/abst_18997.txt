data for snp probes that do not conform to the expected pattern of clustering are often discarded, contributing to ascertainment bias and resulting in lost information - as much as 50% in a recent genome-wide association study in dogs.
when recognized and properly interpreted, vinos recovered a substantial fraction of discarded probes and counteracted snp ascertainment bias.
high-density genotyping arrays that measure hybridization of genomic dna fragments to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes are widely used to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms  in genetic studies, including human genome-wide association studies.
we used whole-genome sequence from  <dig> mouse strains to confirm the presence of novel variants explaining  <dig> vinos in those strains.
hybridization intensities are converted to genotype calls by clustering algorithms that assign each sample to a genotype class at each snp.
we identified atypical patterns of hybridization intensities that were highly reproducible and demonstrated that these patterns represent genetic variants that were not accounted for in the design of the array platform.
genetic studies will benefit from substantial improvements in the accuracy of their results by incorporating vinos in their analyses.
the problems of ascertainment bias and missing information due to genotyping errors are widely recognized as limiting factors in genetic studies.
mousedivgeno produced highly concordant genotype calls when compared with other methods but it uniquely identified more than  <dig> vinos in  <dig> mouse samples.
