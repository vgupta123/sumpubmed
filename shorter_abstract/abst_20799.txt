to study this, we compared superoxide production and mitochondrial electron transport chain  components in isolated rgc mitochondria to mitochondria isolated from cerebral cortex and neuroblastoma sk-n-as cells.
in the presence of the complex i substrate glutamate/malate or the complex ii substrate succinate, the rate of superoxide production in rgc- <dig> cells was significantly lower than cerebral or neuroblastoma cells.
cerebral but not rgc- <dig> or neuroblastoma cells increased superoxide production in response to the complex i inhibitor rotenone, while neuroblastoma but not cerebral or rgc- <dig> cells dramatically decreased superoxide production in response to the complex iii inhibitor antimycin a. immunoblotting and real-time quantitative pcr of metc components demonstrated different patterns of expression among the three different sources of neuronal mitochondria.
diversity in metc component expression and function could explain tissue specificity in diseases associated with inherited mtdna abnormalities.
rgc- <dig> mitochondria produce superoxide at significantly lower rates than cerebral and neuroblastoma mitochondria, most likely as a result of differential expression of complex i components.
for example, leber's hereditary optic neuropathy  results from one of three point mutations mtdna coding for complex i components, but is only manifested in retinal ganglion cells , a central neuron contained within the retina.
