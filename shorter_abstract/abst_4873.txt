to identify ts related abnormalities in gray and white matter we used optimized voxel-based morphometry  and magnetization transfer imaging  which are more sensitive to tissue alterations than conventional mri and provide a quantitative measure of macrostructural integrity.
decreases in white matter volumes were detected in the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus and the anterior corpus callosum.
using vbm, ts patients showed significant decreases in gray matter volumes in prefrontal areas, the anterior cingulate gyrus, sensorimotor areas, left caudate nucleus and left postcentral gyrus.
increases were found in the left middle frontal gyrus and left sensorimotor areas.
in mti, white matter reductions were seen in the right medial frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally and the right cingulate gyrus.
we suggest that anomalous frontal lobe association and projection fiber bundles cause disinhibition of the cingulate gyrus and abnormal basal ganglia function.
pathophysiological evidence suggests an involvement of fronto-striatal circuits in tourette syndrome .
volumetric high-resolution anatomical t1-weighted mri and mti were acquired in  <dig> adult, unmedicated male ts patients without co-morbidities and  <dig> age- and sex-matched controls on a  <dig>  tesla neuro-optimized ge scanner.
tic severity was negatively correlated with orbitofrontal structures, the right cingulate gyrus and parts of the parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex bilaterally.
