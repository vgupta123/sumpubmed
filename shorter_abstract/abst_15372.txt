in the current study, we extend our previous findings to characterize in depth the gga-induced compartments and the determinants for retroviral gag sequestration in these structures.
gga overexpression leads to defects in trafficking of transferrin receptor and recycling of cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
interestingly, brefeldin a treatment, which leads to the dissociation of endogenous ggas from membranes, does not dissociate the gga-induced compartments.
the determinants in gag responsible for sequestration map to the matrix domain, and recruitment to these structures is dependent on gag membrane binding.
we find that gga-induced structures are derived from the golgi and contain aggresome markers.
these data provide insights into the composition of structures induced by gga overexpression and their ability to disrupt endosomal sorting and retroviral particle production.
gga overexpression led to the formation of large, swollen vacuolar compartments, which in the case of gga <dig> sequestered hiv- <dig> gag.
additionally, we find that compartments induced by gga overexpression sequester tsg <dig>  poly-ubiquitin, and, in the case of gga <dig>  hrs.
