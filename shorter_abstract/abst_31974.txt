our rough estimates of trna sine copies per haploid genome were much higher than published ones.
thirty-three species of  <dig> out of  <dig> carnivore families were represented, although two distantly related species, the domestic dog and cat, were clearly overrepresented.
however, little is currently understood about the factors that influence their genesis and distribution among and within species genomes.
microsatellite and interspersed repeat coevolution could also explain different distribution of repeat types among and within species genomes.
our results also revealed a distinct juxtaposition of ag and a-rich repeats and trnalys-derived sines suggesting their coevolution.
our results suggest that trnalys-derived sines are a significant source for microsatellite generation in carnivores, especially for ag and a-rich repeat motifs.
finally, due to their higher complexity and lower potential informative content of microsatellites associated with trnalys-derived sines, we recommend avoiding their use as genetic markers.
these observations indicate two modes of microsatellite generation: the expansion and variation of pre-existing tandem repeats and the conversion of sequences with high cryptic simplicity into a repeat array; mechanisms which are not specific to trnalys-derived sines.
moreover, microsatellites associated with trnalys-derived sines showed the highest complexity and less potential instability.
