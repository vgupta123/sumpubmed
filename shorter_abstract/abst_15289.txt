the highly conserved hydrophobic leu or phe residues at the center of the pentapeptide repeats are known as i sites, and loss-of-function mutations included replacement of the i site hydrophobic residues with charged residues, replacing the i- <dig> site, n-terminal to the i residues, with bulky side-chain residues, introducing pro into the β-helix coil, deletion of the n- and c-termini, and excision of a central coil.
the hydrophobic core and the β-helix backbone conformation are important for maintaining the quinolone resistance property of qnr proteins.
many of the qnr mutants lost their quinolone resistance function.
molecular dynamics simulations and homology modeling demonstrated that qnrc overall adopts a stable β-helix fold and shares more similarities with mfpa than with other prp structures.
of the pentapeptides of qnrc, two-thirds adopted a type ii β-turn, while the rest adopted type iv turns.
qnr proteins confer quinolone resistance, and belong to the pentapeptide repeat protein  family.
several prp crystal structures have been solved, but little is known about the functional significance of their structural arrangement.
a gap exists between coil  <dig> and coil  <dig> in the qnrc model structure, introducing a structural flexibility that is similar to that seen in mfpa.
