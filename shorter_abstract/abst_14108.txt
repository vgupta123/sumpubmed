deciphering cis-regulatory networks has become an attractive yet challenging task.
using promoter sequences and gene expression profiles as input, rather than clustering the genes by the expression data, our method utilizes co-expression neighborhood information for each individual gene, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of current clustering based models which may miss specific information for individual genes.
since this method is simple and gene-specific, it can be readily utilized for insufficiently studied species or flexibly used as an additional step or data source for previous transcription regulatory networks discovery models.
this paper presents a simple method for cis-regulatory network discovery which aims to avoid some of the common problems of previous approaches.
furthermore, the top ranked gene-motif regulatory clusters are evidently functionally co-regulated, and the regulatory relationships between the motifs and the enriched biological functions can often be confirmed by literature.
applications on saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis have shown that our method has a good prediction accuracy and outperforms a phylogenetic footprinting approach.
