performance of the rye5k snp array was investigated by genotyping  <dig> rye inbred lines including the five lines used for sequencing, and five barley, three wheat, and two triticale accessions.

the improvement of agricultural crops with regard to yield, resistance and environmental adaptation is a perpetual challenge for both breeding and research.
to overcome this limitation we sequenced the transcriptomes of five winter rye inbred lines using roche/ <dig> gs flx technology.
exploration of the genetic potential and implementation of genome-based breeding strategies for efficient rye  cultivar improvement have been hampered by the lack of genome sequence information.
a balanced distribution of allele frequencies ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  was observed.
residual heterozygosity of the rye inbred lines varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with higher average heterozygosity in the pollen compared to the seed parent pool.
the established sequence and molecular marker resources will improve and promote genetic and genomic research as well as genome-based breeding in rye.
