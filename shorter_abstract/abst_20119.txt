the computational burden of searching for interactions is compounded by the extremely low threshold for identifying significant p-values due to multiple hypothesis testing corrections.
we constructed pairs of esnps and snps located in the target genes whose expression is regulated by esnps.
the results show our approaches outperform the traditional single locus approaches in detecting genes that previously did not reach significance; the results also provide novel drug targets and biomarkers relevant to the underlying mechanisms of disease.
we present four approaches to detect interactions associated with complex diseases.
utilizing prior biological knowledge to restrict the set of candidate snp pairs to be tested can alleviate this problem, but systematic studies that investigate the relative merits of integrating different biological frameworks and gwas data have not been conducted.
using previously published gwas data for type  <dig> diabetes  and the biologically based pair-wise interaction modeling, we identify twelve genes not seen in the previous single locus analysis.
interactions among genomic loci  have been suggested as one of the potential sources of missing heritability in single locus analysis of genome-wide association studies .
