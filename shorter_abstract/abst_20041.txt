there were also no significant differences in t2wi lesion volume, dwi lesion volume, pwi lesion volume, or ttc staining infarct volume between the two groups .
furthermore, both the bederson score and garcia score, which are used for neurological assessment, were also similar .
the unicar and bicar groups each included  <dig> rats.
at baseline, the average po <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , for the unicar and bicar groups, respectively .
changes in po <dig>  as well as other physiological parameters measured within the ischemic lesion, were similar between the unicar and bicar groups during  <dig> min of mcao and the first  <dig> min of reperfusion .
this study was designed to comprehensively compare the two reperfusion methods to determine if there are any differences in outcomes.
there are two widely used transient middle cerebral artery occlusion  methods, which differ in the use of unilateral or bilateral carotid artery reperfusion .
