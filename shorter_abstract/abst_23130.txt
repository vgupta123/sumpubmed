bioinformatic analysis showed that scgb1a <dig> genes differ from each other by  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, and that they code for different proteins.
airway fluid and lung tissue of horses with recurrent airway obstruction , a chronic inflammatory lung disease affecting mature horses similar to environmentally induced asthma of humans, have reduced total scgb 1a <dig> concentration.
analysis of scgb1a <dig> and scgb1a1a sequences by endpoint-limiting dilution pcr identified a consistent difference affecting 3 bp within exon  <dig>  which served as a gene-specific “signature”.
however, analysis of the equine genome suggested that horses might have multiple scgb1a <dig> gene copies.
secretoglobin 1a <dig> , also called clara cell secretory protein, is the most abundantly secreted protein of the airway.

non-ciliated lung epithelial cells produce scgb 1a <dig> during inhalation of noxious substances to counter airway inflammation.
assessment of gene- and organ-specific expression by semiquantitative rt-pcr of  <dig> tissues showed strong expression of scgb1a <dig> and scgb1a1a in lung, uterus, fallopian tube and mammary gland, which correlated with detection of scgb 1a <dig> protein by immunohistochemistry.
significantly altered expression of the ratio of scgb1a1a to scgb1a <dig> was detected in rao-affected animals compared to controls, suggesting different roles for scgb 1a <dig> and scgb 1a1a in this inflammatory condition.
we identified three scgb1a <dig> gene copies on equine chromosome  <dig>  contained within a 512-kilobase region.
the scgb1a1p gene had most inter-individual variability and contained a non-sense mutation in many animals, suggesting that scgb1a1p has evolved into a pseudogene.
