an important variability of contractile and metabolic properties between muscles has been highlighted.
in ra muscle, contractile and metabolic properties appeared to be less well-correlated than in the two other muscles.
in the literature, the majority of studies on beef sensorial quality concerns m. longissimus thoracis.
m. rectus abdominis  is easy to sample without huge carcass depreciation and may appear as an alternative to m. longissimus thoracis for fast and routine physicochemical analysis.
it was considered interesting to assess the muscle fibres of m. rectus abdominis in comparison with m. longissimus thoracis  and m. triceps brachii  on the basis of metabolic and contractile properties, area and myosin heavy chain isoforms  proportions.
oxidative enzyme activities were higher in ra than in lt muscle, whereas glycolytic enzyme activity was lower.
consequently the classification based on atpase and sdh activities seemed inappropriate, since the fog fibres presented rather low sdh activity in this muscle in comparison to the other muscles of the carcass.
ra muscle had a higher proportion of i fibres than tb and lt muscles, balanced by a lower proportion either of iix fibres  or of iia fibres .
ra muscle has some particularities in comparison to the lt and tb muscles, especially concerning the unusual large cross-section surface of so fibres and the very low oxidative activity of intermediate iia fibres.
ra muscle had higher mean fibre areas  than the two other muscles.
the reverse was observed in tb muscle .
however, both oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were lower in ra than in tb muscle, although the ldh/icdh ratio was higher in ra muscle .
in ra muscle, the slow-oxidative fibres were the largest  and the fast-glycolytic the smallest .
in ra muscle, the distinction between fast-oxidative-glycolytic and fast-glycolytic fibres appeared difficult or impossible to establish, unlike in the other muscles.
