phylogenetic heuristics are used to search stochastically for the best-scoring trees in tree space.
ultimately, improved performance measures lead to better phylogenetic heuristics and will result in better approximations of the true evolutionary history of the organisms of interest.
overall, pauprat identifies more diverse trees than rec-i-dcm <dig>
our results show that although pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> find the trees with the same best scores, topologically these trees are quite different.
in addition to our heatmap visualizations of using parsimony scores and the robinson-foulds distance to compare best-scoring trees found by the two heuristics, we also develop entropy-based methods to show the diversity of the trees found.
furthermore, the rec-i-dcm <dig> trees cluster distinctly from the pauprat trees.
we develop new techniques to evaluate phylogenetic heuristics based on both tree scores and topologies to compare pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig>  two popular maximum parsimony search algorithms.
overall, our work shows that there is value to comparing heuristics beyond the parsimony scores that they find.
evolutionary trees are family trees that represent the relationships between a group of organisms.
