the find  platform presented here provides a powerful, user-friendly environment for analysis of flow cytometry data as well as providing a common platform for implementation and distribution of new automated analysis techniques to users around the world.
flow cytometry is a process by which cells, and other microscopic particles, can be identified, counted, and sorted mechanically through the use of hydrodynamic pressure and laser-activated fluorescence labeling.
fortunately, the field of data mining provides many tools for automated group classification of multi-dimensional data, and many algorithms have been adapted or created for flow cytometry.
we have developed a new software application for analysis of multi-color flow cytometry data.
we also make available a simple plugin system that enables researchers to implement and share their data analysis and classification/population discovery algorithms.
with this software, users can easily load single or multiple data sets, perform automated event classification, and graphically compare results within and between experiments.
