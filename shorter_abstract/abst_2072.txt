molecular analysis has been frequently used in the study of hcv outbreaks and transmission chains; helping identify a cluster of sequences as linked by transmission if their genetic distances are below a previously defined threshold.
the use of next-generation sequencing immensely increases the sensitivity of transmission detection but brings a considerable computational challenge because all sequences need to be compared among all pairs of samples.
we applied these three filters on a set of samples that cover the spectrum of genetic relationships among hcv cases, from being part of the same transmission cluster, to belonging to different subtypes.
our three-step filtering strategy rapidly removes  <dig> % of all the pairwise sample comparisons and  <dig> % of all pairwise sequence comparisons, accurately establishing which pairs of hcv samples are below the relatedness threshold.
we developed a three-step strategy that filters pairs of samples according to different criteria:  a k-mer bloom filter,  a levenhstein filter and  a filter of identical sequences.
we present a fast and efficient three-step filtering strategy that removes most sequence comparisons and accurately establishes transmission links of any threshold-based method.
this highly efficient workflow will allow a faster response and molecular detection capacity, improving the rate of detection of viral transmissions with molecular data.
however, hcv exists as a population of numerous variants in each infected individual and it has been observed that minority variants in the source are often the ones responsible for transmission, a situation that precludes the use of a single sequence per individual because many such transmissions would be missed.
outbreaks of hepatitis c virus  infections associated with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to blood are difficult to detect and investigate.
