because of the female heterogamety in all candidate snp loci, we report for the first time that pistachio has a zz/zw sex determination system.
as the reported female-to-male segregation ratio is 1: <dig> in all known segregating populations and there is no previous report of super-female genotypes or female heteromorphic chromosomes in pistachio, it appears that the ww genotype is not viable.
sex-linked snp markers were identified and validated in a large germplasm and proved their suitability for mas in pistachio.
for the first time in dioecious pistachio, a female heterogamety zw/zz sex determination system is suggested.
eight loci could distinguish sex with 100% accuracy in pistachio.
pistachio  is a dioecious species that has a long juvenility period.
validation was performed by snapshot analysis in  <dig> mature f <dig> progenies and in  <dig> cultivars and genotypes in a germplasm collection.
the generation of sex-linked markers is likely to reduce time, labor, and costs associated with breeding programs, and will help to clarify the sex determination system in pistachio.
restriction site-associated dna  markers were used to identify sex-linked markers and to elucidate the sex determination system in pistachio.
hrm analysis successfully validated the sex-linked markers for mas.
the sex determination mechanism is presently unknown in pistachio.
therefore, development of marker-assisted selection  techniques would greatly facilitate pistachio cultivar-breeding programs.
