the results showed that although nbs1-deficient plants were viable, lacked any sign of developmental aberration and produced fertile seeds through many generations upon self-fertilisation, plants also missing the functional telomerase , rapidly, within three generations, displayed severe developmental defects.
molecular methods used for examining the length of telomeres in double homozygous mutants detected much faster telomere shortening than in plants deficient in telomerase gene alone.
we used arabidopsis thaliana to study the possible functions of the dna repair subunit, nbs <dig>  in telomere homeostasis using knockout nbs <dig> mutants.
cytogenetic inspection of cycling somatic cells revealed a very early onset of massive genome instability.
