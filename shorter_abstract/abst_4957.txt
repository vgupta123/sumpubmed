the macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig> mrna is widely expressed with the highest levels tissues found in the cerebellum, spleen and adrenal with moderate level observed in all the other examined, namely the testis, ovary, cerebral cortex, liver, heart, prostate, mammary gland, myometrium, endometrium, skin, muscle and pancreas.
strong labeling was observed in epithelial cells and stromal cells of the mammary gland.
to further characterize this estradiol-producing enzyme, we have isolated the corresponding cdna in the cynomolgus monkey , characterized its enzymatic activities and performed cellular localization using in situ hybridization.
to gain knowledge about the cellular localization of the mf17β-hsd <dig> mrna expression, we performed in situ hybridization using a 35s-labeled crna probe.
these results strongly suggest that the macaca fascicularis 17β-hsd <dig> is an essential partner of aromatase in the biosynthesis of estradiol .
it strongly suggests that in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway, the step of 17-ketoreduction comes after the step of the aromatization  which is in contrast with the hypothesis suggesting that 4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone followed by the aromatization of testosterone.
in the uterus, the labeling is detected in epithelial cells and stromal cells of the endometrium.
using hek- <dig> cells stably expressing macaca fascicularis type  <dig> 17β-hsd , we have found that the mf17β-hsd <dig> catalyzes efficiently and selectively the transformation of el into e <dig>  in analogy with the h17β-hsd <dig>  we have also quantified the mf17β-hsd <dig> mrna expression levels in a series of macaca fascicularis tissues using quantitative realtime pcr.
