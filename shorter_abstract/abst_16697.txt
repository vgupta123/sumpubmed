distilling the essential biomedical themes for a topic of interest from the relevant literature is important to both understand the importance of related concepts and discover new relationships.
the reliability of meshop annotations is assessed based on the capacity to re-derive the subset of the gene ontology annotations with equivalent mesh terms.
meshops can be visualized using word clouds, providing a succinct quantitative graphical representation of the relative importance of terms.
the mesh vocabulary, developed over 50+ years, provides a broad coverage of topics across biomedical research.
based on a hypergeometric distribution of assigned terms, meshops statistically account for the prevalence of the associated biomedical annotation while highlighting unusually prevalent terms based on a specified background.
medline®/pubmed® indexes over  <dig> million biomedical articles, providing curated annotation of its contents using a controlled vocabulary known as medical subject headings .
a web interface is provided for generating and visualizing meshops.
we introduce a novel method for determining enriched curator-assigned mesh annotations in a set of papers associated to a topic, such as a gene, an author or a disease.
