moreover, the inflammatory response to intravesical instillation of known pro-inflammatory stimuli such as e. coli lipopolysaccharide , substance p, and antigen was strongly attenuated by par1-, and to a lesser extent, by par2-deficiency.
in general, inflammation plays a role in most bladder pathologies and represents a defense reaction to injury that often times is two edged.
intravesical administration of par-activating peptides in mice leads to an inflammatory reaction characterized by edema and granulocyte infiltration.
we hypothesize that pars may link mast cell-derived proteases to bladder inflammation and, therefore, play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of cystitis.
here, we demonstrate that in addition to the mouse urinary bladder, all four pa receptors are also expressed in the j <dig> human urothelial cell line.
in particular, bladder neurogenic inflammation involves the participation of mast cells and sensory nerves.
our results reveal an overriding participation of par <dig> in bladder inflammation, provide a working model for the involvement of downstream signaling, and evoke testable hypotheses regarding the role of pars in bladder inflammation.
four pars have been cloned so far, and not only are all four receptors highly expressed in different cell types of the mouse urinary bladder, but their expression is altered during experimental bladder inflammation.
