solid sequencing of four v. vulnificus strains representing different clades  and biotypes  was used for comparative genomic analysis.
flp pili, ggdef proteins, and genomic island xii were identified as possible virulence factors because of their presence in virulent sequenced strains.
the two complete and annotated genomic dna sequences of v. vulnificus belong to strains of clade  <dig>  which is the predominant clade among clinical strains.
although the read lengths of solid genomic sequencing were only  <dig> nt, we were able to make significant conclusions about the unique and shared sequences among the genomes, including identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
we were able to glean much information about the genomic content of each strain using next generation sequencing.
vibrio vulnificus is the leading cause of reported death from consumption of seafood in the united states.
genomic comparisons also point toward the involvement of sialic acid catabolism in pathogenesis.
comparative analysis of the newly sequenced genomes to the existing reference genomes enabled the identification of  <dig>  core v. vulnificus genes shared among all six strains and  <dig> clade 2-specific genes.
clade  <dig> strains generally possess higher virulence potential in animal models of disease compared with clade  <dig>  which predominates among environmental strains.
greater than  <dig> , <dig> bases were sequenced of each strain, yielding approximately 100-fold coverage for each of the four genomes.
despite several decades of research on molecular pathogenesis, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of virulence of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen.
