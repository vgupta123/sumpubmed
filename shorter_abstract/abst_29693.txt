the design of graphie is guided by domain experts' requirements and well-known infovis mantras.
we introduce graph based histology image explorer -a visual analytics tool to explore, annotate and discover potential relationships in histology image collections within a biologically relevant context.
both of the cases showed efficient annotation and analysis of histology image collection.
histology images comprise one of the important sources of knowledge for phenotyping studies in systems biology.
by representing each image with informative features and then subsequently visualizing the image collection with a graph, graphie allows users to effectively explore the image collection.
more importantly, users can perform feature selection in an interactive way to improve the visualization of the image collection and the overall annotation process.
we demonstrated the usefulness of our visual analytics approach through two case studies.
thus, our design of graphie allows for the users to navigate and explore large collections of histology image datasets.
