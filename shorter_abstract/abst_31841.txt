a total of  <dig> p <dig> genes were assigned to  <dig> families according to standard nomenclature.
to resolve conflicting results between different clustering analyses and standard family designation, a higher order relationship was formulated.
subsequently a novel approach based on parsimony was developed to build the evolutionary models.
clan classification and a novel strategy were developed to study evolutionary history.
the core clans experienced contraction in all four fungal lineages while new clans expanded in all with exception of nc.
to elucidate the evolutionary process of cytochrome p <dig> genes in fungi with different life styles, we studied the patterns of gene gains and losses in the genomes of four filamentous ascomycetes, including two saprotrophs  and neurospora crassa ) and two plant pathogens  and magnaporthe grisea ).
the four studied fungi exhibit unprecedented diversity in their p450omes in terms of coding sequence, intron-exon structures and genome locations, suggesting a complicated evolutionary history of p450s in filamentous ascomycetes.
contraction of core clans and expansion of novel clans were identified.
the exception was the nc lineage, which exhibited pure p <dig> gene loss.
parsimonious analyses unanimously supported one species topology for the four fungi.
