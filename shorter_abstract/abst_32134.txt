cytogenetic studies suggested that the species of this genus have conservative karyotypes, with diploid numbers ranging from 2n =  <dig> to 2n =  <dig>
chromosomal painting, using whole chromosome probes from humans and saguinus oedipus, was used to establish karyotypic divergence among species of the genus cebus, including c. olivaceus, c. albifrons, c. apella robustus and c. apella paraguayanus.
this analysis demonstrated that cebus species have five conserved human associations  when compared with the putative ancestral platyrrhini karyotype.
these data corroborate previous fish results, suggesting that the genus cebus has a very similar karyotype to the putative ancestral platyrrhini.
the autapomorphies 8/15/ <dig> in c. albifrons and 12/ <dig> in c. olivaceus explain the changes in chromosome number from  <dig> to  <dig>  the association 5/16/ <dig>  which has not previously been reported in platyrrhini, was also found in c. olivaceus.
