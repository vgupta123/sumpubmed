high-throughput screening  in drug discovery involves testing a large number of compounds in a biological assay to identify active compounds.
the matlab codes for the poolhits algorithm and the corresponding decoding strategy are also provided.
in this paper, we introduce a pooling strategy called poolhits  which is based on the std algorithm.
we have produced a practical version of std algorithm for pooled drug screens.
these pooled designs, for specific experiment parameters, can be simply and efficiently created using the shifted transversal design  pooling algorithm.
a key goal of drug discovery is to increase the throughput of small molecule screens without sacrificing screening accuracy.
this pooling strategy provides both assay compression and error-correction capabilities that can both accelerate and reduce the overall cost of hts in drug discovery.
