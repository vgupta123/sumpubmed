on the contrary, the rlm <dig> locus important in the immune response towards botrytis cinerea and alternaria spp.
here, a genome-wide study of presence and diversification of cc-nb-lrr and tir-nb-lrr encoding genes, and shorter domain combinations in  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana accessions and arabidopsis lyrata, capsella rubella, brassica rapa and eutrema salsugineum are presented.
the resistance to leptosphaeria maculans  <dig>  locus confers resistance to the brassica pathogen l. maculans the causal agent of blackleg disease and has undergone conservation and diversification events particularly in b. rapa.
our genome-wide analysis of the r gene repertoire revealed a large sequence variation in the  <dig> cruciferous genomes.
has recently evolved in the arabidopsis genus.
