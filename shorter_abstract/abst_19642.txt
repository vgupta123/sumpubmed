we assessed the thermodynamic characteristics of this complex and validated the hyperthermia effect, when combined with magnetic fluid hyperthermia , on xenograft hela cells  in nude mice.
the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> particles were approximately spherical, had good dispersibility as evidenced by tem, and an average diameter of about  <dig> nm.
to reduce the limitations of conventional thermotherapy, improve therapeutic anticancer activity, reduce the toxicity of arsenic on normal tissue, and increase tissue-specific delivery, we prepared a nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex .
with different concentrations of the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex, the correspondingsuspension of magnetic particles could attain a steady temperature ranging from 42°c to 65°c when placed in amf for  <dig> min.
