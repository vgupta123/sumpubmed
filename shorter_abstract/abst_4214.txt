the results obtained from comparesvm showed that accuracy of inference method depends upon the nature of experimental condition and size of the network.
for network with nodes  and average , svm gaussian kernel outperform on knockout, knockdown, and multifactorial datasets compared to all the other inference methods.
for network with large number of nodes , choice of inference method depend upon nature of experimental condition.
predication of gene regularity network  from expression data is a challenging task.
most promising methods are based on support vector machine .

there is a need for comprehensive analysis on prediction accuracy of supervised method svm using different kernels on different biological experimental conditions and network size.
using comparesvm, we investigated and evaluated different svm kernel methods on simulated datasets of microarray of different sizes in detail.
