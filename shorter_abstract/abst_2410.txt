the possession of derived mitochondria could be an adaptation to life in hypoxic environments periodically influenced by small-scale mixing events and changing oxygen content allowing the reduction of oxygen consuming components.
quantitative data for choanoflagellates and the vertical distribution of codosiga spp.
in phylogenetic analyses the 18s rrna gene sequences branch off together with environmental sequences from hypoxic habitats resulting in a wide cluster of hypoxic codosiga relatives so far only known from environmental sequencing approaches.
strains isolated and cultivated from these habitats revealed ultrastructural peculiarities such as mitochondria showing tubular cristae never seen before for choanoflagellates, and the first observation of intracellular prokaryotes in choanoflagellates.
data from microscopical observations, supplemented by findings from previous culture-independent methods, indicate that c. balthica is likely an ecologically relevant player of baltic sea hypoxic waters.
protist communities inhabiting oxygen depleted waters have so far been characterized through both microscopical observations and sequence based techniques.
cultivation of such protists has been unsuccessful in most cases, and has never yet succeeded for choanoflagellates, even though these small bacterivorous flagellates are known to be ecologically relevant components of aquatic protist communities.
these are closely related with but well separated from c. gracilis .
