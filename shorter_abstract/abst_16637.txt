mathematical models are used to gain an integrative understanding of biochemical processes and networks.
as a case study we fitted a model of the irf <dig> gene expression circuit to time-course experimental data obtained by flow cytometry.
irf <dig> shows bimodal dynamics upon ifn stimulation.
however, compared to the wealth of computational methods used to fit and analyze deterministic models, there is only little available to quantify the exactness of the fit of stochastic models compared to experimental data or to analyze different aspects of the modeling results.

commonly the models are based on deterministic ordinary differential equations.
our results allow us to conclude that the activation of the irf <dig> promoter by the combination of irf <dig> and isgf <dig> is sufficient to explain the observed bimodal dynamics.
when molecular counts are low, stochastic formalisms like monte carlo simulations are more appropriate and well established.
the method uses a comparison of the probability density functions that are computed based on monte carlo simulations and the experimental data.
the method improves its performance by selecting parameters values after comparing the similitude between the deterministic stability of the system and the modes in the experimental data distribution.
here, we developed a method to fit stochastic simulations to experimental high-throughput data, meaning data that exhibits distributions.
