polyamines protect plants against a variety of environmental stresses.
the tomato cultivars examined exhibited different capacities for responding to salinity–alkalinity stress.
however, whether exogenous spermidine increases the tolerance of tomato seedlings via effects on chloroplast antioxidant enzymes and chlorophyll metabolism is unknown.
salinity–alkalinity stress disrupted chlorophyll metabolism and hindered uroorphyrinogen iii conversion to protoporphyrin ix.
exogenous spermidine triggers effective protection against damage induced by salinity–alkalinity stress in tomato seedlings, probably by maintaining chloroplast structural integrity and alleviating salinity–alkalinity–induced oxidative damage, most likely through regulation of chlorophyll metabolism and the enzymatic and non–enzymatic antioxidant systems in chloroplast.
in this study, we examined the effect of exogenous spermidine on chlorophyll synthesis and degradation pathway intermediates and related enzyme activities, as well as chloroplast ultrastructure, gene expression, and antioxidants in salinity–alkalinity–stressed tomato seedlings.
in addition, exogenous spermidine stabilized the chloroplast ultrastructure in stressed tomato seedlings.
exogenous spermidine also exerts positive effects at the transcription level, such as down–regulation of the expression of the chlorophyllase gene and up–regulation of the expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene.
salinity–alkalinity stress is known to adversely affect a variety of processes in plants, thus inhibiting growth and decreasing crop yield.
under salinity–alkalinity stress, exogenous spermidine alleviated decreases in the contents of total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a and b in seedlings of both cultivars following 4 days of stress.

<dig>  exogenous spermidine also alleviated the stress–induced increases in malondialdehyde content, superoxide radical generation rate, chlorophyllase activity, and expression of the chlorophyllase gene and the stress–induced decreases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, antioxidants, and expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene.
with extended stress, exogenous spermidine reduced the accumulation of δ–aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and uroorphyrinogen iii and increased the levels of protoporphyrin ix, mg–protoporphyrin ix, and protochlorophyllide, suggesting that spermidine promotes the conversion of uroorphyrinogen iii to protoporphyrin ix.
