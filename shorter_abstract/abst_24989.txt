genes of a. amazonense related to nitrogen/carbon metabolism, energy production, phytohormone production, transport, quorum sensing, antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis/motility and bacteriophytochrome biosynthesis were identified.
one important finding was that some a. amazonense genes, like the nitrogenase genes and rubisco genes, were closer phylogenetically to rhizobiales members than to species of its own order.
the species a. amazonense presents a versatile repertoire of genes crucial for its plant-associated lifestyle.
