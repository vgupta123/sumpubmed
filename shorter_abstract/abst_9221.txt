the statistics obtained using hierarchical clustering and multinomial regression analysis indicate that the genomic signature is shaped by many factors, and this may explain the varying ability to classify prokaryotic organisms below genus level.
the regression model included the cluster groups as the response variable with at content, phyla, growth temperature, selective pressure, habitat, sequence size, oxygen requirement and pathogenicity as predictors.
hierarchical clustering was performed on the outcome of the comparisons before a multinomial regression model was fitted.
many significant factors were associated with the genomic signature, most notably at content.
recently there has been an explosion in the availability of bacterial genomic sequences, making possible now an analysis of genomic signatures across more than  <dig> hundred different bacterial chromosomes, from a wide variety of environments.
using genomic signatures, we pair-wise compared  <dig> different genomic dna sequences, taken from chromosomes and plasmids more than  <dig>  base-pairs in length.
small improvements to the regression model, although significant, were also obtained by factors such as sequence size, habitat, growth temperature, selective pressure measured as oligonucleotide usage variance, and oxygen requirement.
