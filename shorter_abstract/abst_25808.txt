comparative sequence alignments revealed septin derivatives of already known g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> gtpase motifs, four new motifs from two to twelve amino acids long and six conserved single amino acid positions.
one of these new motifs is septin-specific and several are group specific.
septins are cytoskeletal gtpase proteins first discovered in the fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae where they organize the septum and link nuclear division with cell division.
previous studies suggested that many animal septins fell into independent evolutionary groups, confounding cross-kingdom comparison.
our studies provide an evolutionary history for this important family of proteins and a framework and consistent nomenclature for comparison of septin orthologs across kingdoms.
group  <dig>  contains sequences from filamentous fungi.
