the dissociation constants are correlated to both the aβ42/aβ <dig> ratio and the mean age of disease onset in ad patients.
using synthetic peptides derived from the app-tm domain, we show that this segment is capable of forming stable transmembrane dimers.
amyloid precursor protein  is enzymatically cleaved by γ-secretase to form two peptide products, either aβ <dig> or the more neurotoxic aβ <dig>  the aβ42/ <dig> ratio is increased in many cases of familial alzheimer's disease .
we also show that these tm-peptides reduce aβ production and aβ42/aβ <dig> ratios when added to hek <dig> cells overexpressing the swedish fad mutation and γ-secretase components, potentially revealing a new class of γ-secretase inhibitors.
we find that fad-app mutations destabilize the app-tm dimer and increase the population of app peptide monomers.
a model of a dimeric app-tm domain reveals a putative dimerization interface, and interestingly, majority of fad mutations in app are localized to this interface region.
