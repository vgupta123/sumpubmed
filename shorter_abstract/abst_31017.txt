using robust regression helps to reject inconsistently behaving data points.
we also show the results for some real measurement data.
the simulation results clearly show that when the sampling of time series gets more and more uneven, the methods that assume even sampling become unusable.
in practice many biological time series measurements, including gene microarrays, are conducted at time points that seem to be interesting in the biologist's opinion and not necessarily at fixed time intervals.
to tackle the problems of uneven sampling and unknown type of noise in periodicity detection, we propose to use robust regression.
the aim of this paper is to develop a general framework for robust periodicity detection and review and rank different approaches by means of simulations.
the regression based formulation of the periodicity detection problem easily adapts to non-uniform sampling.
since uneven sampling occurs often in biological measurements, the robust methods developed in this paper are expected to have many uses.
