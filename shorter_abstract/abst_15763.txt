three expression patterns were confirmed in ghhsfs when cotton plants were exposed to high temperature for 1 h. ghhsf <dig> exhibited the most immediate response to heat shock.
the expression patterns in different tissues in response to heat shock showed that ghhsfs are important for heat stress as well as fiber development.
heat shock transcriptional factors  play important roles in the processes of biotic and abiotic stresses as well as in plant development.
est assembly and genome-wide analyses were applied to clone and identify heat shock transcription factor  genes in upland cotton .
comparative genome analysis showed that upland cotton d-subgenome contains  <dig> hsf members, and that the whole genome of upland cotton contains more than  <dig> hsf genes due to genome duplication.
due to continuous high temperature and intermittent drought, heat stress is becoming a handicap to improve cotton yield and lint quality.
these results provide an improved understanding of the roles of the hsf gene family during stress responses and fiber development.
forty ghhsf genes were cloned, identified and classified into three main classes  according to the characteristics of their domains.
in order to analyze the functions of different hsfs at the genome-wide level, detailed characterization and analysis of the hsf gene family in g. hirsutum is indispensable.

analysis of gene duplications showed that ghhsfs have occurred more frequently than reported in plant genomes such as arabidopsis and populus.
comparative analysis of hsfs expression differences between the wild-type and fiberless mutant suggested that hsfs are involved in fiber development.
