source code is available to develop similar websites for other organisms .
further tool utility is possible by incorporating large variants and phenotypic data , and an assessment of genotype-phenotype associations.
phylogenetic-based classification of m. tuberculosis and other bacterial genomes is a core analysis for studying evolutionary hypotheses, disease outbreaks and transmission events.
we have developed a web-based tool called phytb  to assist phylogenetic tree visualisation and identification of m. tuberculosis clade-informative polymorphism.
the utility of the phytb is demonstrated on sequence data from  <dig>  m. tuberculosis isolates.
phytb contextualises m. tuberculosis genomic variation within epidemiological, geographical and phylogenic settings.
whole genome sequencing is providing new insights into the genomic variation underlying intra- and inter-strain diversity, thereby assisting with the classification and molecular barcoding of the bacteria.
