the structure filter is implemented as a pipeline with both a graphical interface via the elm resource  and through a web service protocol.
the elm structure filter will aid users assessing candidate motifs presenting in globular structural regions.
a combined score yields 3-fold enrichment for functional motifs assigned to high confidence classifications and  <dig> -fold enrichment for random motifs assigned to low confidence classifications.
many proteins are highly modular, being assembled from globular domains and segments of natively disordered polypeptides.
linear motifs, short sequence modules functioning independently of protein tertiary structure, are most abundant in natively disordered polypeptides but are also found in accessible parts of globular domains, such as exposed loops.
candidate motifs can then be scored for solvent-accessibility and secondary structure context.
we present a method considering accessibility and secondary structural context derived from experimentally solved protein structures to rectify this situation.
the scores are calibrated on a benchmark set of experimentally verified motif instances compared with a set of random matches.
the prediction of novel occurrences of known linear motifs attempts the difficult task of distinguishing functional matches from stochastically occurring non-functional matches.
new occurrences of known linear motifs require experimental validation as the bioinformatics tools currently have limited reliability.
