finally, we highlighted several transcription regulators and specifically expressed genes that likely play an important role in early folliculogenesis.
successful early folliculogenesis is crucial for female reproductive function.
collectively, our data advance our understanding of early folliculogenesis in mono-ovulating species and will be a valuable resource for unraveling human ovarian dysfunction such as premature ovarian failure .
it requires appropriate gene specific expression of the different types of ovarian cells at different developmental stages.
we used a laser capture microdissection method combined with rna-seq technology to explore the transcriptome in oocytes and granulosa cells  during development of the sheep ovarian follicle.
to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of transcriptomes derived from in vivo oocytes and gcs at key stages in early follicular development in sheep.
in mono-ovulating species, few studies have addressed gene expression profiles and mainly concerned human oocytes.
we first documented the expression profile of  <dig>  <dig> genes, then focused on the  <dig>  <dig> genes showing differential expression between oocytes and gcs.
