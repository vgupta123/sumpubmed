exposure to dietary wheat proteins in genetically susceptible individuals has been associated with increased risk for the development of type  <dig> diabetes .
taken together, the results indicate that a diverse group of globulins exists in wheat, some of which could be associated with the pathogenesis of t1d in some susceptible individuals.
to investigate the genomic origin of the identified wheat protein cdna, a hexaploid wheat genomic library from glenlea cultivar was screened.
the glo-3a gene shared 99% identity with the cdna of wp <dig> at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, indicating that we have identified the gene encoding wheat protein wp <dig>  southern analysis revealed the presence of multiple copies of glo-3-like sequences in all wheat samples, including hexaploid, tetraploid and diploid species wheat seed.
recently, a wheat protein encoded by cdna wp <dig> has been shown to be antigenic in mice, rats and humans with autoimmune t1d.
