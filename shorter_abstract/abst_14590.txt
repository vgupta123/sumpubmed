when the molecular recognition element interacts with the analyte of interest and undergoes a conformational change, the ratiometric emission of the construct is altered due to a change in the fret efficiency.
this effort involved the construction and screening of  <dig> distinct libraries: a domain library that included several engineered binding domains isolated by phage-display; a lower-resolution linker library; and a higher-resolution linker library.
the sensitivity of such biosensors is proportional to the change in ratiometric emission, and so there is a pressing need for methods to maximize the ratiometric change of existing biosensor constructs in order to increase the breadth of their utility.
application of this library screening methodology led to the identification of an optimized h3k27-trimethylation biosensor that exhibited an emission ratio change  that was  <dig>  Ã— improved relative to that of the initially constructed biosensor .
