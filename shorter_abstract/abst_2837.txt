these results extend our understanding of human shbg gene transcription, and raise new and important questions regarding the role of novel alternatively spliced transcripts, their function in hormonally responsive tissues including the breast and prostate, and the role that aberrant shbg gene expression may play in cancer.
transcriptional expression patterns were generated for human prostate, breast, testis, liver, and brain, and the lncap, mcf- <dig>  and hepg <dig> cell lines.
alternative splicing was more pronounced in the cancer cell lines.
the shbg gene was previously shown to express a second major transcript of unknown function, derived from an upstream promoter , and two minor transcripts.
initial findings reveal the existence of a smaller immunoreactive shbg species in lncap, mcf- <dig>  and hepg <dig> cells.
we report that transcriptional expression of the human shbg gene is far more complex than previously described.
each expresses the shbg transcript, albeit in varying abundance.
