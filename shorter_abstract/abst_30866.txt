fbratio was used to model wild-type metabolism and metabolically engineered strains of c. acetobutylicum where only flux ratio constraints and thermodynamic reversibility of reactions were required.
five flux ratio constraints were required to achieve a qualitative picture of wild-type metabolism for c. acetobutylicum for the production of:  acetate,  lactate,  butyrate,  acetone,  butanol,  ethanol,  co <dig> and  h <dig>  results of this simulation study coincide with published experimental results and show the knockdown of the acetoacetyl-coa transferase increases butanol to acetone selectivity, while the simultaneous over-expression of the aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase greatly increases ethanol production.
a new method called “flux balance analysis with flux ratios ” was developed in this research and applied to a new genome-scale model of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  that contains  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> reactions.
the method was effective for modeling wild-type and engineered strains of c. acetobutylicum.
fbratio is a promising new method for constraining genome-scale models using internal flux ratios.
the fbratio approach allowed solutions to be found through standard linear programming.
however, few modeling approaches offer predictive capabilities to evaluate potential metabolic engineering strategies in silico.
