chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing of protein-bound dna fragments  is an effective high-throughput methodology for the identification of context specific dna fragments that are bound by specific proteins in vivo.
we introduce a nonparametric method for scoring consensus regions of aligned immunoprecipitated dna fragments when appropriate control experiments are available.
our method uses local models for null binding; these are necessary because binding prediction scores based on global models alone fail to properly account for specialized features of genomic regions and chance pull downs of specific dna fragments, thus disproportionally rewarding some genomic regions and decreasing prediction accuracy.
we test prediction performance by comparing analyses of chip-seq, chip-chip, motif-based binding-site prediction, and shrna assays, showing high reproducibility, binding-site enrichment in predicted target regions, and functional regulation of predicted targets.
