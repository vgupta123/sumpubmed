our results indicated that pcd occurred systematically and progressively and may play an important role in the control of self-pruning of citrus.
self-pruning plays an important role in citrus floral bud initiation.
citrus shoot tips abscise at an anatomically distinct abscission zone  that separates the top part of the shoots into basal and apical portions .
in this study, the hallmarks of programmed cell death  were identified by tunel experiments, transmission electron microscopy  and histochemical staining for reactive oxygen species  during self-pruning of the spring shoots in sweet orange.

these results strongly suggest that abscission layers activate both catabolic and anabolic wall modification pathways during the self-pruning process.
therefore, several key flowering homologs of arabidopsis and tomato shoot apical meristem  activity genes were investigated in sweet orange by real-time pcr and in situ hybridization, and the results indicated that these genes were preferentially expressed in sam as well as axillary meristem.
based on these findings, a model for sweet orange spring shoot self-pruning is proposed, which will enable us to better understand the mechanism of self-pruning and abscission.
microarray analysis was used to examine transcriptome changes at three stages of self-pruning, and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified.
some genes were related to pcd, while others were associated with cell wall biosynthesis or metabolism.
