we used bisulfite sequencing to quantify dna methylation in peripheral blood samples collected from  <dig> ocd patients and  <dig> healthy controls.
we measured dna methylation in the peripheral blood, which prevented us from drawing any conclusions about processes in the central nervous system.
to our knowledge, this is the first study investigating dna methylation of the oxtr in ocd.
further studies are needed to evaluate the roles that dna methylation and oxytocin play in ocd.
the aim of this study was to investigate methylation in two targets sequences located in the exon iii of the oxytocin receptor gene , in ocd patients and healthy controls.
obsessive–compulsive disorder  is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 3% of the general population.
we found that the level of methylation of the cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in two targets sequences analyzed was greater in the ocd patients than in the controls.
the higher methylation in the ocd patients correlated with ocd severity.
