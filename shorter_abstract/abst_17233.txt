these features have precluded the analysis of archived blood samples and require the presence of laboratories in close proximity to the collection of field samples for optimal pre-cryopreservation sample preparation.
because parasitemias are typically low and the parasite cannot be readily cultured, on-site leukocyte depletion of blood samples is typically needed to remove human dna that may be 1000x more abundant than parasite dna.
here we show that in-solution hybridization capture can be used to extract p. vivax dna from human contaminating dna in the laboratory without the need for on-site leukocyte filtration.
with this method, we obtained greater than 5x coverage across 93% of the p. vivax genome for four p. vivax strains from iquitos, peru, which is similar to our results using leukocyte filtration .
using a whole genome capture method, we were able to enrich p. vivax dna from bulk genomic dna from less than  <dig> % to a median of 55% .
malaria caused by plasmodium vivax is an experimentally neglected severe disease with a substantial burden on human health.
whole genome analysis methods on patient-derived material are thus likely to have a substantial impact on our understanding of p. vivax pathogenesis and epidemiology.
this level of enrichment allows for efficient analysis of the samples by whole genome sequencing and does not introduce any gross biases into the data.
the whole genome capture technique will enable more efficient whole genome analysis of p. vivax from a larger geographic region and from valuable archived sample collections.
