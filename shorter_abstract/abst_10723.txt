such species interactions, induced by climate changes, may bring new genetic material to the marginal populations where species tend to experience more extreme climatic conditions at the margins of the species distribution.
climate oscillations during the quaternary period and the response of a species in range shifts likely led to repeated contacts with the gene pools of ecologically distinct relatives.
we sampled two closely related rubus species, one temperate  and the other subtropical  near their joint species boundaries in southern japan.
the margins of a species’ range might be located at the margins of a species’ niche, and in such cases, can be highly vulnerable to climate changes.
they, however, may also undergo significant evolutionary changes due to drastic population dynamics in response to climate changes, which may increase the chances of isolation and contact among species.
such species interactions induced by climate changes could then regulate or facilitate further responses to climatic changes.
we hypothesized that climate changes lead to species contacts and subsequent genetic exchanges due to differences in population dynamics at the species boundaries.
conversely, populations at the current northern limit of r. grayanus diverged relatively recently and likely represent young outposts of a northbound range shift.
at the contact zones on yakushima , where the two species are parapatrically distributed, we tested hybridization along altitudinal gradients.

coalescent analysis suggested that the southernmost populations of r. palmatus predated the lgm .
backcrosses and advanced-generation hybrids likely generated the clinal hybrid zones along altitudinal gradients on the island where the two species are currently parapatrically distributed.
coalescent analysis, based on molecular data and ecological niche modelling during the last glacial maximum , were used to infer past population dynamics.
