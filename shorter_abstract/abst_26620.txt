we describe features and improvements of rewritten blast software and introduce new command-line applications.
there are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.
the new blast command-line applications, compared to the current blast tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences.
we have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.
for long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing cpu time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes.
a new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources.
we introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options.
the strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the ncbi blast web site.
the program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the blast databases.
while basic local alignment search tool  outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current blast software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences.
