these arrays are being increasingly used to study the associated processes of transcription, transcription factor binding, chromatin structure and their association.
this enables segmentation of the response based on protein-coding and non-coding regions; for genes the methodology also partitions differential response with a 5' versus 3' versus intra-genic bias.
a co-localization of differential binding between rna polymerase ii and tetra-acetylated histone has been quantified at a p-value <  <dig> ; it is most significant at the 5' end of genes, at a p-value < 10- <dig>  the prototype r code has been made available as supplementary material .
the time-course experiment, which comprises an in-vivo system and the proposed analyses, is used to determine if annotated and un-annotated portions of genome manifest coordinated differential response to the induced developmental program.
we have proposed a novel approach, based on a piece-wise function â€“ to analyze genome-wide differential response.
the algorithm built upon the framework of significance analysis of microarrays, uses a generalized logic to define regions/patterns of coordinated differential change.
