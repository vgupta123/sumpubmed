in the current study, we sought to establish whether administration routes of colostrum supplemented with avian igy affected passive immunity in calves.
calves fed colostrum containing egg yolk had higher levels of tp, alb, and igg, along with increased ggt activity.
immunoglobulin y , derived from chicken egg yolk, has been used in the prevention and control of diseases affecting calves because it is very similar in structure and function to immunoglobulin g .
our results suggest that supplementing colostrum with egg yolk has a beneficial effect when given to calves, regardless of administration route.
colostrum is rich in immunoglobulins  and its consumption results in the transfer of passive immunity to calves.
