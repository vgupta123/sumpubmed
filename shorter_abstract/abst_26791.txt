we also analyzed exon-intron features, transcriptional variants and protein structure and isoforms, and modality and patterns of expression in various tissues and developmental stages.
the human hsp70-gene family has an unknown number of members ; some have been described but the information is incomplete and inconsistent.
the human hsp70-gene family is characterized by a remarkable evolutionary diversity that mainly resulted from multiple duplications and retrotranspositions of a highly expressed gene, hspa <dig>  human hsp <dig> proteins are clustered into seven evolutionary groups, with divergent c-terminal domains likely defining their distinctive functions.
these functions may also be further defined by the observed differences in the n-terminal domain.
nine proteins were typical hsp70s  with abd and sbd, two were lighter lacking partly or totally the sbd, and six were heavier  with divergent c-terminal domains.
evolutionary analyses, including human hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes, and other eukaryotic hsp <dig> genes, showed that six human genes encoding cytosolic hsp70s and  <dig> pseudogenes originated from retro-transposition of hspa <dig>  a gene highly expressed in most tissues and developmental stages.
hsp <dig> chaperones are required for key cellular processes and response to environmental changes and survival but they have not been fully characterized yet.
