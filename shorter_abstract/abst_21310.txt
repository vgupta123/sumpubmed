the explants can be cultured for up to two weeks, they form the full repertoire of intestinal epithelial cell types  and the method for gene introduction into the epithelium is efficient and reliable.
over a few days of culture, differentiation markers appear characteristic of absorptive epithelium , goblet cells , enteroendocrine cells  and paneth cells .
three different approaches were tested to express genes in the developing cultures: transfection, electroporation and adenoviral infection.
this enables reliable delivery of genes into epithelial cells.
study of the normal development of the intestinal epithelium has been hampered by a lack of suitable model systems, in particular ones that enable the introduction of exogenous genes.
we describe a new in vitro culture system for the small intestine of the mouse embryo that recapitulates its normal development.
the system both provides a model for studying normal development of the intestinal epithelium and also allows for the manipulation of gene expression.
the criteria for a reliable culture system include the ability to perform real time observations and manipulations in vitro, the preparation of wholemounts for immunostaining and the potential for introducing genes.
however the efficiency of adenovirus infection can be greatly improved by a limited enzyme digestion, which makes accessible the lateral faces of cells bearing the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor.
production of such a system would advance our understanding of normal epithelial development and help to shed light on the pathogenesis of intestinal neoplasia.
