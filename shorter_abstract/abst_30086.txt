to find the functional linkage between ttg and auxin in the regulation of plant development, we performed de novo assembly of the tobacco transcriptome to identify candidates of ntttg2-regulated arf genes.
the growth/developmental function of ntttg <dig> associates with differential expression of putative arf genes identified by de novo assembly of the tobacco transcriptome.
the transcriptome also contains  <dig> unigenes  related to auxin responses, including  <dig> putative arf genes.
the effects of the altered ntttg <dig> expression on expression levels of putative arf genes identified in the transcriptome suggest that ntttg <dig> functions in relation to arf transcription factors.
the role of ntttg <dig> in tobacco growth and development was studied by analyzing the biological effects of gene silencing and overexpression.
by contrast, the plant growth and development processes are promoted by ntttg <dig> overexpression.
the phytohormone auxin mediates a stunning array of plant development through the functions of auxin response factors , which belong to transcription factors and are present as a protein family comprising 10– <dig> members so far identified in different plant species.
the biological effects of the ntttg <dig> gene silencing and overexpression suggest that ntttg <dig> is an essential regulator of growth and development in tobacco.
the ntttg <dig> gene silencing causes repressive effects on vegetative growth, floral anthocyanin synthesis, flower colorization, and seed production.
the transcriptome contains a total of  <dig>  unigenes, including  <dig>  unigenes  with annotated functions and at least  <dig>  unigenes  assigned to plant growth and development.
based on quantitative analyses, the expression of the putative genes is either promoted or inhibited by ntttg <dig>
plant development is also subject to regulation by transparent testa glabra  proteins, such as ntttg <dig> that we recently characterized in tobacco nicotiana tabacum.
