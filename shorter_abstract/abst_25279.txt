parasitic protozoans possess many multicopy gene families which have central roles in parasite survival and virulence.
the number and variability of members of these gene families often make it difficult to predict possible functions of the encoded proteins.
we have combined phylogenetic and function shift analyses to study the evolution of the rifin proteins, which are antigenically variant and are encoded by the largest multicopy gene family in plasmodium falciparum.
we show that this family can be subdivided into two major groups that we named a- and b-rifin proteins.
this suggested sub-grouping is supported by a recently published study that showed that, despite the presence of the plasmodium export  motif in all rifin variants, proteins from each group have different cellular localizations during the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite.
assigning functions to protein families requires their subdivision into meaningful groups such as we have shown for the rifin protein family.
these results question the general trend of clustering large antigenically variant protein groups into homogenous families.
in the present study we show that function shift analysis, a novel technique to predict functional divergence between sub-groups of a protein family, indicates that rifins have undergone neo- or sub-functionalization.
