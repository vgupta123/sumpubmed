the fl regression has comparable power to nb regression.
we explore logistic regression as an alternative method for rna-seq studies designed to compare cases and controls, where disease status is modeled as a function of rna-seq reads using simulated and huntington disease data.
when the sample size is small or the expression levels of a gene are highly dispersed, the nb regression shows inflated type-i error rates but the classical logistic and bayes logistic  regressions are conservative.
large sample size and low dispersion generally make type-i error rates of all methods close to nominal alpha levels of  <dig>  and  <dig> .
the nb, bl, and fl regressions gain increased power with large sample size, large log <dig> fold-change, and low dispersion.
finally, we incorporate the data adaptive method in order to compare false positive rates.
however, type-i error rates are controlled after applying the data adaptive method.
we conclude that implementing the data adaptive method appropriately controls type-i error rates in rna-seq analysis.
next generation sequencing provides a count of rna molecules in the form of short reads, yielding discrete, often highly non-normally distributed gene expression measurements.

we evaluate the effect of adjusting for covariates that have an unknown relationship with gene expression.
