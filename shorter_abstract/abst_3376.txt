dynamic light scattering has been used to demonstrate that this mucin-like peptide is arranged in a conformation that is prone to aggregation at room temperature, with a melting temperature of ~40°c, which indicates a pronounced instability.
for the first time, we have attempted a recombinant expression approach in e. coli cells, in order to analyze by biochemical and biophysical techniques this important domain of the α-dystroglycan core protein.
we expressed the recombinant mucin-like domain of human α-dystroglycan in e. coli cells, and purified it as a soluble peptide of  <dig> aa.
the mucin-like peptide lacks any particular fold, as confirmed by its hydrodynamic properties and its fluorescence behavior under guanidine hydrochloride denaturation.
α-dystroglycan  is heavily glycosylated within its central mucin-like domain.
our analysis indirectly confirms the idea that the mucin-like domain of α-dystroglycan needs to be extensively glycosylated in order to reach a stable conformation.
although an altered pattern of α-dystroglycan o-mannosylation, that is not significantly changing its overall glycosylation fraction, represents the primary molecular clue behind currently known dystroglycanopathies, it cannot be ruled out that still unidentified forms of αdg-related dystrophy might originate by a more substantial reduction of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and by its consequent destabilization.
the glycosylation shell of α-dystroglycan is known to largely influence its functional properties toward extracellular ligands.
