this data suggests that the molecular and functional diversity contained in the vast native landraces remains to be explored, and that large-scale transcriptional sequencing of a presumed ancestor of the modern maize varieties represents a valuable approach to characterize the functional diversity of maize for future agricultural and evolutionary studies.
we show that recurrent  <dig> pyrosequencing of a single cdna sample is necessary to attain a thorough representation of the transcriptional universe present in maize, that can also be used to estimate transcript abundance of specific genes.
to explore, in depth, the transcriptional diversity in an ancient maize landrace, we developed a protocol to optimize the sequencing of cdnas and performed  <dig> consecutive gs20– <dig> pyrosequencing runs of a cdna library obtained from  <dig> week-old palomero toluqueño maize plants.
these gs20– <dig> runs generated over  <dig>  million reads, representing the largest amount of sequences reported from a single plant cdna library.
we estimate that  <dig> %  do not align with public ests or annotated genes, potentially representing new maize transcripts.
the protocol reported here allowed obtaining over 90% of informative sequences.
in addition, little emphasis has been given to efforts aiming at an estimation of the overall transcriptional universe found in a multicellular organism at a specific developmental stage.
following the assembly of  <dig> % of the reads in  <dig>  contigs, real-time pcr of selected genes confirmed a predicted correlation between the abundance of gs20– <dig> sequences and corresponding levels of gene expression.
comparisons of all  <dig>  million reads to the maize assembled genomic islands  provided evidence for the transcriptional activity of 11% of magis.
in some cases, deep parallel sequencing of expressed sequence tags , although not yet optimized for the sequencing of cdnas, has represented an efficient procedure for validating gene prediction and estimating overall gene coverage.
