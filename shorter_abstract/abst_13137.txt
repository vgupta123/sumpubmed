dna polymerase δ is essential for eukaryotic dna replication and also plays a role in dna repair.
we have analysed the interactions of the human p <dig> dna polymerase δ subunit with pcna and with components of the dna polymerase δ complex in vivo.
the processivity of this polymerase complex is dependent upon its interaction with the sliding clamp pcna and the polymerase-pcna interaction is largely mediated through the p <dig> polymerase subunit.
we have confirmed the p66-pcna interaction in vivo using fluorescence resonance energy transfer  techniques.
we demonstrate a functional link between pcna interaction and localisation to replication foci and show that there is a direct interaction between p <dig> and pcna in living cells during dna replication.
the dominant negative effect upon growth resulting from expression of p <dig> sub-domains confirms that the p66-pcna interaction is essential in vivo.
analysis of the c-terminal pcna binding motif shows that deletion of the qvsitgff core motif results in a reduced affinity for pcna, while deletion of a further  <dig> amino acids completely abolishes the interaction.
we have identified a functional nuclear localisation sequence and shown that localisation to replication foci is not dependent upon active nuclear import.
a reduced affinity for pcna correlates with reduced targeting to replication foci.
p <dig> is localised to sites of dna replication during s phase and to repair foci following dna damage.
co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that these interaction domains are functional in vivo.
using the two-hybrid system, we have mapped the interaction domains for binding to the p <dig> polymerase δ subunit and with pcna to the n-terminus and the c-terminus of p <dig>  respectively.
expression of egfp-p <dig> shows that it is a nuclear protein which co-localises with pcna throughout the cell cycle.
