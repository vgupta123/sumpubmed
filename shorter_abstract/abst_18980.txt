due to the increase of fungal infections and due to specific antifungal resistence patterns for different species, accurate and rapid identification has become more important.
although its <dig> size estimations on both systems differed and separate libraries had to be constructed for each system, both approaches had the same discriminatory power with regard to the  <dig> reference strains, identical identifications were obtained for 39/  <dig> clinical isolates in both laboratories and strains from  <dig> samples were correctly identified using ceq <dig>  when compared to phenotypic identification.
this approach has quite often limited discriminatory power and may require long incubation periods.
identification of yeasts with its2-pcr followed by fragment analysis can be carried out on different capillary electrophoresis systems with comparable discriminatory power.
several molecular techniques have been described for fast and reliable identification of yeast isolates, but interlaboratory exchangeability of identification schemes of molecular techniques has hardly been studied.
