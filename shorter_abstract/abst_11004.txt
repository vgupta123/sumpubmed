c) the extent of conservation of alternative splicing and alternative promoter use in the dystrophin and dystrobrevin genes; alternative splicing of dystrophin exons  <dig> and  <dig> and α-dystrobrevin exon  <dig> are conserved across vertebrates, as are the use of the dp <dig>  dp <dig> and g-utrophin promoters; the dp <dig> and dp <dig> promoters are tetrapod innovations.
members of this superfamily have been discovered in a relatively serendipitous way; we set out to compile a comprehensive description of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences from available metazoan genome sequences, validated in representative organisms by rt-pcr, or acquired de novo from key species.
although the basic shared function which is implied by the common architecture of these distantly related proteins remains unclear, it clearly permeates metazoan biology.
b) a novel vertebrate member of the dystrobrevin family, γ-dystrobrevin, an ancient branch now extant only in fish, but probably present in our own ancestors.
f) a severely restricted repertoire of dystrophin complex components in ascidians.
e) a c-terminally truncated common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin in cyclostomes.
d) the evolution of the unique n-terminus of drp <dig> and its relationship to dp <dig> and g-utrophin.
