harshlight uses a combination of statistic and image processing methods to identify three different types of defects: localized blemishes affecting a few probes, diffuse defects affecting larger areas, and extended defects which may invalidate an entire chip.
we develop a novel tool, harshlight, for the automatic detection and masking of blemishes in hdona microarray chips.
although all but the starkest blemishes are hard to find by the unaided eye, particularly in high-density oligonucleotide arrays , few tools are available to help with the detection of those defects.
