large scale transcript analysis of human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells  has never been accomplished.
we designed this study to define the transcriptome of hgmec and facilitate a better characterization of these endothelial cells with unique features.
then taking advantage of large public databases and advanced bioinformatics we compared the hgmec sage library with a sage library of non-cultured ex vivo human glomeruli  which contained endothelial cells.
these tags were filtered using a set of criteria: never before shown in kidney or any type of endothelial cell, absent in all nephron regions except the glomerulus, more highly expressed than statistically expected in hgmec.
neurogranin, a direct target of thyroid hormone action which had been thought to be brain specific and never shown in endothelial cells before, fulfilled these criteria.

serial analysis of gene expression  was used for its unbiased approach to quantitative acquisition of transcripts.
we generated a hgmec sage library consisting of  <dig>  transcript tags.
our results represent an extensive molecular characterization of hgmec beyond a mere database, underline the endothelial heterogeneity, and propose neurogranin as a potential link in the kidney-thyroid axis.
its expression in glomerular endothelium in vitro and in vivo was then verified by real-time-pcr, sequencing and immunohistochemistry.
