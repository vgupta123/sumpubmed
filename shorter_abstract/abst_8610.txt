estgs are lineage grammars, in the sense that execution of an estg program generates the corresponding lineage trees, which can be used to analyze the evolutionary and developmental history of the biological system under investigation.
notably, we show the utilization of estg for cases in which the dynamics is regulated by environmental factors, which affect the fate and rate of decisions of the different species.
here we present a language for describing population dynamics that abstracts away detailed interaction among individuals, yet captures in broad terms the effect of the changing environment, based on environment-dependent stochastic tree grammars .
we show that estgs conveniently describe population dynamics at multiple levels including cellular dynamics, tissue development and niches of organisms.
these lineage trees contain a representation of the entire events history of the system, including the dynamics that led to the existing as well as to the extinct individuals.
transition rule probabilities and rates, however, can depend on global parameters such as population size, generation count, and elapsed time.
