recombinant factor viii  is an alternative to plasma-derived fviii for the treatment of hemophilia a. however, commercial manufacturing of rfviii products is inefficient and costly and is associated to high prices and product shortage, even in economically privileged countries.
here, we evaluated the potential of transient transfection in producing rfviii in serum-free suspension hek  <dig> cell cultures and investigated the effects of different dna concentration  and repeated transfections done at 34° and 37°c.
serum-free suspension transient transfection is thus a viable option for high-yield-rfviii production.
we observed a decrease in cell growth when high dna concentrations were used, but no significant differences in transfection efficiency and in the biological activity of the rfviii were noticed.
the best condition for rfviii production was obtained with repeated transfections at 34°c using  <dig>  μg dna/ <dig> cells through which almost  <dig> iu of active rfviii was produced six days post-transfection.
