openbis enables users to collect, integrate, share, publish data and to connect to data processing pipelines.
ease of integration with data analysis pipelines and other computational tools is a key requirement for it.
openbis is currently being used by several systemsx.ch and eu projects applying mass spectrometric measurements of metabolites and proteins, high content screening, or next generation sequencing technologies.
the attributes that make it interesting to a large research community involved in systems biology projects include versatility, simplicity in deployment, scalability to very large data, flexibility to handle any biological data type and extensibility to the needs of any research domain.
