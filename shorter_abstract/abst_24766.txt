subsequently, their predictability and generalizability were evaluated by the 2-fold cross-validation and a resampling test in  <dig> independent datasets, respectively.
were used as the training set, and the log-rank test was performed to select potential signature genes.
lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
a scoring scheme was developed by the cox hazard regression model, and patients were divided into two groups based on the medians.
a set of  <dig> genes related to apoptosis execution was demonstrated to have good predictability as well as generalizability in more than  <dig> lung adenocarcinoma patients and was reproducible in  <dig> independent datasets.
in summary, we presented a new approach to identify reproducible survival predictors for lung adenocarcinoma, and the identified genes may serve as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers in the future.
in this study, we proposed an approach by identifying predictive genes through pathways.
many biomarkers have been identified for predicting survival; challenges arise, however, in translating the findings into clinical practice due to their inconsistency and irreproducibility.
