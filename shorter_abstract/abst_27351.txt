the morphologically unique structure found in ratite spermatids provides additional evidence of a possible phylogenetic link between the reptiles and birds.
a novel transient structure was observed in the spermatids of three ratite species using transmission electron microscopy.
it also endorses the basal positioning of the ratites as a monophyletic group within the avian phylogenetic tree.
it was composed of regularly-spaced finger-like projections which were closely associated with the outer nuclear membrane, giving the nucleus a cogwheel-like appearance.
the potential value of non-traditional characters, such as spermiogenesis and sperm ultrastructure, as phylogenetic markers has recently been advocated.
