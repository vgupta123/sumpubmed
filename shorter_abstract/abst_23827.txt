in this paper we show that using raw illumina data it is possible to identify, control, and perhaps correct for a range of spatial-related phenomena that affect feature-intensity extraction.
these approaches require access to the raw data from the arrays, not just the summarized data usually returned, making the acquisition of such raw data highly desirable.
finally we show that beads can be wrongly identified in the image on either a local or array-wide scale, with obvious implications for data quality.
a key stage for all microarray analyses is the extraction of feature-intensities from an image.
illumina employ random construction of their beadarrays, making feature-intensity extraction even more important for the illumina platform than for other technologies.
