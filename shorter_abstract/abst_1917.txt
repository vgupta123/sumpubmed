fluctuating degrees of introgressive hybridization between atlantic eel species are sufficient to explain temporally varying correlations of geographic and genetic distances reported for populations of the european eel.
finally, fitting an isolation-with-migration model to our data supports the hypothesis of recent asymmetric introgression and refutes the alternative hypothesis of ancient polymorphism.
hybridization, the interbreeding of diagnosably divergent species, is a major focus in evolutionary studies.
by simulating increasing proportions of both f <dig> hybrids and admixed individuals from the southern to the northern-most locations, we were able to generate highly significant isolation-by-distance patterns in both cases, reminiscent of previously published data for the european eel.
the detection of inter-species hybrids in iceland suggests on-going gene flow, but few studies to date have addressed the influence of introgression on genetic differentiation in north atlantic eels.
eels, both from north america and europe migrate through the atlantic to mate in a vast, overlapping area in the sargasso sea.
here, we show that while mitochondrial lineages remain completely distinct on both sides of the atlantic, limited hybridization is detectable with nuclear dna markers.
