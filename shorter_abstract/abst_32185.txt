the gene regulatory network appears to control cell fate decisions and morphogenesis in the vertebral column along with the prevention of premature chondrocyte differentiation thus providing a detailed molecular view of vertebral column development.
here we elucidated the role of the mammalian homeobox gene bapx <dig> during the embryogenesis of five distinct organs at e <dig>  - vertebral column, spleen, gut, forelimb and hindlimb - using expression profiling of sorted wildtype and mutant cells combined with genome wide binding site analysis.
furthermore we analyzed the development of the vertebral column at the molecular level by combining transcriptional profiling and genome wide binding data for bapx <dig> with similarly generated data sets for sox <dig> to assemble a detailed gene regulatory network revealing genes previously not reported to be controlled by either of these two transcription factors.

vertebrate organogenesis is a highly complex process involving sequential cascades of transcription factor activation or repression.
