here, we present the first evidence of the effects of overexpression of mutant  and wild type  human sod <dig> transgenes on a set of functional properties of microglia relevant to als progression, including expression of integrin β- <dig>  spreading and migration, phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cell debris, and intracellular calcium changes in response to an inflammatory stimulus.
tg sod <dig> g93a but not tg sod <dig> wt microglia had lower expression levels of the cell adhesion molecule subunit integrin β- <dig> than their ntg control cells , resulting in decreased spreading ability, with no effect on ability to migrate.
both tg g93a and tg wt microglia had reduced capacity to phagocytose apoptotic neuronal cell debris , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for ntg  cells).
extracellular stimulation of microglia with atp resulted in smaller increase in intracellular free calcium in tg g93a and tg wt microglia relative to ntg controls , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for ntg  microglia).
overexpression of mutant copper/zinc superoxide dismutase  in rodents has provided useful models for studying the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .
