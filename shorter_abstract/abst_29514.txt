svr <dig> is targeted to the chloroplast and svr <dig> single mutants have uniformly pale green leaves at 22Â°c.
our findings, on one hand, reinforce the strong genetic link between var <dig> and chloroplast translation, and on the other hand, point to a critical role of svr <dig>  and possibly some aspects of chloroplast translation, in the response of plants to chilling stress.
when svr <dig> is challenged with chilling temperature , it develops a pronounced chlorosis that is accompanied by abnormal chloroplast rrna processing and chloroplast protein accumulation.
consistent with this phenotype, most chloroplast proteins and rrna species in svr <dig> have close to normal accumulation profiles, with the notable exception of the photosystem ii reaction center d <dig> protein, which is present at greatly reduced levels.
we are characterizing second-site var <dig> genetic suppressors as means to better understand var <dig> function and to study the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis.
