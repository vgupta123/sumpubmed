mobile genetic elements  are selfish dna integrated in the genomes.
mobilomics aims at discovering all the mges in a genome and understanding their dynamic behavior: the data for this kind of investigation can be provided by comparative genomics of closely related organisms.
our approach proposes to exploit the high similarity among homologous chromosomes of different strains of the same species, following a progressive comparative genomics philosophy.
the case study indicates that the proposed methodology brings two major advantages:  it does not require any template sequence for the wanted mges and  it can be applied to infer mges also for low coverage genomes with unresolved bases, where traditional approaches are largely ineffective.
their detection is mainly based on consensus–like searches by scanning the investigated genome against the sequence of an already identified mge.
our case study is represented by a unique recently available dataset of  <dig> different strains of s.cerevisiae, which regender is able to compare in few minutes.
we introduce a software tool based on our new fast algorithm, called regender, which is able to identify the conserved regions between chromosomes.
a clustering based on the presence/absence of the candidate tys in the strains suggests an evolutionary interconnection that is very similar to classic phylogenetic trees based on snps analysis, even though it is computed without using phylogenetic information.
