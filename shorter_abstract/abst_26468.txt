most of these would have presented equal difficulties for manual interpretation of annotations.
there is a frequent need to obtain sets of functionally equivalent homologous proteins  from different species.
however, a manual analysis of five protein families confirmed a high level of performance.
our results demonstrate that the vast majority of uniprotkb/swiss-prot functional annotations are of high quality, and that fosta can interpret annotations successfully.
the method builds a candidate list of homologues and filters out functionally diverged proteins on the basis of functional annotations using a simple text mining approach.
where fosta is not successful, we are able to highlight inconsistencies in uniprotkb/swiss-prot annotation.
the information relevant to extracting feps is contained in databanks such as uniprotkb/swiss-prot and a manual analysis of these data allow feps to be extracted on a one-off basis.
however there has been no resource allowing the easy, automatic extraction of groups of feps â€“ for example, all instances of protein c.
while it is usually the case that orthology implies functional equivalence, this is not always true; therefore datasets of orthologous proteins are not appropriate.
a more extensive comparison with two manually verified functional equivalence datasets also demonstrated very good performance.
