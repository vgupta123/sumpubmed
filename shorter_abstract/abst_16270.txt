we offer an improved functional annotation of both pgsc and itag potato gene models, as well as tools that can be applied to additional pipelines and improve annotation in other organisms.

to overcome this discrepancy, we introduce a simple go structure-based algorithm that reconciles the predictions of the different pipelines.
several annotation pipelines have been developed for functional analysis based on sequence, ‘omics’, and literature data.
furthermore, we evaluate six state-of-the-art annotation pipelines and show that their predictions are markedly dissimilar .
we find that different annotation pipelines produce different results, and show how to integrate them into a unified annotation that is of higher quality than each single pipeline.
here, we used the recently sequenced potato genome as a case study.
the potato genome was selected since its genome is newly sequenced and it is a non-model plant even if there is relatively ample information on individual potato genes, and multiple gene expression profiles are available.
we show that the automatic gene annotations of potato have low accuracy when compared to a “gold standard” based on experimentally validated potato genes.
