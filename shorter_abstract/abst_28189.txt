to this end, we used a real maize dataset based on 256 f2: <dig> progenies plus a simulation data set based on 300 f <dig> individuals.
the broad participation of epistasis in the real dataset may indicate the presence of pervasive epistasis acting on maize grain yield.
the large amount of data used in genomic analysis has allowed geneticists to achieve some understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits.
in the real dataset, we estimate  <dig>  epistatic effects, and several minor epistatic combinations were found to explain a significant proportion of the genetic variance.
in this work, we propose the reversible-jump technique to estimate epistasis in the genome without drastically altering the model dimension.
the power of selecting true epistasis in thousands of possible combinations suggests the attractiveness of our model to handle genomic data
in the simulation scenario, six qtl presenting main effects  were combined with seven other epistatic effects totaling  <dig> qtl controlling the trait.
