using statistical regression methods, we investigate the sensitivity of seeds, in particular good seeds, between four cdna-to-genome comparisons at different evolutionary distances , and identify classes of comparisons that show similar seed behavior and therefore can employ the same seed.
as the number and variety of genomes increases, it becomes desirable to identify a small set of universal seeds that perform optimally or near-optimally on a large range of comparisons.
in addition, we find that with high confidence good seeds for more distant comparisons perform well on closer comparisons, within 98â€“99% of the optimal seeds, and thus represent universal good seeds.
we show for the first time that optimal and near-optimal seeds for distant species-to-species comparisons are more generally applicable to a wide range of comparisons.
