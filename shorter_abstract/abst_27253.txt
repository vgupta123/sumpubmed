the symbol height is adjusted to the information content of the alignment position.
the method has proven to be valid using a set of  <dig> aligned aquaporin sequences in which established subfamily-specific positions were readily identified by the algorithm.
subfamily logos provide an intuitive display of relevant sequence deviations.
recognition of relevant sequence deviations can be valuable for elucidating functional differences between protein subfamilies.
however, identification of such sites is tedious because automated approaches are scarce.
