in the present study, we determined the specificity and efficiency of ad vectors expressing short hairpin  rna constructs to knock-down the estrogen receptor α .
in vitro, transfection of three mouse cell lines with psuper-sherα constructs resulted in up to 80% reduction of endogenous erα activity.
the subsequently generated ad.sherα vectors were equally effective in vitro.
ad mediated transfer of sherα expression constructs results in efficient and specific knockdown of endogenous erα transcription both in vitro and in vivo.
a single mismatch in the target sequence eliminated the reduction of erα activity, demonstrating the specificity of sherα.
two different shrna constructs derived from the murine erα coding sequence were designed .
co-injection of ad.sherα with an ad vector containing a luciferase  gene driven by an estrogen responsive element  containing promoter resulted in a significant  down-regulation of hepatic luciferase activity, as determined by non-invasive optical imaging.
