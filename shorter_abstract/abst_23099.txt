we provide further genomic characterization of these genes in n. punctiforme and extend it to homologous regions in other cyanobacteria.
six putative genes in the scytonemin gene cluster , with no previously known protein function and annotated in this study as scya to scyf, are likely involved in the assembly of scytonemin from central metabolites, based on genetic, biochemical, and sequence similarity evidence.
since many of the protein product sequences for the newly described genes, including scyd, scye, and scyf, have export signal domains, while others have putative transmembrane domains, it can be inferred that scytonemin biosynthesis is compartmentalized within the cell.
genomic comparisons revealed that most scytonemin-related genes were highly conserved among strains and that two additional conserved clusters, npf <dig> to npf <dig> and a putative two-component regulatory system , are likely involved in scytonemin biosynthesis and regulation, respectively, on the basis of conservation and location.
also in this cluster are redundant copies of genes encoding for aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.
redundant copies of the genes coding for the key regulatory and rate-limiting enzymes of the shikimic acid pathway are found there as well.
we show that scytonemin biosynthetic genes are highly conserved among evolutionarily diverse strains, likely include more genes than previously determined, and are predicted to involve compartmentalization of the biosynthetic pathway in the cell, an unusual trait for prokaryotes.
these can theoretically lead to tryptophan and the tyrosine precursor, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate,  from end products of the shikimic acid pathway.
