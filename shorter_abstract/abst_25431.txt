vice versa, given a list of genes, it can be of great importance to predict which snps can be involved in the onset of a particular disease, in order to focus the research on their effects.
given a list of the most relevant snps statistically associated to a specific pathology as result of a genotype study, a critical issue is the identification of genes that are effectively related to the disease by re-scoring the importance of the identified genetic variations.
we implemented our method as a web tool called snpranker  <dig>  , improving our first published release of this system.
this system can be employed to design custom genotyping chips for disease-oriented studies and to re-score gwas results.
a user-friendly interface allows the input of a list of genes, snps or a biological process, and to customize the features set with relative weights.
possible scenarios are gwas data re-scoring, snps selection for custom genotyping arrays and snps/diseases association studies.
the proposed method relies  on the data integration of public resources using a gene-centric database design,  on the evaluation of a set of static biomolecular annotations, defined as features, and  on the snp scoring function, which computes snp scores using parameters and weights set by users.
