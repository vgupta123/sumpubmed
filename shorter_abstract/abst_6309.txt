the phylogenetic position and evolutionary relationships of fusobacteria remain uncertain.
many instances of similarity to other inhabitants of the dental plaque that have been sequenced were found.
a high number of hypothetical orfs with unusual codon usage and short lengths were found and hypothesized to be remnants of transferred genes that were discarded.
we hypothesize that at a point in time, probably associated to the rise of mammals, a strong selective pressure might have existed for a cell with a clostridia-like metabolic apparatus but with the adhesive and immune camouflage features of proteobacteria.
however, depending on the method used, 35â€“56% of fusobacterium genes appear to have a xenologous origin from bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, spirochaetes and the firmicutes themselves.
taking advantage of the recent completion of the fusobacterium nucleatum genome sequence we have examined the evolutionary relationships of fusobacterium genes by phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics tools.
the data indicate that fusobacterium has a core genome of a very different nature to other bacterial lineages, and branches out at the base of firmicutes.
