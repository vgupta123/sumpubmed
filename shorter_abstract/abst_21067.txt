the metabolically coupled replicator system is a class of simulation models built on these two functions to show that an rna world scenario for the origin of life is ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineral surfaces.
incorporating the functional divergence of template and copy into the metabolically coupled replicator system model framework we show that sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a set of metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator system remains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens the way to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotype through a primitive version of phenotype amplification.
this trade-off is the first evolutionary step towards the “division of labour” among enzymes and genes, which has concluded in the extreme form of phenotype amplification characteristic of our recent dna-rna-protein world.
the functional asymmetry of complementary rna strains results in a shift of phenotype/genotype  proportions in mcrs, favouring a slight genotype dominance.
the fact that rna templates and their copies are of complementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance: complementary strains may have very different structures and, consequently, functions – one may specialize for increasing enzymatic activity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme.
