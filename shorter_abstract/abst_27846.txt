the species most frequently found was chlamydophila  abortus  followed by c. pecorum  and c. psittaci genotype a .
c. pecorum was isolated from 2/ <dig> flocks and the presence of seroconversion was determined in 3/ <dig> flocks.
the fact that c. pecorum and the potentially zoonotic c. psittaci were found alongside the classical abortifacient agent c. abortus, raise questions about the significance of this reservoir for animal and human health and underline the necessity for regular monitoring.
the results imply that chlamydial infections occur frequently in german sheep flocks, even in the absence of elevated abortion rates.
using the german state of thuringia as a model example, the chlamydial sero- and antigen prevalence was estimated in thirty-two randomly selected sheep flocks with an average abortion rate lower than 1%.
on the basis of an estimated 25% antigen prevalence , pcr and dna microarray testing, together with sequencing revealed the presence of chlamydiae in 78% of the flocks.
assumption of a seroprevalence of 10%  at flock level, revealed that 94% of the tested flocks were serologically positive with ongoing infection  in nearly half  of the flocks.
the epidemiological situation of ovine chlamydial infections in continental europe, especially germany is poorly characterised.
