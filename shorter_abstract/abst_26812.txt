collectively, our analyses suggest that hsp sequence and expression patterns may reflect the forces of selection acting on thermal tolerance in ants and other social hymenoptera.
ants, and most likely other hymenoptera, utilize lineage-specific heat inducible hsps, whose expression patterns are associated with adaptive variation in thermal tolerance between two ant species.

we reconstructed the evolutionary history of three families of heat shock proteins , the primary molecular chaperones protecting against thermal damage, across  <dig> hymenopteran species and four other insect orders.
for the inducible homologues, the more thermally tolerant species, pogonomyrmex barbatus, had greater hsp basal expression and induction in response to heat stress than did the less thermally tolerant species, aphaenogaster picea.
our results highlight the unique evolutionary history of hsps in eusocial hymenoptera, which has been shaped by gains, losses, and changes in cis-regulation.
four out of eight hsp genes were heat-inducible and matched the predictions based on presence of conserved hses.
the eusocial hymenoptera have radiated across a wide range of thermal environments, exposing them to significant physiological stressors.
furthermore, there was no trade-off between basal expression and induction.
we tested whether hsp induction patterns in ants were associated with different thermal environments.
