shared sex-patterned snps, insertions and deletions suggest an ancestral sex-determination system that is common to both s. melanotheron and o. niloticus.
we identified a shared sex-patterned snp that alters a gata <dig> binding site near wilms tumor protein that might be responsible for sex-determination.
inversions and other structural polymorphisms often reduce the rate of recombination between sex chromosomes, making it impossible to fine map sex-determination loci using traditional genetic mapping techniques.
functional analyses are needed to evaluate shared snps near candidate genes that might play a role in sex-determination of these species.
we found that sarotherodon melanotheron segregates an xy system on lg <dig> in the same region identified in oreochromis niloticus.
here we compare distantly related species of tilapia that each segregate an xy system of sex-determination on linkage group  <dig>  we use whole genome sequencing to identify shared sex-patterned polymorphisms, which are candidates for the ancestral sex-determination mutation.
