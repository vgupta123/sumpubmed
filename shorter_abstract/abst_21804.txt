we demonstrate high accuracy and speed of the proposed methods on reads obtained using illuminaâ€™s genome analyzer ii and hiseq <dig>  in addition to performing reliable and fast base calling, the developed algorithms enable incorporation of prior knowledge which can be utilized for parameter estimation and is potentially beneficial in various downstream applications.
forward-backward and soft-output viterbi algorithms are developed, and their performance and complexity are investigated and compared with the existing state-of-the-art base calling methods for this platform.
