collectively the data indicates that bile tolerance can be enhanced in bifidobacterium and lactococcus species through rational genetic manipulation and that this can significantly improve delivery to and colonisation of the gi tract.
in vitro bile tolerance of both strains was significantly enhanced , following heterologous expression of the listeria monocytogenes bile resistance mechanism bile.
furthermore, a b. breve strain expressing bile demonstrated increased efficacy relative to the wild-type strain in reducing oral l. monocytogenes infection in mice.
