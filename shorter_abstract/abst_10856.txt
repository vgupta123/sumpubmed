canine pyoderma is a frequent, often recurrent diagnosis in pet dogs, usually attributable to secondary bacterial infection of the skin.
lesions can range in severity based on the location, total area and depth of tissue affected and antimicrobial therapy is recommended for resolution.
antimicrobial prescribing behaviour for treatment of canine pyoderma was variable but frequently appeared inconsistent with current recommendations.
this study aimed to describe patient signalment, disease characteristics and treatment prescribed in a large number of uk, primary-care canine pyoderma cases and to estimate pyoderma prevalence in the uk vet-visiting canine population.
systemic antimicrobials were prescribed for fewer than 14Â days in around 40% of study cases reviewed in detail.
of  <dig>  dogs presented to  <dig> participating practices in  <dig>   <dig>  had a pyoderma diagnosis recorded in available electronic patient record  data.
