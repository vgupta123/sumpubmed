this study was undertaken to investigate the distribution and retention of diclofenac and/or its metabolites in inflamed tissues, using the carrageenan-induced inflammation model and quantitative whole body autoradiography in rats.
three carrageenan-treated rats and one control rat were sacrificed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after diclofenac sodium administration .
the exposure, based on the areas under the tissue concentration versus time , was  <dig> and  <dig> fold higher in the inflamed neck and inflamed footpads of treated animals than in control rats; the exposures in unharmed tissues were similar in the treated and control rats, and the auc0-tlast was  <dig> fold higher in the inflamed paws than in the non inflamed footpads of the carrageenan-treated rats.
although there were theoretical considerations that mildly acidic nsaid may show some preferential distribution in inflamed tissues there was no clear experimental proof for diclofenac until the present study.
the radioactivity patterns demonstrated that diclofenac and/or its metabolites preferentially distributed into the inflamed tissues.
this animal study demonstrated that diclofenac and/or its metabolites were rapidly and preferentially taken up and retained in inflamed tissues.
a control animal received saline injections.
