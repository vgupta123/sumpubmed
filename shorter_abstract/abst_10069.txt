adipogenesis is a complex process, in which immature pre-adipocytes change morphology, micro-anatomy and physiology to become mature adipocytes.
in a previous study we analyzed changes in the abundance of free and polysomal, i.e.
we grouped mrna species into categories with respect to up- or down-regulated transcription and translation and analyzed the groups regarding specific functionalities based on gene ontology .
in the tc:unchanged/tl:up group several factors of the olfactory receptor family were identified, while in tc:unchanged/tl:down methylation and repair genes are represented.
many of them are known to contain a top motif.

notably, genes with a specific biological or molecular function tend to cluster in groups according to their transcriptional and translational regulation.
in the tc:up/tl:unchanged group we detected most of the metal binding proteins and metal transporters.
the tc:down/tl:unchanged group mainly consists of regulatory factors.
a shift towards up-regulation of gene expression in early adipogenesis was detected.
