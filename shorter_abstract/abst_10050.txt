the optics of this preparation permit high-quality and multi-channel imaging of retinal cells expressing fluorescent reporters for up to 48h.
tracking of interkinetic nuclear migration within individual cells, and changes in retinal progenitor cell morphology are described.
the explanted, developing rodent retina provides an efficient and accessible preparation for use in gene transfer and pharmacological experimentation.
an integrated approach to rodent retinal culture/transfection, live imaging, cell tracking, and analysis in structurally intact explants greatly improves our ability to assess the kinetics of cell production.
collectively, these methods provide a robust approach to assay multiple features of rodent retinal development using live imaging.
many of the features of normal development are retained in the explanted retina, including retinal progenitor cell proliferation, heterochronic cell production, interkinetic nuclear migration, and connectivity.
