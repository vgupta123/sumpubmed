these genes will enable more accurate and reliable normalization of qpcr results for gene expression studies in this important crop, the major source of natural fiber and also an important source of edible oil.
normalizing through reference genes, or housekeeping genes, can make more accurate and reliable results from reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
by the use of two distinct algorithms, implemented by genorm and normfinder, we have assessed the gene expression of nine candidate reference genes in cotton: ghact <dig>  ghef1α <dig>  ghfbx <dig>  ghpp2a <dig>  ghmza, ghptb, ghgapc <dig>  ghβtub <dig> and ghubq <dig>  the candidate reference genes were evaluated in  <dig> experimental samples consisting of six distinct plant organs, eight stages of flower development, four stages of fruit development and in flower verticils.
we have tested the expression stabilities of nine candidate genes in a set of  <dig> tissue samples from cotton plants divided into five different experimental sets.
ghact <dig> and ghubq <dig> present more stable expression during flower development, ghact <dig> and ghfbx <dig> in the floral verticils and ghmza and ghptb during fruit development.
as a result of this evaluation, we recommend the use of ghubq <dig> and ghpp2a <dig> housekeeping genes as superior references for normalization of gene expression measures in different cotton plant organs; ghact <dig> and ghubq <dig> for flower development, ghact <dig> and ghfbx <dig> for the floral organs and ghmza and ghptb for fruit development.
our analysis provided the most suitable combination of reference genes for each experimental set tested as internal control for reliable qpcr data normalization.
thus, suitable reference genes should be the first step of any qpcr analysis.
therefore qpcr studies on important crops such as cotton has been hampered by the lack of suitable reference genes.
in addition, to illustrate the use of cotton reference genes we checked the expression of two cotton mads-box genes in distinct plant and floral organs and also during flower development.
the use of bona fide reference genes allowed a detailed and accurate characterization of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of two mads-box genes in cotton.
