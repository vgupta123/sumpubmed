we found evidence for five ancestral vps <dig> introns, intron loss, and single instances of intron gain  and intron slippage .
specifically, motif i was absent in vps <dig> homologs of chromalveolates, euglenozoa, and diplomonads.
amino acid sequence analysis showed the consensus for the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs is p- -x- for motif i  and p-p-- for motif ii, and that vps <dig> may be ubiquitinated.
the amino acid sequences of  <dig> vps <dig> orthologs are aligned, compared with the known secondary structure of yeast vps25p, and used to carry out phylogenetic analysis.
two retropseudogenes were found in the chimpanzee genome, one more recently inserted, and one evolving from a common primate ancestor.
expression of mammalian vps <dig> in a wide range of tissues, and the presence in a broad range of eukaryotic species, indicates a basic role in eukaryotic cell function.
intron splice site positions were highly conserved across all major eukaryotic species, suggesting an ancestral origin.
we found that vps <dig> is a highly conserved and widely expressed eukaryotic gene, with single orthologs in chromalveolate, excavate, amoebozoan, plant, fungal and metazoan species.
intron positions were analyzed in vps <dig> from  <dig> species.
a highly conserved carboxy-terminal lysine was identified, which suggests vps <dig> is ubiquitinated.
two paralogs were found in trichomonas vaginalis.
processed pseudogenes were identified in four mammalian genomes, with a notable absence in the mouse genome.
arginine- <dig> of yeast vps25p involved in vps22p interaction was highly, but not absolutely, conserved.
we have identified  <dig> orthologs of yeast vps25p.
