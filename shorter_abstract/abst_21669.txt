the effects of chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressant  on the hippocampal transcriptome in mice displaying high and low swim stress-induced analgesia  were studied.
however, the findings also reveal that many responses to antidepressant treatments, involving the action of individual genes engaged in neurogenesis, neurotransmitter transport and neuroprotection, depend on constitutive hippocampal transcriptomic profiles and might be genotype dependent.
total rna isolated from hippocampi was used.
in ha mice, we observed the upregulation of genes involved in neurotransmitter transport, the termination of gaba and glycine activity , glutamate uptake , and the downregulation of neuropeptide y  and corticotropin releasing hormone-binding protein .
the results suggest that, when and if this becomes feasible, antidepressant treatment should take into consideration individual sensitivity to stress.
to investigate the effects of dmi treatment on gene expression profiling, whole-genome illumina expression beadchip arrays and qpcr were used.
dmi treatment affected the expression of  <dig> genes in ha mice and  <dig> genes in la mice.
we observed the upregulation of igf <dig> and the genes involved in neurogenesis  in both mouse lines.
