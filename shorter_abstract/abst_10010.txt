kinetic modeling of the enzymic reaction revealed that binding at subsites  and  had unfavorable  binding free energy changes and that the binding pocket of vhnag <dig> contains four glcnac binding subsites, designated ,,, and .
the recombinant glcnacases were found to hydrolyze all the natural substrates, vhnag <dig> being ten-fold more active than vhnag <dig>  product analysis by tlc and quantitative hplc suggested that vhnag <dig> degraded chitooligosaccharides in a sequential manner, its highest activity being with chitotetraose.
the genes encoding two new members of family- <dig> glcnacases were isolated from the genome of v. harveyi  <dig>  cloned and expressed at a high level in e. coli.
we have previously reported the structure and function of chitinase a from vibrio harveyi  <dig>  this study t reports the identification of two glcnacases from the same organism and their detailed functional characterization.
two novel glcnacases were identified as exolytic enzymes that degraded chitin oligosaccharides, releasing glcnac as the end product.
