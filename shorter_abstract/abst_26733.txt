the present study compares levels of stress hormones and mrna expression of cytokines and acute-phase proteins in blood samples of harbour porpoises exposed to different levels of stress during handling, in rehabilitation or permanent human care.
a better understanding of how anthropogenic impacts affect the behaviour, health, endocrinology, immunology and physiology of the animals is thus needed.
blood samples were investigated for catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, as well as for adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, metanephrine and normetanephrine.
the harbour porpoise is exposed to increasing pressure caused by anthropogenic activities in its marine environment.
free-ranging harbour porpoises, incidentally caught in pound nets in denmark, were compared to harbour porpoises in rehabilitation at sos dolfijn in harderwijk, the netherlands, and individuals permanently kept in human care in the dolfinarium harderwijk and fjord & belt kerteminde, denmark.
hormone and cytokine ranges showed correlations to each other and to the health status of investigated harbour porpoises.
hormone concentrations were higher in free-ranging harbour porpoises than in animals in human care.
the expression patterns of the selected molecular biomarkers of the immune system are promising to reflect the health and immune status of the harbour porpoise under different levels of stress.

biomarker expression levels varied between free-ranging animals and porpoises in human care.
mrna expression levels of relevant cell mediators  were measured using real-time pcr.
numerous offshore wind farms are planned or under construction in the north and baltic seas, which will increase underwater noise during both construction and operation.
