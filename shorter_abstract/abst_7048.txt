these analyses revealed niche preferences for both fungi.
on the other hand, there is the neutral hypothesis, which suggests that stochastic factors may explain high species diversity.
the niche partitioning of two closely related fungal endophytes, microdochium bolleyi and m. phragmitis, colonizing phragmites australis, was investigated.
the occurrences of each species were assessed using specific nested-pcr assays for  <dig> field samples of common reed from lake constance, germany.
for endophytes, such factors are difficult to identify, and are therefore in most cases unknown.
the fungal species colonizing common reed investigated in this study seem to exploit niche differences leading to a separation in space and time, which may allow for their coexistence on the same host.
a purely neutral model is unlikely to explain the coexistence of closely related endophytes on common reed.
host habitat, host organ and season, host habitat significantly differentiated the two species.
host habitat, host organ, and time of the season.
in contrast, both species exhibited a significant preference for the same host organ, i.e.
m. bolleyi preferred dry habitats, whereas m. phragmitis prevailed in flooded habitats.
