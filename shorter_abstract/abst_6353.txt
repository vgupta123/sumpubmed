carbapenem resistance, along with blakpc- <dig>  blakpc- <dig> and blavim- <dig> carbapenemase genes, was transferred by conjugative plasmids assigned to incfii, incf, and incn incompatibility groups, respectively, in filter mating experiments.
molecular analysis of beta-lactamase genes identified blakpc- <dig> and blactx-m-group  <dig> into conjugative plasmid/s assigned to incfii incompatibility group in st <dig> and st <dig> k. pneumoniae isolates, blakpc- <dig> into conjugative plasmid/s assigned to incf incompatibility group in st <dig> and st <dig> k. pneumoniae isolates, blavim- <dig> into conjugative plasmid/s assigned to incn incompatibility group in st <dig> e. coli isolates.
molecular characterization of cre isolates assigned  <dig> klebsiella pneumoniae isolates to pfge types a1-a <dig> and sequencing type   <dig>  17 k. pneumoniae isolates to pfge type a and st <dig> , 7 k. pneumoniae isolates to pfge types b or c and st <dig>  2 k. pneumoniae isolates to pfge type d and st <dig>  and  <dig> escherichia coli isolates to pfge type a and st <dig>  all k. pneumoniae st <dig> and st <dig> isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  producers and carried blactx-m- <dig> group gene; 4 k. pneumoniae st <dig> isolates were resistant to colistin.
the aim of this study was the molecular epidemiology of cre isolates in valle d’aosta region, italy, and the mechanism of carbapenem resistance.
carbapenem resistance gene transfer was performed by filter mating, plasmids from parental and transconjugant strains were assigned to incompatibility groups by pcr-based replicon typing.
the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae  is an emerging clinical problem, of great relevance in europe and worldwide.

sixty consecutive cre samples were isolated from  <dig> hospital inpatients and/or outpatients from november  <dig> to august  <dig>  genotyping of microbial isolates was done by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multi-locus sequence typing , carbapenemases were identified by pcr and sequencing.
the emergence of colistin resistance was observed in kpc- <dig> producing k. pneumoniae st <dig> isolates.
