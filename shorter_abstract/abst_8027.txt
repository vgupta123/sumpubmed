cry <dig> proteins are members of the alpha helical pore-forming toxins â€“ a structural class not previously recognized among the cry toxins of b. thuringiensis and representing a new paradigm for nematocidal and insecticidal proteins.
trypsin processing was found to result in the loss of some internal sequences while the c-terminal region remains disulfide-linked to the main core of the toxin.
cry6aa shows structural homology to a known class of pore-forming toxins including hemolysin e from escherichia coli and two bacillus cereus proteins: the hemolytic toxin hblb and the nhea component of the non-hemolytic toxin .
these proteins are unrelated to other insecticidal toxins at the level of their primary sequences and the structure and function of these proteins has been poorly studied to date.
based on the structural similarity of cry6aa to other toxins, the mechanism of action of the toxin was probed and its ability to form pores in vivo in caenorhabditis elegans was demonstrated.
