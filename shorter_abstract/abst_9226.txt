while ari-e has been mapped on barley chromosome 5h using traditional markers and next-generation sequencing technologies, it has not yet been finely located on this chromosome.
both snp and indel markers were developed in the target region and used for fine-mapping the ari-e gene.
linkage analysis showed that ari-e co-segregated with marker indel- <dig> and was delimited by two markers  spanning  <dig>  cm in the doubled haploid  dash × vb <dig> population.
we integrated two methods to develop molecular markers for fine-mapping the semi-dwarf gene ari-e:  specific-length amplified fragment sequencing  with bulked segregant analysis  to develop snp markers, and  the whole-genome shotgun sequence to develop indels.
the ari-e gene was fine mapped from 10 mb to  <dig>  mb interval.
the current study demonstrated the slaf-seq for snp discovery and whole-genome shotgun sequencing for indel development as an efficient approach to map complex genomic region for isolation of functional gene.
the semi-dwarf gene ari-e from golden promise is an important gene associated with some agronomic traits and salt tolerance.
the genetic position of ari-e was further confirmed in the hindmarsh × w <dig> dh population which was located between indel- <dig> and indel- <dig>  as a result, the overlapping region of the two mapping populations flanked by indel- <dig> and indel- <dig> was defined as the candidate region spanning  <dig>  mb on the popseq physical map.
