we developed a number of procedures in order to evaluate the performance of the different methods.
first, we introduce a novel cnv detection method based on a gaussian mixture model.
we applied both our new methods as well as existing ones to data from  <dig> individuals from the colaus study who were genotyped on affymetrix 500k arrays.
yet, these genotypes capture only a small fraction of the variance of the studied traits.
our new methodologies for cnv detection and their evaluation will help in extracting additional information from the large amount of snp-genotyping data on various cohorts and use this to explore structural variants and their impact on complex traits.
the ability to detect both rare and common cnvs provides a valuable resource that will facilitate association studies exploring potential phenotypic associations with cnvs.
second, we propose a new algorithm, pca merge, for combining copy-number profiles from many individuals into consensus regions.
genotypes obtained with commercial snp arrays have been extensively used in many large case-control or population-based cohorts for snp-based genome-wide association studies for a multitude of traits.
