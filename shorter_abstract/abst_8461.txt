biogeographic patterns in spacer and prophage distributions support the concept that salinispora spp.
here, comparative genomics of  <dig> salinispora strains provided insight into the diversity and distribution of crispr-cas systems in a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.
a lower prophage frequency in s. arenicola was associated with a higher fraction of spacers matching salinispora prophages compared to s. tropica, suggesting differing defensive capacities between salinispora species.
linkages of crispr features with salinispora microdiversity pointed to subclade-specific contacts with mobile genetic elements .
the ubiquity and diversity of crisprs in salinispora suggests that crispr-mediated interactions with mges represent a major force in the ecology and evolution of this cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus.
prokaryotic crispr-cas systems confer resistance to viral infection and thus mediate bacteria-phage interactions.
this study provides a comprehensive examination of crispr-cas systems in a broadly distributed group of environmental bacteria.

crisprs were found in all salinispora strains, with the majority containing multiple loci and different cas array subtypes.
the occurrence of related prophages in strains from distant locations, as well as spacers matching those prophages inserted throughout spacer arrays, indicate recurring encounters with widely distributed phages over time.
however, the distribution and functional diversity of crisprs among environmental bacteria remains largely unknown.
