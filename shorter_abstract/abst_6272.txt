the more conservative sgm might still be appropriate for meta-analyses when a strong publication bias in favour of significant results is expected to inflate type  <dig> error.
based on our results and those discussed in the literature we conclude that the generalised binomial and stouffer's z procedures should be preferred and z when the number of tests is very small.
this last method has nevertheless been challenged by the sgm  and stouffer's z-transformed methods that are less sensitive to asymmetry and deviations from uniformity of the distribution of the partial p-values.
performances of these different procedures were never compared on proportional data such as those currently used in population genetics.
all procedures more or less behaved consistently with ~5% significant tests at Î± =  <dig> .
we present new software that implements a more recent method, the generalised binomial procedure, which tests for the deviation of the observed proportion of p-values lying under a chosen threshold from the expected proportion of such p-values under the null hypothesis.
the respective performances of all available procedures were evaluated using simulated data under the null hypothesis with standard p-values distribution .
then, linkage disequilibrium tests with increasing signal strength , known to generate highly non-standard p-value distributions are undertaken and finally real population genetics data are analysed.
