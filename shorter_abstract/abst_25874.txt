neurotoxic peptides derived from the protease-resistant core of the prion protein are used to model the pathogenesis of prion diseases.
the current study characterised the ingestion, internalization and intracellular trafficking of a neurotoxic peptide containing amino acids 105â€“ <dig> of the murine prion protein  in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons.
this trafficking followed a non-classical endosomal pathway delivering peptide to the golgi and er, avoiding classical endosomal trafficking via early endosomes to lysosomes.
fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation techniques showed that moprp105- <dig> co-localised with lipid raft markers  and trafficked intracellularly within lipid rafts.
treatment with squalestatin reduced neuronal cholesterol levels and caused the redistribution of moprp105- <dig> out of lipid rafts.
squalestatin treatment also reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla2/cox- <dig>
