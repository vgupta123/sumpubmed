the novel translocation of p-cpla <dig> postulated the potential for exposure to huprp106- <dig> to result in a re-arrangement of the cellular cytoskeleton.
collectively, these findings suggest that cpla <dig> plays a vital role in the action of huprp106- <dig> and that the colocalisation of p-cpla <dig> with beta iii tubulin could be central to the progress of neurodegeneration caused by prion peptides.
exposure of primary cortical neurons to huprp106- <dig> increased the levels of phosphorylated cpla <dig> and caused phosphorylated cpla <dig> to relocate from the cell body to the cellular neurite in a prp-dependent manner, a previously unreported observation.
activation of phospholipase a <dig>  and the subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid  to prostaglandins have been shown to play an important role in neuronal death in neurodegenerative disease.
here we report the effects of the prion peptide fragment huprp106- <dig> on the pla <dig> cascade in primary cortical neurons and translocation of cpla <dig> to neurites.
conversely, p-cpla <dig> did significantly colocalise with the cytoskeletal protein beta iii tubulin.
furthermore, pacocf <dig> reduced expression of p-cpla <dig> in neurites and inhibited colocalisation with beta iii tubulin, resulting in protection against prp-induced cell death.
huprp106- <dig> also induced significant aa release, an indicator of cpla <dig> activation; this preceded synapse damage and subsequent cellular death.
pre-treatment with the pla <dig> inhibitor, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone  reduced cpla <dig> activation, aa release and damage to the neuronal synapse.
