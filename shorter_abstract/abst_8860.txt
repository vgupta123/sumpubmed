several pcr-based and non-pcr based wga technologies, namely multiple displacement amplification, quasi-random primed library synthesis followed by pcr, ligation-mediated pcr, and single-primer isothermal amplification were tested in combination with different dna extractions protocols for various quantities of genomic dna inputs.
genome-wide profiling of single-nucleotide polymorphisms is receiving increasing attention as a method of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis in humans and of commercial genotyping of pre-transfer embryos in cattle.
judicious selection of the wga platform, careful handling of the samples and genomic imputation together, make it possible to perform extremely reliable genomic evaluations for pre-transfer embryos.
the selected wga platform was then tested on embryo biopsies , comparing their results to that of biopsies collected after birth.
the gdna input, gdna extraction method and amplification technology were all found to be critical for successful genome-wide genotyping.
however, imputation from parental and population genotypes is a requirement for completing and correcting genotypic data.

although wga inevitably leads to a random loss of information and to the introduction of erroneous genotypes, following genomic imputation the resulting genetic index of both sources of dna were highly correlated .
however, the very small quantity of genomic dna in biopsy material from early embryos poses daunting technical challenges.
