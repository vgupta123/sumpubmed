the malate:quinone-oxidoreductase is a genomic feature that appears to be absent from diatom genomes, and it is likely to strongly contribute to the uniquely high endurance of e. huxleyi under nutrient limitation.
we applied microarray-based transcriptome profilings, covering ~ <dig>  known e. huxleyi gene models, and screened for expression patterns that indicate the subcellular responses.
to better understand phytoplankton nutrient utilization on the subcellular basis, we assessed the transcriptomic responses of the life-cycle stages of the biogeochemically important microalgae emiliania huxleyi to nitrogen-limitation.
the similarity between the responses of the life-cycle stages, despite the usage of different genes, also indicates a strong functional consistency in the responses to nitrogen-limitation that appears to be owed to biochemical requirements.
both stages induce a malate:quinone-oxidoreductase that efficiently feeds electrons into the respiratory chain and drives atp generation with reduced respiratory carbon throughput.
the ornithine-urea cycle and proline oxidation appear to constitute a sensory-regulatory system that monitors and controls cellular nitrogen budgets under limitation.

the haploid stage reacts similarly, although nitrogen scavenging is less pronounced and lipid oxidation is more prominent.
the diploid life-cycle stage scavenges nitrogen from external organic sources and -like diatoms- uses the ornithine-urea cycle to rapidly turn over cellular nitrogen.
the use of the ornithine-urea cycle to budget the cellular nitrogen in situations of limitation resembles the responses observed earlier in diatoms.
