the consistently high levels of toxin in the c. difficile mfd mutant indicate this process is inefficient leading to transcriptional de-repression.
marker recovery revealed an insertion in mfd, a gene encoding a transcription-coupled repair factor.
western blotting and cellular cytotoxicity assays revealed increased expression across all time points over a 24 h period, with inactivation of mfd resulting in at least a  <dig> fold increase in cell cytotoxicity.
the symptoms of clostridium difficile infection are mediated primarily by two toxins, tcda and tcdb, the expression of which is governed by a multitude of factors including nutrient availability, growth phase and cell stress.
qrt-pcr demonstrated the upregulation of both toxins occurred on a transcriptional level.
several global regulators have been implicated in the regulation of toxin expression, such as ccpa and cody.
this study adds mfd to the repertoire of factors involved in regulation of toxin expression in clostridium difficile.
mfd is known to remove rna polymerase molecules from transcriptional sites where it has stalled due to repressor action, preventing transcriptional read through.
the mfd mutant exhibited pleiotropic effects, in particular increased expression of both toxin a and b  compared to the parental strain.
