in this paper, we utilized the taxonomic data working group life sciences identifier  vocabulary to represent our data and defined a new vocabulary which is specific for annotating monogenean haptoral bar images to develop the mhbi ontology and a merged mhbi-fish ontologies.
in the process, we have come up with a new vocabulary for annotating the monogenean images with textual information.
in this paper we propose a semantic representation of these images in the form of a monogenean haptoral bar image  ontology, which are annotated with taxonomic classification, diagnostic hard part and image properties.
this will enable linking of information from the monogenean ontology to the host species found in the fish ontology without changing the underlying schema for either of the ontologies.
the data we used are basically of the monogenean species found in fish, thus we built a simple fish ontology to demonstrate how the host  ontology can be linked to the mhbi ontology.
the proposed monogenean image ontology will form the basis of a monogenean knowledge base to assist researchers in retrieving information for their analysis.
digitised monogenean images are usually stored in file system directories in an unstructured manner.
these ontologies are successfully evaluated using five criteria which are clarity, coherence, extendibility, ontology commitment and encoding bias.
