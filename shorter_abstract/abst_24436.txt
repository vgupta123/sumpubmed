our study not only brings new perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic relationships among mustelidae subfamilies, but also provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear non-coding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation.
one of the main reasons is that the mustelids represent a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event.
phylogenetic relationships among these mustelidae subfamilies remain argumentative subjects in recent years.
in addition, the molecular dating provides insights into the time scale of the origin and diversification of the mustelidae subfamilies.
finally, the phylogenetic performances and limits of nuclear introns and mt genes are discussed in the context of mustelidae phylogeny.
prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial  sequence and nuclear protein-coding data, herein we employ  <dig> nuclear non-coding loci , in conjunction with mt complete genome data , to clarify these enigmatic problems.
mustelidae, as the largest and most-diverse family of order carnivora, comprises eight subfamilies.
the combined nuclear intron and mt genome analyses both robustly support that taxidiinae diverged first, followed by melinae.
the position of helictidinae, however, is enigmatic because the mt genome analysis places it to the clade uniting lutrinae and mustelinae, whereas the nuclear intron analysis favores a novel view supporting a closer relationship of helictidinae to martinae.
