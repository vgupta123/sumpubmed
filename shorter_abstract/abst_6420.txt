as the role of σh-like factors has been little studied in non-sporulating bacteria, we investigated the function of σh in l. sakei.
our results are indicative of the existence of a genetic competence state activated by σh in l. sakei, and sustain the hypothesis that σh-like factors in non sporulating firmicutes share this common function with the well-known comx of naturally transformable streptococci.
more than half of them are involved in the synthesis of a dna uptake machinery linked to genetic competence, and in dna metabolism; however, σh overproduction did not allow detectable genetic transformation.
lactobacillus sakei, a non-sporulating meat-borne bacterium, carries an alternative sigma factor seemingly orthologous to σh of bacillus subtilis, best known for its contribution to the initiation of a large starvation response ultimately leading to sporulation.
twenty-five genes potentially regulated by σh in l. sakei  <dig> k were revealed by genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of sigh overexpression and/or quantitative pcr analysis.
σh was found to be conserved in the l. sakei species.
transcription of sigh coding for σh was hardly affected by entry into stationary phase in our laboratory conditions.
