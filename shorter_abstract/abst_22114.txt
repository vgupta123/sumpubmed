with the increasing number of automatic annotations, the tendency of biological properties to be clustered, once a biological similarity measure is introduced, may become exceedingly helpful in the development of such automatic methods.
the method quantifies the biological similarity between pairs of proteins by examining each protein's annotations, and then proceeds by clustering sets of proteins that received similar annotation into biological groups.
we present a novel protein-clustering method that enables automatic separation of fp from true hits.
automatic detection of fps may greatly facilitate the manual validation process and increase annotation sensitivity.
furthermore, we constructed an extensive random fp simulation test and show a high degree of success in detecting fp, indicating that the method is not specifically tuned for prosite and performs well on larger scales.
