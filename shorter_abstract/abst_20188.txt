the evolutionary origin of these organs was investigated using a combination of morphological, molecular and phylogenetic techniques to a developmental series of floral buds of e. pusilla.
these genetic changes are not incorporated in current models and urge for a rethinking of the evolution of deceptive flowers.
the median sepal, callus and stelidia of e. pusilla appear to be derived from a sepal, a stamen that gained petal identity, and stamens, respectively.
thousands of flowering plant species attract pollinators without offering rewards, but the evolution of this deceit is poorly understood.
duplications, diversifying selection and changes in spatial expression of different mads-box genes shaped these organs, enabling the rewardless flowers of e. pusilla to mimic an unrelated rewarding flower for pollinator attraction.
the lip of e. pusilla has a ‘callus’ that, together with winged ‘stelidia’, mimics these glands.
rewardless flowers of the orchid erycina pusilla have an enlarged median sepal and incised median petal  to attract oil-collecting bees.
different hypotheses exist about the evolutionary origin of the median sepal, callus and stelidia of orchid flowers.
the vascular bundle of the median sepal indicates it is a first whorl organ but its convex epidermal cells reflect convergence of petaloid features.
expression of agl <dig> epmads <dig> and apetala <dig> epmads <dig> is low in the median sepal, possibly correlating with its petaloid appearance.
agl <dig> epmads <dig> and apetala <dig> epmads <dig> are most highly expressed in lip and callus, consistent with current models for lip identity.
six vascular bundles, indicating a stamen-derived origin, lead to the callus, stelidia and stamen.

these bees also forage on similar looking but rewarding malpighiaceae flowers that have five unequally sized petals and gland-carrying sepals.
another copy of agamous, epmads <dig>  and the single copy of seedstick, epmads <dig>  are most highly expressed in the stelidia, suggesting epmads <dig> may be required for fertile stamens.
