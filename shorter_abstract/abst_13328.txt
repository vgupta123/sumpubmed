furthermore, our results indicate that the fungus me4- <dig> is a potent producer of 2-phenylethanol, which is a common component of floral essential oils.
this floral endophyte was thus identified as lasiodiplodia sp.

sequence analysis of its internal transcribed spacer rdna demonstrated that me4- <dig> forms a distinct branch within the genus lasiodiplodia and is closely related to l. pseudotheobromae.
as limited information on floral endophytes is available, the aim of the present study is to characterise fungal endophytes using their secondary metabolites.
five aromatic compounds, including cyclo-, indole-3-carboxylic acid , indole-3-carbaldehyde, mellein and 2-phenylethanol, were found in the culture.
this study introduces a fungal strain producing several important aromatic metabolites with pharmaceutical or food applications and suggests that endophytic fungi isolated from plant flowers are promising natural sources of aromatic compounds.
to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to report isolation of these aromatic metabolites from a floral endophyte.
