the generated sequence data are publicly available and will facilitate gene discovery in o. longistaminata and rice functional genomic studies.
one sequencing run using a normalized cdna library from o. longistaminata roots adapted to low n conditions generated  <dig>  reads, which assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
the large number of abundant of novel ests suggests different metabolic activity in o. longistaminata roots in comparison to o. sativa roots.
our results show that one run using a genome sequencer flx from  <dig> life science/roche generates sufficient genomic information for adequate de novo assembly of a large number of transcripts in a wild rice species, o. longistaminata.
in this study we present the first comprehensive characterization of the o. longistaminata root transcriptome using  <dig> pyrosequencing.
comparison with ests derived from cultivated rice collections revealed expressed genes across different plant species, however  <dig> % of the o. longistaminata ests had not been detected as expressed in o. sativa.
however, only limited genomic or transcriptomic data of o. longistaminata are currently available.
rt-pcr and southern blot analyses confirmed the expression of selected novel transcripts in o. longistaminata.
