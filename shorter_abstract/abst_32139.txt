the egg stage library, relative to the other developmental stages, was enriched in genes functioning in cell division and proliferation, transcription, signal transduction, and regulation of protein function.
partial sequencing of  <dig> cdna libraries each for a. palmata and m. faveolata has produced a rich set of candidate genes  that we can use as a starting point for examining the life history and symbiosis of these two species, as well as to further expand the dataset of cnidarian genes for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.
scleractinian corals are the foundation of reef ecosystems in tropical marine environments.
to develop a foundation for studying coral biology and coral symbiosis, we have constructed a set of cdna libraries and generated and annotated ests from two species of corals, acropora palmata and montastraea faveolata.
five unigenes appear to be restricted to the scleractinia, as they had no homology to any sequences in the nr databases nor to the non-scleractinian cnidarians nematostella vectensis and hydra magnipapillata.
fifteen unigenes were identified as candidate symbiosis-related genes as they were expressed in all libraries constructed from the symbiotic stages and were absent from all of the non symbiotic stages.
we generated  <dig>   and  <dig>   high quality ests from five life history/symbiosis stages .
comparison between the a. palmata and an a. millepora est dataset identified ferritin as a highly expressed gene in both datasets that appears to be undergoing adaptive evolution.
