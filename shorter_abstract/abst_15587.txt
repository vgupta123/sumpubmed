they were then equibiaxially stretched to 25% change in surface area at  <dig> cycles/minute for  <dig> hour or  <dig> hours, or served as unstretched controls, and mirnas were extracted.
cyclic stretch of alveoli is characteristic of mechanical ventilation, and is postulated to be partly responsible for the lung injury and inflammation in ventilator-induced lung injury.
specific inhibition of two selected mirnas demonstrated a reduction of the increased epithelial permeability seen with cyclic stretch.
using a parallel mrna array under identical conditions and publicly available databases, target genes for these  <dig> differentially regulated mirnas were identified.
we conclude that mirna expression is differentially expressed between cyclically stretched and unstretched alveolar epithelial cells, and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate stretch-associated alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction.
we validated  <dig> of the mirnas using real-time pcr.
we propose that mirnas may regulate some of the stretch response, and therefore hypothesized that mirnas would be differentially expressed between cyclically stretched and unstretched rat alveolar epithelial cells .
