our overlap graph theoretic algorithm is able to model next generation sequencing reads at various levels of granularity through the process of graph coarsening.
previously, we presented an overlap graph coarsening scheme for modeling read overlap relationships on multiple levels.
additionally, our model allows for efficient representation of the read overlap relationships, is scalable for large datasets, and is practical for both illumina and  <dig> sequencing technologies.
instead, we use a series of graphs to represent the reads and their overlap relationships across a spectrum of information granularity.
next generation sequencing technologies have greatly advanced many research areas of the biomedical sciences through their capability to generate massive amounts of genetic information at unprecedented rates.
while these tools filled an important gap, current approaches for storing, processing, and analyzing short read datasets generally have remained simple and lack the complexity needed to efficiently model the produced reads and assemble them correctly.
