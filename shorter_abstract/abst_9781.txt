in total,  <dig> individuals from  <dig> localities were sampled, and variations in the chalcone synthase gene  intron and leafy  intron- <dig> sequences of nuclear dna were examined in order to assess phylogeographic patterns, the timescales of demographic and evolutionary events, and recent anthropogenic effects.
the isolation-by-distance test showed that there generally was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances.
a fit of spatial range expansion was found for pooled and regional samples according to the non-significant values of the sum of squared deviations.
common haplotype distributions among geographic regions and the relatively shallow genetic structuring displayed are the result of historical gene flows.
southward dispersals in an earlier time frame from the nw region and in a later time frame from the se region were inferred.
species in the varied geographic topology of taiwan underwent obvious demographic changes during glacial periods.
recent trends, however, refer to a bottleneck due to human interventions observed for both pooled and regional c. kanehirae samples.
the bsp analysis suggested a postglacial expansion event.
cinnamomum kanehirae has been exploited for timber and to obtain medicinal fungi for the past  <dig> years.
using the bayesian skyline plot  method, a recent bottleneck after the lgm expansion was detected in both regional and pooled samples.
populations of c. kanehirae were classified into four geographic regions: northwestern , west-central , southwestern , and southeastern .
however, no significant among-region genetic differentiation was found in comparisons among the four geographic regions.
the level of among-region genetic differentiation was significant when comparing eastern to western populations.
estimates of the migration rate  through time revealed a pattern of frequent gene flow during previous and the present interglacials.
