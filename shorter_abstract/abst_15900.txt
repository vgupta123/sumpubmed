being used as background network in a case study of disease gene prediction, the final integrated network presents good performance, implying its reliability and application significance.
the common information among the refined networks increases notably, suggesting their higher reliability.
however, it is found that these existing human gene association networks share only quite limited overlapped interactions, suggesting their incompleteness and noise.
our final integrated network owns much more links than most of the original networks, meanwhile its links still keep high functional relevance.
here we proposed a workflow to construct a weighted human gene association network using information of six existing networks, including two weighted specific ppi networks and four gene association meta-networks.
our workflow could be insightful for integrating and refining existing gene association data.
some efforts have been made to construct weighted gene association meta-networks by integrating multiple biological resources, where the weight indicates the confidence of the interaction.
