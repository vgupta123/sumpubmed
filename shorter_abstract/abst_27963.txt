however, a serious dilemma arises when the database holder also wants to output no information except for the search results, and such a dilemma prevents the use of many important data resources.
searching for similar compounds in a database is the most important process for in-silico drug screening.
we proposed a novel privacy-preserving protocol for searching chemical compound databases.
in an experiment searching chembl, which consists of more than  <dig> , <dig> compounds, the proposed method was  <dig>  times faster in cpu time and  <dig>  times as efficient in communication size compared with general purpose multi-party computation.
in this study, our protocol is successfully built only from an additive-homomorphic cryptosystem, which allows only addition performed on encrypted values but is computationally efficient compared with versatile techniques such as general purpose multi-party computation.
the proposed method, easily scaling for large-scale databases, may help to accelerate drug discovery research by making full use of unused but valuable data that includes sensitive information.
