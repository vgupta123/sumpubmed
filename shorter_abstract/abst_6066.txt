their evolutionary history includes repeated mass extinctions.
after mass extinctions, surviving species evolve to refill essentially the same pyramid, suggesting that the tasks are unchanging.
organisms that need to perform multiple tasks face a fundamental tradeoff: no design can be optimal at all tasks at once.
ammonoid fossil shells provide an excellent model system for this purpose.
we infer putative tasks for each archetype, related to economy of shell material, rapid shell growth, hydrodynamics and compactness.
these results support pareto optimality theory as an approach to study evolutionary tradeoffs, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to infer the putative tasks that may shape the natural selection of phenotypes.
recent theory based on pareto optimality showed that such tradeoffs lead to a highly defined range of phenotypes, which lie in low-dimensional polyhedra in the space of traits.
