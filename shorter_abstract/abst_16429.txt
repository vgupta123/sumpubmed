in order to elucidate intrinsic functional diversity, and underlying evolutionary mechanism among anoctamins, we performed comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of anoctamin gene family.
most of the amino acid replacements responsible for the functional divergence were fixed by adaptive evolution and this seem to be a common pattern in anoctamin gene family evolution.
our results show that anoctamin protein paralogs evolved from several gene duplication events followed by functional divergence of vertebrate anoctamins.
in addition we identified a number of protein domains, and amino acid residues which contribute to predicted functional divergence.
the anoctamin family of transmembrane proteins are found in all eukaryotes and consists of  <dig> members in vertebrates.
