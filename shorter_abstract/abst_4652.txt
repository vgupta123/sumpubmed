salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is an important pathogen that infects a broad range of hosts.
the co-infection model we used provides a sensitive assay that confirms the role of spi <dig> and clarifies the role of spi <dig> in the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium.
additionally, we show that the contribution of spi <dig> in the spleen is greater than that of spi <dig>  these results are different from those observed during the infection of the mouse by typhimurium where spi <dig> is the major player during systemic colonization.
in humans, typhimurium causes a gastroenteritis characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pains.
we have taken a mixed infection approach to study the contribution of spi <dig> and spi <dig> to the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium.
