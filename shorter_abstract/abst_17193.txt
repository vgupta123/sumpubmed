although western la pampa has more infected herds, within-farm prevalence was not higher, which suggests that the control program has been relatively successful in controlling the disease at the farm level, and/or that low animal density inherently results in low disease prevalence.
our results provide baseline information on the epidemiology of bb and its potential pattern of transmission in argentina, which will ultimately help to improve bb control programs in the country.
there were not differences between the proportions of reactive cattle compared to that obtained in a survey conducted in  <dig>  however, herd prevalence in la pampa was significantly  higher compared to that study.
the objectives of this study were to quantify the prevalence of bb and to identify factors associated with its occurrence, along with the spatial distribution of the disease, in the provinces of la pampa and san luis.
both cow-level and herd-level prevalence in la pampa  were significantly higher than in san luis .
the increase of farm prevalence in the last five years suggests that the disease is spreading and that control measures should be applied in the region.
there, farms have lower animal densities and smaller cow/calf indices compared to the rest of the province.
the lower the bovine density and the calf/cow ratio, the higher odds of belonging to the cluster.
bovine brucellosis  is a zoonotic disease caused by brucella abortus.
bb is endemic in argentina, where vaccination with brucella abortus strain  <dig> is compulsory for 3-to-8 month-old heifers.
