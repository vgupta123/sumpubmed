our findings could lead to the improvement in disease control strategies.
in particular, in the incompatible interaction an activation of defense genes related to secondary metabolite production and tryptophan metabolism was observed.
despite such major economic impact, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating fusarium oxysporum f.sp.
as for the compatible interaction, activation of an oxidative burst mediated by peroxidases and a cytochrome monooxygenase induced cell degeneration and necrosis.
a transcriptomic experiment was carried out in order to investigate the main mechanisms of forl response in resistant and susceptible isogenic tomato lines.
a model of plant response both for compatible and incompatible reactions was proposed.
microarray analysis at  <dig> dpi  revealed a distinct gene expression pattern between the two genotypes in the inoculated vs non-inoculated conditions.
the result obtained emphasizes a different transcriptional reaction between the resistant and the susceptible genotype to the forl challenge.
our work allowed comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of the tomato-forl interaction.
