in addition to the speciation events reflected by the phylogenetic tree of the considered species, the evolutionary events that are taken into account are simple or multiple tandem duplications, direct or inverted, simple or multiple deletions, and inversions.
the diltag algorithm developed in  <cit>  makes it possible to infer a set of optimal evolutionary histories explaining the evolution of a single tag cluster, from an ancestral single gene, through tandem duplications , deletions and inversion events.
we analysed the performance of our algorithm on simulated data sets and we applied it to the protocadherin gene clusters of human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat.
our results obtained on simulated data sets showed a good performance in inferring the total number and size distribution of duplication events.
in addition to tandem duplication events, tag clusters are affected during their evolution by other mechanisms, such as inversion and deletion events, that affect the order and orientation of genes.
we present a general methodology, which is an extension of diltag, for the study of the evolutionary history of a set of orthologous tag clusters in multiple species.
tandemly arrayed gene  clusters are groups of paralogous genes that are found adjacent on a chromosome.
