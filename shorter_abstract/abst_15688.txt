streptomyces virginiae ibl <dig> is an effective degradative strain for many steroidal compounds and can also catalyze the c <dig> hydroxylation of diosgenin, the first-ever biotransformation found on the f-ring of diosgenin.
c. one new subfamily was found as per the fact that the cyp svu <dig> in s. virginiae ibl <dig> shares 66% identity only to that  from streptomyces sp.
the analytical results of blastp showed that the strain ibl <dig> contains  <dig> cyps,  <dig> ferredoxins and  <dig> ferredoxin reductases in its  <dig>  mb linear chromosome.
experimental results showed that both cyp svh <dig> and cyp svu <dig> are two hydroxylases, capable of bioconverting diosgenone into isonuatigenone and β-estradiol into estriol, respectively.
mg <dig>  further analysis showed that among all of the  <dig> cyps in s. virginiae ibl <dig>  three cyps are clustered with ferredoxins, one with ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase and three cyps with atp/gtp binding proteins, four cyps arranged with transcriptional regulatory genes and one cyp located on the upstream of an atp-binding protein and transcriptional regulators as well as four cyps associated with other functional genes involved in secondary metabolism and degradation.
cyps from s. virginiae ibl <dig> are phylogenetically closed to those of streptomyces sp.
these characteristics found in cyps from s. virginiae ibl <dig> show that the exxr motif in the k-helix is not absolutely conserved in cyp <dig> family and i-helix not absolutely essential for the cyp structure, too.
to completely elucidate the hydroxylation function of cytochrome p <dig> genes  found during biotransformation of steroids by s. virginiae ibl <dig>  the whole genome sequencing of this strain was carried out via  <dig> sequencing systems.
