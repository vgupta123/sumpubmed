the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance in pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus has prompted the search for new antimicrobial approaches.
this approach has promise as a means of treating wound infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microbes as well as for the elimination of such organisms from carriage sites.
the results of this study demonstrate that pdt is effective at reducing the total number of viable emrsa in a wound.
histological examination of the wounds revealed no difference between the photodynamic therapy -treated wounds and the untreated wounds, all of which showed the same degree of inflammatory infiltration at  <dig> hours.
in this study we report for the first time the use of a light-activated antimicrobial agent, methylene blue, to kill an epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  strain in two mouse wound models.
