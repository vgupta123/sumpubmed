immunization of rats demonstrates that this ige-hyporeactive domain, despite its three sequence modifications , is able to induce antibodies that substantially block the binding of allergic subjectsâ€™ ige to the wild-type allergen.
a mutated variant of the immunodominant c-terminal domain of the group  <dig> grass pollen allergen phl p  <dig> was recently established through an approach that used a set of human monoclonal ige as a guide to identify mutations that disturbed ige-allergen interactions.
gst-tagged wild-type and mutated c-terminal domains of phl p  <dig> were produced in escherichia coli tuner.
rats were immunized with gst-tagged and tag-free mutated c-terminal domain of phl p  <dig>  antigen-binding properties of induced antibodies were assessed by immunochemical analysis.
gst was removed by enzymatic cleavage and tag-free products were purified by size exclusion chromatography.
the mutated domain has a structure very similar to that of the wild-type domain as determined by circular dichroism, but a reduced thermal stability.
group  <dig> grass pollen allergens are a major cause of allergic disease.
