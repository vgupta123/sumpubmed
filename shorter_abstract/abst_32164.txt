the tdcf structure closely resembles those of all yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family members determined thus far.
we have determined the crystal structure of e. coli tdcf by molecular replacement to a maximum resolution of  <dig>  Ã…. structures are also presented of tdcf complexed with a variety of ligands.
the gene encoding the tdcf protein of e. coli, a yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family member, resides in an operon that strongly suggests a role in the metabolism of 2-ketobutyrate for this protein.
we show that tdcf is capable of binding several low molecular weight metabolites bearing a carboxylate group, although the interaction with 2-ketobutyrate appears to be the most well defined.
