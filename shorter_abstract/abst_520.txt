dintor covers a wide range of frequently required functionalities, from gene identifier conversions and orthology mappings to functional annotation of proteins and genetic variants up to candidate gene prioritization and gene ontology-based gene set enrichment analysis.
we demonstrate a selection of dintorâ€™s capabilities by analyzing datasets from four representative publications.
dintor is a computational annotation framework for the analysis of genomic and proteomic datasets, providing a rich set of tools that cover the most frequently encountered tasks.
each of the tools solves a particular task and several tools can be combined into data processing pipelines.
since the tools operate on constantly changing datasets, we provide a mechanism to unambiguously link tools with different versions of archived datasets, which guarantees reproducible results for future tool invocations.
a major advantage is its capability to consistently handle multiple versions of tool-associated datasets, supporting the researcher in delivering reproducible results.
even though various computational approaches have been developed to analyze these data, it is still a laborious task involving prudent integration of many heterogeneous and frequently updated data sources, creating a barrier for interested scientists to accomplish their own analysis.
in addition, the dintor tools are available on our public galaxy web service at http://dintor.eurac.edu.
we have implemented dintor, a data integration framework that provides a set of over  <dig> tools to assist researchers in the exploration of genomics and proteomics datasets.
