the phylogenetic analysis suggests that the protoamer gene originated early in the vertebrate lineage and was then duplicated due to whole genome duplications  giving rise to the three different amer genes.
divergent and conserved molecular functions of wtx/amer <dig>  amer <dig> and amer <dig> are discussed.
this amer gene family is present in all currently available vertebrate genome sequences, but not invertebrate genomes and is characterized by six conserved blocks of sequences.
on the molecular level wtx has been shown to act as an antagonist of canonical wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in fish and mammals thus linking it to an essential pathway involved in normal development and cancer formation.
our study represents the first phylogenetic analysis of amer genes and reveals a new vertebrate specific gene family that is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of this subphylum.
in spite of the growing interest of molecular biologists in wtx, little is known about its paralogs and its phylogenetic history.
