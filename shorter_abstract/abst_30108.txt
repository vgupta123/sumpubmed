modification of the backbone with phosphonic ester side chains further improves their properties and allows the efficient knock down of a single gene in fish embryos.
when we examined the activity and specificity of these novel phosphonic ester pnas  molecules in medaka  embryos, high solubility and selective binding to mrna was observed.
in particular, mixing of the novel components with aegpna components resulted in mixed pnas with superior properties.
among the molecules which can block mrna function in a sequence specific manner are peptide nucleic acids .
