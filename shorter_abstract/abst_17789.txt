we have demonstrated that using kernel learning on multiple data sources provides a stronger alternative to the existing method in solving this task.
regulation of cellular events is, often, initiated via extracellular signaling.
identification of receptor-ligand pairs is thus an important and specific form of ppi prediction.
given a set of disparate data sources  we seek to predict new receptor-ligand pairs.
the prediction of receptor-ligand pairings is a difficult and complex task.
extracellular signaling occurs when a circulating ligand interacts with one or more membrane-bound receptors.
among our findings, we discover that our predictions for the tgfβ family accurately reconstruct over 76% of the supported edges  of the receptor-ligand bipartite graph defined by the dlrp "golden standard".
in addition, for the tgfβ family, the combined kernel classifier is able to relatively improve upon the gertz et al.
we create a combined kernel classifier and assess its performance with respect to the database of ligand-receptor partners  'golden standard' as well as the method proposed by gertz et al.
