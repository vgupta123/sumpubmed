in the current study, two morphotypes of lake trout, leans and siscowets, were parasitized in the laboratory by sea lampreys and the liver transcriptomes of parasitized and nonparasitized fish were analyzed by rna-seq  to determine which genes and gene pathways  were altered by lamprey parasitism.
the results indicate a strong transcriptional response in the lake trout to lamprey parasitism that entails genes involved in the regulation of inflammation and cellular damage.
the sea lamprey  is a jawless vertebrate that parasitizes fish as an adult and, with overfishing, was responsible for the decline in lake trout  populations in the great lakes.

responses to energy utilization as well as hydromineral balance also occurred indicating an adjustment in the host to energy demands and osmotic imbalances during parasitism.
however, pathways related to energy metabolism  were also regulated.
while laboratory studies have looked at the rates of wounding on various fish hosts, there have been few investigations on the physiological effects of lamprey wounding on the host.
in siscowets, the top upregulated gene was growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible protein and for leans it was interleukin-18-binding protein.
for siscowets, the top downregulated gene was c-c motif chemokine  <dig> - deseq <dig> or gtp-binding protein rhes - edger.
given the role of the kynurenine pathway in promoting immunotolerance in mammals, the downregulation observed in this pathway during parasitism may signify an attempt by the host to inhibit any feedback suppression of the immune response to the lamprey.
