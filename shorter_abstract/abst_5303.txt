active modules are connected regions in biological network which show significant changes in expression over particular conditions.
we propose a novel encoding/decoding scheme to ensure the connectedness of the identified active modules.
based on the scheme, we also design and incorporate a local search operator into the memetic algorithm to improve its performance.
in this paper, we propose a novel active module identification algorithm based on a memetic algorithm.
