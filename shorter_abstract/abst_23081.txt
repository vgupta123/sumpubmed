analyzing the co-localization with several genomic regions as a function of window size vs. statistical significance , cpgcluster shows a higher overlap with promoter regions and highly conserved elements, at the same time showing less overlap with alu retrotransposons.
we compare sliding-window to clustering  predictions by applying new ways to detect putative functionality of cpg islands.
finally, we show that window-based islands can spuriously overlap several, differentially regulated promoters as well as different methylation domains, which might indicate a wrong merge of several cpg islands into a single, very long island.
this suggests that cpgcluster may be the algorithm of choice to explore the function of these short, but putatively functional cpg islands.
conventionally, these regions are detected by sliding window approaches using %g + c, cpg observed/expected ratio and length thresholds as main parameters.
unmethylated stretches of cpg dinucleotides  are an outstanding property of mammal genomes.
recently, clustering methods directly detect clusters of cpg dinucleotides as a statistical property of the genome sequence.
many of these islets seem to be functional, as they are unmethylated, highly conserved and/or located within the promoter region.
the major difference in the prediction was found for short islands , often exclusively predicted by cpgcluster.
short islands, often differentially methylated, are almost exclusively predicted by cpgcluster.
