prior microarrays have included only a single strain per array or the conserved sequences of gene families.
unlike arrays built on clustered gene families, panarray uses an unbiased, probe-centric approach that does not rely on annotations, gene clustering, or multi-alignments.
this method, as with all microarray applications, requires adequate coverage of probes targeting the regions of interest.
array comparative genomic hybridization is a fast and cost-effective method for detecting, genotyping, and comparing the genomic sequence of unknown bacterial isolates.
the viability of the algorithm is demonstrated by array designs for seven different bacterial pan-genomes and, in particular, the design of a  <dig>  probe array that fully tiles the genomes of  <dig> different listeria monocytogenes strains with overlapping probes at greater than twofold coverage.
however, such a whole-genome tiling requires that the genome sequence is known in advance.
panarray is an oligonucleotide probe selection algorithm for tiling multiple genome sequences using a minimal number of probes.
these unique pan-genome tiling arrays provide maximum flexibility for the analysis of both known and uncharacterized strains.
to minimize the required number of probes, probes conserved across multiple strains in the pan-genome are selected first, and additional probes are used only where necessary to span polymorphic regions of the genome.
this paper presents a new probe selection algorithm  that can tile multiple whole genomes using a minimal number of probes.
