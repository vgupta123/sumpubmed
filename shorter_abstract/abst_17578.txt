using es cells carrying a neuroepithelial cell specific vital reporter  and facs purification of sox1-gfp neural progenitors, we have investigated the temporal aspect of sdia mediated dopaminergic neuron specification during es cell differentiation.
dopaminergic neurons are specified early during mouse es cell differentiation.
furthermore, we show that dopaminergic neurons could be produced efficiently in a monolayer differentiation paradigm independent of sdia activity or exogenous signalling molecules.
our results establish that sdia induces a dopaminergic neuron fate in nascent neural stem or progenitor cells at, or prior to, sox <dig> expression and does not appear to have further instructive role or neurotrophic activity during late neuronal differentiation of neural precursors.
the in vitro generation of dopaminergic neurons, the type of cells lost in parkinson's disease patients' brains, requires the inductive molecules sonic hedgehog and fgf <dig>  or an unknown stromal cell derived inducing activity .
in this case, the competence for dopaminergic neuron differentiation is also established at the level of sox <dig> expression.
