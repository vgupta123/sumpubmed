we also used  <dig> transfac motifs comprising not only the usual tfs constituting the enhanceosome but also the architectural proteins of high mobility group i .
the enhanceosome is an enhancer located upstream of the human interferon β gene, bound by transcription factor  complex of extremely rigid structure.
within these rigid constraints, even a slight change of distances between transcription factor binding sites  results in loss of functionality of the enhanceosome.

we hypothesized that smaller subunits of the enhanceosome may entail tf complex formation in other regulatory regions.
a notable feature of these instances is that  most of them are located in introns of genes,  they are enriched in regulatory states, and  those instances that are located near transcription start sites are enriched for inclusion in computationally predicted enhancers.
we performed this computational experiment in a cell-type–specific manner by utilizing cell-type–specific dnase-seq data for  <dig> human cell types.
to characterize these predicted tf dimers, we performed functional analysis  for sets of genes which were in the neighbourhood of predicted dimer instances.
nf- κb did not participate in forming dimers with other proteins.
we found  <dig> statistically significant dimer predictions in the human genome, and  <dig> predictions in the mouse genome, that matched the positioning on the enhanceosome with ± <dig> bp tolerance.
it follows from our experiments that, except for homodimer formed by irf proteins, the rest of the dimers were formed exclusively between one of the transcriptional activators  and a hmg i protein.
a similar experiment used  <dig> dnase-seq data sets for mouse cell types.
