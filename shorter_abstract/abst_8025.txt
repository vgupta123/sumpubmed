the resulting strain tol <dig> exhibited significantly increased growth rates in the presence of up to 1Â m methanol.
the methanol tolerance of the amino acid producing soil bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum was improved by experimental evolution in the presence of methanol.
genome sequence analysis of strain tol <dig> revealed two point mutations potentially relevant to enhanced methanol tolerance: one leading to the amino acid exchange a165t of o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and the other leading to shortened coa transferase cat .
the methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum can be increased by two point mutations leading to amino acid exchange of o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and shortened coa transferase cat.
methanol often inhibits growth of bacteria, thus, methanol tolerance may limit fermentative production processes.
introduction of either mutation into the genome of c. glutamicum wild type increased methanol tolerance and introduction of both mutations into c. glutamicum was sufficient to achieve methanol tolerance almost indistinguishable from that of strain tol <dig>
introduction of these mutations into producer strains may be helpful when using carbon sources containing methanol as component or impurity.
however, neither transcriptional changes nor increased enzyme activities of the linear methanol oxidation pathway were observed, which was in accordance with the finding that tolerance to the downstream metabolites formaldehyde and formate was not improved.
