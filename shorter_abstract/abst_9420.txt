several otus at genus level were identified over-represented in piglets from control farms, indicating their potential as probiotics.
the diversity of the nasal microbiota was low in comparison with other body sites, showing a maximum number of operational taxonomic units  per pig of  <dig> , clustered in five phyla.
the composition of the nasal microbiota of healthy piglets was uncovered and different phylotypes were shown to be significantly altered in animals depending on the clinical status of the farm of origin.
significant differences were found at various taxonomical levels, when the microbiota was compared regarding the farm health status.
among the early colonizers, haemophilus parasuis also has clinical importance, since it is also the etiological agent of glässer’s disease.
although we provide relevant data, fully metagenomic approaches could give light on the genes and metabolic pathways involved in the roles of the nasal microbiota to prevent respiratory diseases.
however, these studies focused mainly on the human digestive system, while the populations in the respiratory tract have been poorly assessed, especially in pigs.
healthy status was associated to higher species richness and diversity, and uk farms demonstrated the highest diversity.
the nasal mucosa of piglets is colonized by an array of bacteria, many of which are unknown.
hence, the purpose of this work was to characterize the nasal microbiota composition of piglets, and its possible role in glässer’s disease development.

the total dna extracted from nasal swabs was used to amplify the 16s rna gene for sequencing in illumina miseq.
