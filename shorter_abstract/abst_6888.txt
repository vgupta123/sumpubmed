future releases of chromhome will accommodate more species and their respective gene and bac maps, in addition to chromosome painting data.
chromhome  is a comprehensive web application that is designed to provide cytogenetic comparisons among species and to fulfil this need.
the chromhome application architecture is multi-tiered with an interactive client layer, business logic and database layers.
chromhome provides a useful resource for comparative genomics, holding graphical homology maps of a wide range of species.
enterprise java platform with open source framework openlaszlo is used to implement the rich internet chromhome application.
chromhome application provides a single-page interface  with desktop style layout, delivering a better and richer user experience.
inferred data also provides maps of homologous regions that could serve as a guideline for researchers involved in phylogenetic or evolution based studies.
inferred painting can often determine the chromosomal homologous regions between two species, if each has been compared with a common third species.
it can also be used to understand the phylogenetic relationships of species and the mechanisms leading to rearrangement of karyotypes during evolution.
