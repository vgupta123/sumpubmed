comparisons with true aphids  should also allow to link differences in life-traits of the two groups with changes in gene repertoires or shifts in patterns of expression.
at a different scale, we could also illustrate one major shift in expression levels associated with changes in life-traits that occurred along evolution and that respectively characterize  grapevine phylloxera and  true aphids.
grapevine phylloxera, an insect related to true aphids, is a major historic pest of viticulture only controlled through the selection of resistant rootstocks or through quarantine regulations where grapevine is cultivated own-rooted.
we sequenced transcriptomes of the grapevine phylloxera , choosing three life-stages  to cover a large catalogue of transcripts, and performed a de novo assembly.
we also identified a gene family with a very high expression level  in the grapevine phylloxera , but usually expressed at very low levels in true aphids .
this resulted in  <dig>  contigs, which were annotated: most contigs had a best blastx hit to the pea aphid , while very few bacterial hits were recorded .
