to systematically understand the interactions between numerous biological components, a variety of biological networks on different levels and scales have been constructed and made available in public databases or knowledge repositories.
the identifiability-based observation problem for biological networks is mathematically formulated for the first time based on linear recursive structural equation models, and then a dynamic programming strategy is developed to obtain the optimal observation strategies.
the proposed approach is the first solution to the structural identifiability-based optimal observation remedy problem.
graphical models such as structural equation models have long been used to describe biological networks for various quantitative analysis tasks, especially key biological parameter estimation.
however, limited by resources or technical capacities, partial observation is a common problem in experimental observations of biological networks, and it thus becomes an important problem how to select unobserved nodes for additional measurements such that all unknown model parameters become identifiable.
observation remedy is an important issue in experiment design for biological networks, and we believe that this study provides a solid basis for dealing with more challenging design issues  in the future.
it is applicable to an arbitrary directed acyclic biological network  without bidirectional edges, and it is a computerizable method.
we also provided necessary theoretical justifications to the proposed method.

the efficiency of the dynamic programming algorithm is achieved by avoiding both symbolic computation and matrix operations as used in other studies.
