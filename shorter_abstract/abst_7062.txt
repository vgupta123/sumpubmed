size exclusion chromatography is the method of choice for separating free from liposome-encapsulated molecules.
however, if the column is not presaturated with lipids this type of chromatography causes a significant loss of lipid material.
further addition of free liposomes leads to the elution of part of the gel-trapped liposomes, showing that the retention is transitory.
here we show that intact liposomes and their contents are retained in the exclusion gel.
to date, the mechanism of lipid retention is poorly understood.
retention depends on the pore size, the smaller the pores, the higher the retention.
