although biparental care, epm, mate guarding and punishment are shared by many species, gossiping and blackmailing make the human mating system unique.
the human mating system is characterized by bi-parental care and faithful monogamy is highly valued in most cultures.
stability of faithful monogamy is therefore a conundrum.
blackmailing, which makes policing a non-altruistic act, is crucial for the maintenance of faithful monogamy.
we show that this dynamics leads to the coexistence of different strategies in oscillations, with obligate monogamy maintained at a high level.
deletion of blackmailing benefit from the model leads to the complete disappearance of obligate monogamy.
obligate monogamy can be maintained in the population in spite of the advantages of epm.
however, similar to other species with bi-parental care, both males and females frequently indulge in epm in secrecy since it confers certain gender specific genetic benefits.
marriage has evolved as a social institution and punishment for extra pair mating  or adultery is common.
if the maximum probabilistic benefit of blackmailing is greater than the cost of policing, policing becomes a non-altruistic act and stabilizes in the society.
