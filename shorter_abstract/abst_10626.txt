a subgroup of  <dig> atypical strains had a variant type of the asta gene sequence, with four non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions.
the rt-pcr results showed that the asta gene was transcribed only by the strains carrying either the intact or the variant type of the asta gene sequence.
strains carrying intact asta genes were more frequently found in diarrheic children than in non-diarrheic children .
in conclusion, our data suggest that the presence of an intact asta gene may represent an additional virulence determinant in both epec groups.
the enteroaggregative e. coli heat-stable enterotoxin  <dig>  encoded by asta gene has been found in enteropathogenic e. coli  strains.
however, it is not sufficient to simply probe strains with an asta gene probe due to the existence of asta mutants  and east <dig> variants .
in this study,  <dig> epec  isolates were tested for the presence of the asta gene sequence by pcr and sequencing.
the asta gene was amplified from  <dig> strains,  <dig> typical and  <dig> atypical.
sequence analysis of the pcr products showed that  <dig> strains,  <dig> typical and  <dig> atypical, had an intact asta gene.
the remaining  <dig> strains had mutated asta gene with nucleotide deletions or substitutions in the first  <dig> codons.

southern blot analysis indicated that asta is located in eaf plasmid in typical strains, and in plasmids of similar size in atypical strains.
