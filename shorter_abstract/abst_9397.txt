in the present study, we used high throughput pyrosequencing to assess the effects of a single 2-hour exposure to a social stressor, called social disruption , on colonic mucosa-associated microbial profiles of c57bl/ <dig> mice.
l. reuteri, an immunomodulatory species, was decreased in stressor-exposed cd- <dig> mice, but not c57bl/ <dig> mice.
these data illustrate that stressor exposure can affect microbial populations, including the lactobacilli, that are closely associated with the colonic mucosa.
the mucosa-associated microbiota exist in close proximity to elements of the host immune system and the two are tightly interrelated.
studies from laboratories such as ours have demonstrated that exposure to psychological stressors disrupts the population profile of intestinal microbiota.
it is not known whether shorter stressors can also impact the microbiota, and whether colonic mucosa-associated populations can also be affected.
thus, whether stressor exposure can have contrasting effects on the colonic microbiota in inbred c57bl/ <dig> mice and outbred cd- <dig> mice was also examined.
the data indicate that exposure to the stressor significantly changed the community profile and significantly reduced the relative proportions of two genera and one family of highly abundant intestinal bacteria, including the genus lactobacillus.
additionally, stressors can induce differential responses in anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone outputs in variant strains of mice.
