areas that concentrate evolutionary history of conservation interest greatly differed among taxa and indices, although a large proportion of hotspots were identified in the maghreb, in the east of the mediterranean basin as well as in islands.
we focused on three vertebrate groups with high proportions of endemic, threatened species: amphibians, squamates and terrestrial mammals.
we found that, in a minimum conservation scenario, there was a significant proportion of hotspots for amphibians and squamates that were protected but not for terrestrial mammals.
focusing on a biodiversity hotspot, the mediterranean basin, we aimed to identify those areas where evolutionary history is highly threatened and range-restricted in the region.
using null models, we first compared the spatial distributions of three indices: two measured threatened evolutionary history—expected pdloss and heightened evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment—and one measured endemic evolutionary history—biogeographically evolutionary distinctiveness.
second, we estimated the spatial overlap of hotspots of threatened and endemic evolutionary history within the network of protected areas under several conservation scenarios.
some sites concentrate highly threatened and range-restricted evolutionary history of the mediterranean basin and their conservation could be much improved.
these sites are relevant for conservation studies aimed at designing new conservation actions to preserve evolutionary history and the option values it represents.
phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness are highly valuable components of biodiversity, but they are rarely considered in conservation practices.
