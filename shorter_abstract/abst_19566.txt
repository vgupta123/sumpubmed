the genome of b. mori has been fully sequenced while function analysis of bmchi-h and bmsuc <dig> genes revealed that horizontal gene transfer  maybe bestow a clear selective advantage to b. mori.
results from this study clearly demonstrated that hgts play an important role in the evolution of b. mori although the number of hgt events in b. mori is in general smaller than those of microbes and other insects.
ten candidate hgt events were defined in b. mori by comprehensive sequence analysis using maximum likelihood and bayesian method combining with est checking.
furthermore, functional analysis based on expression, coexpression and related literature searching revealed that several hgt candidate genes have added important characters, such as resistance to pathogen, to b. mori.
phylogenetic analysis of the candidate hgt genes suggested that one hgt was plant-to- b. mori transfer while nine were bacteria-to- b. mori transfer.
the domesticated silkworm, bombyx mori, is the model insect for the order lepidoptera, has economically important values, and has gained some representative behavioral characteristics compared to its wild ancestor.
in this study, we compare the whole genome of b. mori with those of  <dig> prokaryotic and eukaryotic species to investigate the potential hgts.
however, the role of hgt in the evolutionary history of b. mori is largely unexplored.
in particular, interdomain hgts in b. mori may give rise to functional, persistent, and possibly evolutionarily significant new genes.
