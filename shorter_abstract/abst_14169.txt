the results of this study show that leaves treated with calcium channels inhibitors  or calcium chelators  are impaired in ros production.
however the molecular mechanisms of this response and the signal cascade between the wound and ros production are still largely unknown.
these data further extend our knowledge on the connection between wounding, calcium influx and ros production.
this change in the cytosolic calcium was followed in the same region by a more stable ros burst.
moreover, leaves treated with verapamil, egta or oxalate were more susceptible to b. cinerea after wounding.
the intracellular measurements of calcium changes indicated quick but transient calcium dynamics taking place few seconds after wounding in cells neighbouring the wound site.
moreover they provide for the first time the evidence that, following wounding, calcium changes precede a burst in ros in the same location.
