the specialized organisms persist through negative frequency-dependent selection.
resource influx has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear transition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species evolving at low resource influx.
at low resource influx the degree of specialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more ecotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are.
we present a model to study the effects of trade-offs on specialization and adaptive radiation in asexual organisms based solely on competition for limiting resources, where trade-offs are stronger the greater an organismâ€™s ability to utilize resources.
the observation that several mutations are required to complete speciation, even when a single mutation creates the new species, highlights the gradual nature of speciation and the importance of phyletic evolution.
without trade-offs to restrain traits, generalists evolve and diversity decreases.
instead, it takes a series of additional mutations to ensure the stable coexistence of the new ecotype in the background of the existing ones.
we quantify the degree of specialization by the number of ecotypes evolved and the niche breadth of the population, and observe that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs.
