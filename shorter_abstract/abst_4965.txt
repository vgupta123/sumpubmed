the expected proportion of false positive genes in a set of genes, called the false discovery rate , has been proposed to measure the statistical significance of this set.
a r routine for computing local fdr estimates from p-values is available at .
using process intensity estimation methods, we define and give estimates of the local fdr, which may be considered as the probability for a gene to be a false positive.
after a global assessment rule controlling the false positive error, the local fdr is a valuable guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed.
the local fdr associated with each gene measures the probability that it is a false positive.
it gives the opportunity to compute the fdr of any given group of clones  or genes pertaining to the same regulation network or the same chromosomic region.
