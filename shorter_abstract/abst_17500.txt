whole-head meg was employed to study changes in cortical activation during this pharyngeal stimulation in nine healthy subjects.
our results revealed bilateral activation of the caudolateral primary somatosensory cortex following sensory pharyngeal stimulation with a slight lateralization to the side of stimulation.
the results are in keeping with previous findings showing bihemispheric involvement in the complex task of sensory pharyngeal processing.
we developed a simple paradigm to perform pneumatic stimulation to both sides of the pharyngeal wall.
they might also explain changes in deglutition after hemispheric strokes.
therefore an objective technique to examine the cortical processing of pharyngeal sensory input would be a helpful diagnostic tool in this context.
data were analyzed by means of synthetic aperture magnetometry  and the group analysis of individual sam data was performed using a permutation test.
the method introduced here is simple and easy to perform and might be applicable in the clinical setting.
