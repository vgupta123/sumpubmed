edgar is designed to automatically perform genome comparisons in a high throughput approach.
a main task in comparative genomics is the identification of orthologous genes in different genomes and the classification of genes as core genes or singletons.
comparative analyses for  <dig> genomes across  <dig> genus groups taken from the ncbi genomes database were conducted with the software and the results were integrated into an underlying database.
visualization features, like synteny plots or venn diagrams, are offered to the scientific community through a web-based and therefore platform independent user interface , where the precomputed data sets can be browsed.
edgar provides novel analysis features and significantly simplifies the comparative analysis of related genomes.
