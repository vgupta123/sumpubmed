in addition, brig supports the mapping of unassembled sequencing reads against one or more central reference sequences.
the output image shows similarity between a central reference sequence and other sequences as a set of concentric rings, where blast matches are coloured on a sliding scale indicating a defined percentage identity.
brig is readily accessible to any user, as it assumes no specialist computational knowledge and will perform all required file parsing and blast comparisons automatically.
visualising a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others.
several programs, imaging libraries and internet resources already exist for this purpose, however, most are either limited in the number of comparisons they can show, are unable to adequately utilise draft genome sequence data, or require a knowledge of command-line scripting for implementation.
there is a clear need for a user-friendly program that can produce genome comparisons for a large number of prokaryote genomes with an emphasis on rapidly utilising unfinished or unassembled genome data.
visualisation of genome comparisons is invaluable for helping to determine genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes.
blast ring image generator  can generate images that show multiple prokaryote genome comparisons, without an arbitrary limit on the number of genomes compared.
