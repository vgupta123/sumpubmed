fish analysis of  <dig> cnvs  in normal subjects resulted in the confirmation of copy number changes for  <dig> of  <dig> novel cnvs and  <dig> of  <dig> known cnvs.
a selection of cnvs was further analyzed by fish and real-time quantitative pcr .
genomic copy number variants  involving > <dig> kb of dna have recently been found to be widely distributed throughout the human genome.
this included the lack of copy number change by both rt-qpcr and fish for clone rp11-100c <dig>  one of the most common known copy number variants, as well as confirmation of deletions for clones rp11-89m <dig> and rp5-1011o <dig>
in order to understand their potential significance and to facilitate interpretation of array-cgh findings in constitutional disorders and cancers, we studied  <dig> normal individuals  using commercially available  <dig> mb resolution bac array .
further study of a small selection of cnvs indicated concordant and discordant array vs. fish/rt-qpcr results.
a total of  <dig> different cnvs were detected in  <dig> normal subjects.
although a large number of cnvs has been reported to date, quantification using independent methods and detailed cellular and/or molecular assessment has been performed on a very small number of cnvs.
we have described  <dig> novel cnvs in  <dig> individuals.
they represent a newly recognized form of dna variation in normal populations, discovered through screening of the human genome using high-throughput and high resolution methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization .
this information is, however, very much needed as it is currently common practice to consider cnvs reported in normal subjects as benign changes when detected in individuals affected with a variety of developmental disorders.
