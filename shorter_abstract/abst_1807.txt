the gene expressions at  <dig> and 72â€‰h after inoculation with fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes.
among  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the fhb-resistant dream cultivar.
especially abc transporter, udp-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley.
another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat.
fusarium head blight  caused by fusarium species like f. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat  worldwide.
resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to fhb resistance are still poorly understood.
a non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and gdsl-like lipase genes.
transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars dream  and lynx .
moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among fhb-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars dream and sumai  <dig>
mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality.
a comparative qpcr was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars dream and sumai  <dig> .
this was further supported in our qpcr experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars dream and sumai  <dig>  finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars.
