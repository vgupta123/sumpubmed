seeing that the ligand-target protein system in drug design and the substrate-enzyme system in enzyme applications share the similar molecular recognition mechanism, we aim to fulfill the goal of substrate screening by in silico means in the present study.
such high accuracy guaranteed the feasibility and reliability of the cass system.
although the case studied in this paper is tentative, high accuracy of the cass system sheds light on the field of computer-aided substrate screening.
however, experimental work for substrate screening of a new enzyme is laborious, time consuming and costly.
