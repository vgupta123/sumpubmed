identified variations in this study were successfully validated using visual examination of the genoplot image, mendelian inconsistency, another cnv identification program, and quantitative pcr.
among them, there were  <dig> common cnvrs with > 1% cnv frequency.
heritability errors of  <dig> bovine pedigrees and comparative pairwise analyses were analyzed to detect  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms.
in this study, we describe a map of bovine cnvs and provide important resources for future bovine genome research.
recently, the discovery of copy number variation  led researchers to think that there are more variations of genomic dna than initially believed.
for these animals, the average number of cnvs was  <dig> , average size was  <dig>  kb, and median size was  <dig>  kb.
in our study of cattle, we used illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  to obtain each marker's signal intensity  and allelic intensity , which led to our discovery of  <dig> bovine cnvs from  <dig> cows.
taking into consideration some overlapping regions among the identified bovine cnvs,  <dig> unique cnv regions were detected.
however, most cnv studies have only involved the human genome.
