collectively, these data implicate cdc25a as a key player in the developmentally regulated program of apoptosis in x. laevis embryos.
in order to assess the effect of wee <dig> on embryonic cell cycle remodeling, wee <dig> mrna was injected into one-cell stage embryos.
the cell cycles of the xenopus laevis embryo undergo extensive remodeling beginning at the midblastula transition  of early development.
some remodeling events depend upon a critical nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, whereas others rely on a maternal timer controlled by cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity.
furthermore, overexpression of wee <dig> disrupted key developmental events that normally occur at the mbt such as the degradation of cdc25a, cyclin e, and wee <dig>  overexpression of wee <dig> also resulted in post-mbt apoptosis, tyrosine phosphorylation of cdks and persistence of cyclin e/cdk <dig> activity.
to determine whether cdk <dig> was required specifically for the survival of the embryo, the cyclin e/cdk <dig> inhibitor, Δ34-xic <dig>  was injected in embryos and also shown to induce apoptosis.
taken together, these data suggest that wee <dig> triggers apoptosis through the disruption of the cyclin e/cdk <dig> timer.
overexpression of wee <dig> caused cell cycle delay and tyrosine phosphorylation of cdks prior to the mbt.
cell divisions 2– <dig> consist of rapid cleavages without gap phases or cell cycle checkpoints.
