f. esculentum  is also an important food crop.
normalized cdna corresponding to genes expressed in flowers and inflorescences of f. esculentum and f. tataricum was sequenced using the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology.
<dig> transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly was performed for two congeneric flowering plant species, f. esculentum and f. tataricum.
the sister relationships of the caryophyllales and asterids now gained high support from nuclear gene sequences.
these species, fagopyrum esculentum and f. tataricum, belong to the order caryophyllales - a large group of flowering plants with uncertain evolutionary relationships.
thirteen single-copy genes were used for phylogenetic analysis; the resulting trees are largely consistent with those inferred from multigenic plastid datasets.
we present here the results of transcriptome sequencing for two closely related plant species.
as a result, a large set of cdna sequences that represent orthologs of known plant genes as well as potential new genes was generated.
this resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  thousands of reads with average length of 341- <dig> nucleotides.
comparative analysis of two transcriptomes demonstrated their overall similarity but also revealed genes that are presumably differentially expressed.
however, despite advances in the technologies of dna sequencing, such data are lacking for many groups of living organisms, in particular, many plant taxa.
