this method involves the use of the styryl dye fm1- <dig> to estimate the release capacity of a synaptic terminal, and the subsequent post-hoc immunolabelling of thousands of individual nerve terminals.
we observed a strong correlation between the release capacity of the nerve terminal and the levels of the rim1α but not the munc13- <dig> protein in the active zone.
we have combined fluorescence imaging techniques using the styryl dye fm1- <dig> in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells with subsequent post-hoc immunocytochemistry in order to study synaptic efficiency in terms of vesicular release.
in this study we describe a technique that specifically correlates presynaptic activity with the levels of presynaptic markers.
we describe a protocol to easily quantify these results with minimal user intervention.
these results also demonstrate that this technique is a useful tool to analyse the molecular differences underlying the heterogeneous responses exhibited by neuronal networks.
presynaptic strength has been associated with the activity of several types of proteins, including the scaffolding proteins that form the active zone cytomatrix and the proteins involved in presynaptic exocytosis.
our findings support those of previous studies and point out to rim1α as a crucial factor in determining synaptic efficiency.
in terms of vesicular recycling, synaptic efficiency is a key determinant of the fidelity of synaptic transmission.
