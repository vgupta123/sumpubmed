moreover, starr automatically updates microarray probe annotation files by a highly efficient remapping of microarray probe sequences to an arbitrary genome.
the package provides functions for data import, quality assessment, data visualization and exploration.
we present a free, open-source r/bioconductor package starr that facilitates comparative analysis of chip-chip data across experiments and across different microarray platforms.
further investigation compares binding profiles of functionally related proteins, or binding profiles of the same proteins in different genetic backgrounds or experimental conditions.
starr includes high-level analysis tools such as the alignment of chip signals along annotated features, correlation analysis of chip signals with complementary genomic data, peak-finding and comparative display of multiple clusters of binding profiles.
