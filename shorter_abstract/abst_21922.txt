multiple myeloma  is an important human and canine cancer for which novel therapies remain necessary.
dose-dependent antiproliferative activity was observed in all evaluated cell lines.
major antitumor responses  were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> evaluable dogs for a median of  <dig> days, including a durable stringent complete response  in a dog with melphalan-refractory disease.
we evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative effects of vdc- <dig> against  <dig> human mm cell lines, and we performed a phase-ii clinical trial in  <dig> dogs with spontaneous mm.
<dig> dogs were euthanized due to presumed pulmonary fibrosis; there were no other dose-limiting toxicities encountered.
vdc- <dig> , a novel double prodrug of the anti-proliferative nucleotide analog 9- guanine , possesses potent cytotoxic activity in vitro in human lymphoblasts and leukemia cell lines and in vivo in spontaneous canine lymphoma.
