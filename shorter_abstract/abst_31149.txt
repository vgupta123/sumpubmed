in particular, our method can keep its high performance even when the sequence identity of family members is less than 60%.
clustering of unannotated transcripts is an important task to identify novel families of noncoding rnas .
several hierarchical clustering methods have been developed using similarity measures based on the scores of structural alignment.
however, the high computational cost of exact structural alignment requires these methods to employ approximate algorithms.
we approximate structural alignment in a more simplified manner than the existing methods.
instead, our method utilizes all possible sequence alignments and all possible secondary structures, whereas the existing methods only use one optimal sequence alignment and one optimal secondary structure.
such heuristics degrade the quality of clustering results, especially when the similarity among family members is not detectable at the primary sequence level.
the idea is that the reliability of approximate algorithms can be improved by utilizing the information of suboptimal solutions in their dynamic programming frameworks.
we describe a new similarity measure for the hierarchical clustering of ncrnas.
we demonstrate that this strategy can achieve the best balance between the computational cost and the quality of the clustering.
