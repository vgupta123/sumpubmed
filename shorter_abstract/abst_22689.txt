protein modification, signaling, gene expression, and response to dna damage.
animal and plant genomes produce numerous small rnas  that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally affecting metabolism, development, and epigenetic inheritance.
analysis of degs also revealed that minicircle-encoded photosynthesis proteins seem to be common targets of transcriptional regulation.
in order to characterize the repertoire of endogenous smrnas and potential gene targets in dinoflagellates, we conducted smrna and mrna expression profiling over  <dig> experimental treatments of cultures from symbiodinium microadriaticum, a photosynthetic symbiont of scleractinian corals.
we identified a set of  <dig> novel smrnas that share stringent key features with functional micrornas from other model organisms.
integration of smrna and mrna expression profiling identified a variety of processes that could be under microrna control, e.g.
