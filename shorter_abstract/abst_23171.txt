illumina paired-end reads are used to analyse microbial communities by targeting amplicons of the 16s rrna gene.
assembly of control libraries showed a 4-50% increase in the number of assembled sequences over na√Øve assembly with negligible loss of "good" sequence.
publicly available tools are needed to assemble overlapping paired-end reads while correcting mismatches and uncalled bases; many errors could be corrected to obtain higher sequence yields using quality information.
uncertain error corrections come from reads with many low-quality bases identified by upstream processing.
