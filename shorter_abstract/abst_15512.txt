the amenability of c. briggsae to genetic manipulations and the availability of its genome sequence have prompted researchers to study evolutionary changes in gene function and signaling pathways.
the utility of polymorphisms in genetic studies was demonstrated by successful mapping of  <dig> mutations, including  <dig> that were localized to sub-chromosomal regions.
the nematode c. briggsae serves as a useful model organism for comparative analysis of developmental and behavioral processes.
we also show that molecular markers can be useful tools to improve the c. briggsae genome sequence assembly.
our polymorphism resource promises to accelerate genetic and functional studies of c. briggsae genes.
we have computationally identified more than  <dig>  polymorphisms  in c. briggsae strains af <dig> and hk <dig>  these include  <dig>  snps that change restriction enzyme recognition sites  and  <dig> indels that range between  <dig> bp and  <dig> kb.
we report a comprehensive set of polymorphisms in c. briggsae wild-type strains and demonstrate their use in mapping mutations.
