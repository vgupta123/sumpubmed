cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation  and restored to a normoxic glucose-supplied condition.
the results of this study provide new insights that may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to reduce cerebral ischemic injuries.
cell viability was evaluated by hoechest/propidium iodide nuclear staining and lactate dehydrogenase assay.
agmatine, an endogenous polyamine catalyzed from l-arginine by arginine decarboxylase , is a neuromodulator and it protects neurons/glia against various injuries.

expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase  and matrix metalloproteinase s  were assessed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western immunoblots, and immunofluorescence.
intracellular levels of agmatine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography.
a large body of experimental evidence has shown that impaired astrocytes play crucial roles in the pathologic process of cerebral ischemia; therefore, astrocytes may represent a breakthrough target for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.
our findings imply that astrocytes can be reinforced against oxidative stress by endogenous agmatine production through adc gene transduction.
in this investigation, agmatine-producing mouse cortical astrocytes were developed through transduction of the human adc gene.
in physiologic and pathologic conditions of the central nervous system , astrocytes are a double-edged sword.
these cells were highly resistant to not only ogd but also restoration, which mimicked ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo.
