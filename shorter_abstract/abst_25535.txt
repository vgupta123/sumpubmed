neutral trehalase  hydrolyzes trehalose, which plays a role in environmental stress response in many organisms, including m. acridum.
we selected four ntl over-expression and four ntl rna interference  transformations in which ntl expression is different.
ntl controlled trehalose accumulation in m. acridum by degrading trehalose, and thus affected conidiospore thermotolerance.
demonstration of a relationship between ntl and thermotolerance or virulence may offer a new strategy for enhancing conidiospore thermotolerance of entomopathogenic fungi through genetic engineering.
these results offer a new strategy for enhancing conidiospore thermotolerance of entomopathogenic fungi without affecting virulence.
compared to the wild-type, ntl mrna expression was reduced to 35-66% in the rnai mutants and increased by  <dig> - <dig> -fold in the over-expression mutants.
the opposite effects were found in conidiospores of over-expression mutants compared to rnai mutants.
the entomopathogenic fungus metarhizium acridum has been used as an important biocontrol agent instead of insecticides for controlling crop pests throughout the world.
furthermore, virulence was not altered in the two types of mutants compared to the wild type.
the rnai conidiospores exhibited less trehalase activity, accumulated more trehalose, and were much more tolerant of heat stress than the wild-type.
