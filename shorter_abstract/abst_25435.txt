we present here a family of methods, the analyses with respect to instrumental variables, which can be easily applied to the particular case of microarray data.
an illustrative example of analysis with instrumental variables is given in the case of microarray data investigating the effect of beverage intake on peripheral blood gene expression.
instrumental variables analyses provide a simple way to control several sources of variation in a multivariate analysis of microarray data.
evaluating the importance of the different sources of variations is essential in microarray data experiments.
