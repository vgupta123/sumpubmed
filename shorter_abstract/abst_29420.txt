therefore, this study is aimed to investigate potential prenatal and early postnatal influence of tocotrienol-rich fraction  supplementation on cognitive function development in male offspring rats.
based on these results, it is concluded that prenatal and postnatal trf supplementation improved cognitive function development in male progeny rats.
recent findings suggest that the intake of specific nutrients during the critical period in early life influence cognitive and behavioural development profoundly.
results showed that prenatal and postnatal trf supplementation increased the brain  and plasma α-tocotrienol  levels in male off-springs.
there is also notably better cognitive performance based on the morris water maze test among these male off-springs.
antioxidants such as vitamin e have been postulated to be pivotal in this process, as vitamin e is able to protect the growing brain from oxidative stress.
the animals were fed either with the base diet as control , base diet plus vehicle , base diet plus docosahexanoic acid , base diet plus tocotrienol-rich fraction , and base diet plus both docosahexaenoic acid, and tocotrienol rich fraction  diets for 2 weeks prior to mating.
