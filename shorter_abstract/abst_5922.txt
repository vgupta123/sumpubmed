to cover the remaining untagged genes, we identified  <dig> additional gsts using less stringent design criteria and designed  <dig> sequence tags matching multiple members of gene families  to cover any remaining untagged genes.
these gst amplicons can easily be reamplified and shared, subsets can be picked at will to print dedicated arrays, and the gsts can be cloned and used for other functional studies.
to update the catma gst repertoire, we designed  <dig>  additional sequence tags, bringing the total number of tagged tair6-annotated arabidopsis nuclear protein-coding genes to  <dig> .
to complete the catma repertoire, all  <dig>  gene models for which no gst had yet been designed were processed with an adjusted version of the specific primer and amplicon design software .
gsts from the catma version  <dig> repertoire  were mapped onto the gene models from two independent arabidopsis nuclear genome annotation efforts, tigr <dig> and psb-eugène, to consolidate a list of genes that were targeted by previously designed catma tags.
a total of  <dig>  gene models were not tagged by any amplified catmav <dig> gst, and  <dig>  amplified gsts were no longer predicted to tag an updated gene model.
it comprises  <dig>  unique amplified sequences that tag  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein-encoding nuclear gene models in the tair <dig> and eugène genome annotations, respectively.
to validate the efficacy of gst mapping criteria and design rules, the predicted and experimentally observed hybridization characteristics associated to gst features were correlated in transcript profiling datasets obtained with the catmav <dig> microarray, confirming the reliability of this platform.
the complete arabidopsis transcript microarray  initiative combines the efforts of laboratories in eight european countries  <cit>  to deliver gene-specific sequence tags  for the arabidopsis research community.
all information about the resulting updated catma repertoire is available through the catma database http://www.catma.org.
a total of  <dig>  novel gsts were designed and amplified by pcr from genomic dna.
