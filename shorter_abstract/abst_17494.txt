the modern loquat cultivars have experienced a non-significant genetic bottleneck during domestication, and originated from a single domesticated event.
the process of crop domestication has long been a major area of research to gain insights into the history of human civilization and to understand the process of evolution.
moreover, our study revealed that hubei province of china is probably the origin center of cultivated loquat.
the snp density and numbers were slightly higher in the wild loquat populations than that in the cultivated populations.
all cultivars were clustered together by structure, phylogenetic and pca analyses.
in the present study, we re-sequenced the genome of nine wild loquat accessions collected from wide geographical range and  <dig> representative cultivated loquat cultivars by using rad-tag tacit to exploit the molecular footprints of domestication.
