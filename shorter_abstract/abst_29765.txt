u-box ubiquitin ligases  are proteins characterized by containing a peculiar protein domain known as u box.
the patterns of emergence and diversification of the families of ubiquitin ligases provide insights about the evolution of the eukaryotic ubiquitination system.
these general patterns are highly congruent with those found for other two families  of ubiquitin ligases.
finding that the patterns of emergence, diversification and loss of three unrelated families of ubiquitin ligases  are parallel indicates that there are underlying, linage-specific evolutionary forces shaping the complexity of the animal ubiquitin system.
the fact that only  <dig> -  <dig> genes orthologous to the human ones are present in the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis suggests that several animal-specific cooptions of the u box to generate new genes occurred.
