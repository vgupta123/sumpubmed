study of inbreeding effects in specific traits, such as age-specific mortality and life span, provide a good starting point, as a limited set of genes is expected to be involved.
however, the complex and polygenic nature of general inbreeding depression makes this a daunting task.
we found the genetic basis of the lethal effect to be relatively simple, being due mainly to a single recessive qtl on the left arm of chromosome  <dig>  this locus colocalised with a qtl that conditioned variation in female life span, acting as an overdominant locus for this trait.
still, the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon remains poorly characterised, as knowledge on the mechanistic causes of inbreeding depression and the molecular properties of genes that give rise to or modulate its deleterious effects is lacking.
male life span was additionally affected by variation at the x-chromosome.
the study of inbreeding depression has major relevance for many disciplines, including conservation genetics and evolutionary biology.
this demonstrates that analysis of large conditional lethal effects is a viable strategy for delineating genes which are sensitive to inbreeding depression.
