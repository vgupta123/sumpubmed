additional loci enriched for srna production were identified and characterised.
the most abundant size class of srnas were  <dig> nt.
additionally, some repetitive elements were associated with  <dig> nt srnas.
short rnas, and in particular micrornas, are important regulators of gene expression both within defined regulatory pathways and at the epigenetic scale.
we investigated the short rna  population  of the transcriptome of green leaves from the sequenced populus trichocarpa using a concatenation strategy in combination with  <dig> sequencing.
we identified  <dig> novel predicted micrornas , including mirna*sequences, and identified a novel locus that may encode a dual mirna or a mirna and short interfering rnas .
we identified an srna hot-spot on chromosome  <dig>  overlapping a region containing both the proposed sex-determining locus and a major cluster of nbs-lrr genes.
