from the over  <dig>  million taxonomic names that are part of the ubio system  <cit> , approximately  <dig> million names were identified to have taxonomic authority information from the years  <dig> to  <dig>  a pipe-delimited file was then generated, organized according to a linnaean hierarchy and by years from  <dig> to  <dig>  and imported into an excel workbook.
we have developed an excel workbook and complementary web site that enables one to explore taxonomic trends for linnaean taxonomic groupings, from kingdoms to families.
authority and year information have been attached to taxonomic names since linnaean times.
the findings also help quantify the number of taxonomic descriptions that may be made available through digitization initiatives.
