in central asia, where the disease was confirmed only recently, no positive animals were detected in the wakhan district of afghanistan or across the border in neighboring areas of tajikistan, whereas seroprevalence varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the other districts investigated and in northern pakistan.
this newly formatted ccpp celisa kit has retained the high specificity of the original kit.
the lack of a more specific test has been a real obstacle to the evaluation of the prevalence and economic impact of ccpp worldwide.
the complement fixation test, the test prescribed for international trade purposes, uses a crude antigen that cross-reacts with all the other mycoplasma species of the “mycoides cluster” frequently infecting goat herds.
the strict specificity of the test was confirmed in ccpp-free goat herds exposed to other mycoplasma species of the “mycoides cluster”.
it could also be used to monitor the efficacy of vaccination campaigns as high-quality vaccines induce high rates of seroconversion.
seroprevalence was estimated at  <dig> % in the afar region of ethiopia, whereas all the herds presented for ccpp vaccination in kenya tested positive .
prevalence studies were performed across the enzootic range of the disease in africa and asia.
