tissue plasminogen activator  is known to have functions beyond fibrinolysis in acute ischemic stroke, such as blood brain barrier disruption.
tpa modulates gene expression in the blood of rats involving immune cells in a manner that is dependent on the status of vascular reperfusion.
to further delineate tpa functions in the blood, we examined the gene expression profiles induced by tpa in a rat model of ischemic stroke.
the majority of genes regulated by tpa were different from genes regulated by ischemic stroke.
tpa gene expression was found to be dependent on the reperfusion status of cerebral vasculature.
genes identified had functions related to modulation of immune cells.
