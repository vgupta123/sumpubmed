we show that depletion of gdf <dig>  resulted in a reduction in eye size, loss of laminar structure and a reduction in differentiated neural cell types within the retina.
neural cell adhesion molecule  is generally reduced in intensity along the neural tube, while in the retina and brain discreet patches of ncam expression are also lost.
gdf <dig> knock down resulted in an increase in cell death along the neural tube and within the retina as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  staining.
our data demonstrate that gdf <dig> has an important role in neural differentiation in the eye as well as within the central nervous system, and that gdf <dig> may act in some way to maintain cell survival within the ectoderm, during the normal waves of programmed cell death.
here we address the role of gdf <dig> in neural and eye development by morpholino knockdown experiments.
in xenopus the bone morphogenetic protein growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  is expressed at the edge of the neural plate, and within the anterior neural plate including the eye fields.
