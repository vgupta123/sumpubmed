we found previously unknown relationship between chemotaxis and electron transfer using la system.
we utilize the novel statistical method, liquid association , to investigate the complex pattern of gene regulation.
to shed light on this problem, we obtain the gene expression datasets of mr- <dig> that are recently public-accessible in gene expression omnibus.
