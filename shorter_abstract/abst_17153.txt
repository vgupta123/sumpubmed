significant interactions of qtl by sex allowed detection of sex-specific and sex-antagonistic qtl for body composition and abdominal fat.
in addition, the incorporation of gene-gene interactions in the statistical model provides further insight into the genetic factors that underlie body composition traits.
an understanding of such regulatory mechanisms is key to mapping specific genes that underlie qtl controlling somatic growth in an avian model.
delineating the genetic basis of body composition is important to agriculture and medicine.
we identified  <dig> qtl with main effects across  <dig> chromosomes and several sex-specific and sex-antagonistic qtl for breast meat yield, thigh + drumstick yield and abdominal fatness.
we found several female-specific p. major qtl and sex-antagonistic p. minor and abdominal fatness qtl.
also, several qtl on different chromosomes interact with each other to affect body composition and abdominal fatness.
we used bayesian model selection to comprehensively map main, epistatic and sex-specific qtl in an f <dig> reciprocal intercross between two chicken lines divergently selected for high or low growth rate.
