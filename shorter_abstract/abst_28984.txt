lysogenisation of phage sfiv converted serotype y strain to serotype 4a.
the sfiv phage has a host range significantly different from the other phages of shigella.
the comparative analysis also revealed that sfiv phage contained five proteins which were not found in any other phages of s. flexneri.
these proteins were: a tail fiber assembly protein, two hypothetical proteins with no clear function, and two other unknown proteins which were encoded by orfs present on a moron, that presumably got introduced in sfiv genome from another species via a transposon.
electron microscopy indicated that sfiv belongs to myoviridae family.
in this study, a novel temperate serotype converting bacteriophage sfiv was isolated.
this study reports the isolation and complete genome sequence analysis of bacteriophage sfiv.
the o-antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide is one of the key virulence determinants required for the pathogenesis of s. flexneri.
the glucosyltransferase and/or acetyltransferase genes responsible for the modification of the o-antigen are encoded by temperate serotype converting bacteriophage present in the s. flexneri genome.
protein level comparison of sfiv with other serotype converting phages of s. flexneri revealed that sfiv is similar to phage sfii and sfv.
these findings will further our understanding on the evolution of these phages, and will also facilitate studies on development of new phage vectors and therapeutic agents to control infections caused by s. flexneri.
