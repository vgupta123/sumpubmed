recent studies have shown that the human right-hemispheric auditory cortex is particularly sensitive to reduction in sound quality, with an increase in distortion resulting in an amplification of the auditory n1m response measured in the magnetoencephalography .
we degraded speech stimuli , complex non-speech stimuli , and sinusoidal tones by decreasing the amplitude resolution of the signal waveform.
we found that the aef amplitudes increased significantly with stimulus distortion for all stimulus types, which indicates that the right-hemispheric n1m sensitivity is not related exclusively to degradation of acoustic properties of speech.
we propose that the increased activity of aefs reflects cortical processing of acoustic properties common to both speech and non-speech stimuli.
here, we examined whether this sensitivity is specific to the processing of acoustic properties of speech or whether it can be observed also in the processing of sounds with a simple spectral structure.
more specifically, the enhancement is most likely caused by spectral changes brought about by the decrease of amplitude resolution, in particular the introduction of periodic, signal-dependent distortion to the original sound.
in addition, the p1m and p2m responses were amplified with increasing distortion similarly in both hemispheres.
the aef latencies were not systematically affected by the distortion.
the amplitude resolution was impoverished by reducing the number of bits to represent the signal samples.
auditory evoked magnetic fields  were measured in the left and right hemisphere of sixteen healthy subjects.
