the diatom cdka <dig> was originally assigned to the classical a-type cdks, but its cell cycle phase-specific transcription at the g2-to-m phase transition is typical for plant-specific b-type cdks.
through a yeast two-hybrid library screen, cdka <dig> was found to interact with the g2/m-specific cdk scaffolding factor cks <dig>  localization of cdka <dig> was found to be nuclear in interphase cells, while in cells undergoing cytokinesis, the signal extended to the cell division plane.
expression analysis of cell cycle marker genes in the overexpression lines indicates that this growth reduction is primarily due to a prolongation of the mitotic phase.
cyclin-dependent kinases  are crucial regulators of cell cycle progression in eukaryotes.
here, we report the functional characterization of cdka <dig> from the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum.
the functional characterization of a cdk with clear cdkb properties in a non-green organism questions whether the current definition of b-type cdks being plant-specific might need revision.
in addition, overexpression of cdka <dig> induced an overall reduction in the cell growth rate.
