the overall expression pattern from posidonia rhizome was determined using a preliminary proteomic approach,  <dig> protein spots were characterized by pi and molecular weight.
human activities and natural events are responsible for a widespread meadows regression; to date the identification of "diagnostic" tools to monitor conservation status is a critical issue.
these differences may account for changes in metabolic/physiological pathways as adaptation to stress.
a combined approach, based on phenols content determination and 2-d electrophoresis protein pattern, seems a promising tool to monitor posidonia meadows health state.
the endemic seagrass posidonia oceanica  delile colonizes soft bottoms producing highly productive meadows that play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems dynamics.
phenols content, has been coupled to 2-d electrophoretic protein analysis of rhizome samples.
posidonia showed phenols variations within the meadow, that probably reflect the heterogeneity of environmental pressures.
we found that protein expression differs in samples belonging to sites with high or low phenols:  <dig> unique protein spots are peculiar of "low phenols" and  <dig> other spots characterize "high phenols" samples.
quantification of a putative stress indicator, i.e.
