we identified the suites of genes in the two gene families in populus and performed comparative genomic analysis with arabidopsis and rice.
poptriaa and poptrarf gene families appear to have expanded due to high segmental and low tandem duplication events.
the present study examines the extent of conservation and divergence in the structure and evolution of populus aux/iaa and arf gene families with respect to arabidopsis and rice.
the gene-family analysis reported here will be useful in conducting future functional genomics studies to understand how the molecular roles of these large gene families translate into a diversity of biologically meaningful auxin effects.
a total of  <dig> aux/iaa and  <dig> arf genes were identified in the populus genome.
activator arf genes were found to be two fold-overrepresented in the populus genome.
