similarly, the transcriptional changes associated with this pathway have been studied in different organisms and different cell types.
cell division is central to the physiology and pathology of all eukaryotic organisms.
two clusters in particular, containing  <dig> transcripts, showed patterns of expression consistent with cell cycle occurrence across the four human cell types assessed.
in a recent comparison of transcriptomic studies of the cell cycle in different human cell types, only  <dig> cell cycle genes were reported to be the same across all studies examined.
our analysis shows that there is a far greater conservation of cell cycle-associated gene expression across human cell types than reported previously, which can be separated into two distinct transcriptional networks associated with the g1/s-s and g2-m phases of the cell cycle.
the molecular machinery underpinning the cell cycle has been studied extensively in a number of species and core aspects of it have been found to be highly conserved.
here we perform a systematic re-examination of published human cell cycle expression data by using a network-based approach to identify groups of genes with a similar expression profile and therefore function.
