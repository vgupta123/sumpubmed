our results demonstrate that t. vaginalis expresses thousands of intergenic loci, including numerous transcribed pseudogenes.
expression of several representative lncrnas was verified through reverse-transcriptase pcr in different t. vaginalis strains and case studies exclude the use of alternative start codons or stop codon suppression for the genes analysed.

our results furthermore illustrate the effect genome duplication events can have on the transcriptome of a protist.
among transcriptome data we found thousands of instances, in which reads mapped onto genomic loci not annotated as genes, some reaching up to several kilobases in length.
at first sight these appear to represent long non-coding rnas , however, about half of these lncrnas have significant sequence similarities to genomic loci annotated as protein-coding genes.
the parasite’s genome is in a steady state of changing and we hypothesize that the numerous lncrnas could offer a large pool for potential innovation from which novel proteins or regulatory rna units could evolve.
