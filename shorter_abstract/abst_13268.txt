food isolates were widely dispersed in the mlst tree and could not be distinguished from the other strains.
the result of the mlst analysis supported previous findings of two different subgroups  within this species, named “a” and “b” statistical analysis of the mlst data indicated a higher rate of recombination within group “a”.
this scheme could be used for further studies of evolution and population genetics in b. licheniformis.
bacillus licheniformis has for many years been used in the industrial production of enzymes, antibiotics and detergents.
however, as a producer of dormant heat-resistant endospores b. licheniformis might contaminate semi-preserved foods.
the aim of this study was to establish a robust and novel genotyping scheme for b. licheniformis in order to reveal the evolutionary history of  <dig> strains of this species.
a multi-locus sequence typing  scheme, based on the sequence of six house-keeping genes  of  <dig> b. licheniformis strains from different sources was established.
however, the food contaminating strain b. licheniformis nvh <dig>  represented by a unique sequence type , was distantly related to all other strains.
in this study, a novel and robust genotyping scheme for b. licheniformis was established, separating the species into two subgroups.
