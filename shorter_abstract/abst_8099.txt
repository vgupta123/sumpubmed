the proposed methodology;  is easy to implement,  does not require inverting potentially singular covariance matrices, and  controls the family wise error rate  at the desired nominal level,  is robust to the underlying distribution and covariance structures.
although for simplicity of exposition, the methodology is described for microarray gene expression data, it is also applicable to any high dimensional data, such as the mrna seq data, cpg methylation data etc.
this may result in loss of power and/or inflated false positive rate.
using this methodology, a biologist may not only determine whether a set of variables are differentially expressed between two experimental conditions, but may also test whether specific subsets within a significant set are also significant.
biologists are often interested in determining whether some pre-defined sets of variables  are differentially expressed under varying experimental conditions.
we introduce a multiple testing-based methodology which makes use of available information regarding biologically relevant subsets within each pre-defined set of variables while exploiting the underlying dependence structure among the variables.
