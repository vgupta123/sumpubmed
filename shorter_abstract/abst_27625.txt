we know little about the coordinated regulation of gene expression patterns in distant somatic tissues that support the developmental cost of gamete production.
our results show that germline-dependent expression in the non-gonadal soma is extensive.
drosophila females commit tremendous resources to egg production and males produce some of the longest sperm in the animal kingdom.
we determined the non-gonadal gene expression patterns of drosophila females and males with or without a germline.
interestingly, gene expression patterns and hormone titers are consistent with a hormone axis between the gonads and non-gonadal soma.
the germline has a long-range influence on gene expression in the drosophila sexes.
