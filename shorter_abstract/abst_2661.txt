synteny analysis and evolution rates suggest that the genome organization of tamet <dig> genes results from a whole genome duplication shared within the grass family, and a second gene duplication, which occurred specifically in the triticeae tribe prior to the speciation of diploid wheat.
we show the connection between low expression levels, elevated evolution rates and unexpected enrichment in cg-dinucleotides  at putative promoter regions of homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig>  but not of group  <dig> tamet <dig> genes.
plant and animal methyltransferases are key enzymes involved in dna methylation at cytosine residues, required for gene expression control and genome stability.
we retraced the evolutionary history of met <dig> genes in wheat, explaining the predominance of group  <dig> homoeologous genes and suggest cg-dna methylation as one of the mechanisms involved in wheat genome dynamics.
taking advantage of the new sequence surveys of the wheat genome recently released by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium, we identified and characterized met <dig> genes in the hexaploid wheat triticum aestivum .
higher expression levels were observed for tamet <dig> homoeologous group  <dig> genes compared to group  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that group  <dig> homoeologous genes are predominant at the transcriptional level, while group  <dig> evolved into pseudogenes.
