here we report that: 1) dopamine-depletion did not affect vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> expression but significantly decreased that of vglut <dig> in almost all bg structures studied; 2) stn-hfs did not change vglut1- <dig> expression in the different brain areas of normal rats while, on the contrary, it systematically induced a significant increase of their expression in da-depleted rats and 3) stn-hfs reversed the decrease in vglut <dig> expression induced by the da-depletion.
these results show for the first time a comparative analysis of changes of expression for the three vgluts induced by stn-hfs in the bg network of normal and hemiparkinsonian rats.

they provide evidence for the involvement of vglut <dig> in the modulation of bg cicuits and in particular that of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical pathways suggesting their key role in its therapeutic effects for alleviating pd motor symptoms.
vesicular glutamate transporters  import glutamate into synaptic vesicles and are key anatomical and functional markers of glutamatergic excitatory transmission.
