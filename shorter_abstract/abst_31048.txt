this introduces a potentially severe error in the estimation of bacteria present in the sample due to false positives, since all species in the subtree rooted at the ancestor are implicitly assigned to the read even though many of them may not match it.
to characterize the diversity of bacterial populations in metagenomic studies, sequencing reads need to be accurately assigned to taxonomic units in a given reference taxonomy.
we present a method that maps each read to a node in the taxonomy that minimizes a penalty score while balancing the relevance of precision and recall in the assignment through a parameter q. this mapping can be obtained in time linear in the number of matching sequences, because lca queries to the reference taxonomy take constant time.
validation of our results in an artificial dataset confirm that a combination of values of q produces the most accurate results.
the assignment strategy of sequencing reads introduced in this paper is a versatile and a quick method to study bacterial communities.
finally, two measures of performance are described and results with a set of artificially generated datasets are discussed.
reads that cannot be reliably assigned to a unique leaf in the taxonomy  are typically assigned to the lowest common ancestor of the set of species that match it.
the bacterial composition of the analyzed samples can vary significantly depending on how ambiguous reads are assigned depending on the value of the q parameter.
