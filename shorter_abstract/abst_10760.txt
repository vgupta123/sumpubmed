according to their proposed function as cation entry pathways these channels contribute to cellular cation homeostasis, including calcium and sodium, as well as to stress-related signal transduction.
no differences in k and na contents of the shoots were measured in homozygous t-dna insertion lines for cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  respectively, which developed a growth phenotype in the presence of up to  <dig> mm nacl similar to that of the wild type.
cngc <dig> showed highest promoter activity in mesophyll cells surrounding the veins.
it occurred with similar kinetics, irrespective of whether nacl was applied to roots of intact plants or to the petiole of detached leaves.
gus, gfp and luciferase reporter assays were used to study the expression of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> genes from arabidopsis thaliana in response to developmental cues and salt stress.
cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> could assist the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress, probably by contributing to a re-allocation of sodium within the plant.
together, the results strongly suggest that both channels are involved in the salinity response of different cell types in the shoot.
