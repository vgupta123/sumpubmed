although improvement of the discovery rate is still needed, this approach is applicable to many agricultural systems with limited genomic resources.
this method has been utilized in a few different plants to discover genetic variation, using affymetrix arrays that exist for only a few organisms.
melon, among other crops, is still lagging in genomic resources, limiting the ability to discover new markers in a high-throughput fashion.
the creation of these maps is dependent on marker discovery.
we applied this approach with some modifications for marker discovery in melon.
genetic maps constitute the basis of breeding programs for many agricultural organisms.
microarray hybridization of dna from different accessions can reveal differences between them--single-feature polymorphisms .
one of the methods used to search for molecular markers is dna hybridization to microarrays.
