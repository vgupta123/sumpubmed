to allow the independent regulation of multiple genes, novel tet systems are being developed that respond to different effectors and bind to different teto sites.
we recently identified amino acid substitutions in rtta that greatly improved the transcriptional activity and doxycycline-sensitivity of the protein.
we thus generated a novel sc-rtta variant that is almost as active and dox-sensitive as the regular dimeric rtta.
the tet-off  and tet-on  regulatory systems are widely applied to control gene expression in eukaryotes.
this variant was also less sensitive to interference by co-expressed tetr-based tts repressor protein and may therefore be more suitable for applications where multiple tetr-based regulatory systems are used.
we developed an improved sc-rtta variant that may replace regular rtta in applications where multiple tetr-based regulatory systems are used.
whereas none of the tested mutations improved tta activity, they did significantly enhance sc-rtta activity.
unfortunately, the activity of the single-chain rtta  is reduced when compared with the regular rtta, which might limit its application.
