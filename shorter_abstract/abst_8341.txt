further, the diversity in the lin gene sequences and copy number, their arrangement with respect to is <dig> and evidence for potential plasmid content elucidate possible evolutionary acquisition mechanisms for this pathway.
are efficient degraders of a wide range of chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbons.
isolated from hch dumpsites, with three existing genomes .
the bacteria isolated from hch dumpsites provide a natural testing ground to study variations in the lin system and their effects on degradation efficacy.
in particular, strains which harbour the lin pathway genes mediating the degradation of hexachlorocyclohexane  isomers are of interest due to the widespread persistence of this contaminant.
here, we examined the evolution and diversification of the lin pathway under the selective pressure of hch, by comparing the draft genomes of six newly-sequenced sphingobium spp.
while strains hdipo <dig> and ip <dig> contained the complete set of lin genes, ds <dig> was entirely devoid of lin genes  whereas, ll <dig>  p <dig> and rl <dig> were identified as lin deficient strains, as they housed incomplete lin pathways.
genes associated with nitrogen stress response and two-component systems were found to be enriched.
this study further opens the horizon for selection of bacterial strains for inclusion in an hch bioremediation consortium and suggests that hdipo <dig>  ip <dig> and b90a would be appropriate candidates for inclusion.

less than 10% of the total gene content was shared among all nine strains, but among the eight hch-associated strains, that is all except syk <dig>  the shared gene content jumped to nearly 25%.
