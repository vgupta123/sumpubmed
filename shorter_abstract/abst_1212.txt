here we built on previous work to characterize crucial chemosensory tissues linked to environmental interactions including larval antennae, larval mouthparts and larval fat bodies, as well as male and female adult heads, male and female adult tarsi, and female abdomens.
chemosensory receptors including olfactory receptors , gustatory receptors  and ionotropic receptors  play a central role in sensing chemical signals and guiding insect behaviours, and are potential target genes in insect pest control.
harmor <dig> in calcium imaging analysis did not show responses to either of the two h. armigera sex pheromone components  inviting a future detailed study.
our results have now provided an extensive resource for investigating the chemoreceptor complement of this insect pest, and meanwhile allow for targeted experiments to identify potential molecular targets for pest control and to investigate insect-plant interactions.
finally, our expression profiling showed that four “divergent” harmirs  were expressed in both adult and larval antennae, suggesting a functional divergence from their drosophila homologues.
this diversity of host plants is likely linked to a complex chemosensory system.
using transcriptome sequencing, trinity rna-seq assemblies and extensive manual curation, we identified a total of  <dig> candidate chemosensory receptors .
further, we created extensive expression profiles using reverse transcription -pcr on a variety of adult and larval stages.
we found that the expression profile of harmor <dig> was limited to adult male antenna suggesting a role in mating that was further supported by a phylogenetic analysis clustering it into the pheromone receptor clade.
