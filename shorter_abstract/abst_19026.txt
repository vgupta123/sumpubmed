this is a clear example where biological ergodicity cannot be assumed, just as is also the case when cell replication rates are not homogeneous, or depend on the cell state.
we also show how a simple linear adaptation scheme displays fold-change detection properties, and how rupture of ergodicity prevails in scenarios where transitions between protein states are mediated by other molecular species in the system, such as phosphatases and kinases.
in cell signaling terminology, adaptation refers to a system's capability of returning to its equilibrium upon a transient response.
by consequence, adaptation can many times be considered a purely emergent property of the collective system.
we present models of the simplest adaptation architecture, a two-state protein system, in a stochastic setting.
single cell behavior cannot be inferred from population measurements and, sometimes, collective behavior cannot be determined from the individuals.
