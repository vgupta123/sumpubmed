a purified llo preparation was obtained by affinity chromatography.
we demonstrated the possibility of regulating llo activity by adjusting cell membrane cholesterol content.
listeriolysin o  is the main virulence factor of listeria monocytogenes and facilitates the intracellular survival of the pathogen.
importantly, the cytotoxic activity was easily regulated in vitro and could be restricted to areas containing malignant cells, raising the possibility of future clinical application of llo for leukaemia treatment.
the llo preparation had haemolytic activity and had a cytotoxic effect on the human t-leukaemia jurkat cell line as well as mouse and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
llo has a very potent cytotoxic activity towards human leukocytes.
the llo preparation procedure was optimized and purified llo was tested for optimal conditions of storage including temperature, application of proteinase inhibitors and serum components.
