using a fluorescent conjugate of the actin binding drug cytochalasin d  we provide evidence that polymerising actin accumulates in vicinity to the ne.
we conclude that actin polymerisation occurs around interphase nuclei of living cells at the cytoplasmic phase of ne-membranes.
consistent with the idea that the cytoplasmic phase of ne-membranes can support this novel pool of perinuclear actin polymerisation we show that isolated, intact, differentiated primary hepatocyte nuclei support actin polymerisation in vitro.
there exists abundant molecular and ultra-structural evidence to suggest that cytoplasmic actin can physically interact with the nuclear envelope  membrane system.
in addition, both transiently expressed fluorescent actin and cytoplasmic micro-injection of fluorescent actin resulted in accumulation of actin at the ne-membrane.
