finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods.
in combination with the increasingly widespread usage of 3d printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users.
this enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns.
however, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays.
the printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose.
their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope.
