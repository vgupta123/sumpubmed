horizontal gene transfer  is an important process, which contributes in bacterial pathogenesis and drug resistance.
a number of methods have been proposed for detection of horizontal gene transfer.
on the other hand, genes transferred within the bacterial phyla are mainly involved in translation.
one successful approach to the detection of hgt events is due to novichkov et al.
in combination with sequence similarity and likelihood tests, it yields a measure robust enough to derive a set of  <dig> genes deemed likely to have been horizontally transferred.
genes transferred between the archaea and bacteria are mostly metabolic genes.
the majority of transfers between archaea and bacteria have occurred in the direction from bacteria to archaea rather than the other way round.
further analysis of these  <dig> established horizontal transfer events gave interesting insights in the direction of transfer.
, who rely on comparing phylogenetic distances within a gene family with genomic distances of the source organisms.
simulations indicated that our method performs better than novichkov et al's original approach.
the principle behind method allows detection of xenologous gene displacements as well as acquisition of novel genes.
the approach very efficiently identified hgt between distantly related bacteria and also a limited number of gene transfers between closely related bacteria.
