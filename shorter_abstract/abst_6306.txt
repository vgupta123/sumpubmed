to map the expression patterns of many genes into the same coordinate space and account for the embryonic shape variations, we develop a mesh generation method to deform a meshed generic ellipse to each individual embryo.
recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have generated spatiotemporal expression patterns for thousands of genes in the model organism fruit fly drosophila melanogaster.
currently, a fundamental challenge in regulatory biology is to elucidate the gene expression controls that generate the complex body plans during development.
we develop a set of computational methods and open source tools for identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously.
our mesh generation and machine learning methods and tools improve upon the flexibility, ease-of-use and accuracy of existing methods.
experimental results indicate that the gene and mesh co-clusters can be correlated to key developmental events during the stages of embryogenesis we study.
we then develop a co-clustering formulation to cluster the genes and the mesh elements, thereby identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously.
