the number of visitors that may be more likely to spread diseases between farms was associated with animal species and herd size.
preventive measures, risk-based surveillance and contact tracing may be facilitated if the frequency and type of between-farm contacts can be assessed for different types of farms.
reports of the visitorsâ€™ degree of contact with the animals showed that veterinarians, ai-technicians, animal transporters and neighbours were often in direct contact with the animals or entered the stables and  <dig> % of the repairmen were also in direct contact with animals, which was unexpected.
the average number of professional and non-professional visitors per day was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
in addition to livestock movements, other between-farm contacts such as visitors may contribute to the spread of contagious animal diseases.
whereas the number of professional visitors seemed to increase with increasing herd size, this relation was not seen for non-professional visits.
in a multivariable analysis, species, herd size and season were significantly associated with the number of professional visitors as well as the number of visitors in direct contact with the animals.
knowledge about such contacts is essential for contingency planning.
data were collected from swedish farmers through contact-logs covering two-week periods during four different seasons.
in total,  <dig>  farmers filled in the contact log for at least one period and the data represent  <dig>  days.
in conclusion there was a large variation between farms in the number and type of contacts.
