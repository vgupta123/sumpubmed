most notably, compared to other approaches, rnaprob significantly improves sensitivity by  <dig> %~ <dig> % over the benchmark data sets.
besides the incorporation of evolutionary information from standard pssm profiles, the proposed smoothed pssm encoding scheme also considers the correlation and dependency from the neighboring residues for each amino acid in a protein.
moreover, physicochemical properties and amino acid preferences of rna-binding proteins are examined and analyzed.
however, they could yield low sensitivities in trade-off for high specificities.
using five-fold cross-validation, our method performs better than the state-of-the-art systems by  <dig> %~ <dig> %,  <dig> %~ <dig> %, and  <dig> ~ <dig>  in terms of overall accuracy, specificity, and matthew's correlation coefficient, respectively.
to prevent data over fitting, a three-way data split procedure is incorporated to estimate the prediction performance.
experimental results show that smoothed pssm encoding significantly enhances the prediction performance, especially for sensitivity.
our results demonstrate that smoothed pssm encoding scheme significantly enhances the performance of rna-binding site prediction in proteins.
thus, computational approaches for prediction of rna-binding sites in proteins have become highly desirable.
rna-protein interaction plays an essential role in several biological processes, such as protein synthesis, gene expression, posttranscriptional regulation and viral infectivity.
extensive studies of rna-binding site prediction have led to the development of several methods.
the proposed method can be used in other research areas, such as dna-binding site prediction, protein-protein interaction, and prediction of posttranslational modification sites.
however, experimental determination of rna-protein interaction remains time-consuming and labor-intensive.
we propose a method, rnaprob, which incorporates a new smoothed position-specific scoring matrix  encoding scheme with a support vector machine model to predict rna-binding sites in proteins.
