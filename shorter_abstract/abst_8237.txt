multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that “having more than  <dig>  pigs” was the most influential risk factor for iav-s positivity.
raising a large number of pigs on a farm has the strongest impact on the incidence of subclinical iav-s infection.
farms affected by reassortant iav-s had significantly larger pig populations than did those where apdm <dig> viruses were isolated, thus suggesting that large, corporate farms serve as sites of reassortment events.
to increase our understanding of the etiology of the subclinical form and thus help prevent the persistence of iav-s in pig populations, we conducted active virologic surveillance in vietnam, the second-largest pig-producing country in asia, from february  <dig> to december  <dig>
iav-s were isolated from  <dig> large, corporate farms and  <dig> family-operated farms from among the  <dig> farms evaluated.
given that only some of the corporate farms surveyed were iav-s positive, further active monitoring is necessary to identify additional risk factors important in subclinical infection of pigs with iav-s in vietnam.
we demonstrate the asymptomatic circulation of iav-s in the vietnamese pig population.
from a total of  <dig> nasal swabs collected from clinically healthy pigs at  <dig> farms and  <dig> slaughterhouses, we isolated  <dig> iav-s from swine at the weaning and early-fattening stages.
