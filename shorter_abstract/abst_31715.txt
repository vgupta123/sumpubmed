pathogenesis-related proteins, other cell wall modifying enzymes, and orthologs of genes with unknown function  are among the parasite genes highly expressed by t. versicolor at the parasite-host interface.
in this preliminary study of the interface transcriptomes, we have shown that t. versicolor, and the orobanchaceae in general, provide excellent opportunities for the characterization of plant genes with unknown functions.
here, we compare de novo assembled transcriptomes generated from laser micro-dissected tissues at the host-parasite interface to uncover details of the largely uncharacterized interaction between parasitic plants and their hosts.
a generalist member of this family, and an important parasitic plant model, triphysaria versicolor regularly feeds upon a wide range of host plants.
relative to above ground tissues, gene families are disproportionally represented at the interface including enrichment for transcription factors and genes of unknown function.
the results of our analysis suggest that t. versicolor’s generalist strategy involves a reliance on overlapping but distinct gene sets, depending upon the host plant it is parasitizing.
quantitative real-time pcr of a t. versicolor β-expansin shows strong differential  upregulation in response to the monocot host z. mays; a result that is concordant with our read count estimates.
the massive upregulation of a t. versicolor β-expansin is suggestive of a mechanism for parasite success on grass hosts.
