as an intracellular human pathogen, mycobacterium tuberculosis  is facing multiple stressful stimuli inside the macrophage and the granuloma.

the most significant transcriptomic alteration with more than  <dig> de genes was seen under nitrosative stress.
the main goal of this study was to map the regulatory networks of differentially expressed  transcripts in mtb upon various forms of genotoxic stress.
we also applied a state-of-the-art method to predict potential target genes of the identified ncrnas and found that some of these could regulate several genes that might be directly involved in the response to genotoxic stress.
by predicting the structures of hypothetical proteins  encoded by de genes, we found that some of these hps might be involved in mycobacterial genome maintenance.
our study reflects the complexity of the response of mtb in handling genotoxic stress.
in addition to genes involved in genome maintenance, other potential key players, such as the members of the t7ss and pe/ppe gene family, were identified.
we exposed mtb cells to oxidative , nitrosative , or alkylation  stress or mitomycin c, inducing double-strand breaks in the dna.
in addition to genes that belong to the replication, recombination and repair  group, mainly found under mitomycin c stress, we identified de genes important for bacterial virulence and survival, such as genes of the type vii secretion system  and the proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid  family.
