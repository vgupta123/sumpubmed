the present study identifies the largest family of glyoxalase proteins to date with  <dig> gmglyi and  <dig> gmglyii members in soybean.
moreover, this study provides a strong basis about the biological role and function of gmglyi and gmglyii members in soybean growth, development and stress physiology.
detailed analysis of gmglyi and gmglyii genes strongly indicates the genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication of the glyoxalase members.
previously genome-wide analysis of glyoxalase genes has been conducted in model plants arabidopsis and rice, but no such study was performed in any legume species.
role of glyoxalase enzymes has been extensively investigated in various plant species which showed their crucial role in salinity, drought and heavy metal stress tolerance.
expression profiling of these genes has been performed in different tissues and developmental stages as well as under salinity and drought stresses using publicly available rnaseq and microarray data.
detailed analysis of these identified members was conducted including their nomenclature and classification, chromosomal distribution and duplication, exon-intron organization, and protein domain and motifs identification.
glyoxalase pathway consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase i  and glyoxalase ii  which detoxifies a highly cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal  to its non-toxic form.
in the present study, a comprehensive genome database analysis of soybean was performed and identified a total of putative  <dig> glyi and  <dig> glyii proteins encoded by  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.
the study revealed that gmglyi- <dig> and gmglyii- <dig> have been expressed intensively in all the developmental stages and tissues; while gmglyi- <dig>  gmglyi- <dig>  gmglyi- <dig>  gmglyii- <dig> and gmglyii- <dig> were highly abiotic stress responsive members.
