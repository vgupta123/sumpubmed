we present a comprehensive study to address the potential existence of environmental preferences of prokaryotic taxa and the commonness of the specialist and generalist strategies.
these sequences were taxonomically assigned, and the corresponding samples were also classified into a hierarchical classification of environments.
our data indicate that we are still far from characterizing prokaryotic diversity in any environment, except, perhaps, for human tissues such as the oral cavity and the vagina.
this is, as far as we know, the most comprehensive assessment of the distribution and diversity of prokaryotic taxa and their associations with different environments.
salinity is another very important factor for constraining prokaryotic diversity.
our results indicate that environmental specificity is not very common at the higher taxonomic levels , but emerges at lower taxonomic levels .
we also assessed the most significant environmental factors shaping the environmental distribution of taxa.
we used several statistical methods to analyze the environmental distribution of taxa.
the most selective environmental characteristics are those of animal tissues and thermal locations.
on the other hand, soil and freshwater habitats are the less restrictive environments, harboring the largest number of prokaryotic taxa.
we used 16s rdna sequences from  <dig>  sampling experiments in natural and artificial sources.
