in its most structured state under hydrophobic conditions, p <dig> adopts a stable helical structure within the c-terminus.
qualitative 1h-chemical shift and noe data indicate that in a pure aqueous environment p <dig> favors an unstructured state.
quantitative noe data further revealed that this Î±-helix extends from ser- <dig> to ser- <dig>  while the n-terminal residues remain unstructured.
circular dichroism and 1h-nmr spectroscopy provide the first molecular insight into the secondary structure and folding of this 51-amino acid protein under different solution conditions.
the structural elements identified for p <dig> differ substantially from that of the functional homologous hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein.
in the present study the p <dig> protein and n- and c-terminal fragments  were chemically synthesized and used for structural analyses.
these structural differences are discussed in the context of the different types of l-domains regulating distinct cellular pathways in virus budding.
