epi-allelic hypomorphic analysis using rna interference  can similarly correlate target gene dosage with cellular phenotypes.
this however requires a set of rnai triggers empirically determined to attenuate target gene expression to different levels.
in order to improve our ability to incorporate epi-allelic analysis into target validation studies, we developed a novel flow cytometry-based functional screening approach  to achieve unbiased selection of shrnas from high-coverage libraries that knockdown target gene expression to predetermined levels.
the unbiased cellselectrnai flow cytometry-based functional screening approach readily provides an epi-allelic series of shrnas for graded reduction of target gene expression and improved phenotypic validation.
employing a gaussian probability model we calculated that knockdown efficiency is inferred from shrna sequence frequency profiles derived from sorted hypomorphic cell populations.
