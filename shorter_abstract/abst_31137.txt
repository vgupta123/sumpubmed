in nine live horses the threshold of pressure that lead to any reaction was documented.
compared to the thoracic region, a significantly higher pressure threshold was found in the lumbar region in the live horses.
algometer tips with a contact area of 1 cm <dig> led to widely similar results irrespective of the surface shape; these measurements also had the lowest variance.
in postmortem specimens of five euthanized horses the transmission of algometer pressure onto a pressure sensor placed underneath the dorsal thoracolumbar tissues at the level of the ribs or the transverse lumbar processes respectively was measured.
algometry is an easily practicable and well tolerated method to quantify pain but it is important to consider the many factors influencing the results obtained.
this result corresponds to the increased tissue thickness in the lumbar region compared to the thoracic region, also documented as less pressure transmission in the lumbar region on the in vitro specimens.
contact areas of  <dig>  cm <dig> resulted in a lower pressure threshold, and those of 2 cm <dig> resulted in a higher pressure threshold.
the hemispheric shape of the contact area resulted in a higher pressure threshold, than the cylindrical contact area.
