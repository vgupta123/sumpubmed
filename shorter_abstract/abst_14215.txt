genome-wide association studies  with metabolic traits and metabolome-wide association studies  with traits of biomedical relevance are powerful tools to identify the contribution of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors to the etiology of complex diseases.
we derive critical values of the p-gain for different levels of correlation between metabolite pairs and show that b/ is a conservative critical value for the p-gain, where Î± is the level of significance and b the number of tested metabolite pairs.
the p-gain statistic was introduced as an ad-hoc measure to determine whether a ratio between two metabolite concentrations carries more information than the two corresponding metabolite concentrations alone.
hypothesis-free testing of ratios between all possible metabolite pairs in gwas and mwas has proven to be an innovative approach in the discovery of new biologically meaningful associations.
we show that the p-gain is a well defined measure that can be used to identify statistically significant metabolite ratios in association studies and provide a conservative significance cut-off for the p-gain for use in future association studies with metabolic traits.
