to elucidate the physiological functions of adam <dig>  we employed gene targeting to generate adam <dig> knockout mice.
no major histological abnormalities were detected in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum of the homozygous mutants; however, marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves was observed.
adam22's sequence similarity to other adams suggests it to be an integrin binder and thus to have a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions.
further analysis of adam <dig> will provide clues to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases such as epileptic seizures and peripheral neuropathy.
the results of our study demonstrate that adam <dig> is closely involved in the correct functioning of the nervous system.
after one week, severe ataxia was observed, and all homozygotes died before weaning, probably due to convulsions.
adam22-deficient mice were produced in a good accordance with the mendelian ratio and appeared normal at birth.
adam <dig> is a member of the adam gene family, but the fact that it is expressed only in the nervous systems makes it unique.
