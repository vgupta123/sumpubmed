clustalxeed can now compute a large volume of biological sequence data sets, which were not tractable in any other parallel or single msa program.
to solve the conventional memory-dependency problem, clustalxeed uses both physical random access memory  and a distributed file-allocation system for distance matrix construction and pair-align computation.
the computation efficiency of disk-storage system was markedly improved by implementing an efficient load-balancing algorithm, called "idle node-seeking task algorithm" .
we designed clustalxeed, a software system for multiple sequence alignment with incremental improvements over previous versions of the clustalx and clustalw-mpi software.
2) implementing an efficient task load-balancing algorithm, insta, which improves overall processing times for multiple sequence alignment with input sequences of non-uniform length.
the new editing option and the graphical user interface  provide ready access to a parallel-computing environment for users who seek fast and easy alignment of large dna and protein sequence sets.
the commonly used multiple sequence alignment programs are still limited in their ability to handle very large amounts of sequences because the system lacks a scalable high-performance computing  environment with a greatly extended data storage capacity.
the primary advantage of clustalxeed over other multiple sequence alignment software is its ability to align a large family of protein or nucleic acid sequences.
