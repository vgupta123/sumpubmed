here, we conduct comprehensive analyses of cold and heat treatments in nhcc using rna-seq.
except conducting the de novo transcriptome analyses, we also compared these unigenes with the chinese cabbage proteins.
the enrichment analyses showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes were enriched under cold and heat treatments, respectively.
it showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes were regulated by lncrnas under cold and heat treatments, respectively.
furthermore, we constructed a coexpression network for lncrnas and mirnas.

however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance for extreme temperature in nhcc.
additionally,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified, and  <dig>  belonged to novel lncrnas.
we identified several most important genes, and discussed their regulatory networks and crosstalk in cold and heat stresses.
non-heading chinese cabbage  is an important leaf vegetable grown worldwide.
therefore, this study represents a fully characterized nhcc transcriptome, and provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies under abiotic stress.
we presented the first comprehensive characterization for nhcc crops and constructed the flowchart for identifying lncrnas using transcriptome.
