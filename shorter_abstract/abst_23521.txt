rnaseq analysis of knockdown cells instead revealed dysregulation of a core subset of genes relevant to airway biology and a robust downregulation of protein synthesis pathways.
in addition, chipseq experiments demonstrated ints <dig> binding throughout the genome, which was enriched in transcriptionally active regions.
we found that, in lung tissue, 4q <dig> polymorphisms associated with lung function correlate with ints <dig> but not neighbouring gstcd expression.
finally, we defined the ints <dig> regulome which includes genes belonging to the protein synthesis pathways.
we show that it regulates translation by regulating the expression of genes belonging to protein synthesis pathways.
this study provides a detailed analysis of ints <dig> activities on a genome-wide scale and contributes to the biology behind the genetic association for lung function at 4q <dig>
in contrast to the previous reports in other species, we only observed a minor alteration of snrna processing following ints <dig> depletion.
ints <dig> has functions beyond the canonical snrna processing.

genetic studies of human lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have identified a highly significant and reproducible signal on 4q <dig>  it remains unclear which of the two candidate genes within this locus may regulate lung function: gstcd, a gene with unknown function, and/or ints <dig>  a member of the integrator complex which is currently thought to mediate 3’end processing of small nuclear rnas.
