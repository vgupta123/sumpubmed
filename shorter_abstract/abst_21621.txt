little is known regarding the regulatory networks programming tuberous root formation and development.
here, as a first step toward understanding these networks, we analyzed and characterized the genome-wide transcriptional profiling and dynamics of sweetpotato root in seven distinct developmental stages using a customized microarray containing  <dig>  genes.
we found that most genes active in roots were shared across all developmental stages, although significant quantitative changes in gene abundance were observed for  <dig>   genes.
the remaining tfs with unknown roles would also play critical regulatory roles during sweetpotato tuberous root formation and development.
in contrast with the large number of shared expressed genes in root development, each stage or period of root development has only a small number of specific genes.
gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in different processes were enriched at specific stages of root development.
the results generated in this study provided spatiotemporal patterns of root gene expression in support of future efforts for understanding the underlying molecular mechanism that control sweetpotato yield and quality.
the tuberous root of sweetpotato is undisputedly an important organ from agronomic and biological perspectives.

clustering analysis of these differentially expressed genes pointed out six distinct expression patterns during root development.
several of the specific tf genes are known regulators of root development, including da1-related protein, short-root and bel1-like.
analysis of these genes identified temporal programs of gene expression, including hundreds of transcription factor  genes.
