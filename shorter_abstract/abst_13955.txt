prominent sites of expression for many members of this family are the hypodermis, the alimentary system and several specialized cells including sensory sheath and sockets cells, which are located at openings in the body wall.
astacins are a large family of zinc metalloproteases found in bacteria and animals.
mutants in nas- <dig> and nas-6; nas- <dig> double mutants are slow growing and have defects in the grinder of the pharynx, a cuticular structure important for food processing.
we analyzed the expression pattern of previously uncharacterized members of the astacin family to try and obtain clues to potential functions.
expression data and phenotypic characterization of selected family members suggest a diversity of functions for members of the astacin family in nematodes.
the c. elegans genome contains an unusually large number of astacins, of which the majority have not been functionally characterized yet.
