in addition, we show that the multiple genes observed in humans and other distantly related mammals have arisen due to the independent expansion of an ancestral sequence within each species.
the observation that the dub/usp <dig> genes, which can influence cell growth and survival, have evolved from an unstable ancestral sequence which has undergone multiple and varied duplications in the species examined marks this as a unique family.
here we demonstrate that the human dub/usp <dig> family members are found on both chromosome 4p <dig> , within a block of tandem repeats, and on chromosome 8p <dig> , embedded within the copy number variable beta-defensin cluster.
we originally showed that constitutive expression of dub- <dig> can block cell proliferation and more recently we have demonstrated that this is due to its regulation of the ubiquitination and activity of the 'caax' box protease rce <dig>
subsequently we have identified a number of human family members and shown that one of these  is also cytokine inducible.
the dub/usp <dig> subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes were originally identified as immediate early genes induced in response to cytokine stimulation in mice .
