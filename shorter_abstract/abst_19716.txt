pyocyanin , an extracellular product of pseudomonas aeruginosa and a blue redox active secondary metabolite, plays an important role in invasive pulmonary infection.
the results were further confirmed by the observation that p <dig>  erk1/ <dig> and nf-κb inhibitors inhibited pcn-induced nf-κb activation and attenuated pcn-induced il- <dig> expression in u <dig> cells as a function of their concentrations.
p <dig> and erk mapks were activated after 10 min of induction with pcn and their levels returned to baselines after 30 min by western blotting.
furthermore, p <dig> and erk mapks and nf-κΒ signaling pathways may be involved in the expression of il- <dig> in pcn-incubated pma-differentiated u <dig> cells.
it was found that pcn increased il- <dig> release and mrna expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  differentiated u <dig> cells in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
it was also found that within 10 min of pcn incubation, the level of p-i-κbα in the cytosol was increased, which returned to baseline level after 60 min.
meanwhile, the level of p-p <dig> was increased in the nuclear extract and cytosol, and maintained high in total cell lysates.
moreover, it was shown that pcn induced oxidative stress in u <dig> cells and n-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, was able to inhibit pcn-induced il- <dig> protein expression.
it is concluded that pcn induces il- <dig> secretion and mrna expression in pma-differentiated u <dig> cells in a concentration- and time- dependent manner.
