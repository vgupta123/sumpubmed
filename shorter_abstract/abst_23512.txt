for this reason, the analysis of membrane proteins is essential in genomic and proteomic-wide investigations.
it turned out that amino acid covariation within interacting sequence parts, extracted from a evolutionary sequence record of α-helical membrane proteins, can be used for structure prediction.
the low-cost rapid computational methods postulated in this work provides valuable information to classify unknown α-helical transmembrane proteins and to determine their structural similarity.

this points to their general importance for α-helical membrane protein structure formation and interaction mediation.
in this work, we used motif data to define evolutionary interaction pattern pairs.
the results indicate a good agreement with recent studies.
these signatures can provide valuable information for structure prediction and protein classification.
such tasks addressed to transmembrane protein structures provide valuable knowledge about their three-dimensional structure.
thus, many in-silico approaches have been utilized extensively to gain crucial advances in understanding membrane protein structures and functions.
