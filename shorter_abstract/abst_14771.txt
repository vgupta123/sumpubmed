we have modified and adapted a previous algorithm to take advantage of the special characteristics of the affymetrix exon arrays.
the proposed algorithm shows a substantial improvement in the performance over the previous version.
the algorithm was also applied to different real datasets showing its effectiveness and the concordance with pcr validated results.
this improvement is mainly due to the exploitation of the redundancy of the affymetrix exon arrays.
exon arrays provide a way to measure the expression of different isoforms of genes in an organism.
