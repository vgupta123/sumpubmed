a major advantage of our method is its simplicity: it relies on searching sequences for the occurrence of just  <dig> specific peptides belonging to the s <dig> subgroup of aars enzymes.
we employ specific peptides, deduced from aminoacyl trna synthetases, as markers for the occurrence of single genes in data.
when applied to genomic contigs of a recent human gut microbiome study, the taxa counting method provides information on numbers of different species and strains.
sequences carrying these markers are aligned and compared with each other to provide a lower limit for taxa counts in metagenomic data.
taxa counting is a major problem faced by analysis of metagenomic data.
when compared to other methods, it provides additional insight into the taxonomic contents of metagenomic data.
the taxa counting problem is analyzed mathematically and a heuristic algorithm is proposed.
