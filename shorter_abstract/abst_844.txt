morphant embryos exhibited an arrest in lens development and abnormalities in the body axis length and curvature.
laminins represent major components of basement membranes and play various roles in embryonic and adult tissues.
these results underline the importance of the laminin alpha  <dig> for normal ocular development and provide a basis for further analysis of its developmental roles.
the laminin alpha - <dig> gene was shown to have the most restricted expression pattern with strong expression in ocular structures, particularly in the developing and mature lens.
we identified the zebrafish lama <dig> gene encoding a 3075-amino acid protein  that possesses strong identity with the human lama <dig>  zebrafish lama <dig> transcripts were detected at all stages of embryo development with the highest levels of expression in the developing lens, somites, nervous and urogenital systems.
