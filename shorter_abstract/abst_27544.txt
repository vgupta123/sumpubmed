the most commonly used potentials define the energy of residue-residue interactions and are derived from the empirical analysis of the known protein structures.
here we do not try to combine the two different types of residue interaction potential, but rather to assess their independent contribution to scoring protein structures.
using a large and standard set of protein decoys we performed an in-depth comparison of these two types of residue interaction propensities.
our findings show that both types of score perform equally well on the task of discriminating between near-native protein decoys.
in addition, the use of a single-body term allows for efficient alignment strategies using dynamic programming, which is useful for fold recognition, for example.
the scores derived from the contact-type and contact-count propensities were assessed using two different performance metrics and were compared using  <dig> different definitions of residue-residue contact.
this similarity suggests a common underlying biophysical principle for both types of residue interaction propensity.
for over  <dig> years potentials of mean force have been used to evaluate the relative energy of protein structures.
