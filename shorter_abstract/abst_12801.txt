while the utility of gpu-based implementations in bioinformatics has been well studied, mic architecture has been introduced only recently and may provide a number of comparative advantages that have yet to be explored and tested.
gpu implementation on a single nvidia tesla k <dig> runs twice as fast as that for the mic architecture-based xeon phi p <dig> coprocessor, but also requires considerably more programming effort.
on the other hand the new mic architecture, albeit lacking in performance reduces the programming effort and makes it up with a more general architecture suitable for a wider range of problems.
general purpose gpus are a mature platform with large amounts of computing power capable of tackling inherently parallel problems, but can prove demanding for the programmer.
massively parallel hardware within a modern graphic processing unit  and many integrated core  coprocessors can shorten the run time considerably.
we report on differences between these two modern massively parallel architectures and their software environments.
exhaustive evaluation of all interactions among hundreds of thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms  may require weeks or even months of computation.
we have developed a heterogeneous, gpu and intel mic-accelerated software module for snp-snp interaction discovery to replace the previously single-threaded computational core in the interactive web-based data exploration program snpsyn.
