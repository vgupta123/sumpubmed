different iron transport systems evolved in gram-negative bacteria during evolution.
based on sequence similarity, we identified  <dig> clusters, where elements of one cluster may possibly recognize similar substrates.
most of the transport systems depend on outer membrane localized tonb-dependent transporters , a periplasma-facing tonb protein and a plasma membrane localized machinery .
for iron transport, three uptake systems are defined: the lactoferrin/transferrin binding proteins, the porphyrin-dependent transporters and the siderophore-dependent transporters.
however, for cyanobacteria almost nothing is known about possible tonb-dependent uptake systems for iron or other substrates.
pcc  <dig> we identified  <dig> genes as putative tbdts covering almost all known tbdt subclasses.
the expression of the  <dig> putative tbdts individually depends on the presence of iron, copper or nitrogen.
