sirnas are small rnas that serve as sequence determinants during the gene silencing process called rna interference .
the way of denoting a bio-sequence by binary system in mathematical language might be helpful in other analysis work associated with fixed-length bio-sequence.
therefore, there is high demand for reliable sirnas prediction tools and for the design methods able to pick up high silencing potential sirnas.
in this paper, two systems have been established for the prediction of functional sirnas:  a statistical model based on sequence information and  a machine learning model based on three features of sirna sequences, namely binary description, thermodynamic profile and nucleotide composition.
