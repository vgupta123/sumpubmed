endosperm starch granules from the sbe1a mutant were more resistant to digestion by pancreatic Î±-amylase, and the sbe1a mutant starch had an altered branching pattern for amylopectin and amylose.
when kernels were germinated, the sbe1a mutant was associated with shorter coleoptile length and higher residual starch content, suggesting that less efficient starch utilization may have impaired growth during germination.
we believe that these results provide a plausible rationale for the conservation of sbei in plants in both monocots and dicots, as greater seedling vigor would provide an important survival advantage when resources are limited.
to explore this incongruity the objective of the present work was to characterize functional and molecular phenotypes of both sbe1a and wild-type  in the w64a maize inbred line.
