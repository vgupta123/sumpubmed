in response to lps-induced inflammation, the liver x receptor was over-represented in both mucosa and detrusor regulatory networks confirming a role for this nuclear receptor in lps-induced gene expression.
a new approach for understanding bladder muscle-urothelium interaction was developed by assembling ssh, real time pcr, and tre analysis results into regulatory networks.
the regulatory networks represent key targets for development of novel drugs targeting bladder diseases.
nf-Îºb was specifically over-represented in the inflamed mucosa regulatory network.
during development, the pax- <dig> transcription factor  maintains progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state whereas, during inflammation, pax- <dig> was suppressed and genes involved in neuronal development  were up-regulated.
therefore, during inflammation, an increased maturation of neural progenitor cells in the muscle may underlie detrusor instability.
when the inflamed detrusor was compared to control, two major pathways were found, one encoding synapsin i, a neuron-specific phosphoprotein, and the other an important apoptotic protein, siva.
inflammation has been implicated in every major disease of the bladder, including cancer, interstitial cystitis, and infection.
it was found that the control bladder mucosa presented regulatory elements driving genes such as myosin light chain phosphatase and calponin  <dig> that influence the smooth muscle phenotype.
