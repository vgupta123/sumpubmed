given such two-class high-dimensional data, many methods have been proposed for classifying data points into one of the two classes.
the previously identified hcc biomarker gene, glypican  <dig> , is part of an accurate gene triple involving mt1e and arhe.
such small gene sets could indicate biomarkers and portend simple medical diagnostic tests.
we recommend checking for small gene sets routinely.
we also find small gene sets that distinguish leukemia subtypes in the large pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer set of yeoh et al.
this could be a common characteristic of microarray data, thus making looking for them worth the computational cost.
we find  <dig> gene pairs and many gene triples in the large hepatocellular carcinoma  data set of chen et al.
the key component of these is the "placental gene of unknown function", plac <dig>  our hmm modeling indicates plac <dig> might have a domain like part of lp59's crystal structure .
this technique discovered small sets of genes  in published data that form accurate classifiers, yet were not reported in the prior publications.
we use the brute force approach of exhaustive search through all genes, gene pairs .
four contain thousands of gene pairs and  <dig> have single genes that perfectly discriminate.
