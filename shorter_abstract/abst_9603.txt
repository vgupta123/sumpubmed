these results indicate that msgb5cer-enriched raft membrane domains participate in cytokinesis in a close cooperation with the cortical actin network and the distribution of e-cadherin.
here we show that monosialylgb5cer -enriched raft domains are involved in development during the cleavage stage of mouse preimplantation embryos.
lipid rafts enriched in glycosphingolipids , cholesterol and signaling molecules play an essential role not only for signal transduction started by ligand binding, but for intracellular events such as organization of actin, intracellular traffic and cell polarity, but their functions in cleavage division of preimplantation embryos are not well known.
msgb5cer preferentially localizes at the interfaces between blastomeres in mouse preimplantation embryos.
depletion of cholesterol from the cell membrane with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin  reduced the expression of msgb5cer and stopped cleavage.
extensive accumulation of msgb5cer at the interfaces by cross-linking with anti-msgb5cer mab  caused f-actin to aggregate at the interfaces and suppressed the localization of e-cadherin at the interfaces, which resulted in the cessation of cleavage.
in e-cadherin-targeted embryos, the msgb5cer-enriched raft membrane domains accumulated heterotopically.
