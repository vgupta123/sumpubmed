it is especially well suited for the increasingly important task of aligning large numbers of sequences.
current msa methods suffer from being either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive to be applied effectively in large-scale comparative genomics.
the availability of complete genome sequences has increased the demands on multiple sequence alignment  programs.
we developed kalign, a method employing the wu-manber string-matching algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of multiple sequence alignment.
we compared the speed and accuracy of kalign to other popular methods using balibase, prefab, and a new large test set.
