expression microarrays are increasingly used to obtain large scale transcriptomic information on a wide range of biological samples.
furthermore, many of the more sophisticated mathematical approaches to data analysis in the literature remain inaccessible to much of the biological research community.
analysis of replicate normalised reference data demonstrate that intrarray variability is small , while interarray variability from replicate array measurements has a standard deviation  of around  <dig>  log <dig> units .
comparison to expression data obtained using arabidopsis samples demonstrates that the large number of genes in each sample showing a low level of transcription reflect the real complexity of the cellular transcriptome.
in this study we examine ways of extracting and analysing a large data set obtained using the agilent long oligonucleotide transcriptomics platform, applied to a set of human macrophage and dendritic cell samples.
