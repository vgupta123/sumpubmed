in non-infected abid1+ cells, specific abid <dig> mrna is unstable and present in low amounts.
it does not increase during abortive infection of sensitive phage.
the loss of ability to activate translation of abid <dig> mrna determines the molecular basis for phage resistance to abid <dig>  we show for the first time that temperature downshift also activates abortive infection by activation of abid <dig> mrna translation.
interestingly, cell growth at low temperature also activates translation of abid <dig> mrna and consequently the abid <dig> phenotype, and occurs independently of phage infection.
escherichia coli abis are considered as mediators of programmed cell death, which is induced by infecting phage.
abortive infection  mechanisms comprise numerous strategies developed by bacteria to avoid being killed by bacteriophage .
we previously showed that development of abid <dig> abortive infection against phage bil <dig> depends on orf <dig>  which is expressed in mid-infection.
protein synthesis directed by the abid <dig> translation initiation region is also inefficient.
however, molecular basis for this activation remains unclear.
