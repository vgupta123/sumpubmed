rrm domains were observed to occur multiple times in a single polypeptide.
in the present study, we have investigated human genome for the presence of rrm-containing gene products starting from rrm domains in the pfam  repository.
our sequence analysis identified rrm-containing gene products in the human genome and provides insights into their domain architectures and biological functions.
they are involved in a variety of functions such as splicing, alternative splicing, nuclear import and export of mrna, rna stability and translation.
these were studied for their predicted domain architectures, biological processes, involvement in pathways, disease relevance and disorder content.
further, functional enrichment analysis revealed that rrm-containing gene products are mainly involved in biological functions such as mrna splicing and its regulation.

we then examined the presence of rrm-containing gene products in homo sapiens genome and identified  <dig> rrm-containing gene products.
gene expression is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
we studied these families for their taxonomic representation, sequence features  and structural properties .
