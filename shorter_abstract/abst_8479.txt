our experiments, carried out on synthetic and clinical data, show a sensitivity of up to  <dig>  and specificity of up to  <dig>  for a 15-class problem of disease classification.
we define a composed loss function for this task and analytically derive a closed form equation such that training a model reduces to searching for an optimal threshold vector.
bioinformatics data analysis often deals with additive mixtures of signals for which only class labels are known.
the presented factorization method provides a simple and generative model and, therefore, represents a first step towards predictive factorization methods.
