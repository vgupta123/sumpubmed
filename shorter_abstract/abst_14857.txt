panac <dig> and its orthologs form a sister group to well characterized stress-related angiosperm nac genes and at least panac <dig> is responsive to biotic stress and appear to act in the control of defence associated secondary metabolite production.
the phylogeny and domain structure in the nac proteins can be used to organize functional specificities, several well characterized stress-related nac proteins are found in iii- <dig> in arabidopsis .
three key genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway: a chs, a f3â€™h and palar <dig> were consistently down regulated in the overexpression lines.
in accordance, the overexpression lines showed reduced levels of specific flavonoids, suggesting that panac <dig> act as a repressor of this pathway, possibly by directly interacting with the promoter of the repressed genes.
norway spruce lines overexpressing panac <dig> exhibited aberrant embryo development in response to maturation initiation and  <dig> misregulated genes were identified in proliferating cultures.
however, transactivation studies of panac <dig> and palar <dig> in nicotiana benthamiana showed that panac <dig> activated palar3a, suggesting that panac <dig> does not act as an independent negative regulator of flavan-3-ol production through direct interaction with the target flavonoid biosynthetic genes.
the nac family of transcription factors is one of the largest gene families of transcription factors in plants and the conifer nac gene family is at least as large, or possibly larger, as in arabidopsis.
these transcription factors control both developmental and stress induced processes in plants.
this study investigates nac family transcription factors involved in the responses to the pathogen heterobasidion annosum  bref.
the norway spruce genome contain seven genes with similarity to subgroup iii- <dig> nacs.
