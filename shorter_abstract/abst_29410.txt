we describe a new technique for detecting prenyl anchors in n-terminally glutathione s-transferase -labeled constructs of target proteins expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and incubated with 3h-labeled anchor precursors.
savings in time for experimentation and the higher sensitivity for detecting 3h-labeled lipid anchors recommend the tlc-scanning method with purified gst-  tagged target proteins as the method of choice for analyzing their prenylation capabilities in vitro and in vivo and, possibly, also for studying the myristoyl and palmitoyl posttranslational modifications.
we show directly that rasd <dig> is a farnesylation target.
available in vitro and in vivo methods for verifying protein substrates for posttranslational modifications via farnesylation or geranylgeranylation  are time consuming , laborious and suffer from low sensitivity.
these protocols have been tested with rap2a, v-ki-ras <dig> and rhoa  including the necessary controls.
