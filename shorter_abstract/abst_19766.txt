our findings indicate that δoat feeds p5c exclusively into the catabolic branch of pro metabolism, which yields glu as an end product.
wildtype plants could readily catabolise supplied arg and orn and were able to use these amino acids as the only nitrogen source.
utilisation of urea and stress induced pro accumulation were not affected in t-dna insertion mutants with a complete loss of δoat expression.
arg catabolism produces ornithine  inside mitochondria, which was discussed controversially as a precursor for pro biosynthesis, alternative to glutamate .
pro biosynthesis occurs predominantly or exclusively via the glu pathway in arabidopsis and does not depend on glu produced by arg and orn catabolism.
we show here that ornithine-δ-aminotransferase , the enzyme converting orn to pyrroline-5-carboxylate , is localised in mitochondria and is essential for arg catabolism.
like many other plant species, arabidopsis uses arginine  as a storage and transport form of nitrogen, and proline  as a compatible solute in the defence against abiotic stresses causing water deprivation.
