the interplay between duplication and point mutation in our data shed light on the relative frequencies of these events in human history, showing that at least some of the duplication events were recurrent.
software to perform generalized genotyping from snp array data is freely available online  <cit> .
this new multi-allelic view of snps has a complicated role in disease association studies, and further work will be necessary in order to accurately assess its importance.
in the presence of copy number variability, the individual may theoretically harbor any number of copies of each of the two snp alleles.
in particular, a snp site can no longer always be accurately assigned one of three genotypes in an individual.
here we apply our approach to data from  <dig> individuals and uncover thousands of aberrant snps, most in regions that were previously unreported as copy number variants.
