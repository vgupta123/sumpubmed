however, the number of inversions identified among malus and prunus was much higher than any reported genome comparisons in plants, suggesting that small inversions have played an important role in the evolution of these two genera or of the rosaceae.
we generated a comparative analysis using  <dig> molecular markers that are anchored genetically to the prunus and/or fragaria reference maps, and physically to the malus genome sequence.
we reconstructed a proposed ancestral genome for the rosaceae.
markers in common for malus and prunus, and malus and fragaria, respectively were  <dig> and  <dig>  the correspondence between marker positions was high and conserved syntenic blocks were identified among the three genera in the rosaceae.
comparative genome mapping studies in rosaceae have been conducted until now by aligning genetic maps within the same genus, or closely related genera and using a limited number of common markers.
