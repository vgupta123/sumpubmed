prions, infectious agents associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, are primarily composed of the misfolded and pathogenic form  of the host-encoded prion protein.
to assess the validity of prion inactivation by heat treatment in yellow grease, which is produced in the industrial manufacturing process of mbms, we pooled, homogenized, and heat treated the spinal cords of bse-infected cows under various experimental conditions.
quantitative analysis of the inactivation efficiency of bse prpsc was possible with the introduction of the pmca <dig>  which is the dilution ratio of 10% homogenate needed to yield 50% positivity for prpsc in amplified samples.
log pmca <dig> exhibited a strong linear correlation with the transmission rate in the bioassay; infectivity was no longer detected when the log pmca <dig> of the inoculated sample was reduced to  <dig> .
because prpsc retains infectivity after undergoing routine sterilizing processes, the cause of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  outbreaks are suspected to be feeding cattle meat and bone meals  contaminated with the prion.
the quantitative pmca assay may be useful for safety evaluation for recycling and effective utilization of mbms as an organic resource.
