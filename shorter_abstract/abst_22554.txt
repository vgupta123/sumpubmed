pedigrees ascertained for disease can be powerful for genetic analysis due to the cases being enriched for genetic disease.
genomewide association studies have resulted in a great many genomic regions that are likely to harbor disease genes.
results also indicated the value of large high-risk pedigrees for association analysis, which, in the simulations considered, were comparable in power to case-control resources of the same sample size.
our method, hapmc, allows for the analysis of full-length and sub-haplotypes, including imputation of missing data, in resources of nuclear families, general pedigrees, case-control data or mixtures thereof.
power comparisons suggest that transmission-disequilibrium statistics are superior for performing association in resources of only nuclear families.
thorough interrogation of these specific regions is the logical next step, including regional haplotype studies to identify risk haplotypes upon which the underlying critical variants lie.
our new phasing algorithm substantially outperformed the standard expectation-maximization algorithm that is ignorant of pedigree structure, and hence is preferable for resources that include pedigree structure.
the method includes a phasing algorithm that can be used in large pedigrees and optional use of pseudocontrols.
we propose hapmc as a valuable new tool to perform haplotype association analyses, particularly for resources of mixed structure.
