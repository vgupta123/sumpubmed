our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of the two chicken lines and additional evidence that mapk signaling pathway may play an important role in host response to md virus infection.
copy number variation  is a major source of genome polymorphism that directly contributes to phenotypic variation such as resistance to infectious diseases.
we also found  <dig> cnvrs overlapping with  <dig> genes previously shown to be strong candidates of the underlying genes responsible for the susceptibility to md.
over half of the line-specific cnvrs were shared by  <dig> or more chickens, reflecting the reduced diversity in both inbred lines.
a total of  <dig>  cnv regions  were identified after merging the two datasets, of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  were specific to the md resistant or susceptible line, respectively.
the cnvrs fixed in the susceptible lines were significantly enriched in genes involved in mapk signaling pathway.
the results were combined to obtain a union set of genomic cnvs in the two chicken lines.
the rich source of line-specific cnvs is valuable for future disease-related association studies in the two chicken lines.
two popular software, cnvnator and pindel, were used to call genomic cnvs separately.
lines  <dig> and  <dig> are two highly inbred experimental chicken lines that differ greatly in susceptibility to marek’s disease , and have been used extensively in efforts to identify the genetic and molecular basis for genetic resistance to md.
using next generation sequencing, we present a genome-wide assessment of cnvs that are potentially associated with genetic resistance to md.
