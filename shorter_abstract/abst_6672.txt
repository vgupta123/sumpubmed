here we hypothesize that recovered human and swine heart-lung blocs can be reanimated using a clear perfusate and elicit viable cardiodynamic and pulmonic function.
we report the first dynamic videoscopic images of the pulmonary vasculature during viable cardiopulmonary function in isolated reanimated heart-lung blocs.
systolic and diastolic left ventricular pressures observed for human and swine specimens were 68/2 ± 11/ <dig> and 74/3 ± 17/5 mmhg, respectively, with associated native heart rates of 80 ±  <dig> and 96 ±  <dig> beats per minute.
this experimental approach provides unique in vitro opportunities for the study of novel medical therapeutics applied to large mammalian, including human, heart-lung specimens.
such preparations afford investigators a high level of hemodynamic control, independent of host or systemic interactions.
further, this approach will facilitate multimodal imaging, which is particularly valuable for the study of both functional anatomy and device-tissue interactions.
high-resolution imaging within functioning human pulmonary vasculature was obtained among other anatomies of interest.
in vitro isolated heart preparations are valuable tools for the study of cardiac anatomy and physiology, as well as for preclinical device testing.
