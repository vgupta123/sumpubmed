bioinformatics analyses of differentially expressed proteins were performed by means of gene ontology, metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulation networks using blast2go software, the dynamic impact approach and ingenuity pathway analysis.
this paper is the first to show the protein expression in the late response to a mastitic pathogen, thus, revealing mechanisms associated with host tissue damage.
the up-regulated expression of col1a <dig> and itih <dig> in the mastitic mammary gland may be associated with tissue damage and repair during late stages of infection.
the bioinformatics analyses highlighted the effects of mastitis on proteins such as collagen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, casein alpha and heparan sulfate proteoglycan  <dig>  our findings provide additional clues for further studies of candidate genes for mastitis susceptibility.
this systems approach also could help identify biomarkers for monitoring clinical and subclinical mastitis.
compared with healthy mammary gland tissue,  <dig> proteins were significantly up-regulated  while  <dig> were significantly down-regulated  in response to mastitis due to natural infections with staphylococci aureus.
proteomics and bioinformatics may help us better understand the biological adaptations occurring during bovine mastitis.
the aim of the present study was to use isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification  to screen potential proteins associated with mastitis at late infectious stage.
