one accompanying issue is the simultaneous estimation of p-values for a large number of hypothesis tests.
we formulated a bayesian-inspired approach to this problem, and devised an algorithm that adapts the assignment of resamples iteratively with negligible space and running time overhead.
we present a new approach to more efficiently assign resamples  within a nonparametric multiple testing framework.
using resampling-based procedures for multiple testing is computationally intensive and typically requires large numbers of resamples.
in many applications, a parametric assumption in the null distribution such as normality may be unreasonable, and resampling-based p-values are the preferred procedure for establishing statistical significance.
large-scale statistical analyses have become hallmarks of post-genomic era biological research due to advances in high-throughput assays and the integration of large biological databases.
in two experimental studies, a breast cancer microarray dataset and a genome wide association study dataset for parkinson's disease, we demonstrated that our differential allocation procedure is substantially more accurate compared to the traditional uniform resample allocation.
r code for our algorithm and the shortcut method are available at .
