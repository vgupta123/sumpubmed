a multi-tiered parallel framework  implemented on cuda-enabled gpus presented here, offers a finer-grained parallelism for msv/ssv and viterbi algorithms.
in addition, runtime compilation via nvrtc available with cuda  <dig>  is incorporated into the presented framework that not only helps unroll innermost loop to yield upto  <dig> to 3-fold speedup than static compilation but also enables dynamic loading and switching of kernels depending on the query model size, in order to achieve optimal performance.
in addition to exceeding performance of other acceleration attempts, comprehensive evaluations against high-end cpus  shows that cudampf yields upto  <dig> gcups for ssv,  <dig> gcups for msv and  <dig>  gcups for p7viterbi all with  <dig> % accuracy, which translates to a maximum speedup of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold for msv, ssv and p7viterbi respectively.
it achieves significant speedup by exploiting hierarchical parallelism on single gpu and takes full advantage of limited resources based on their own performance features.
however, the most compute intensive tasks within the pipeline  still stand to benefit from the computational capabilities of massively parallel processors.
since the latest version is highly optimized for performance on modern multi-core cpus with sse capabilities, only a few acceleration attempts report speedup.
cudampf is designed as a hardware-aware parallel framework for accelerating computational hotspots within the hmmsearch pipeline as well as other sequence alignment applications.
the latest version of hmmsearch in hmmer  <dig> x, utilizes heuristic-pipeline which consists of msv/ssv  stage, p7viterbi stage and the forward scoring stage to accelerate homology detection.
