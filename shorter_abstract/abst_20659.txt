indeed, gbv-c is genetically closer to hcv than bvdv, and can lead to productive infection of cultured cells.
the resulting model suggests a new proposition for the mechanism of rna synthesis, and may prove useful to design new experiments to implement our knowledge on the initiation mechanism of rna polymerases.
the bovine viral diarrhea virus  is often used as a surrogate model to screen antiviral drugs against hcv.
these differences raise questions about the relevance of bvdv as a surrogate model, and cast novel interest on the "gb" virus c .
it presents several differences relative to hcv rdrp.
we show in this study that the gbv-c rdrp is closest to the hcv rdrp.
we report a 3d model of the gbv-c rdrp, developed using sequence-to-structure threading and comparative modeling based on the atomic coordinates of the hcv rdrp structure.
the hepatitis c virus  is a major human pathogen difficult to study in cultured cells.
the flaviviridae virus family includes major human and animal pathogens.
docking a gtp molecule into the structure allows defining a gtp binding pocket in the gbv-c rdrp, such as that of bvdv.
