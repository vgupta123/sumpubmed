typically, plant associated microbes are screened for anti-fungal activities in vitro using the high-throughput dual culture screen, but it is not clear whether this method correlates with the activities of these microbes in planta.
the objective of this study was to evaluate the relevance of the in vitro dual culture method for screening endophytes with anti-fungal activity.
all endophytes that showed anti-fungal activity in planta against sclerotinia homoeocarpa and rhizoctonia solani , were captured in vitro.
evidence was gained here that the in vitro dual culture method is a relevant method for high throughput screening of plant endophyte communities for anti-fungal activity.
an important function of some endophytes is to suppress fungal pathogens.
in parallel,  <dig> bacterial endophytes from the corn grass family  were screened for suppression of two fungal pathogens  using the in vitro dual culture method, and in planta using the model plant, creeping bentgrass.
the in vitro and in planta screening results strongly correlated .

plant microbial communities consist of large numbers of endophyte species.
