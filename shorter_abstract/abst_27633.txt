the rtff <dig> produced by b. choshinensis had better wound healing capability than the rtff <dig> produced by e. coli.
the protein sources from b. choshinensis were more efficient than rtff <dig> produced by e. coli.
trefoil factor  <dig>  mediates mucosal repair and belongs to a highly conserved trefoil factor family proteins which are secreted by epithelial cells in the stomach or colon mucous membrane.
glycosylation assay and lc-ms/ms spectrometry experiments showed that the rtff <dig> produced by b. choshinensis was unexpectedly glycosylated at n-terminal ser residue.
previous recombinant expressions of tff <dig> were too low yield for industrial application.
this study provides a potent tool of rtff <dig> production to be applied in gastric damage protection and wound healing.
