therefore, in this pilot human volunteer study, using proteomics approach, we have examined whether a local exposure of human skin to rf-emf will cause changes in protein expression in living people.
this suggests that protein expression in human skin might be affected by the exposure to rf-emf.
earlier we have shown that the mobile phone radiation  alters protein expression in human endothelial cell line.
proteins extracted from biopsies were separated using 2-de and protein expression changes were analyzed using pdquest software.
this does not mean that similar response will take place in human body exposed to this radiation.
our study confirms that proteomics screening approach can identify protein targets of rf-emf in human volunteers.
