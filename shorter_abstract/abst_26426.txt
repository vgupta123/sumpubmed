although inner-nuclear envelope proteins, such as sun <dig> and potentially sun <dig>  are known to bind and recruit meiotic telomeres, these proteins are not meiosis-specific, therefore cannot solely account for telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or for other meiosis-specific characteristics of telomeres in mammals.
consistent with this scenario, ccdc <dig> is missing from most telomeres that fail to connect to sun <dig> protein in spermatocytes lacking the meiosis-specific cohesin smc1b.
these conclusions are consistent with the findings of an independently initiated study that analysed ccdc79/terb <dig> functions.
these trans-nuclear envelope connections between telomeres and cytoplasmic motor proteins permit the active movement of telomeres and chromosomes during the first meiotic prophase.
we identify ccdc <dig>  alternatively named terb <dig>  as a meiosis-specific protein that localizes to telomeres from leptotene to diplotene stages of the first meiotic prophase.
smc1b-deficient spermatocytes display both reduced efficiency in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and reduced stability of telomeres specifically during meiotic prophase.
movements of chromosomes/telomeres facilitate the meiotic recombination process, and allow high fidelity pairing of homologous chromosomes.
pairing of homologous chromosomes is a prerequisite for their correct segregation during the first meiotic division.
in particular, we favour the possibility that ccdc <dig> is involved in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or the stabilization of meiotic telomeres.
