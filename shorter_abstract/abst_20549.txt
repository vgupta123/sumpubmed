yamas , however, enables cross-gwas conclusions prior to finished and polished imputation runs, which eventually are time-consuming.
as a proof of principle, we analyzed six dbgap type ii diabetes gwas and found that the proxy algorithm clearly outperforms na√Øve ma on the p-value level: for  <dig> out of  <dig> we observe an improvement on the p-value level by a factor of more than two, and a maximum improvement by a factor of  <dig>
association results from gwas analysis applications can be used as input files for ma, tremendously speeding up ma compared to the conventional imputation approach.
we show that our proxy algorithm is well-powered and yields valuable ad hoc results, possibly providing an incentive for follow-up studies.
yamas is an efficient and fast meta-analysis program which offers various methods, including conventional ma as well as inserting proxy-snps for missing markers to avoid unnecessary power loss.
meta-analysis  is widely used to pool genome-wide association studies  in order to a) increase the power to detect strong or weak genotype effects or b) as a result verification method.
