we have implemented agennt that utilizes these services, albeit with datasets purged with respect to unspecific protein functions and overrepresented species.
pfam-nodes are annotated with additional features like go terms describing protein function.
the enzyme function initiative  offers services that compute ssns and gnns.
agennt generates refined gnns  that consist of cluster-nodes representing the sequences under study and pfam-nodes representing enzyme functions encoded in the respective neighborhoods.
for edges, the coverage is given, which is the relative number of neighborhoods containing the considered enzyme function .

an rgnn is easier to interpret than a conventional gnn, which commonly contains proteins without enzymatic function and overly specific neighborhoods due to phylogenetic bias.
in prokaryotes, the genome neighborhood of a gene-product is indicative of its function and thus, a genome neighborhood network  deduced for an ssn provides strong clues to the specific function of enzymes constituting the different clusters.
