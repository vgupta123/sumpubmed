in silico analysis of the complete, but un-annotated, sbw <dig> genome sequence identified  <dig> genes putatively involved in pvd biosynthesis, transport or regulation, which are distributed across seven different regions of the genome.
the pao <dig> pvd regulatory model, which involves a branched fpv signaling pathway, is generally conserved in sbw <dig>  however there is a significant difference in fpvr regulation.
here, we describe the results of a genomic, genetic and structural analysis of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake by the plant growth-promoting bacterium p. fluorescens sbw <dig>
transcriptional assays using gene expression constructs showed that fpvr is positively regulated by fpvi  sigma factor), and not directly by the ferric uptake regulator  as for pao <dig>  deletion of pvdl, encoding a predicted non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  involved in pvd chromophore biosynthesis confirmed the necessity of pvdl for pvd production and for normal growth in iron-limited media.
pyoverdines  are high affinity siderophores, for which the molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis, uptake and regulation have been extensively studied in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  however, the extent to which this regulatory model applies to other pseudomonads is unknown.
pvd gene iron-responsiveness was tested using 'lacz fusions to five pvd loci, representative of structural and regulatory genes.
structural analysis of the sbw <dig> pvd shows a partly cyclic seven residue peptide backbone, identical to that of p. fluorescens atcc <dig>  at least  <dig> putative siderophore receptor genes are present in the sbw <dig> genome enabling the bacterium to utilize  <dig> structurally distinct pvds from  <dig> different pseudomonas isolates.
sbw <dig> produces pvd with a partly cyclic seven amino acid residue backbone, and is able to utilize a wide variety of exogenous pvds.
the genome of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> contains an extensively dispersed set of pvd genes in comparison to other sequenced pseudomonas strains.
in silico analyses suggested that regulation of fpvr  may be unique.
