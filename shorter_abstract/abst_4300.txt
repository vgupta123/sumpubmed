we developed a web-based database server, called gerontome that contains aging-related gene information and user-friendly analysis pipelines.
analysis pipelines for promoter analysis and protein-ligand docking were developed.
the server provides comprehensive age-related gene information and analysis pipelines.
the aging-related genes were categorized by a set of structural terms from gene ontology .
the promoter analysis pipeline allows users to investigate the age-dependent regulation of gene expression.
to construct the gerontome database, we integrated aging-related genes and their annotation data.
to assist basic research on aging, a comprehensive database and analysis platform for aging-related genes is required.
the protein-ligand docking pipeline provides information on the position and orientation of a ligand in an age-related protein surface.
