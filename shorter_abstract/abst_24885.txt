this study has aided in the understanding of flc's role in the clock, as it reveals that the network affecting circadian timing is partially overlapping with the floral-regulatory network.
the circadian system drives pervasive biological rhythms in plants.
multiple signaling pathways affect the circadian system, in ways that are likely to be adaptively significant.
we tested whether these same pathways affect the circadian system.
by mutant analyses, we demonstrate a graded effect of flc expression upon circadian period.
genes in the autonomous flowering pathway, including flc, were found to regulate circadian period in arabidopsis.
we also show a link between vernalization and circadian period.
circadian clocks integrate endogenous timing information with environmental signals, in order to match rhythmic outputs to the local day/night cycle.
related mads-box genes had less effect on clock function.
our previous studies of natural genetic variation in arabidopsis thaliana accessions implicated flowering locus c  as a circadian-clock regulator.
