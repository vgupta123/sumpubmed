we propose methods for prediction of heterotrimeric protein complexes by extending techniques in the previous work on the basis of the idea that most heterotrimeric protein complexes are not likely to share the same protein with each other.
the results suggest that our proposed two-phase methods and svm with the extended features outperform the existing method nwe, which was reported to outperform other existing methods such as mcl, mcode, dpclus, cmc, coach, rrw, and ppsampler for prediction of heterotrimeric protein complexes.
the two-phase method with the extended features and the domain composition kernel using svm as the second classifier is particularly useful for prediction of heterotrimeric protein complexes.
protein complexes play important roles in biological systems such as gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways.
most methods for predicting protein complexes try to find protein complexes with size more than three.
it, however, is known that protein complexes with smaller sizes occupy a large part of whole complexes for several species.
in our previous work, we developed a method with several feature space mappings and the domain composition kernel for prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes, which outperforms existing methods.
we make use of the discriminant function in support vector machines , and design novel feature space mappings for the second phase.
we perform 10-fold cross-validation computational experiments.
we propose two-phase prediction methods with the extended features, the domain composition kernel, svms and rvms.
