traditional candidate gene approach has been widely used for the study of complex diseases including obesity.
our combined strategy of comparative genomics and chromosomal heritability estimate analysis of obesity traits, subscapular skinfold thickness and back-fat thickness in korean cohorts and pig , may overcome the limitations of candidate gene analysis and allow us to better understand genetic predisposition to human obesity.
obesity genetics still awaits further discovery.

we found common genes including fto, the fat mass and obesity associated gene, identified from significant snps by association studies of each trait.
through the estimation of variance of genetic component  for each chromosome by snps, we observed a significant positive correlation  between genetic contributions of human and pig to obesity traits.
these common genes were related to blood pressure and arterial stiffness  and type  <dig> diabetes .
