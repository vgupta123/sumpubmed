the existing genomic resources for nile tilapia include a genetic map, bac end sequences and ests, but comparative genome analysis and maps of quantitative trait loci  are still limited.
mapping of microsatellites enabled integration to the genetic map.
it is a good model to study evolutionary mechanisms in vertebrates, because of its close relationship to haplochromine cichlids, which have undergone rapid speciation in east africa.
from these,  <dig> markers could be associated in  <dig> rh groups, while  <dig> were not linked.
the orientation and association of rh groups to each chromosome and lg was confirmed by chromosomal in situ hybridizations  of  <dig> bacs.
fifty rh groups were localized on the  <dig> chromosomes while  <dig> remained small orphan groups.
all genetic linkage groups with their corresponding rh groups now have a corresponding chromosome which can be identified in the karyotype.
the total size of the rh map is  <dig>  cr <dig> and  <dig> â€‰kb.
the rh map and associated fish map provide a valuable gene-ordered resource for gene mapping and qtl studies.
the nile tilapia  is the second most farmed fish species worldwide.
we have constructed a high-resolution radiation hybrid  panel for the nile tilapia and genotyped  <dig> markers consisting of  <dig> genes,  <dig> markers corresponding to bac end sequences,  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms .
synteny relationships were determined between nile tilapia, stickleback, medaka and pufferfish.
placement of conserved segments indicated that multiple inter-chromosomal rearrangements have occurred between nile tilapia and the other model fishes.
these maps represent a valuable resource for organizing the forthcoming genome sequence of nile tilapia, and provide a foundation for evolutionary studies of east african cichlid fishes.
we have merged lg <dig> and lg <dig> into a single linkage group, and confirmed that lg16-lg <dig> are also merged.
