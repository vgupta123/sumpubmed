this study analyses the effect of both single train and repeated electrical stimulation of lc on na and da release in the medial prefrontal cortex , occipital cortex , and caudate nucleus.
in the presence of the na transport  blocker desipramine , multiple lc stimulation still increased extracellular na and da levels.
local perfusion with tetrodotoxin  markedly reduced baseline na and da in the mpfc and occ and totally suppressed the effect of electrical stimulation in both areas.
na in both cortices and da in the mpfc returned to baseline within  <dig> min after the end of the stimulation period, while da in the occ reached a maximum increase during  <dig> min post-stimulation and remained higher than baseline values at  <dig> min post-stimulation.
the results confirm and extend that lc stimulation induces a concomitant release of da and na in the mpfc and occ.
electrical stimulation of the lc increased na levels in the homolateral caudate nucleus, but failed to modify da level.
we recently demonstrated that the concomitant release of da and na could be elicited in the cerebral cortex by electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus .
to rule out possible stressful effects of electrical stimulation, experiments were performed on chloral hydrate anaesthetised rats.
twenty min electrical stimulation of the lc, with burst type pattern of pulses, increased na and da both in the mpfc and in the occ.
previous studies by our group suggest that extracellular dopamine  and noradrenaline  may be co-released from noradrenergic nerve terminals in the cerebral cortex.
