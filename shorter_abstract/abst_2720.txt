de novo assembly of cdna sequence data generated  <dig>  contigs between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length; with 35% of >  <dig> bp in length.
expression of ichnovirus genes were detected in parasitized larvae with  <dig> unique sequences identified from five pdv gene families including vankyrin, viral innexin, repeat elements, a cysteine-rich motif, and polar residue rich protein.
in addition, the results show that transcription levels of antimicrobial peptides, such as gloverin, cecropin e and lysozyme, were up-regulated after parasitism.
in the current study, d. semiclausum ichnovirus  genes expressed in p. xylostella were identified and their sequences compared with other reported pdvs.
this study provides detailed information on differential expression of p. xylostella larval genes following parasitization, dsiv genes expressed in the host and also improves our current understanding of this host-parasitoid interaction.
transcriptomic approaches provide a powerful approach to study insect host-parasitoid interactions at the molecular level.
parasitization had significant impacts on expression levels of  <dig> identified insect host transcripts.
vankyrin  <dig> and repeat element  <dig> genes showed the highest transcription levels among the dsiv genes.
