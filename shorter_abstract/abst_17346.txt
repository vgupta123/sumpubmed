many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes.
we used massively parallel sequencing of virus like particles to investigate the diversity of the rumen virome in thirteen lactating australian holstein dairy cattle all housed in the same location,  <dig> of which were sampled on the same day.
our findings suggest a large amount of between animal variation in the bovine rumen virome and that co-habiting animals may have more similar viromes than non co-habited animals.
we report the deepest sequencing to date of the rumen virome.
this work highlights the enormous amount of novelty and variation present in the rumen virome.
we compared the functional characteristics of our bovine viromes with that of other viromes, as well as rumen microbiomes.
