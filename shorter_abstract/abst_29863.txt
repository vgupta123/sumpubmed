biological databases and pathway knowledgebases are proliferating rapidly.
we apply these tests to the publicly available reactome releases  and compare the results, which highlight reactome's steady improvement in terms of decreasing inconsistencies.
the case study described in this work demonstrates that it is possible to use our model theory based approach to identify problems one might encounter using a knowledgebase to support hypothesis evaluation tools.
the methodology we use is general and is in no way restricted to the specific knowledgebase employed in this case study.
but before we can reliably use a pathway knowledgebase as a data source, we need to proofread it to ensure that it can fully support computer-aided information integration and inference.
we then use this logic to formulate tests for desirable properties  for pathways stored in reactome.
we also investigate and discuss reactome's potential for supporting computer-aided inference tools.
we design a series of logical tests to detect potential problems we might encounter using a particular knowledgebase, the reactome database, with a particular computer-aided hypothesis evaluation tool, hybrow.
