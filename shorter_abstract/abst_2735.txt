this promoter tagging and real-time screening platform proved valuable for the identification of novel promoters and genes in banana and for monitoring expression patterns throughout in vitro development and low temperature treatment.
qualitative and quantitative gus expression analyses of one tagged promoter in a commercial cultivar demonstrated a reproducible promoter activity pattern during in vitro culture.
thus, this promoter could be used during in vitro selection and generation of commercial transgenic plants.
next-generation transgenic plants will require a more precise regulation of transgene expression, preferably under the control of native promoters.
after discarding positive colonies, cultures were re-screened in real-time at 26°c followed by a gradual decrease to 8°c.
this activating sequence was fused to the uida reporter gene and back-transformed into a commercial dessert banana cultivar, in which its original expression pattern was confirmed.
the baseline activation frequency was  <dig> %, while the frequency of low temperature-responsive luciferase activity was  <dig> % in the same population of cell cultures.
combination of pcr walking techniques was efficient for the isolation of candidate promoters even in a multicopy t-dna line.
rt-pcr analysis in one line containing five inserts allowed the identification of the sequence that had activated luciferase expression under low temperature stress in a developmentally regulated manner.
