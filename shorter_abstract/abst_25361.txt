here we analyze a chloroplast-encoded his-to-asp signal transduction circuit in the stramenopile heterosigma akashiwo  hada ex y. hara et chihara .
functionally, an organism uses a variety of signal transduction arrays to amplify and convert these perceived signals into appropriate gene transcriptional responses.
these data represent the first documentation of a his-to-asp array in stramenopiles and counter previous reports suggesting that such regulatory proteins are lacking in this taxonomic cluster.
the evolutionary conservation of these proteins argues that they are important for the maintenance of chloroplast homeostasis.
the occurrence of trg <dig> protein in actively growing h. akashiwo cells was verified by western analysis.
sequence analysis of h. akashiwo rpod showed this nuclear-encoded gene has a well-defined  <dig>  domain, a region that augments rna polymerase interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins and also serves in - <dig> promoter recognition.
comparison of the  <dig> kda h. akashiwo tsg <dig> with bacterial sensor kinases showed that the algal protein exhibits a moderately maintained pas motif in the sensor kinase domain as well as highly conserved h, n, g <dig> and f motifs within the histidine kinase atp binding site.
these changes in gene expression serve to modify selective metabolic processes and thus optimize reproductive success.
molecular modelling of the  <dig> kda h. akashiwo trg <dig> regulator protein was consistent with a winged helix-turn-helix identity – a class of proteins that is known to impact gene expression at the level of transcription.
our data suggest that chloroplast gene transcription may be impacted by the interaction of the his-to-asp regulator protein  with the rna polymerase σ <dig> subunit.
