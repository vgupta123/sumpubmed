epithelial cells and dendritic cells  both initiate and contribute to innate immune responses to bacteria.
however, much less is known about the coordinated regulation of innate immune responses between gecs and immune cells, particularly dcs in the oral cavity.
responses of both cell types were bacteria-specific, as demonstrated by distinctive profiles of hbds mrna expression and secreted cytokines and chemokines in response to cell wall preparations of various bacteria of different pathogenicity: fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii and porphyromonas gingivalis.
the results suggest that cytokines, chemokines and β-defensins are involved in interaction of these two cell types, and the responses are bacteria-specific.
differential and coordinated regulation between gecs and dcs may be important in regulation of innate immune homeostasis and response to pathogens in the oral cavity.
hbd <dig> significantly induced il- <dig>  while hbd <dig> induced mcp- <dig> to approximately the same extent as lps, suggesting a unique role in immune responses.
the β-defensin antimicrobial peptides hbd <dig>  hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> were expressed by immature dcs as well as gingival epithelial cells .
the present study was conducted to investigate whether their responses are coordinated and are bacteria-specific in the oral cavity.
