in traditional vine areas, the production should present a typicity that partly depends on the grapevine variety.
different digestion patterns revealed different methylation status, especially different levels of de-methylation, that are the consequence of the in vitro culture.
seven and five somaclones of 'chardonnay 96' and 'syrah 174', respectively, which covered at least all polymorphic loci found in aflp analysis were used for msap study.
the detection of the same polymorphic bands in numerous somaclones of different cultivars suggests the possibility of hot spots of dna methylation variation.
the percentage of full methylation at ccgg recognition sites was slightly higher in somaclones due to more polymorphic bands generated after cleavage by ecori/hpaii.
msap highlights dna methylation variation in somaclones compared to mother clones and, therefore, is a powerful tool for genotypic characterisation of somatic embryo-derived grapevines.
therefore, somatic embryogenesis through in vitro culture technique could be useful for the selection of improved cultivars with subtle changes but conserving their main characteristics.
ssrs were only useful to verify the conservation of the microsatellite genotype between the somaclones and the respective mother clones.
in order to study tissue culture-induced variation of grapevine, we have analysed  <dig> somaclones obtained from somatic embryos of two distinct cultivars using molecular marker techniques.
aflp polymorphism between mother clones and somaclones was  <dig> â€“ <dig>  times higher to that found between clones.
ssr profiles of the 'chardonnay' and 'syrah' somaclones were the same as of the respective mother clones.
in vitro somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis can lead to genotypic and phenotypic variations, described as somaclonal variation, that could be useful for the selection of improved grapevine genotypes.
