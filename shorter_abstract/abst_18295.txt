further studies to investigate the factors which determine the emergence and persistence of mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae in jamaican hospitals and their impact on clinical and economic outcomes at such institutions would be useful.
the clonal relatedness of  <dig> multidrug resistant  strains of extended spectrum beta-lactamase  producing k. pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens from hospitalized patients at a jamaican hospital during a  <dig> year period were determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis .
the clonal and temporal distribution of the mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains among clinical service areas did not suggest outbreaks of the organism during the period of study.
the most frequently occurring strains belonged to clones i , ii , iii  and iv  which accounted for 86%  of esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains over the  <dig> year period.
instead the molecular epidemiology of esbl producing k. pneumoniae at this hospital was more representative of an endemic persistence of clones of the organism with limited dissemination from patient to patient.
a total  <dig> different esbl producing k. pneumoniae genotypes designated clones i-x were found.
the remaining  <dig>  cases of esbl producing k. pneumoniae were due to strains of clones v-x.
