to improve this, we developed a universal two-step approach, named 'fast forward genetics', which combines traditional bulk segregant techniques with targeted genomic enrichment and next-generation sequencing technology
as the approach is independent of genome size, it can be applied to any model system of interest.
phenotype-driven forward genetic experiments are powerful approaches for linking phenotypes to genomic elements but they still involve a laborious positional cloning process.
although sequencing of complete genomes now becomes available, discriminating causal mutations from the enormous amounts of background variation remains a major challenge.
we demonstrated that the 'fast forward genetics' procedure efficiently identifies a small number of testable candidate mutations.
