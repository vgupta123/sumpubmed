baymir performed better than all other methods in both benchmarks and, surprisingly, the variation index performed better than cometa and some individual determinants of the targetscan context scores.
the baymir package is publicly available and can be readily applied to any mrna expression data sets.
we also found that mrna expression variation can be used as another predictor of functional mirna targets.
we benchmarked baymir, the expression variation, cometa, and the targetscan “context scores” on two tasks: predicting independently validated mirna targets and predicting the decrease in mrna abundance in mirna overexpression assays.
baymir applies a large number of mrna expression profiles and successfully identifies the mrna targets and mirna activities without using mirna expression data.
baymir gives higher scores to target sites residing near the poly tail which strongly favors mrna degradation using poly shortening.
we introduce baymir, a new computational method, that predicts the functionality of potential mirna target sites using the activity level of the mirnas inferred from genome-wide mrna expression profiles.
we develop a new computational method for predicting the target mrnas of mirnas.
our work also suggests that modeling multiplicative interactions among mirnas is important to predict endogenous mrna targets.
furthermore, baymir predicted mirna target sets are more consistently annotated with go and kegg terms than similar sized random subsets of genes with conserved mirna seed regions.
popular mirna target prediction techniques use sequence features to determine the functional mirna target sites.
gene expression data are rich resources that can complement sequence features to take into account the context dependency of mirnas.
