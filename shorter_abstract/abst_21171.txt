inoculation of rabbits with extracts from both plant types resulted in a weak immune response, and antisera neither reacted with native hpv- <dig> l <dig> vlps, nor did they neutralise hpv- <dig> pseudovirion infectivity.
immunization of new zealand white rabbits with ~ <dig> μg of plant-derived hpv- <dig> l <dig> nls- protein induced an antibody response that predominantly recognized insect cell-produced hpv- <dig> l <dig> nls- and not nls+ vlps.
neutralising monoclonal antibodies binding both surface-linear and conformation-specific epitopes bound the a. thaliana-derived particles and – to a lesser degree – the n. tabacum-derived particles, suggesting that plant-derived and insect cell-derived vlps displayed similar antigenic properties.
the hpv- <dig> l <dig> nls- gene was stably integrated and inherited through several generations of transgenic plants.
