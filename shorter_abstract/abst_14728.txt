for each positive set, we construct two corresponding negative sets, one is by our method and the other by random method.
each positive set is combined with a negative set to form a dataset for model training and performance evaluation.
finally, the performance of support vector machine , random forest  and naive bayes  is evaluated on the generated  <dig> datasets.
the identification of protein-rna interactions  is important to understanding cell activities.

concretely, we firstly collect the known pris as positive samples for generating positive sets.
consequently, we get  <dig> datasets of different species and different ratios of negative samples to positive samples.
secondly, sequence-based features are extracted to represent each of pris and protein-rna pairs in the datasets.
extensive experiments show that comparing to using randomly-generated negative samples, all classifiers achieve substantial performance improvement by using negative samples selected by our method.
for boosting the performance of pri prediction, we propose a novel method to generate reliable negative samples.
one major reason is that they usually use unreliable negative samples in the training process.
the improvements on accuracy and geometric mean for the svm classifier, the rf classifier and the nb classifier are as high as  <dig>  and  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.
a filter-based method is employed to cut down the dimensionality of feature vectors for reducing computational cost.
