one thousand and twenty-three proteins were not reported in previous studies at the proteome level and were unique to our study.
here we performed a proteomic analysis of urine samples from pregnant and non-pregnant patients using gel electrophoresis and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
among these phosphoproteins,  <dig> of them were found to be significantly differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and two were down-regulated in urine samples from women just before vaginal delivery.
our results may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of pregnancy maintenance, potentially leading to the development of biomarker-based sensitive assays for understanding pregnancy.
taken together, these results offer a comprehensive urinary proteomic profile of healthy women during before and after vaginal delivery and novel information on the phosphoproteins that are differentially regulated during the maintenance of normal pregnancy.
in total,  <dig> proteins  were identified, including  <dig> from the urine of pregnant volunteers and  <dig> from the urine of non-pregnant volunteers.
