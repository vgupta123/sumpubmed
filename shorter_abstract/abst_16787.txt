significantly, ~60% of the gaca-tagged and all the gata-tagged transcripts showed highest or unique expression in the testis and/or spermatozoa.
simple sequence repeats  of gaca/gata have been implicated with differentiation of sex-chromosomes and speciation.
this is envisaged to establish the roles of integral simple sequence repeats and tagged transcripts in gene expression or regulation.
we explored several genomes and transcriptomes, and observed total absence of these repeats in the prokaryotes, with their gradual accumulation in higher eukaryotes.
moreover, the distribution of gaca and gata repeats in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes was studied to highlight their significance in genome evolution.
the main objective of this study was to explore the buffalo transcriptome for its association with gaca/gata repeats, and study the structural organization and differential expression of the gaca/gata repeat tagged transcripts.
comparative analysis suggests the gradual accumulation of these repeats in the higher eukaryotes, and establishes the gaca richness of the buffalo transcriptome.
further, employing novel microsatellite associated sequence amplification  approach using varying length oligos based on gaca and gata repeats; we identified and characterized  <dig> types of known and novel mrna transcripts tagged with these repeats from different somatic tissues, gonads and spermatozoa of water buffalo bubalus bubalis.
present study is a pioneer attempt exploring gaca/gata tagged transcriptome in any mammalian species highlighting their tissue, stage and species-specific expression profiles.
