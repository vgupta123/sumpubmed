in the present study, we have used high-throughput screen datasets for the discovery of apicoplast inhibitors of the malarial pathogen as assayed from the delayed death response.
we further evaluated the active molecules using a substructure based approach to identify common substructures enriched in the active set.
the recent availability of high-throughput phenotypic screen datasets for antimalarial activity offers a possibility to create computational models for bioactivity based on chemical descriptors of molecules with potential to accelerate drug discovery for malaria.
we found random forest based approach provides for better accuracy as assessed from roc curve analysis.
the molecules were further evaluated for common substructures using a maximum common substructure  based approach.
we argue that the computational models generated could be effectively used to screen large molecular datasets to prioritize them for phenotypic screens, drastically reducing cost while improving the hit rate.
