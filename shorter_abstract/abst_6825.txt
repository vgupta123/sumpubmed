most mirnas were down regulated during the fungus infection in the susceptible genotype; however, in the resistant genotype, most mirnas did not vary during rust attack.
among the  <dig> mirnas analyzed, all showed different expression profiles during biotic and abiotic stresses to soybean.
in order to identify new mirnas in soybean and to verify those that are possibly water deficit and rust-stress regulated, eight libraries of small rnas were constructed and submitted to solexa sequencing.
a prediction of the putative targets was carried out for conserved and novel mirnas families.
validation of our results with quantitative rt-qpcr revealed that solexa sequencing is a powerful tool for mirna discovery.
from this total, we identified  <dig> families of novel mirnas that had not been reported before, six families of conserved mirnas that exist in other plants species, and  <dig> families previously reported in soybean.
small rnas  are key regulators of gene expression that guide both transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms in eukaryotes.
the identification of differentially expressed plant mirnas provides molecular evidence for the possible involvement of mirnas in the process of water deficit- and rust-stress responses.
however, for the tolerant genotype, most of the mirnas were down regulated.
the majority of mirnas were up-regulated during water deficit stress in the sensitive plants.
to validate novel mirnas, we performed rt-qpcr across the eight different libraries.
current studies have demonstrated that micrornas  act in several plant pathways associated with tissue proliferation, differentiation, and development and in response to abiotic and biotic stresses.
the libraries were developed from drought-sensitive and tolerant seedlings and rust-susceptible and resistant soybeans with or without stressors.
