bacille calmette-guerin  is currently the only available vaccine against tuberculosis  and comprises a heterogeneous family of sub-strains with genotypic and phenotypic differences.
here, we combine two-dimensional electrophoresis  and mass spectrometry to analyse the proteomic profile of culture filtrate proteins  from m. bovis bcg moreau, the brazilian vaccine strain, comparing it to that of bcg pasteur.
these findings contribute to the detailed characterization of the brazilian vaccine strain against tb, revealing aspects that may lead to a better understanding of the factors leading to bcg's variable protective efficacy against tb.
here we report the detailed 2de profile of cfps from m. bovis bcg moreau and its comparison to bcg pasteur, identifying differences that may provide relevant information on vaccine efficacy.
the 2de proteomic map of m. bovis bcg moreau cfps in the ph range  <dig> -  <dig> allowed the identification of  <dig> spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins, identified by ms/ms.
comparison to bcg pasteur highlights the great similarity between these bcg strains.
however, quantitative analysis shows a higher expression of immunogenic proteins such as rv <dig> , rv1926c  and rv1886c  in bcg moreau when compared to bcg pasteur, while some heat shock proteins, such as rv <dig>  and rv <dig> , show the opposite pattern.
