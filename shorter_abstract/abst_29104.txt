while the horse reference genome is available, there has been no large-scale functional annotation of the genome using expressed genes derived from transcriptomes.
the first sequencing-based horse transcriptome data, extensive analyses results, deferentially expressed genes before and after exercise, and candidate genes that are related to the exercise are provided in this study.
in addition, we found interesting rna expression patterns where different alternative splicing forms of the same gene showed reversed expressions before and after exercising.
by comparing current genome annotations, we identified  <dig>  unigene clusters spanning  <dig> â€‰mb that contained  <dig>   annotated genes.
more than 60%  of the unigene clusters did not match any current equine gene model.
we present a large-scale analysis of whole transcriptome data.
we sequenced the whole mrna from the blood and muscle tissues of six thoroughbred horses before and after exercise.
