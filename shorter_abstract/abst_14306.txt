existing clustering approaches for microarray data do not adequately differentiate between subsets of co-expressed genes.
these results show the potential of our technique for functional prediction and regulatory motif identification from microarray data.
we devised a novel approach that integrates expression and sequence data in order to generate functionally coherent and biologically meaningful subclusters of genes.

specifically, the approach clusters co-expressed genes on the basis of similar content and distributions of predicted statistically significant sequence motifs in their upstream regions.
