the process of translation can be affected by the use of rare versus common codons within the mrna transcript.
genes predicted to be secreted show significant enrichment in 5' rare codon clusters, but not 3' rare codon clusters.
here, we show that rare codons are enriched at the 5' and 3' termini of genes from e. coli and other prokaryotes.
potential functional roles for the enrichment of rare codons at terminal positions are explored.
surprisingly, no correlation between 5' mrna structure and rare codon usage was observed.
