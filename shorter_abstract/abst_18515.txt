required to process full-length articles, an ineffective gene mention tagger may produce a huge number of ambiguous false positives that overwhelm subsequent filtering steps while still missing many true positives.
its tap-k scores are competitive to the best results among all participants.
our gn system achieved a precision of  <dig>   on the biocreative iii gn test corpus with the silver annotation of  <dig> articles.
we show that despite the lack of clever disambiguation in our gene normalization system, effective soft tagging of gene mention variants can indeed contribute to performance in cross-species and full-text gene normalization.
we present our gn system participated in the biocreative iii gn task.
previously, gene normalization  systems are mostly focused on disambiguation using contextual information.
an effective gene mention tagger is deemed unnecessary because the subsequent steps will filter out false positives and high recall is sufficient.
however, unlike similar tasks in the past biocreative challenges, the biocreative iii gn task is particularly challenging because it is not species-specific.
