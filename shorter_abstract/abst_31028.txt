reconstructed models may contain inconsistencies that appear as gap metabolites and blocked reactions.
moreover, a method for the detection of unconnected modules, defined as isolated sets of blocked reactions connected through gap metabolites, is proposed.
metabolic reconstruction is the computational-based process that aims to elucidate the network of metabolites interconnected through reactions catalyzed by activities assigned to one or more genes.
we introduce a general definition of gap metabolite that allows its detection in a straightforward manner.
the outcome of its application to the genome-scale model b. cuenoti icg <dig> is a more accurate model version named as b. cuenoti imp <dig>
although automatic methods for solving this problem have been previously developed, there are many situations where manual curation is still needed.
