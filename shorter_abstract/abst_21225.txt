the main algorithm of redundancyminer, multiclust, performs a novel form of cluster analysis in which a go category might belong to several category clusters.
tools such as gominer can leverage go to perform ontological analysis of microarray and proteomics studies, typically generating a list of significant functional categories.
for illustration, we have applied it to the clarification of the results arising from two current studies:  assessment of the gene expression profiles obtained by laser capture microdissection  of serial cryosections of the retina at the site of final optic fissure closure in the mouse embryos at specific embryonic stages, and  analysis of a conceptual data set obtained by examining a list of genes deemed to be "kinetochore" genes.
each category cluster follows a "complete linkage" paradigm.
the redundancy might typically inflate the report of significant categories by a factor of three-fold, create an illusion of an overly long list of significant categories, and obscure the relevant biological interpretation.
