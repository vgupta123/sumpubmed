most nodulation functions as well as a putative type-iv secretion system are found in a distinct symbiosis region.
the genome analysis reveals that a. caulinodans is a diazotroph that acquired the capacity to nodulate most probably through horizontal gene transfer of a complex symbiosis island.
azorhizobium caulinodans ors <dig> has the dual capacity to fix nitrogen both as free-living organism and in a symbiotic interaction with sesbania rostrata.
the host is a fast-growing, submergence-tolerant tropical legume on which a. caulinodans can efficiently induce nodule formation on the root system and on adventitious rootlets located on the stem.
it potentially encodes  <dig> proteins of which  <dig> % have homologs and  <dig> % are unique for a. caulinodans.
these combined features and the availability of the annotated genome make a. caulinodans an attractive organism to explore symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation beyond leguminous plants.
biological nitrogen fixation is a prokaryotic process that plays an essential role in the global nitrogen cycle.
the  <dig> -mb genome consists of a single circular chromosome with an overall average gc of 67% and numerous islands with varying gc contents.
the genome contains numerous genes that reflect a strong adaptive and metabolic potential.
