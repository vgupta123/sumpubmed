we defined a collection of  <dig> pathway features, whose information content we evaluated with respect to the gold standard.
feature data were used as input to an extensive collection of machine learning  methods, including na√Øve bayes, decision trees, and logistic regression, together with feature selection and ensemble methods.
however, pathway prediction performance appears to be limited largely by the ability to correctly match enzymes to the reactions they catalyze based on genome annotations.
to quantitatively validate methods for pathway prediction, we developed a large "gold standard" dataset of  <dig>  pathway instances known to be present or absent in curated metabolic pathway databases for six organisms.
we compared the ml methods to the previous pathologic algorithm for pathway prediction using the gold standard dataset.
ml methods for pathway prediction perform as well as existing methods, and have qualitative advantages in terms of extensibility, tunability, and explainability.
one strategy for addressing this problem is to predict which metabolic pathways, from a reference database of known pathways, are present in the organism, based on the annotated genome of the organism.
we found that ml-based prediction methods can match the performance of the pathologic algorithm.
the ml-based prediction methods achieved accuracy as high as  <dig> % and f-measure as high as  <dig> .
more advanced prediction methods and/or more sophisticated input features may improve the performance of ml methods.
