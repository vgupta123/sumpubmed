in the present study, a variety of parametric and graph theoretical clustering algorithms are compared using well-characterized transcriptomic data at a genome scale from saccharomyces cerevisiae.

these algorithms cover a broad range of approaches, from conventional techniques such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, to graphical approaches such as k-clique communities, weighted gene co-expression networks  and paraclique.
jaccard similarity was used to measure each cluster's agreement with every go and kegg annotation set, and the highest jaccard score was assigned to the cluster.
clusters were grouped into small, medium, and large bins, and the jaccard score of the top five scoring clusters in each bin were averaged and reported as the best average top  <dig>  score for the particular method.
