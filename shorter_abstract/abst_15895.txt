using  <dig> diversity ‘tag’ sequencing we investigate the diversity and distribution of these protists in marine sediments and water column samples taken from the deep chlorophyll maximum  and sub-surface using both dna and rna as the source template and sampling four european offshore locations.
we detected the presence of  <dig> sequences branching with known perkinsea, the majority of them recovered from marine sediments.
given the phylogenetic range of hosts infected by known perkinsea parasites, these data suggest that perkinsea either play a significant but hitherto unrecognized role as parasites in marine sediments and/or members of this group are present in the marine sediment possibly as part of the ‘seed bank’ microbial community.
these results demonstrate that the perkinsea lineage is considerably more diverse than previously detected in marine environments.
moreover, 27% of these sequences were sampled from rna derived cdna libraries.
here, we test the hypothesis that perkinsea are a hitherto under-sampled group in marine environments.
recent studies making use of environmental small sub-unit ribosomal rna gene  sequencing methodologies have detected a significant diversity and abundance of perkinsea-like phylotypes in freshwater environments.
this wide diversity of perkinsea-like protists is largely retrieved in marine sediment with a significant proportion detected in rna derived libraries suggesting this diversity represents ribosomally ‘active’ and intact cells.
phylogenetic analyses classify a large proportion of these sequences into  <dig> cluster groups , which share less than 97% sequence similarity suggesting this diversity encompasses a range of biologically and ecologically distinct organisms.
