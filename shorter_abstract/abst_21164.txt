we have developed deiva, a free and open source, browser-based single page application  with a strong emphasis on being user friendly that enables locating and identifying single or multiple genes in an immediate, interactive, and intuitive manner.
differential gene expression  analysis is a technique to identify statistically significant differences in rna abundance for genes or arbitrary features between different biological states.
we identified a need for a web-based system to share dge statistical test results, and locate and identify genes in dge statistical test results with a very low barrier of entry.
compared to existing software, deiva offers a unique combination of design decisions that enable inspection and analysis of dge statistical test results with an emphasis on ease of use.
the result of a dge test is typically further analyzed using statistical software, spreadsheets or custom ad hoc algorithms.
