we have taken alternative protein crystal structures and generated simulation snapshots to explicitly investigate the impact of structural changes on the alignments.
protein structural alignment provides a fundamental basis for deriving principles of functional and evolutionary relationships.
we show that structural diversity has a significant effect on structural alignment.
a comprehensive treatment of ambiguous alignment regions is crucial for further development of structural alignment applications and for the representation of alignments in general.
a salient example is the groes 'mobile loop' where sub-Ã…ngstrom variations give rise to contradictory sequence alignments.
however, the available techniques do not fully consider the implications of protein structural diversity and typically generate a single alignment between sequences.
it is routinely used for structural classification and functional characterization of proteins and for the construction of sequence alignment benchmarks.
