we also discuss the possibility that they are involved in the regulation of cell numbers in response to food supply in hydra.
our results indicate that 14-3- <dig> proteins have been ubiquitous signalling components since the start of metazoan evolution.
14-3- <dig> proteins have been implicated in many signalling mechanisms due to their interaction with ser/thr phosphorylated target proteins.
a diverse array of target proteins has been found in higher plants and in human cell lines including proteins involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organisation, secretion and ca2+ signalling.
in order to investigate whether the diversity of 14-3- <dig> target proteins is also conserved over the whole animal kingdom we isolated 14-3- <dig> binding proteins from hydra vulgaris using a 14-3-3-affinity column.
they are evolutionarily well conserved in eukaryotic organisms from single celled protozoans and unicellular algae to plants and humans.
