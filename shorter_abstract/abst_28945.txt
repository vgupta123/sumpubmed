this work aims to study the gene expression profiles associated with zinc or cadmium exposure and to identify genes involved in metal tolerance in these two metallicolous mesorhizobium strains of interest for mine phytostabilization purposes.
for instance, several pib-type atpases and genes likely to participate in metal sequestration were identified.
comparative genomics and transcriptomics allowed the rapid discovery of metal-specific or/and strain-specific genes.

the comparative rnaseq-based approach revealed a relatively low number of genes significantly regulated in the two mesorhizobium strains.
downstream functional studies will increase successful phytostabilization strategies by selecting appropriate metallicolous rhizobial partners.
very few of them were involved in the non-specific metal response, indicating that the approach was well suited for identifying genes that specifically respond to zinc and cadmium.
the draft genomes of the two mezorhizobium strains were sequenced and used to map rnaseq data obtained after zinc or cadmium stresses.
among significantly up-regulated genes, several encode metal efflux and sequestration systems which can be considered as the most widely represented mechanisms of rhizobial metal tolerance.
additionally, global analyses suggested that both metals also repressed significantly the translational machinery.
