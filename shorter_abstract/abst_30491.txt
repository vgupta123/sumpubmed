interest in lycopene metabolism and regulation is growing rapidly because accumulative studies have suggested an important role for lycopene in human health promotion.
functional assignments of the differentially expressed genes indicated that  <dig> reliable metabolic pathways are altered in the mutant; the most noticeable ones are carotenoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and citrate cycle.
on a spontaneous sweet orange bud mutant with abnormal lycopene accumulation in fruits and its wild type, comparative transcripts profiling was performed using massively parallel signature sequencing .
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reliable signatures were obtained for the wild type  and the mutant , respectively.
this study provided a global picture of the gene expression changes in a sweet orange red-flesh mutant as compared to the wild type.
interpretation of the differentially expressed genes revealed new insight into the molecular processes regulating lycopene accumulation in the sweet orange red-flesh mutant.
however, little is known about the molecular processes regulating lycopene accumulation in fruits other than tomato so far.
these data suggest that enhanced photosynthesis and partial impairment of lycopene downstream flux are critical for the formation of lycopene accumulation trait in the mutant.
interpretation of the mpss signatures revealed that the total number of transcribed gene in mt is  <dig> , larger than that in wt  <dig> , suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurs in the mt.
