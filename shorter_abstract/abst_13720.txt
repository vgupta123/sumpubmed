anatomy ontologies play an increasingly important role in developing integrated bioinformatics applications.
in this paper we describe a solution that is based on our work on an anatomy ontology for mouse embryo development, which is part of the edinburgh mouse atlas project .
with the proposed name set approach, rather than having to standardise hierarchies, it is sufficient to agree on a suitable set of basic tissue terms and their meaning in order to facilitate the integration of multiple partonomic hierarchies.
as there are a number of ways to divide up the anatomical structure of an organism, each may be represented by more than one valid partonomic  hierarchy.
one of the primary relationships between anatomical tissues represented in such ontologies is part-of.
a prototype was implemented in prolog for evaluation purposes.
