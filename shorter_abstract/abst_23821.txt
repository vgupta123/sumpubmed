these technologies are now widely used in biology research such as in genome-wide identification of polymorphisms, transcription factor binding sites, methylation states, and transcript expression profiles.
evaluations on both real and simulation datasets suggest that boat is capable of mapping large volumes of short reads to reference sequences with better sensitivity and lower memory requirement than other currently existing algorithms.
mapping the sequencing reads to reference genomes efficiently and effectively is one of the most critical analysis tasks.
boat calculates an e-value for each hit as a quality assessment and provides customizable post-mapping filters for further mapping quality control.
we report a new algorithm, basic oligonucleotide alignment tool  that can accurately and efficiently map sequencing reads back to the reference genome.
the source code and pre-compiled binary packages of boat are publicly available for download at http://boat.cbi.pku.edu.cn under gnu public license .
boat can handle several substitutions and indels simultaneously, a useful feature for identifying snps and other genomic structural variations in functional genomic studies.
although several tools have been developed, their performance suffers when both multiple substitutions and insertions/deletions  occur together.
for better handling of low-quality reads, boat supports a "3'-end trimming mode" to build local optimized alignment for sequencing reads, further improving sensitivity.
