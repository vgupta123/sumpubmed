all cell lines were then independently re-cultured and along with another set of  <dig> independent cases and controls, were profiled with affymetrix microarrays to perform a technical validation of the rna-seq results.
here, we used rna-seq to study the transcriptomes of matched coronary artery disease cases and controls in the clinseqÂ® study, using cell lines as tissue surrogates.
lymphoblastoid cell lines  from  <dig> cases and controls representing phenotypic extremes for coronary calcification were cultured and analyzed using rna-seq.

we present a pilot study for transcriptome involvement in coronary artery calcification and demonstrate how rna-seq analyses using lcls as a tissue surrogate may yield fruitful results in a clinical sequencing project.
next, by fitting a linear model to exon-level rna-seq read counts, we detected signals of alternative splicing in  <dig> transcripts.
at the network level, we found evidence for perturbation in pathways involving both cardiovascular system development and function as well as lipid metabolism.
overall, differentially expressed genes showed strong enrichment  for prior association with cardiovascular disease.
in addition to canonical gene expression, we present candidate variants from alternative splicing and novel transcript detection, which have been unexplored in the context of this disease.
finally, we used the rna-seq data to identify differential expression  in eight previously unannotated regions that may represent novel transcripts.
