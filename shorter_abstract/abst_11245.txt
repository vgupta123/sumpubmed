relationships among the nine first-branching families in the lamiales tree are now resolved with very strong support.
confidence about deep nodes of the lamiales tree is an important step towards understanding the evolutionary diversification of a major clade of flowering plants.
the addition of further sequence data from introns and spacers holds promise to eventually obtain a fully resolved plastid tree of lamiales.
the multiple independent evolution of the carnivorous syndrome, once in lentibulariaceae and a second time in byblidaceae, is strongly supported by all analyses and topological tests.
however, understanding the evolution of these phenomena in the order, and clarifying borders of and relationships among lamialean families, has been hindered by largely unresolved trees in the past.
the evolution of selected morphological characters such as flower symmetry is discussed.
subsequent to plocospermataceae, a clade consisting of carlemanniaceae plus oleaceae branches, followed by tetrachondraceae and a newly inferred clade composed of gesneriaceae plus calceolariaceae, which is also supported by morphological characters.
