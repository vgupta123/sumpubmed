the dataset obtained through this analysis will provide a platform for functional genomics in common bean and related legumes and will aid in the development of molecular markers that can be used for tagging genes of interest.
in addition, a large number of simple sequence repeats  and transcription factors were also identified in this study.
this work provides the first large scale identification of the common bean transcriptome derived by  <dig> pyrosequencing.
the common bean unigenes were also compared to the bean bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequences, and a total of 21% of the unigenes  including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons match to the  <dig>  bac-end sequences.
functional annotation of the unigenes carried out by gene ontology assignments from hits to arabidopsis and soybean indicated coverage of a broad range of go categories.
common bean  is the most important food legume in the world.
although this crop is very important to both the developed and developing world as a means of dietary protein supply, resources available in common bean are limited.
however, the number and description of common bean sequences are very limited, which greatly inhibits genome and transcriptome research.
here we used  <dig> pyrosequencing to obtain a substantial transcriptome dataset for common bean.
comparing the unigenes to common bean ests deposited in genbank, we found that  <dig> % or  <dig>  of these unigenes had no matches to this dataset and can be considered as new common bean transcripts.
additionally, these sequences will provide a means for better annotation of the on-going common bean whole genome sequencing.
this research has resulted in a 150% increase in the number of phaseolus vulgaris ests.
