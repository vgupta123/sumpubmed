under resting conditions, spms maintained high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression , whereas bms produced high levels of suppressive cytokines .
to date, most experimental studies have been performed on macrophages derived from bone marrow, spleen and peritoneum.
in this study, the features of murine macrophages from bone marrow, spleen and peritoneum were compared.
we found that peritoneal macrophages  appear to be more mature than bone marrow derived macrophages  and splenic macrophages  based on their morphology and surface molecular characteristics.
our results show that bms, spms and pms are distinct populations with different biological functions, providing clues to guide their further experimental or therapeutic use.
macrophages have heterogeneous phenotypes and complex functions within both innate and adaptive immune responses.
however, differences among macrophages from these particular sources remain unclear.
