this demonstrates the applicability of next-generation sequencing technology and comparative genomic analysis in the development of cho genomic resources.
high-throughput illumina sequencing was used to generate a 1x genomic coverage of an engineered cho cell line expressing secreted alkaline phosphatase .
yet few genomic resources are available to aid in engineering high-producing cell lines.
the majority of these genes are involved in metabolic processes, cellular signaling, and transport and represent attractive targets for cell line engineering.
reference-guided alignment and assembly produced  <dig>  million contigs and cho-specific sequence information for ~  <dig>  mouse and ~  <dig>  rat orthologous genes.
