the data from such experiments contain many false positives and false negatives, but can be processed using computational methods to provide reliable information about protein-protein relationships and protein function.
an outstanding and important goal is to predict detailed functional annotation for all uncharacterized proteins that is reliable enough to effectively guide experiments.
we present avid, a computational method that uses a multi-stage learning framework to integrate experimental results with sequence information, generating networks reflecting functional similarities among proteins.
assignments of highly detailed functional descriptors to proteins, based on the networks, are estimated to be ~67% accurate for go categories describing molecular function and cellular component and ~52% accurate for terms describing biological process.
we illustrate use of the networks by making predictions of detailed gene ontology  annotations in three categories: molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.
we use these networks to generate new, highly detailed functional predictions for roughly half of the yeast proteome that are reliable enough to drive targeted experimental investigations.
thus, avid will be a valuable resource for experimental biologists.
out of  <dig>  predicted pair-wise relationships, the greatest number shared in common with another method is  <dig> .
