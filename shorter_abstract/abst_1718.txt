in the context of inducible defenses, one of the most studied cases of plasticity, the wgp x tgp interaction has been poorly investigated.
the wgp x tgp interaction patterns are trait-specific and lead to decreased slope of reaction norms .
the wgp x tgp interaction further lead to a switch from a plastic towards a constitutive expression of defenses for shell dimensions .
wgp-alteration by tgp may shape the adaptive responses to environmental change and then has a substantial importance to understand the evolution of plasticity.
we provide evidence that tgp can alter the reaction norms of inducible defenses in a freshwater snail.

recent evidence suggests that wgp is altered by the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations .
within-generational plasticity  and transgenerational plasticity  are mechanisms allowing rapid adaptive responses to fluctuating environments without genetic change.
offspring from induced parents showed a higher predator avoidance behaviour and a thicker shell than snails from non-induced parents in no predator-cue environment while they reached similar defenses in predator-cue environment.
