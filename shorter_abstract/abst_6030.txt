we have generated a high-resolution phylogenetic tree from  <dig> francisella isolates, including  <dig> f. tularensis subspecies holarctica  strains,  <dig> f. tularensis subsp.
the phylogenetic tree was used to guide the selection of informative snps specific to major nodes in the tree for development of a genotyping assay for identification of f. tularensis subspecies and clades.
a low genetic diversity in francisella tularensis has been documented.
additionally, whole genome sequence based snp information gained from a representative population of strains may be used to perform evolutionary or phylogenetic comparisons of strains, or selection of unique strains for whole-genome sequencing projects.
whole-genome snp based clustering was shown to accurately identify snps for differentiation of f. tularensis subspecies and clades, emphasizing the potential power and utility of this methodology for selecting snps for typing of f. tularensis to the strain level.
whole genome sequencing is the most accurate and reliable method to identify, type and determine phylogenetic relationships among strains of a species.
tularensis  strains and a single f. novicida strain.
current dna based genotyping methods for typing f. tularensis offer a limited and varying degree of subspecies, clade and strain level discrimination power.
we designed and validated an assay that uses these snps to accurately genotype  <dig> additional f. tularensis strains as type a  or type b .
the tree was generated from global multi-strain single nucleotide polymorphism  data collected using a set of six affymetrix genechipÂ® resequencing arrays with the non-repetitive portion of lvs  as the reference sequence complemented with unique sequences of schu s <dig> .
