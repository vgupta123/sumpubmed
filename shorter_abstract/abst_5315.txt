starting from individual sequence alignments, and using monophyletic groups defined by the user, scafos creates chimeras with partial sequences, or selects, among multiple sequences, the orthologous and/or slowest evolving sequences.
scafos is able to deal with datasets of hundreds of species and genes, both at the amino acid or nucleotide level.
once sequences representing each predefined monophyletic group have been selected, scafos retains genes according to the user's allowed level of missing data and generates files for super-matrix and super-tree analyses in several formats compatible with standard phylogenetic inference software.
however, several difficulties are associated with the assembly of large datasets, such as multiple copies of a gene per species , lack of some genes for a given species, or partial sequences.
the use of undetected paralogous or xenologous genes in phylogenetic inference can lead to inaccurate results, and the use of partial sequences to a lack of resolution.
because no clear-cut criteria exist for the sequence selection, a semi-automatic mode is available to accommodate user's expertise.
it has a graphical interface and can be integrated in an automatic workflow.
