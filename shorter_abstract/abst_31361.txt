here, two types of bacs that contained the duplicated segments were isolated and analyzed in tetraploid cotton by fish.
the fish and related linkage map results followed known reinforced the relationships of homoeologous chromosomes in allotetraploid cotton, and presented a useful approach for isolation of homoeologous loci or segments and for mapping of monomorphic loci.
it is very important to find that the large duplicated segments  do exist between homoeologous chromosomes, so the shot-gun approach for genome sequencing was unavailable for tetraploid cotton.
duplicated segments in homoeologous chromosomes were detected by fish.
the study of the homoeologous  segments or chromosomes can facilitate insight into the evolutionary process of polyploidy and the development of genomic resources.
however, without doubt, it will contain more information and promote the research for duplicated segments as well as the genome evolution in cotton.
these findings and the analysis method by bac-fish demonstrated the powerful nature and wide use for the genome and genome evolutionary researches in cotton and other polyploidy species.
cotton, as an allopolyploid species, contains homoeologous a and d subgenomes.
fluorescence in situ hybridization  using bacterial artificial chromosome  clones as probes has commonly been used to provide a reliable cytological technique for chromosome identification.
homologous and homoeologous bacs were isolated by way of ssr marker-based selection and then used to develop bac-fish probes.
