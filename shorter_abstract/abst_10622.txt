to further expand the ppi network and to extract more accurate information from existing maps, studies have been carried out to integrate various types of functional relationship data.
by applying a probabilistic model, we integrated  <dig> heterogeneous genomic, proteomic and functional annotation datasets to predict ppi networks in human.
we further built an easy-to-use, updatable integrated ppi database, the integrated network database  online, to provide automatic prediction and visualization of ppi network among genes of interest.
intnetdb includes  <dig>  predicted protein-protein interactions among  <dig>  human proteins and represents a useful resource for the research community.
a frequently updated database of computationally analyzed potential ppis to provide biological researchers with rapid and easy access to analyze original data as a biological network is still lacking.
in addition to previously studied data types, we show that phenotypic distances and genetic interactions can also be integrated to predict ppis.
