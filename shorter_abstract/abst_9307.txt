the center of the mouse mirna gene cluster consists of  <dig> copies of mlong <dig>  blast analysis of mshort <dig> in the mouse shows that the repeat unit is unique for intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene and suggest a dual phase model for growth of the mirna gene cluster: arrangment of  <dig> mshort <dig> units into mlong <dig> and further duplication of  <dig> head-to-tail mlong <dig> units in the center of the mirna gene cluster.
rats have a similar arrangment of repeat units in intron  <dig> of the sfmbt <dig> gene.
the total number of mirna genes in a genome, expression of which is responsible for the mirna repertoire of an organism, is not precisely known.
moreover, the question of how new mirna genes arise during evolution is incompletely understood.
our data provides new evidence for the emerging concept that lineage-specific retroposons have played an important role in the birth of new mirna genes during evolution.
the discrepancy between  <dig> mirna genes in the mouse cluster as compared to only  <dig> mirna gene in the corresponding rat repeat cluster is ascribed to sequence differences between mshort <dig> and rshort <dig> that result in lateral-shifted, less-stable mirna precursor hairpins for rshort <dig>
the large difference in the number of mirna genes in two closely related species  indicates that this species-specific evolution can be a rapid process.
