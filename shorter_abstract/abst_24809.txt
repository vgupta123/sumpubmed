however, unlike the other three central african countries, the majority of spoligotype patterns observed in mali also lacked spacer  <dig>  of the remaining seven strains, six had spoligotype patterns identical to strains commonly isolated in france and spain.
m. bovis was isolated from  <dig> animals and  <dig> different spoligotypes were observed among these  <dig> strains; three of the patterns had not been previously reported.
from these animals, twenty strains of m. bovis were isolated and characterised by spoligotyping.
spoligotype patterns from thirteen of the strains lacked spacer  <dig>  a characteristic common in strains of m. bovis found in chad, cameroon and nigeria.
two groups of m. bovis were detected in cattle slaughtered at the bamako abattoir.
the objective of this study was to conduct, for the first time, molecular characterisation of mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from cattle slaughtered at the bamako abattoir.
organ lesions typical of btb were most often detected in the liver, followed by the lung and the peritoneum.
the spoligotype pattern of the first group has similarities to strains previously observed in chad, cameroon and nigeria.
the spoligotype patterns of the remaining strains suggest that they may have been of european origin.
a high frequency of bovine tuberculosis  has been reported but surveillance and control schemes are restricted to abattoir inspections only.
of  <dig> animals screened only  <dig> exhibited gross visible lesions.
mali is one of the most important livestock producers of the sahel region of africa.
