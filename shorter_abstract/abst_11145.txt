the aim is to rank relevant documents higher in the retrieved list.
we have successfully applied some of these strategies to improve the ranking of relevant documents in the retrieved sets.
accuracy of document retrieval from medline for gene queries is crucially important for many applications in bioinformatics.
we explore five information retrieval-based methods to rank documents retrieved by pubmed gene queries for the human genome.
we explore the effect of different post-retrieval strategies on the ranking of documents returned by pubmed for human gene queries.
for most genes the best ranking query is one that is built from the locuslink  summary and product information along with the gene names and aliases.
for others, the gene names and aliases suffice.
we feel that it would be very useful to apply strategies like ours on pubmed search results as these are not ordered by relevance in any way.
this holds true even when various kinds of ambiguity are encountered.
our best ranking strategy offers significant improvements on three different kinds of ambiguities over our two baseline strategies .
two of our three locuslink-based strategies offer significant improvements.
we address the special challenges faced due to ambiguity in gene nomenclature: gene terms that refer to multiple genes, gene terms that are also english words, and gene terms that have other biological meanings.
these methods work very well even when there is ambiguity in the gene terms.
