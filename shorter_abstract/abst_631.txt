however, cerebro-vascular diseases can affect blood oxygen level dependent  signal.
this study investigated whether any impairment of cerebral hemodynamics that occurs during the acute and the subacute phases of ischemic stroke is related to changes in bold response.
all patients underwent a transcranial doppler to assess cerebral autoregulation  and fmri to evaluate the amplitude and the peak latency  of bold response in the acute  and the subacute  stroke phases.
cerebral autoregulation is a primary function of cerebral hemodynamics, which allows to maintain a relatively constant blood flow despite changes in arterial blood pressure and perfusion pressure.
cerebral autoregulation is reported to become less effective in the early phases post-stroke.
as patients advanced from the acute to subacute stroke phase, the affected hemisphere presented a bold ttp increase  and a deterioration of cerebral autoregulation .
when the two hemispheres were grouped together, bold ttp delay was significantly related to worsening cerebral autoregulation  .
the hemodynamic response function subtending bold signal may present a delay in peak latency that arises as patients advance from the acute to the subacute stroke phase.
we enrolled six aphasic patients affected by acute stroke.
these findings suggest that remodeling the fmri hemodynamic response function in the different phases of stroke may optimize the detection of bold signal changes.
this delay is related to the deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics.
