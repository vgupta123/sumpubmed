we applied our algorithm to a number of representative chip-chip data sets, including those of pol ii and histone modifications, which have a diverse distribution of length-scales of biochemical activity, including some broad peaks.
finally, we benchmarked our method in comparison to other approaches for scoring chip-chip data using spike-ins on the encode nimblegen tiling array.
tiling array data is hard to interpret due to noise.
consequently, we attempted to denoise representative tiling array datasets for chip-chip experiments using wavelets.
we were also able to show that wavelet coefficients due to non-specific cross-hybridization follow a log-normal distribution, and we used this fact in developing a thresholding procedure.
the wavelet transformation is a widely used technique in signal processing for elucidating the true signal from noisy data.
in particular, wavelets allow one to set an unambiguous, absolute threshold, which has been hard to define in chip-chip experiments.
this comparison demonstrated excellent performance, with wavelets getting the best overall score.
