they contribute to plant defense response against biotic and abiotic stress, and also influence leaf aroma and smoke flavor.
secondary metabolism related genes, such as isoprenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis-related, were also identified.
the expression of selected unigenes was confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis, some of which were specifically expressed in trichomes.
leaf trichomes of nicotiana tabacum are distinguished by their large size, high density, and superior secretion ability.
of these,  <dig> highly expressed genes in tobacco trichomes were enriched in second metabolic processes, defense responses, and the metabolism regulation categories.
the expression feature of leaf trichomes in nicotiana tabacum indicates their metabolic activity and potential importance in stress resistance.
in the first, a trichome cdna library was randomly sequenced, and  <dig> unique genes were obtained.
however, there is limited genomic information about trichomes of this non-model plant species.
sequences predominantly expressed in trichomes will facilitate gene-mining and metabolism control of plant trichome.
among the related sequences, most encoded enzymes involved in primary metabolism.
