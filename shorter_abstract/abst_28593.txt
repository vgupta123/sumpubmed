f-statistics analysis revealed a moderate level of genetic differentiation in c. abyssinica  and a accordingly low estimated gene flow .
genetic diversity analysis using a subset of  <dig> markers on  <dig> independent c. abyssinica accessions exhibited that 1) 95 % of the designed ssrs were polymorphic among these accessions; 2) the polymorphism information content  value of the markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; 3) the genetic distances  between accessions varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
application of high-throughput sequencing technology has facilitated ssr marker development, which was successfully employed in evaluating genetic diversity of c. abyssinica as demonstrated in our study.
results showed these molecular markers were robust and provided powerful tools for assessing genetic diversity and estimating crambe breeding history.

virtual pcr analysis showed that a fraction of these primers could be mapped onto the genomes of related species of brassica, including brassica rapa, b. oleraceae and b. napus.
however, as an understudied crop, improvement of crambe has been hampered by the lack of genetic and genomic information to enhance its yield, oil quality and resistance against biotic and abiotic stress.
development of molecular markers is therefore of great significance to facilitate genetic improvement of crambe.
moreover, the ssr primers and sequence information developed in the study are freely available to the research community.
cluster analysis subsequent on the accessions demonstrated consistency with crambe breeding history.
