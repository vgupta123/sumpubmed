a presence/absence variation  in the scmv <dig> region and two polymorphic sites around the zmtrx-h gene were significantly associated with scmv resistance.
candidate geneâ€“based association mapping was conducted using a panel of  <dig> inbred lines with variable resistance to scmv.
we combined both linkage and association mapping to identify positional candidate genes for scmv <dig>
the combined results assigned the scmv <dig> locus to a  <dig> -kb interval, and candidate genes within this region were predicted based on the publicly available b <dig> sequence.
combined linkage and association mapping pinpoints zmtrx-h as the most likely positional candidate gene for scmv <dig>  these results pave the way towards cloning of scmv <dig> and facilitate marker-assisted selection for potyvirus resistance in maize.
maize resistance to scmv is associated with two dominant genes, scmv <dig> and scmv <dig>  which are located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and near the centromere region of chromosome  <dig>  respectively.
