human height is a complex trait with a strong genetic basis.
a following retrospective genotype-phenotype analysis based on a literature review confirmed that short stature is a frequent feature in those coffin-siris syndrome patients with arid1b mutations.
recently, a significant association between rare copy number variations  and short stature has been identified, and candidate genes in these rare cnvs are being explored.
this study aims to evaluate the association between mutations in arid1b gene and short stature, both the syndromic and non-syndromic form.
based on a case-control study of whole genome chromosome microarray analysis , three overlapping cnvs were identified in patients with developmental disorders who exhibited short stature.
mutation screening of arid1b coding regions was further conducted in a cohort of  <dig> non-syndromic short stature patients,andfour novel missense variants including two de novo mutations were found.
these results suggest that haploinsufficient mutations of arid1b are associated with syndromic short stature including coffin-siris syndrome and intellectual disability, while rare missense variants in arid1b are associated with non-syndromic short stature.
this study supports the notion that mutations in genes related to syndromic short stature may exert milder effect and contribute to short stature in the general population.
