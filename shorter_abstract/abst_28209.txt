we assessed variation at the  <dig> miru loci used for typing in a set of mtb strains isolated from infected cynomolgus macaques.
copy number variation  in miru loci is used for epidemiological typing, making the rate of variation important for tracking the transmission of mtb strains.
we applied this methodology to a panel of mtb strains isolated from the macaque model of tuberculosis , the animal model that best mimics human disease.
our results represent the first experimental estimate of the miru mutation rate in mtb.
with these data, we estimate a miru mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  per locus, per year.
in this study, we developed and assessed a whole-genome sequencing  approach to detect miru cnv in mtb.
this rate is comparable to the highest previous estimates gathered from epidemiologic data and meta-analyses.
from these data, we have estimated the rate of miru variation in the host environment, providing a benchmark rate for future epidemiologic work.
to assess the relative power of these approaches, all miru loci were resequenced using sanger sequencing.
