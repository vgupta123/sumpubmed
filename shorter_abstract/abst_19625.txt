the maximum ediii expression level of 187 mg/l was achieved under shake flask conditions with induction at 20 °c in the presence of 1 % ca.
notably, there are four serotypes of dengue viruses  that places ~40 % of the global population at risk of infection.
hence developing a method for efficient production of high quality recombinant ediii is important for research and industrial purpose.
the strategy described herein could enable fulfilling the mounting demand for recombinant ediii as well as lay direction to future studies on secretory expression of recombinant proteins in p. pastoris with ca as a media supplement.
moreover, a bell-shaped correlation was observed between ca concentration and secretory ediii titer.
temperature alone had a significant impact upon the amount of secretory ediii, with  <dig> -fold increase upon reducing the induction temperature from  <dig> to 20 °c.
however surprisingly, supplementation of culture media with casamino acids , further augmented secretory ediii titer, with a concomitant drop of intracellular ediii levels at both temperatures.
notably, mouse immune-sera, generated using this purified ediii antigen, efficiently neutralized the denv.
though, reduction in intracellular retention of ediii was more prominent at 20 °c than 30 °c.

the overall increase in ediii titer was ~9-fold compared to un-optimized conditions.
this suggests that ca supplementation facilitates overexpressing p. pastoris cells to secrete more ediii by reducing the proportion retained intracellularly.
