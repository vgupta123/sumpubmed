the observed transcriptome differences between the two lines indicate that selection for mbl had influenced innate as well as adaptive immunity.
understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to ibv infection is a crucial element for further improvements in strategies to control ib.
avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious disease of the upper-respiratory tract caused by infectious bronchitis virus .
comparing uninfected l10h and l10l birds, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed  genes at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
to this end, two chicken lines, selected for high  and low  serum concentration of mannose-binding lectin  were studied.
rna sequencing was performed on spleen samples from all  <dig> birds and differential gene expression analysis was performed for four comparisons: l10l line versus l10h line for uninfected birds at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and in the same way for infected birds.
when comparing ibv-infected birds between the two lines, the most enriched go terms were “alpha-beta t cell activation” and “positive regulation of leukocyte activation” at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
the two most enriched go terms emerging from the comparison of uninfected birds between the two lines were “lymphocyte activation involved in immune response” and “somatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes involved in immune response” at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
functional analysis was performed using gene ontology  immune system process terms specific for gallus gallus.
healthy birds from the two lines showed significant differences in expression profiles for subsets of adaptive and innate immunity-related genes, whereas comparison of the ibv-infected birds from the two lines showed differences in expression of immunity-related genes involved in t cell activation and proliferation.
