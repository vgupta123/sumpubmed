with the price of next generation sequencing steadily decreasing, bacterial genome assembly is now accessible to a wide range of researchers.
it is therefore necessary to understand the best methods for generating a genome assembly, specifically, which combination of sequencing and bioinformatics strategies result in the most accurate assemblies.

using data generated solely from the pacific biosciences rs, we were able to generate the most complete and accurate de novo assemblies of e. coli strains.
here, we sequence three e. coli strains on the illumina miseq, life technologies ion torrent pgm, and pacific biosciences rs.
three e. coli strains – bl <dig>  bal <dig>  and dh5α – were sequenced to a depth of 100× on the miseq and ion torrent machines and to at least 125× on the pacbio rs.
we then perform genome assemblies on all three datasets alone or in combination to determine the best methods for the assembly of bacterial genomes.
we found that the addition of other sequencing technology data offered no improvements over use of pacbio data alone.
in addition, the sequencing data from the pacbio rs allowed for sensitive and specific calling of covalent base modifications.
bl <dig> pacbio-only assemblies resulted in a 90% reduction in contigs versus short read only assemblies, while n <dig> numbers increased by over 7-fold.
use of pacbio sequencing reads also allowed us to call covalent base modifications for the three strains.
