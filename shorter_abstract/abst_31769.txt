the gene-level agreement of these significant subnetworks was between  <dig> % to  <dig> %.
these results clearly demonstrate that our technique generates significant subnetworks and genes that are more consistent and reproducible across datasets compared to the other popular methods available .
while contemporary methods of microarray analysis are excellent tools for studying individual microarray datasets, they have a tendency to produce different results from different datasets of the same disease.
snet provides both quantitative and descriptive analysis of microarray datasets by identifying specific connected portions of pathways that are significant.
for each of these diseases, we obtained two independent microarray datasets produced by distinct labs on distinct platforms.
in each case, our technique consistently produced almost the same list of significant nontrivial subnetworks from two independent sets of microarray data.
in contrast, when the same pairs of microarray datasets were analysed using gsea, t-test and sam, this percentage fell between  <dig> % to  <dig> % for gsea,  <dig> % tp  <dig> % for t-test, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % for sam.
this shows that our algorithm is capable of generating descriptive biologically conclusions.
in addition, we have chosen two sample subnetworks and validated them with references from biological literature.
the large size of subnetworks which we generate indicates that they are generally more biologically significant .
we tested snet on independent datasets of several diseases, including childhood all, dmd and lung cancer.
