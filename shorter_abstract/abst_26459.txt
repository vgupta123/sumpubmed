information on non-duplex-forming long ncrnas is now also rapidly accumulating.
moreover, ccg and cgg repeats are significantly enriched in the upstream regions and downstream regions, respectively, of tsss located in head-to-head type promoters.
more than 90% of head-to-head type promoters contain cpg islands.
to examine the directional properties of transcription at the whole-genome level, we performed directional rna-seq analysis of mouse and chimpanzee tissue samples.
we found that there is only about 1% of the genome where both the top and bottom strands are utilized for transcription, suggesting that rna-rna duplexes are not abundantly formed.
genes with tissue-specific promoter-associated ncrnas  show a positive correlation between the expression of their pancrna and mrna, which is in accord with the proposed role of pancrna in facultative gene activation, whereas genes with constitutive expression generally lack pancrnas.
