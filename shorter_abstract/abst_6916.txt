additionally, a reverse search initiated by a potential target can also be conducted.
on the other hand, taggo application is designed to automatically group gene ontology annotations, taking advantage of the gene ontology , in order to extract the main attributes of sets of proteins.
gomir  introduces mirna predicted targets accompanied by  full gene description,  functional analysis and  detailed gene ontology clustering.
jtarget integrates mirna target prediction and functional analysis by combining the predicted target genes from targetscan, miranda, rnahybrid and pictar computational tools as well as the experimentally supported targets from tarbase and also providing a full gene description and functional analysis for each target gene.
predicting or verifying mrna targets of specific mirnas is a difficult process of great importance.
mirnas regulate gene expression, by interacting with target mrnas at specific sites in order to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation.
gomir is a novel stand-alone application consisting of two separate tools: jtarget and taggo.
