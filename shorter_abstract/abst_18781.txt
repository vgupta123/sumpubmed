this study highlights the effects of divergent selection for growth rate on some behavioral traits, muscle biochemistry and ultimately meat quality traits.
some qtls may in fact co-localize, suggesting pleiotropic effects for some chromosomal regions.
association analyses were performed using maximum-likelihood interval mapping in qtlmap.
the hg and lg birds exhibit large differences in body weight and abdominal fat content.
several meat quality traits  were lower in hg chickens.
in contrast, meat color-lightness  was higher in hg chickens, whereas meat drip loss  was similar in both lines.
several qtl regions were identified that are worthy of further characterization.
the present study identified genome-wide significant qtls for all meat technological traits presently assessed in these chickens, except for meat lightness.
hg birds were more active on the shackle line.
further analyses with qtlexpress confirmed the two genome-wide qtls for meat color on gga <dig>  failed to identify the genome-wide qtl for ph <dig> on gga <dig>  and revealed only suggestive qtls for ph <dig> and dl on gga <dig>  however, qtlexpress qualified the qtl for phu on gga <dig> as genome-wide.
meat technological traits  are important considerations for improving further processing of chicken meat.
five genome-wide significant qtls were revealed: two for ph <dig> on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  one for dl on gga <dig>  one for bco-r and one for bco-y both on gga <dig>  in addition, four suggestive qtls were identified by qtlmap for bco-y, phu, ph <dig> and dl on gga <dig>  gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  respectively.
