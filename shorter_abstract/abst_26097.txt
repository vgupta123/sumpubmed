the periplasmic high temperature requirement protein a  plays important roles in bacterial protein folding and stress responses.
since it is hypothesized that chlamydial organisms possess a proteolysis strategy to manipulate host cell signaling pathways, secretion of the serine protease chtra into host cell cytosol suggests that the periplasmic chtra may also play an important role in chlamydial interactions with host cells.
most chlamydial species secreted chtra into host cell cytosol and the secretion was not inhibitable by a type iii secretion inhibitor.
however, the role of chlamydial htra  in chlamydial pathogenesis is not clear.
the periplasmic chtra protein appeared to be actively secreted into host cell cytosol since no other chlamydial periplasmic proteins were detected in the host cell cytoplasm.
fractionation of the infected cells revealed chtra in the host cell cytosol fraction.
in a western blot assay, the anti-chtra antibodies detected the endogenous chtra in chlamydia-infected cells without cross-reacting with any other chlamydial or host cell antigens.
the detection was specific since both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-chtra antibodies revealed similar intracellular labeling patterns that were only removed by absorption with chtra but not control fusion proteins.
the chtra was detected both inside and outside the chlamydial inclusions.
