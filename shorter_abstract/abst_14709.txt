microrna  is a class of small rnas of ~22nt which play essential roles in many crucial biological processes and numerous human diseases at post-transcriptional level of gene expression.
we constructed the mirna-transcription factor regulatory network that contains the interactions between transcription factors , mirnas and non-tf protein-coding genes, and made a genome-wide study on the regulatory coordination of clustered mirnas.
the diverse pattern of regulatory coordination suggests distinct roles of the homo-clustered and the hetero-clustered mirnas in biological processes.
homo-clusters that contain mirnas of the same family and hetero-clusters that contain mirnas of various families.
the genomic clustering of mirnas is closely related to the coordinated regulation in the gene regulatory network.
we found that there are two types of mirna clusters, i.e.
the pattern of regulatory coordination is dependent on the composition of the mirna cluster.
however, the homo-clustered mirnas show a direct regulatory coordination that is realized by one-step regulation , whereas the hetero-clustered mirnas show an indirect regulatory coordination that is realized by a regulation comprising at least three steps .
however, how the clustered mirnas coordinate their regulations on large scale gene expression is still unclear.
it has been revealed that mirna genes tend to be clustered, and the mirnas organized into one cluster are usually transcribed coordinately.
