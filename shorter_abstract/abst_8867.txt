then the markov clustering algorithm was applied to the protein graph.
the published genome sequence of plasmodium vivax revealed the largest subtelomeric multigene family of human malaria parasites, the vir super-family, presently composed of  <dig> vir genes subdivided into  <dig> different subfamilies based on sequence homologies detected by blast.

results showed that  three previous subfamilies cannot longer be classified as vir genes;  most previously unclustered vir genes were clustered into vir subfamilies;   <dig> hypothetical proteins were predicted as vir proteins;  many of these findings are supported by a number of structural and functional evidences, sub-cellular localization studies, gene expression analysis and chromosome localization  this approach can be used to study other multigene families in malaria.
subtelomeric multigene families of malaria parasites encode virulent determinants.
this methodology, resource and new classification of vir genes will contribute to a new structural framing of this multigene family and other multigene families of malaria parasites, facilitating the design of experiments to understand their role in pathology, which in turn may help furthering vaccine development.
next, the homology block concept was used to further validate this clustering approach.
a novel computational approach was used to redefine vir genes.
