two of the largest fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes are those of the actinobacterium, streptomyces coelicolor , and the Î´-proteobacterium, myxococcus xanthus , both differentiating, sporulating, antibiotic producing, soil microbes.
sco but not mxa has also amplified drug efflux pumps of the dha <dig> family of the major facilitator superfamily  , amino acid transporters of the apc family , abc-type sugar transport proteins , and organic anion transporters of several families.
this is because sco has amplified several specific types of its transport protein genes, while mxa has done so to a much lesser extent.
a number of unexpected and surprising observations are presented, and predictions are made regarding the physiological functions of recognizable transporters as well as the existence of yet to be discovered transport systems in these two important model organisms and their relatives.
the results provide insight into the evolutionary processes by which two dissimilar prokaryotes evolved complexity, particularly through selective chromosomal gene amplification.
