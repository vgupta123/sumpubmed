functionally meaningful sequence similarity may sometimes be reflected only in local structural similarity, but not in global fold similarity.
pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase and quinol-fumarate reductase contain ferredoxin domains that bind  clusters and are involved in electron transport.
the sequence similarity between these ferredoxin domains resides in the area of the  cluster-binding sites.
although overall folds of these ferredoxins bear no obvious similarity, the regions of sequence similarity display a remarkable local structural similarity.
sequence similarity between proteins is usually considered a reliable indicator of homology.
