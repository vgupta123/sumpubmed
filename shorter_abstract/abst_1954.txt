in drosophila, mutations in the gene eyes absent  lead to severe defects in eye development.
expression analysis of eya <dig> by in-situ hybridizations and Î²-gal-staining of eya <dig> mutant mice revealed abundant expression of the gene throughout development, e.g.
there was no obvious defect in the eyes, ears and kidneys of eya <dig> mutant mice.
among them, the mutant mice move less than the wild-type mice and, together with the effects on respiratory, muscle and heart function, the mutation might lead to more severe effects when the mice become older.
therefore, future investigations of eya <dig> function should focus on aging mice.
behavioral analysis of the mutants demonstrated a mild increase in exploratory behavior, but decreased locomotor activity and reduced muscle strength.
in the lung, the tidal volume at rest was decreased, and electrocardiography showed increased jt- and pq intervals as well as decreased qrs amplitude.
the loss of eya <dig> in mice leads to a broad spectrum of minor physiological changes.
the phenotype of young adult eya <dig> mouse mutants was systematically analyzed within the german mouse clinic.
homozygous mutants displayed decreased bone mineral content and shorter body length.
the wide-spread expression of eya <dig> in mouse and zebrafish embryos is in contrast to the restricted expression pattern in xenopus embryos.
the loss of eya <dig> in the mouse has no apparent effect on eye development.
using real-time pcr, we confirmed nup <dig> being down regulated in both organs.
a similar complex expression pattern was observed also in zebrafish embryos.
