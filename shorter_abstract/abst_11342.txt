we predicted a total of  <dig> mirnas which included  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas.
our results indicate that sulfur-deprivation may have a significant influence on small rna expression patterns, and the differential expressions of mirnas and interactions between mirna and its targets might further reveal the molecular mechanism responding to sulfur-deprivation in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
we used a deep sequencing platform to extensively profile and identify changes in the mirnas expression that occurred under sulfur-replete and sulfur-deprived conditions.
<dig> mirnas showed significantly differential expressions responding to sulfur-deprivation, and most were up-regulated in the small rna libraries with sulfur-deprivation.
chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an ideal model organism for the study of many metabolic processes including responses to sulfur-deprivation.
the aim of our research was to characterize the differential expression of chlamydomonas mirnas under sulfur-deprived conditions, and subsequently, the target genes of mirna involved in sulfur-deprivation were further predicted and analyzed.
by using high-throughput sequencing, we characterized the microrna transcriptomes under sulphur-replete and sulfur-deprived conditions in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
using a web-based integrated system  and combing the former information from a transcriptome of chlamydomonas reinhardtii,  <dig> mirnas and their targets involved in metabolism regulation with sulfur-deprivation were verified.
