prevalence estimates were calculated by adjusting for sampling weights and where possible for test sensitivity and specificity.
mean within-herd seroprevalence in positive herds was  <dig> %  and ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.
a significantly higher seroprevalence was found in males  than in females   and in non-pregnant females  than in pregnant females  .
this study was carried out to investigate the status of brucellosis in cattle under various management systems in adamawa, kaduna and kano states, northern nigeria.
this is the first large study to assess the prevalence of bovine brucellosis over a wide geographic area of northern nigeria, in a variety of management systems and using accurate tests.
seroprevalence did not differ significantly between breeds or lactation status.
the seroprevalence of brucellosis was high, and higher than results of previous studies in northern nigeria.
seroprevalence also varied between management systems : pastoral systems  <dig> % , zero-grazing systems  <dig> % , agro-pastoral systems  <dig> % , and commercial farms  <dig> % .
the pastoral management systems of the traditional fulanis may be encouraging the dissemination of the disease.
using multi-stage sampling, serum samples of  <dig>  cattle from  <dig> herds were tested using the rose-bengal plate-agglutination test  and positives were confirmed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
