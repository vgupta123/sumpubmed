in the present study, we describe the evaluation of the recently established real-time pcr assay based on the brucella-specific insertion sequence is <dig> with blood samples from  <dig> wild boars  and tissue samples from  <dig> wild boars  collected in switzerland.
in the first group of animals, is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in  <dig> %  of wild boars that were serologically negative.
regarding the second group of animals, the is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in 26% of animals, while brucella spp.
the results presented here indicate that is <dig> real-time pcr assay is a specific and sensitive tool for detection of brucella spp.
serological tests showed different sensitivities  and only 2% of blood samples were positive with all three tests, which makes interpretation of the serological results very difficult.
results from is <dig> real-time pcr were compared to those obtained by bacterial isolation, rose bengal test , competitive elisa  and indirect elisa .
