the trans-atlantic slave trade dramatically changed the demographic makeup of the new world, with varying regions of the african coast exploited differently over roughly a  <dig> year period.
the slaves from the bight of biafra and west-central africa were imported in great numbers; however, the results suggest a deficit in expected maternal contribution from those regions.
results from the admixture analyses suggest modern jamaicans share a closer affinity with groups from the gold coast and bight of benin despite high mortality, low fecundity, and waning regional importation.
when considering the demographic pressures imposed by chattel slavery on jamaica during the slave era, the results seem incongruous.
the results from these admixture procedures were then compared to the wealth of historic knowledge surrounding the disembarkation of africans on the island.
