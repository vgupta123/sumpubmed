ptrabf was subcellularly targeted to the nucleus, exhibited transactivation activity in yeast cell and could bind to abre, supporting its role as a transcription factor.
ptrabf is a bzip transcription factor and functions in positive modulation of drought stress tolerance.
under dehydration and drought conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen species compared with wild type, accompanied by higher activities and expression levels of three antioxidant enzymes.
expression levels of ptrabf were induced by treatments with dehydration, low temperature and aba.
in addition, steady-state mrna levels of nine stress-responsive genes coding for either functional or regulatory proteins were induced to higher levels in the transgenic lines with or without drought stress.
ectopic expression of ptrabf under the control of a camv 35s promoter in transgenic tobacco plants enhanced tolerance to both dehydration and drought.
aba responsive element binding factor  plays an important role in stress responses via regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes.
