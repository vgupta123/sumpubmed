these were grouped into  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  non-assembled bes , representing ~ <dig> % of the melon genome.
this suggests that ~30% of the melon genome consists of coding dna.
the analysis of nearly  <dig>  bes from two complementary genomic libraries covered ~ <dig> % of the melon genome, providing insight into properties such as microsatellite and transposable element distribution, and the percentage of coding dna.
the observed synteny between melon paired-bes and six other plant genomes showed that useful comparative genomic data can be derived through large scale bac-end sequencing by anchoring a small proportion of the melon genome to other sequenced genomes.
the sequences were used to screen genomic databases, identifying  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  and  <dig>  additional repeats of which  <dig> % represented transposable elements.
we therefore sequenced bac-ends representing a total of  <dig>  clones, half of them from a previously described melon bac library generated with restriction endonucleases and the remainder from a new random-shear bac library.
we observed regions of microsynteny between melon paired-bes and six other dicotyledonous plant genomes.
