despite its importance, little is known about the regulation of cubilin expression.
here we show that cubilin expression is under epigenetic regulation by at least two processes.
not only was the expression of pparα and γ inducible by 5aza and tsa, but the positive effects of tsa and 5aza on cubilin expression were also dependent on both increased ppar transcription and activation.
cubilin is an endocytic receptor that is necessary for renal and intestinal absorption of a range of ligands.
the first process involves inactivation of expression of one of the cubilin alleles.
the second process involves transcriptional regulation of cubilin by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  transcription factors that are themselves regulated by dna methylation and histone deacetylation.
this monoallelic expression state could not be transformed to biallelic by inhibiting dna methylation or histone deacetylation.
this is supported by findings that inhibitors of dna methylation and histone deacetylation, 5aza and tsa, increase cubilin mrna and protein in renal and intestinal cell lines.
