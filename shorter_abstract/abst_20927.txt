the gc × gc-ms provides much increased separation capacity, chemical selectivity and sensitivity for complex sample analysis and brings more accurate information about compound retention times and mass spectra.
the proposed smith-waterman local alignment-based algorithms are capable of aligning both the homogeneous and heterogeneous data of multiple gc × gc-ms experiments without the transformation of retention times and the selection of landmark peaks.
furthermore, an automated peak alignment software package was established by implementing a likelihood function for optimal peak alignment.
an optimal version of the sw-based algorithms was also established based on the associated likelihood function for the automatic peak alignment.
compared with literature reported algorithms, the proposed algorithms eliminated the detection of landmark peaks and the usage of retention time transformation.
despite these advantages, the retention times of the resolved peaks on the two-dimensional gas chromatographic columns are always shifted due to experimental variations, introducing difficulty in the data processing for metabolomics analysis.
we developed novel peak alignment algorithms for both homogeneous  and heterogeneous  gc × gc-ms data using modified smith-waterman local alignment algorithms along with mass spectral similarity.
the proposed alignment algorithms outperform the literature reported alignment method by analyzing the experiment data of a mixture of compound standards and a metabolite extract of mouse plasma with spiked-in compound standards.
comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry  is a powerful technique which has gained increasing attention over the last two decades.
