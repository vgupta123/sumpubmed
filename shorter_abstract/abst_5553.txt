here we develop a flux-based approach that allows the integration of time-resolved transcriptomics data with genome-scale metabolic networks.
application of the approach to the metabolic network of escherichia coli in conjunction with time-series gene expression data from cold and heat stress results in two distinct time-resolved modes for reaction utilizationâ€”constantly active and temporally activated reactions.
altogether, our findings pinpoint the inherent relation between the systemic properties of robustness and adaptability arising from the interplay of metabolic network structure and changing environment.
the minimality of the extracted networks enables the computation of elementary flux modes for each time point, which are in turn used to characterize the transitional behavior of the network as well as of individual reactions.
our framework uses bilevel optimization to extract temporal minimal operating networks from a given large-scale metabolic model.
they also allow the prediction of reactions involved in time- and stress-specific metabolic response and are verified with respect to existing experimental studies.
