we demonstrate the benefits of use of multiple structures for protein-ligand and protein-protein interface analysis on a set of complexes and consider three case studies in detail: i) analysis of a kinase superfamily highlights the conserved occurrence of surface pockets at the active and regulatory sites; ii) a simulated ensemble of unliganded bcl <dig> structures reveals extensions of a known ligand-binding pocket not apparent in the apo crystal structure; iii) visualisations of interleukin- <dig> and its homologues highlight conserved pockets at the known receptor interfaces and regions whose conformation is known to change on inhibitor binding.
it is non-trivial to compare pockets, either from different programs or across sets of structures.
through post-processing of the output of a variety of pocket prediction software, provar provides a flexible approach to the analysis and visualization of the persistence or variability of pockets in sets of related protein structures.
for a protein with no known ligand, computational tools can predict surface pockets that are of suitable size and shape to accommodate a complementary small-molecule drug.
however, pocket prediction against single static structures may miss features of pockets that arise from proteins' dynamic behaviour.
we show how provar simplifies comparison of the outputs of different pocket prediction algorithms, of pockets across multiple simulated conformations and between homologous structures.
protein structures provide a valuable resource for rational drug design.
we have developed a computational method, provar, that provides a consistent representation of predicted binding pockets across sets of related protein structures.
in particular, ligand-binding conformations can be observed as transiently populated states of the apo protein, so it is possible to gain insight into ligand-bound forms by considering conformational variation in apo proteins.
