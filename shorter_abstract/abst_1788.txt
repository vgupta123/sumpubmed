however, for many of these genes neither baseline neuroanatomical nor injury-related temporal expression have been studied in the brain.
the latter comprise a subset of the cytochrome p <dig> “cyp” gene family that metabolize fatty acids, steroids, as well as endogenous and exogenous toxicants.
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with low density arrays were used to assay  <dig> rat cyps,  <dig> of which metabolize ara or other unsaturated fatty acids;  <dig> eicosanoid-related enzymes that metabolize ara or its metabolites;  <dig> eicosanoid receptors;  <dig> other inflammatory- and recovery-related genes, plus  <dig> mouse cyps as negative controls and  <dig> highly expressed “housekeeping” genes.
the results suggest complex regulation of ara and other lipid metabolism after tbi.
discrete tissue levels and distinct postinjury temporal patterns of gene expression were observed in hippocampus and parietal cortex.
eicosanoids are synthesized by heme-containing enzymes, including cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and arachidonate monoxygenases.
sixteen arachidonate monoxygenases,  <dig> eicosanoid-related genes, and  <dig> other cyps were regulated in the brain postinjury .
in a rat model of parietal cortex tbi, cyp and eicosanoid-related mrna levels were determined at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, 3d, and 7d postinjury in parietal cortex and hippocampus, where dynamic changes in eicosanoids have been observed.

traumatic brain injury  induces arachidonic acid  release from cell membranes.
the dynamic metabolism of ara to eicosanoids, and how they affect the injured brain, is poorly understood due to their diverse activities, trace levels, and short half-lives.
