the results further demonstrate the complexity of the disease and highlight the importance for studying rare genetic variants as they can be causal for large effects.
in the current study we generated a bac library of the obese-prone nzo strain to clarify the genomic alteration within the gene cluster ifi <dig> on chr.
with the pacbio sequencing data of nzo bac clones we identified a deletion spanning approximately  <dig>  kb in the b <dig> reference genome.
our data reveal the reconstruction of a complex genomic region on mouse chr.
the deletion affects different members of the ifi <dig> gene family which also includes the original first exon and 5′-regulatory parts of the ifi202b gene and suggests to be the relevant cause of its expression deficiency in b <dig>  in addition, the generation and characterization of congenic mice carrying the critical fragment on the b <dig> background demonstrate its crucial role for obesity and insulin resistance.
