in this report we show that p <dig> and p <dig> can, in some contexts, act as transcriptional repressors.
furthermore these proteins were shown to interact with co-activators p300/cbp and the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme.
p <dig>  and p <dig>  are highly related members of the dead box family and are established rna helicases.
taken together these reports suggest a role for p <dig> and p <dig> in transcriptional activation.
they have been implicated in growth regulation and have been shown to be involved in both pre-mrna and pre-rrna processing.
