to aid the discovery of rna motifs within the marine metagenome we exploited the genomic properties of 'cand.
we also describe four additional potential rna motifs with few or no examples occurring outside the metagenomic data.
this work begins the process of identifying functional rna motifs present in the metagenomic data and illustrates how existing completed genomes may be used to aid in this task.
it is also small, contains little non-coding dna, and has strikingly low gc content.
p. ubique' by targeting our search to long intergenic regions  with relatively high gc content.
p. ubique' using comparative genomics approaches in conjunction with marine metagenomic data.
employing this strategy, we discovered four candidate structured rnas including a new riboswitch class as well as three additional likely cis-regulatory elements that precede genes encoding ribosomal proteins s <dig> and s <dig>  and the cytoplasmic protein component of the signal recognition particle.
metagenomic sequence data are proving to be a vast resource for the discovery of biological components.
