a combined analysis of connectivity and differential expression suggested three biological processes as being primarily different between breeds: spermatogenesis, muscle differentiation and several metabolic processes.
these results suggest that differences across breeds in gene expression of the male gonads are larger than in other endocrine tissues in the pig.
ascertaining the transcriptome differences between individuals is an important step to understand how selection and genetic drift may affect gene expression.
using a bayesian linear model approach, we observed that the largest breed variability corresponded to the male gonads, and was larger than at the remaining tissues, including ovaries.
nevertheless, the strong presence of breed biased genes in the male gonads cannot be explained solely by changes in spermatogenesis nor by differences in the reproductive tract development.
transcriptome variability is due to genetic and environmental causes, much like any other complex phenotype.
