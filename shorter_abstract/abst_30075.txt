a wrky  and rav  protein can specifically bind to a w-box motif in the promoter of taeif5a <dig> and activate the expression of taeif5a <dig>  furthermore, taeif5a <dig>  tawrky and tarav share very similar expression pattern and are all stress-responsive gene that functions in the abscisic acid  signaling pathway, indicating that they are components of a single regulatory pathway.
in addition, taeif5a <dig> may mediate stress tolerance by increasing protein synthesis, enhancing ros scavenging by improving sod and pod activities, and preventing chlorophyll loss and membrane damage.
furthermore, taeif5a1-transformed plants exhibited enhanced superoxide dismutase  and peroxidase  activities, lower electrolyte leakage and higher chlorophyll content under salt stress.
these results suggested that taeif5a <dig> is involved in abiotic stress tolerance, and is likely regulated by transcription factors tawrky and tarav both of which can bind to the w-box motif.
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a  promotes formation of the first peptide bond at the onset of protein synthesis.
transgenic yeast and poplar expressing taeif5a <dig> showed elevated protein levels combined with improved abiotic stresses tolerance.
