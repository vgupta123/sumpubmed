analyses of transcriptomic data revealed that i. spirale uses uag to encode glutamine, similarly to the most common variant of a non-canonical code known from several unrelated eukaryotic groups, including hexamitin diplomonads .
the second code variant was found in the recently described anaerobic flagellate iotanema spirale .
here, we present the discovery of two new variants of the nuclear genetic code, in which uag is translated as an amino acid while uaa is kept as a termination codon .
departures from the standard genetic code in eukaryotic nuclear genomes are known for only a handful of lineages and only a few genetic code variants seem to exist outside the ciliates, the most creative group in this regard.
our study documents, for the first time, that evolutionary changes of the meaning of uag and uaa codons in nuclear genomes can be decoupled and that the interpretation of the two codons by the cytoplasmic translation apparatus is mechanistically separable.
however, in these organisms, uaa also encodes glutamine, whereas it is the primary termination codon in i. spirale.
most frequent code modifications entail reassignment of the uag and uaa codons, with evidence for at least  <dig> independent cases of a coordinated change in the meaning of both codons.
this first documented case of a rhizarian with a non-canonical genetic code employs uag to encode leucine and represents an unprecedented change among nuclear codon reassignments.
along with phylogenetic evidence for distant relationship of i. spirale and hexamitins, this indicates two independent genetic code changes in fornicates.
