analyses of the whole genome of physcomitrella patens resulted in the identification of  <dig> mips, belonging to seven different subfamilies, of which only five have been previously described.
of the newly discovered subfamilies one was only identified in p. patens  whereas the other was found to be present in a wide variety of dicotyledonous plants and forms a major previously unrecognized mip subfamily .
surprisingly also some specific groups within subfamilies present in arabidopsis thaliana and zea mays could be identified in p. patens.
our results suggest an early diversification of mips resulting in a large number of subfamilies already in primitive terrestrial plants.
aquaporins, also called major intrinsic proteins , constitute an ancient superfamily of channel proteins that facilitate the transport of water and small solutes across cell membranes.
