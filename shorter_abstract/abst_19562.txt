forward-time population genetic simulations play a central role in deriving and testing evolutionary hypotheses.
we develop a novel and general method for addressing the memory issue inherent in forward-time simulations by compressing and decompressing, in real-time, active and ancestral genotypes, while carefully accounting for the time overhead.
further, the techniques we provide are generic and can be integrated with existing population genetic simulators to boost their performance in terms of memory usage.
results show that our method not only scales well, but that it also overcomes memory issues that would cripple existing tools.
as evolutionary analyses are being increasingly performed on genomes, pathways, and networks, particularly in the era of systems biology, scaling population genetic simulators to handle large-scale simulations is crucial.
we believe our method offers a significant step in that direction.
