our results demonstrate that plant response patterns are strongly coupled to damage patterns of attackers.
to investigate plant transcriptome response to leafminers, we selected the leafminer liriomyza huidobrensis, which has a special feeding pattern more similar to pathogen damage than that of chewing insects, as a model insect, and arabidopsis thaliana as a response plant.
we then downloaded gene expression data from online databases and used hierarchical clustering to explore relationships among gene expression patterns in a. thaliana damaged by different attackers.
plants have evolved a complicated resistance system and exhibit a variety of defense patterns in response to different attackers.
genes related to metabolic processes and stimulus responses were highly regulated.
less is known, however, regarding molecular responses to leafminer insects.
we first investigated local and systemic responses of a. thaliana to leafminer feeding using an affymetrix ath <dig> genome array.
