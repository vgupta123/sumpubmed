we show that mixture of convolution chains of geometrically distributed states is better for presenting multimodal long-tailed duration phenomena.
based on learned hmm profiles we are able to classify  <dig> base-pair dna hairpins with accuracy up to  <dig> % on signals from same-day experiments.
we have demonstrated several implementations for de novo estimation of duration distribution probability density function with hmm framework and applied our model topology to the real data.
hidden markov model  based duration learning experiments on artificial two-level gaussian blockade signals helped us to identify proper modeling framework.
