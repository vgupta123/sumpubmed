genes specific to pepper pathogens, such as the o-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide cluster, and genes unique to individual strains, such as novel type iii effectors and bacteriocin genes, have been identified providing new clues for our understanding of pathogen virulence, aggressiveness, and host preference.
the genomes were compared with each other and with the previously sequenced xcv strain 85- <dig>  in addition, the molecular features were predicted that may be required for pathogenicity including the type iii secretion apparatus, type iii effectors, other secretion systems, quorum sensing systems, adhesins, extracellular polysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide determinants.
several novel type iii effectors from xg strain  <dig> and xv strain  <dig> genomes were computationally identified and their translocation was validated using a reporter gene assay.
genes encoding proteins with functions mediated by type ii and type iv secretion systems have also been compared, including enzymes involved in cell wall deconstruction, as contributors to pathogenicity.
the four species are distinct from each other based on physiological and molecular characteristics.
these analyses will aid in efforts towards breeding for broad and durable resistance in economically important tomato and pepper cultivars.
the genome sequence of strain 85- <dig>  a member of one of the species, xanthomonas euvesicatoria  has been previously reported.
bacterial spot of tomato and pepper is caused by four xanthomonas species and is a major plant disease in warm humid climates.
