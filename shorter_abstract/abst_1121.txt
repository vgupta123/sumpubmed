while increased levels and activity of aldh1a <dig> are hallmarks of cscs, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and cancer stem cell  formation are key underlying causes that promote extensive metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor recurrence in highly lethal pancreatic cancer.
the mechanisms leading to emt and csc phenotypes are not fully understood, which has hindered the development of effective targeted therapies capable of improving treatment outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer.
phospho-resistant aldh1a <dig> fully reverses emt and csc phenotypes, thus serving as dominant negative, which underscores the clinical significance of the aurka-aldh1a <dig> signaling axis in pancreatic cancer.
finally, while aurka inhibition provides a potent tool to reduce aldh1a <dig> levels and activity, the reciprocal loop between them ensures that their concurrent inhibition will be highly synergistic when inhibiting tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and metastasis in highly aggressive pancreatic cancer and beyond.
aldh1a <dig> also reciprocates and prevents aurka degradation, thereby triggering a positive feedback activation loop which drives highly aggressive phenotypes in cancer.
aurka phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at three critical residues which exert a multifaceted regulation over its level, enzymatic activity, and quaternary structure.
we show a central role of aurora kinase a  in promoting emt and csc phenotypes via aldh1a <dig>  which was discovered as its direct substrate using an innovative chemical genetic screen.
