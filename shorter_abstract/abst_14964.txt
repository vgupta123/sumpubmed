statistical variable selection methods have been widely used for this purpose.
in addition, the overall procedure is fast, deterministic, and has very few user-set parameters, yet is capable of capturing interplay between molecular players.
empirical bayes, together with the proposed pathway-based priors, results in an approach with a competitive variable selection performance.
pathway and network maps are one example of a source of such information.
the approach presented is general and readily applicable in any setting with multiple sources of biological prior knowledge.
we show an example of priors for pathway- and network-based information and illustrate our proposed method on both synthetic response data and by an application to cancer drug response data.
we employ continuous, linear models with interaction terms and exploit biochemically-motivated sparsity constraints to permit exact inference.
we put forward an approach in which biological knowledge is incorporated using informative prior distributions over variable subsets, with prior information selected and weighted in an automated, objective manner using an empirical bayes formulation.
the empirical bayes method proposed here can aid prior elicitation for bayesian variable selection studies and help to guard against mis-specification of priors.
an important question in the analysis of biochemical data is that of identifying subsets of molecular variables that may jointly influence a biological response.
however, although ancillary information is increasingly available, it is not always clear how it should be used nor how it should be weighted in relation to primary data.
