in addition, we found that gene expression fluctuation is positively correlated with the number of transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region, which suggests that coordination between transcription factors and mirnas leads to balanced responses to external perturbations.
we found that these genes have distinct function distributions.
mirna targets are shown to be significantly enriched in se genes by using propensity analysis of mirna regulation, supporting the hypothesis that mirnas can buffer whole genome expression fluctuation.
they are widely involved in biological processes, such as embryonic development, cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis.
our study confirmed that the genetic buffering roles of mirnas can act on genome expression fluctuation and provides insights into how mirnas and transcription factors coordinate to cope with external perturbation.
however, whether this effect can act on the genome-wide expression remains controversial.
in this study, we comprehensively explored the stably expressed genes  and fluctuant genes  in the human genome by a meta-analysis of large scale microarray data.
