hierarchical clustering of these  <dig>  genes showed three major clusters in which in planta conditions closely grouped with the nutrient starvation conditions.
gene expression data were collected from these in vitro experiments and compared to fungal gene expression during the invasive growth phase at  <dig> hours post-inoculation in compatible interactions on two grass hosts, rice and barley.
functional categorization of the  <dig> induced genes revealed that most were either related to carbon metabolism, membrane proteins, or were involved in oxidoreduction reactions.
here, we tested the hypothesis that gene expression patterns during in planta invasive growth are similar to in vitro stress conditions, such as nutrient limitation, temperature up shift and oxidative stress, and determined which condition most closely mimicked that of in planta invasive growth.
from those genes,  <dig>  showed similar expression patterns between at least one of the in vitro stresses and rice and/or barley.
rice blast is the most threatening disease to cultivated rice.
magnaporthe oryzae, its causal agent, is likely to encounter environmental challenges during invasive growth in its host plants that require shifts in gene expression to establish a compatible interaction.
these findings suggest that m. oryzae is likely primarily coping with nutrient-limited environments at the invasive growth stage  <dig> hours post-inoculation, and not with oxidative or temperature stresses.
we identified  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed in at least one of the in planta and in vitro stress conditions when compared to fungal mycelia grown in complete medium, which was used as reference.
the  <dig> repressed genes showed putative roles in vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, nitrogen metabolism, or molecular transport.
