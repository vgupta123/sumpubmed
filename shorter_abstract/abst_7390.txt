identification of good metaphase spreads is an important step in chromosome analysis for identifying individuals with genetic disorders.
the first and the second classes refer to individual chromosomes with straight and skewed shapes, respectively.
several image parameters were examined and used for creating rule-based classification.
we observed that the gaussian model can represent the empirical probability density function of the parameters and, hence, the threshold value can be easily determined.
the proposed rules can efficiently and accurately classify the individual chromosome with > 90% accuracy.
the threshold value for each parameter is determined using a statistical model.

good metaphase spreads should largely contain chromosomes of the first and the second classes, while the third class should be kept minimal.
in this paper, we present a software tool that uses a simple rule-based system to efficiently identify metaphase spreads suitable for karyotyping.
the software tool, termed metasel, was developed.
