the extended duration of concerted evolution in multiple distant lineages suggests that there has been prolonged homogenization of specific segments within these gene pairs.
these genes were required to be present in multiple mammalian genomes, suggesting duplication early in mammalian divergence.
to eliminate genes that have been conserved due to strong purifying selection, our analysis also required at least one intron to have retained high sequence similarity between paralogues.
through these analyses, our results demonstrate additional examples of a process that plays a definite, although unspecified, role in molecular evolution.
here we identify human gene pairs that have undergone concerted evolution, caused by ongoing gene conversion, since at least the human-mouse divergence.
we identified three human gene pairs undergoing concerted evolution .
although we speculate that selection for homogenization could have been utilized in order to maintain crucial homo- or hetero- binding domains, it remains unclear why gene conversion has persisted for such extended periods of time.
concerted evolution occurs in multigene families and is characterized by stretches of homogeneity and higher sequence similarity between paralogues than between orthologues.
