such experiments should be optimally designed to produce data that are most likely to invalidate incorrect model structures.
the numerical implementation of each method is considered in an example, signal processing in starving dictyostelium amœbæ.
a problem commonly encountered in the computational modelling of biological networks is that alternative, structurally different models of similar complexity fit a set of experimental data equally well.
at this point, new experiments maximizing the difference between the measured values of alternative models should be proposed and conducted.
this opens the way to model invalidation, which can be used to perfect our understanding of biochemical networks.
the first approach determines the 'best' initial condition that maximizes the l <dig>  distance between the outputs of the rival models.
in this paper we develop methodologies for the optimal design of experiments with the aim of discriminating between different mathematical models of the same biological system.
our general problem formulation together with the three proposed experiment design methods give the practitioner new tools for a systems biology approach to experiment design.
our third method uses optimized structural changes  to achieve the same goal.
in this case, more than one molecular mechanism can explain available data.
