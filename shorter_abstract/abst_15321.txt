our parameter-free functional prediction method uses a sensitive algorithm to achieve a high association rate of linking genes with unknown function to annotated genes.
furthermore, prosecutor utilizes additional biological information such as genomic context and known regulatory mechanisms that are specific for prokaryotes.
we supply the complete results of our analysis for  <dig> prokaryotic organisms on a dedicated website.
we developed prosecutor, an application that enables researchers to rapidly infer gene function based on available gene expression data and functional annotations.
the prosecutor software and supplementary datasets available at  allow researchers working on any of the analyzed organisms to quickly identify the putative functions of their genes of interest.
