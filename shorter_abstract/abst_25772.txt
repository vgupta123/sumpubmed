one enhancer, termed erbb3_mcs <dig>  which lies within the first intron of erbb <dig>  directs the highest reporter expression in vitro and also demonstrates epigenetic marks consistent with enhancer activity.
additionally, we demonstrate that transcription from the endogenous erbb <dig> locus is dependent on sox <dig>  further we demonstrate in vitro that sox <dig> physically interacts with that erbb3_mcs <dig>  consistent with its in vitro activity, we also show that erbb3_mcs <dig> drives reporter expression in nc cells and a subset of its derivative lineages in vivo in zebrafish in a manner consistent with erbb3b expression.
we also demonstrate, using morpholino analysis, that sox <dig> is necessary for erbb3_mcs <dig> expression in vivo in zebrafish.
in this study we identified three transcriptional enhancers at the erbb <dig> locus and evaluated their regulatory potential in vitro in nc-derived cell types and in vivo in transgenic zebrafish.
as with all cell fate decisions, transcriptional regulatory control plays a significant role in the progressive restriction and specification of nc derived lineages during development.
however, little is known about the sequences mediating transcriptional regulation of erbb <dig> or the factors that bind them.
the erbb <dig> gene is essential for the proper development of the neural crest  and its derivative populations such as schwann cells.
