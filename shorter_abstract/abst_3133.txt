we conduct a detailed analysis of the information content in the topic-based representation, showing that topics have semantic meaning.
these representations have also been used to obtain linearly-reducible maps of protein structure space.
it has been shown, as additionally supported from analysis in this paper that such maps preserve functional co-localization of the protein structure space.
inspired by a recent application of the latent dirichlet allocation  model for conducting structural comparisons of proteins, we propose higher-order lda-obtained topic-based representations of protein structures to provide an alternative route for remote homology detection and organization of the protein structure space in few dimensions.
we show that a topic-based representation is just as effective as a fragment-based one at automated detection of remote homologs and organization of protein structure space.
this work opens exciting venues in designing novel representations to extract information about protein structures, as well as organizing and mining protein structure space with mature text mining tools.

structure-based comparisons can detect remote homologs but most methods for doing so are too expensive to apply at a large scale over structural databases of proteins.
sequence-based comparison cannot detect remote homologs, in which evolution has adjusted the sequence while largely preserving structure.
recently, fragment-based structural representations have been proposed that allow fast detection of remote homologs with reasonable accuracy.
