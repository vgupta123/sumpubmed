moreover, tgf-β <dig> and mir <dig> expression was elevated in cells pretreated with l. acidophilus or synbiotic, a combination of inulin and l. acidophilus, compared to that in untreated cells or cells infected with s. typhimurium alone.
our results suggest that the tgf-β1/mir <dig> signaling pathway may be involved in the suppressive effects of l. acidophilus on inflammation caused by s. typhimurium in intestinal caco- <dig> cells.
in this study, we showed that the probiotic l. acidophilus decreased salmonella-induced nf-κb activation in human intestinal caco- <dig> cells.
l. acidophilus and prebiotic inulin were used to treat human intestinal caco- <dig> cells prior to infection with salmonella.
tgf-β /smad and nf-κb signaling play important roles in inflammation in intestinal cells.
probiotics reduce inflammatory cytokine production and serve as beneficial commensal microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
furthermore, tgf-β <dig> antibody antagonized the smad3/ <dig> and nf-κb transcriptional activity modulated by l. acidophilus in intestinal cells.
expression of the inflammatory cytokines, tnf-α and il- <dig>  in l. acidophilus-pretreated cells was also significantly lower than that in cells infected with salmonella alone.
by contrast, expression of smad <dig>  a target of mir <dig>  was accordingly reduced in cells treated with l. acidophilus or synbiotics.
consistent with tgf-β1/mir <dig> and smad <dig> expression, smad3/ <dig> transcriptional activity was significantly higher in the cells treated with l. acidophilus or synbiotics.
the cells were harvested to examine the cytokines and mir <dig> expression with immunoblotting and real-time pcr.
