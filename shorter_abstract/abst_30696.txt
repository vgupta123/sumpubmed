when evaluated using different sets of both simulated data and experimental data, ab-origin outperformed all the other five popular tools in terms of prediction accuracy.
partitioning the functional antibody sequences to their sourcing germline gene segments is vital not only for understanding antibody maturation but also for promoting the potential engineering of the therapeutic antibodies.
it is designed by batch query against germline databases based on empirical knowledge, optimized scoring scheme and appropriate parameters.
in the adaptive immune system, variable regions of immunoglobulin  are encoded by random recombination of variable , diversity , and joining  gene segments in the germline.
in particular, a threshold score for certain sensitivity and specificity is provided to give the confidence level of the ighd identification.
the features of batch query and confidence indication of ighd identification would provide extra help to users.
special efforts have been paid to improve the identification accuracy of the short and volatile region, ighd.
