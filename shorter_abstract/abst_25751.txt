here we evaluate a method – based on the pagerank algorithm employed by the popular search engine google – that tries to automate some of this procedure to generate prioritized gene lists by exploiting biological background information.
our modification of the pagerank algorithm provides an alternative method of evaluating microarray experimental results which combines prior knowledge about the underlying network.
interpretation of the results usually combines lists of differentially expressed genes with previous knowledge about their biological function.
it combines gene expression information with a network structure derived from gene annotations  or expression profile correlations.
using both simulated and real data we find that the algorithm offers an improved ranking of genes compared to pure expression change rankings.
