spectralnet also displays several graph visualizations, including a linear dimensionality reduction for uploaded datasets  and a non-linear dimensionality reduction that provides an elegant view of global graph structure .
graph theory provides a computational framework for modeling a variety of datasets including those emerging from genomics, proteomics, and chemical genetics.
whichever graph-generation method is used, spectralnet displays detailed information about each connected component of the graph, including graphs of degree distribution, clustering coefficient by degree, and average distance by degree.
available both as a standalone .net executable and as an asp.net web application, spectralnet was designed specifically with the analysis of graph-theoretic metrics in mind, a computational task not easily accessible using currently available applications.
spectralnet provides an easily accessible means of analyzing graph-theoretic metrics for data modeling and dimensionality reduction.
networks of genes, proteins, small molecules, or other objects of study can be represented as graphs of nodes  and interactions  that can carry different weights.
spectralnet is publicly available as both a .net application and an asp.net web application from .
in addition, extensive information about the selected vertex is shown, including degree, clustering coefficient, various distance metrics, and the corresponding components of the adjacency, laplacian, and normalized laplacian eigenvectors.
