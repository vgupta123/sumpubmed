one of the qtls encompassing two bnft paralogues  on chromosome c <dig> was resolved further using near isogenic lines, specific alleles of which were both shown to promote flowering.
the allelic variation of bnft paralogues results in functional differences affecting flowering time between winter and spring type cultivars of oilseed brassica.
it was inferred that the ancestral ft homologues in brassica evolved from two distinct copies, one of which was duplicated along with inversion of the associated chromosomal segment prior to the divergence of b. rapa  and b. oleracea .
association analysis of the three bnft paralogues across  <dig> cultivars of b. napus showed that the alleles detected in the original parents of the mapping population used to detect qtl  were ubiquitous amongst spring and winter type cultivars of rapeseed.
the gene flowering locus t  and its orthologues play a central role in the integration of flowering signals within arabidopsis and other diverse species.
we have identified six bnft paralogues from the genome of b. napus and mapped them to six distinct regions, each of which is homologous to a common ancestral block  of arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  four of the six regions were present within inverted duplicated regions of chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  the coding sequences of bnft paralogues showed 92-99% identities to each other and 85-87% identity with that of arabidopsis.
three bnft paralogues  were associated with two major qtl clusters for flowering time.
six orthologues of arabidopsis ft were identified and mapped in the genome of b. napus which sheds new light on the evolution of paralogues in polyploidy species.
at least ten such inverted duplicated blocks  were identified covering a quarter of the whole b. napus genome.
the prevalent inverted duplicated blocks, two of which were located by four of the six bnft paralogues, contributed to gene duplications and might represent predominant pathway of evolution in brassica.
