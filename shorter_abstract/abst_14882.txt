individual-based simulations confirm these predictions and show that high levels of local drift speed up invasion but prevent high levels of prevalence across the entire population.
maternally transmitted symbionts have evolved a variety of ways to promote their spread through host populations.
while host philopatry  favours the spread of infection, deme size has a non-monotonous effect, with ci-invasion being most likely at intermediate deme size.
one strategy is to hamper the reproduction of uninfected females by a mechanism called cytoplasmic incompatibility .
additional simulations with sex-specific migration rates further show that low migration rates of both sexes are required to facilitate the spread of ci.
since some level of sub-division is likely to occur in most natural populations, our results help to explain the high incidence of ci-infections across species of arthropods.
furthermore, our work has important implications for the use of ci-systems in order to genetically modify natural populations of disease vectors.
given the importance of drift, population sub-division would be expected to facilitate the spread of ci.
our model shows that population sub-division facilitates the invasion of ci.
ci-infections are under positive frequency-dependent selection and require genetic drift to overcome the range of low frequencies where they are counter-selected.
