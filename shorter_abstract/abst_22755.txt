starting from this core set of proteins, we acquired a ppi network that pointed, through topological analysis, to some proteins that may well be playing a central role in the neoplastic process, such as 14-3-3ζ.
with this study, we sought to achieve a systemic perspective of the common proteomic profile of six cervical cancer cell lines, both positive and negative for hpv, and which differ from the profile corresponding to the non-tumourgenic cell line, hacat.
we analyzed by means of 2d sds-page and maldi-tof mass spectrometry the protein extracts of six cervical cancer cell lines, from which we identified a consensus of  <dig> proteins.
with the purpose of characterizing the effects of malignant transformation in cellular activity, proteomic studies constitute a reliable way to monitor the biological alterations induced by this disease.
our objectives were to identify common cellular events participating in cancer maintenance, as well as the establishment of a pipeline to work with proteomic-derived results.
in silico overrepresentation analysis of transcription factors pointed to the overexpression of c-myc, max and e2f <dig> as key transcription factors involved in orchestrating the neoplastic phenotype.
in addition, our bioinformatics analysis suggests that the neoplastic phenotype is governed by a non-canonical regulatory pathway.
cervical cancer is a major mortality factor in the female population.
we call this group of proteins, the "central core of cervical cancer".
our findings show that there is a "central core of cervical cancer" protein expression pattern, and suggest that 14-3-3ζ is key to determine if the cell proliferates or dies.
in this contextual scheme, a systemic description that enables the identification of the common events between cell lines of different origins, is required to distinguish the essence of carcinogenesis.
