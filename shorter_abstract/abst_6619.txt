the therapeutic doses of radiation employed often result in adverse effects manifesting themselves primarily in the form of genital tract infections in patients or diarrhea.
this collection of lactobacillus bacteria isolates of various species, obtained from the genital tract and gastrointestinal tract of healthy women, was tested for resistance to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation.
the species studied, were isolated from the genital tract  and from the anus  of healthy pregnant women.
in the present study, we examined the influence of ionizing radiation on  <dig> selected strains of bacteria: lactobacillus crispatus, l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus l. amylovorus, l. casei, l. helveticus, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. salivarius and l. gasseri.
therapeutic doses of radiation do not affect the lactobacillus bacteria significantly.
however, the results were not statistically significant.
