the potential roles of the micrornaome in the transcriptomic cold regulation in the zebrafish brain were investigated by various statistical analyses.
micrornas  play important roles in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes by directing the degradation and/or repression of the translation of gene transcripts.
we defined a set of  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed under the cold and normal conditions and predicted the molecular functions and biological processes that they involve through gene ontology  annotation of their target genes.
on the other hand, microarray analysis showed that genes related to mrna processing and response to stress were overrepresented among the up-regulated genes in cold-stress, but are not directly corresponding to any of the go molecular functions and biological processes predicted from the differential mirnas.
our results suggest that the cold-stress response of mrna expression may be governed mainly through regulatory modes other than mirna-mediated regulation.
mirnas in animal brains might act more as developmental regulators than thermal adaptability regulators.
using several statistical models including a novel, network-based approach, we found that mirnas identified in this study, either individually or together, and either directly or indirectly , only make minor contribution to the change in gene expression patterns under the low-temperature condition.
in addition, we identified  <dig> novel, mature mirnas using multiple mirna prediction methods.
we then examined the expression pattern of the protein-coding genes under these two conditions with affymetrix zebrafish genome array profiling.
however, the roles of mirna-mediated regulation in environmental adaptation of organisms are largely unknown.
