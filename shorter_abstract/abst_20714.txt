in the present study, we investigate karyotypic variation in a single chromosome responsible for transmitting apomixis, the apospory-specific genomic region carrier chromosome, in relation to species phylogeny in the genera pennisetum and cenchrus.
an  <dig> bp region from the apospory-specific genomic region also was sequenced from the  <dig> apomicts.
our results indicate that the apospory-specific genomic region is shared by all apomictic species while it is absent from all sexual species or cytotypes.
contrary to our previous observations in pennisetum squamulatum and cenchrus ciliaris, retrotransposon sequences of the opie-2-like family were not closely associated with the apospory-specific genomic region in all apomictic species, suggesting that they may have been accumulated after the apospory-specific genomic region originated.
the apospory-specific genomic region likely preceded speciation in cenchrus and its lateral transfer through hybridization and subsequent chromosome repatterning may have contributed to further speciation in the two genera.
recent studies arguing that apomicts are not evolutionary dead ends have generated further interest in the evolution of asexual flowering plants.
a  <dig> kb region from the 3' end of the ndhf gene and a  <dig> bp region from trnl-f were sequenced from  <dig> apomictic and eight sexual species in the genus pennisetum and allied genus cenchrus.
apomixis is an intriguing trait in plants that results in maternal clones through seed reproduction.
molecular cytological analysis was conducted in sixteen pennisetum and two cenchrus species.
given that phylogenetic analysis merged cenchrus and newly investigated pennisetum species into a single clade containing a terminal cluster of cenchrus apomicts, the presumed monophyletic origin of cenchrus is supported.
