vaccine development against coccidioides is of contemporary interest because a large number of relapses and clinical failures are reported with antifungal agents.
we found that the primary dcs transfected with coccidioides-ag2/pra-cdna were of immature immunophenotype, expressed ag2/pra and activated naïve t cells.
in this study, we investigated the immunostimulatory characteristics of an intranasal primary dc-vaccine in balb/c mouse strain that is most susceptible to coccidioidomycosis.
coccidioidomycosis or valley fever is caused by a highly virulent fungal pathogen: coccidioides posadasii or immitis.
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that the intranasally-administered primary dc vaccine is capable of inducing ag2/pra-specific t cell response.
for trafficking, the dcs were co-transfected with a plasmid dna encoding hsv <dig> thymidine kinase  and administered intranasally into syngeneic mice.
based on the pet-probe accumulation in vaccinated mice, selected tissues were studied for antigen-specific response and t cell phenotypes using elispot and flow cytometry, respectively.
in pet images and subsequent biodistribution, intranasally-administered dcs were found to migrate in blood, lung and thymus; lymphocytes showed generation of t effector memory cell population  and ifn-γ release.
