cohen’s h can increase the power to find genetic association of rare variants and diseases, especially when maf is less than  <dig> .
we re-analyzed published datasets, one microarray and one sequencing based, and used simulation to compare the performance of cohen’s h with the risk difference  and odds ratio .

the power of the genome wide association studies starts to go down when the minor allele frequency  is below  <dig> .
the variance stabilizing effect based on the arcsine square root transformation of mafs to generate cohen’s h contributed to the statistical power for rare variants analysis.
here, we proposed the use of cohen’s h in detecting disease associated rare variants.
