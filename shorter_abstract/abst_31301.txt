the gut microbiota is nutritionally important for herbivorous animals.
however, little is known about the microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal tract  of the white rhinoceros.
sequences assigned to otu- <dig>  and otu- <dig>  had  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity to methanocorpusculum labreanum, respectively, making methanocorpusculum labreanum the predominant phylotype in these white rhynoceroses.
in order to better protect these endangered animals, it is necessary to better understand their digestive physiology and nutritional requirements.
sequences belonging to otu- <dig> , otu- <dig>  and otu- <dig>  were distantly related  to methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and were considered to be novel species or strains that have yet-to-be cultivated and characterized.
sequences belonging to otu- <dig>  were related  to methanobrevibacter smithii.
methanogen diversity in the git may be host species-specific and, or, function-dependent.
sequence analysis of  <dig> archaeal 16s rrna sequences revealed  <dig> unique phylotypes, which were assigned to seven operational taxonomic units .
to assess methanogen diversity in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses, an archaeal 16s rrna gene clone library was constructed from pooled pcr products obtained from the feces of seven adult animals.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the methanogen species in the hindgut of white rhinoceroses were more similar to those in the hindgut of horses.
the white rhinoceros is on the verge of extinction with less than  <dig>  animals remaining in the wild.
only 4% of the total sequences  were assigned to methanosphaera stadtmanae .
