na cleaves the sialic acid receptors eventually releasing newly formed virus particles which then invade new cells.
influenza virus spreads infection by two main surface glycoproteins, namely hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase .
an experimentally reported series of acylguanidine zanamivir derivatives was used to develop gqsar model targeting na in different strains of influenza virus, h1n <dig> and h3n <dig>  a combinatorial library was developed and their inhibitory activities were predicted using the gqsar model.
the top leads were analyzed by docking which revealed the binding modes of these inhibitors in the active site of na .
the top compound  was selected for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations for 15Â ns which provided insights into the time dependent dynamics of the designed leads.
