our assembly reveals that the number of h37ra-specific variants is less than half of what the sanger-based h37ra reference sequence indicates, undermining and, in some cases, invalidating the conclusions of several studies.
here, we report the assembly and finishing of the h37ra genome from single-molecule, real-time  sequencing.
the genetic basis of virulence in mycobacterium tuberculosis has been investigated through genome comparisons of virulent  and attenuated  sister strains.
pe_ppe family genes, which are intractable to commonly-used sequencing platforms because of their repetitive and gc-rich nature, are overrepresented in the set of genes in which all reported h37ra-specific variants are contradicted.
our results constrain the set of genomic differences possibly affecting virulence by more than half, which focuses laboratory investigation on pertinent targets and demonstrates the power of smrt sequencing for producing high-quality reference genomes.
