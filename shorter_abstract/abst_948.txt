their higher availability and stability when compared to simple sequence repeats  provide enhanced possibilities for genetic and breeding applications such as cultivar identification, construction of genetic maps, the assessment of genetic diversity, the detection of genotype/phenotype associations, or marker-assisted breeding.
to validate the use of the detected polymorphisms in genetic mapping, cultivar identification and genetic diversity studies we have used the snplex™ genotyping technology in a sample of grapevine genotypes and segregating progenies.
using snplex™ genotyping we have shown the application of a set of discovered snps as molecular markers for cultivar identification, linkage mapping and genetic diversity studies.
these results provide accurate values for nucleotide diversity in coding sequences and a first estimate of short-range ld in grapevine.
single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant type of dna sequence polymorphisms.
the average number of haplotypes per gene sequence was estimated as six, with three haplotypes representing over 83% of the analyzed sequences.
thus, the combination a highly efficient re-sequencing approach and the snplex™ high throughput genotyping technology provide a powerful tool for grapevine genetic analysis.
in order to develop a large snp set of wide application in grapevine we followed a systematic re-sequencing approach in a group of  <dig> grape genotypes corresponding to ancient unrelated cultivars as well as wild plants.
nucleotide diversity in grape  was found to be similar to values observed in highly polymorphic plant species such as maize.
short-range linkage disequilibrium  studies within the analyzed sequences indicate the existence of a rapid decay of ld within the selected grapevine genotypes.
in parallel, the sequence of the grapevine cultivar pinot noir is also providing thousands of polymorphisms present in this highly heterozygous genome.
