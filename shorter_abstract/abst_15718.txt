oral streptococci metabolize carbohydrate to produce organic acids, which not only decrease the environmental ph, but also increase osmolality of dental plaque fluid due to tooth demineralization and consequent calcium and phosphate accumulation.
we found that the hyperosmotic condition was able to initiate s. mutans biofilm dispersal by reducing both microbial content and extracellular polysaccharides matrix.
hyperosmotic condition induces significant stress response on s. mutans at both phenotypic and transcriptomic levels.
specific genes involved in heat shock response and acid tolerance were also upregulated, indicating potential cross-talk between hyperosmotic and other environmental stress.
further analysis of microarray data showed significant up-regulation of genes and pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
in the meantime, it may take full advantage of these environmental stimuli to better fit the fluctuating environments within oral cavity, and thus emerges as numeric-predominant bacterium under cariogenic conditions.
we then used whole-genome microarray with quantitative rt-pcr validation to systemically investigate the underlying molecular machineries of this bacterium in response to the hyperosmotic stimuli.
among those identified  <dig> deferentially regulated genes, down-regulation of gtfb and comc were believed to be responsible for the observed biofilm dispersal.

we investigated phenotypic change of s. mutans biofilm upon hyperosmotic challenge.
the aim of this study was to obtain a global view on strategies taken by streptococcus mutans to deal with physiologically relevant elevated osmolality, and perseveres within a cariogenic dental plaque.
