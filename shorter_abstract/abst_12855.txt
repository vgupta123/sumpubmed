many content-based statistical features of secondary structural elements  have been proposed and achieved promising results in protein structural class prediction, but until now position distribution of the successive occurrences of an element in predicted secondary structure sequences hasn’t been used.
besides, the proposed pbf-psse’s performance is extremely sensitive to the choice of parameter k. in summary, our quantitative analysis verifies that exploring the position information of predicted secondary structural elements is a promising way to improve the abilities of protein structural class prediction.
when combining with the pbf-psse, most of the cbf-psses get a great improvement over the prediction accuracies, so the pbf-psses and the cbf-psses have to work closely so as to make significant and complementary contributions to protein structural class prediction.
it is necessary to extract some appropriate position-based features of the secondary structural elements for prediction task.
we proposed some position-based features of predicted secondary structural elements  and assessed their intrinsic ability relative to the available cbf-psses, which not only offers a systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of these statistical features, but also naturally complements the available comparison of the cbf-psses.
pbf-psses and cbf-psses have a compelling impact on protein structural class prediction.
