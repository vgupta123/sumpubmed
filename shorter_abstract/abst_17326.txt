however, the molecular mechanisms linking its action to body weight balance have been only partially elucidated.
no gender-related variation concerning bmax/bmi ratios was observed in this cohort of subjects.
-paroxetine bmax  was reduced in platelet membranes of grade ii  and iii  obese subjects vs. controls and in overweight subjects  vs. grade iii obese individuals.

a cohort of  <dig> unrelated individuals  without major psychiatric disorders, was recruited following a naturalistic design regarding age or gender and classified accordingly to their body mass index .
