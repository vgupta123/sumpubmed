furthermore, our study reveals significant similarities in gene content between this environmental isolate and the selected enterococci strains , which contributes to understand the persistence of this genus in different niches and also improves our knowledge about the genetics of this diverse group of microorganisms that includes environmental, commensal and opportunistic pathogens.
the draft genome sequence of e. mundtii was recently announced.
the objective of this study was to compare the genetic content of e. mundtii with respect to other enterococcal species and, more specifically, to identify genes coding for putative virulence traits present in enterococcal opportunistic pathogens.
although e. mundtii crl <dig> is phylogenetically closer to e. faecium, frequently responsible of nosocomial infections, this strain does not encode the most relevant relevant virulence factors found in the enterococcal clinical isolates and bioinformatic predictions indicate that it possesses the lowest number of putative pathogenic genes among the most representative enterococcal species.
moreover, in this study a comparative genomic analysis against commensal and pathogenic enterococcal species, for which genomic sequences have been released, was conducted for the first time.
enterococcus mundtii is a yellow-pigmented microorganism rarely found in human infections.
