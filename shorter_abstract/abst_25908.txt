text annotator is able to extract compound, organism, and assay entities from text content while structure image recognition enables translation of chemical raster images to machine readable format.
chemex facilitates and speeds up chemical data curation by extracting compounds, organisms, and assays from a large collection of publications.
automatic information extraction can be used as a tool to reduce these problems.
a user can view annotated text along with summarized information of compounds, organism that produces those compounds, and assay tests.
since chemical structures usually described in images, information extraction needs to combine structure image recognition and text mining together.
we have developed chemex, a chemical information extraction system.
manual chemical data curation from publications is error-prone, time consuming, and hard to maintain up-to-date data sets.
