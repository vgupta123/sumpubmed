pre-symptomatic prediction of disease and drug response based on genetic testing is a critical component of personalized medicine.
we apply our method to genetic prediction of type  <dig> diabetes and breast cancer, and we additionally show the best possible accuracy that can be obtained from integrated predictors, which can incorporate non-genetic features.
here, we mathematically derive the absolute limits that these factors impose on test accuracy in the absence of any distributional assumptions on risk.
knowledge of such limits is valuable in understanding the implications of genetic testing even before additional associations are identified.
previous work has demonstrated that the predictive capacity of genetic testing is constrained by the heritability and prevalence of the tested trait, although these constraints have only been approximated under the assumption of a normally distributed genetic risk distribution.
