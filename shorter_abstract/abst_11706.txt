greater than 95% knockdown of the non-catalytic subunit csn <dig> and the deneddylating subunit csn <dig> of the csn was achieved in the human myeloid progenitor cell line k <dig>  csn <dig> knockdown led to a reduction of both csn <dig> protein and mrna whilst csn <dig> knockdown had little effect on csn <dig>  both knockdowns inhibited csn deneddylase function as demonstrated by accumulation of neddylated cul <dig>  furthermore, both knockdowns resulted in the sequential loss of skp <dig>  cdc <dig> and Î²-trcp f-box proteins.
these proteins were rescued by the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  indicating the autocatalytic degradation of f-box proteins upon loss of csn <dig> or csn <dig>  interestingly, altered f-box protein gene expression was also observed in csn <dig> and csn <dig> knockdowns, suggesting a potential role of the csn in regulating f-box protein transcription.
our data present the first evidence for the sequential loss of f-box proteins upon csn manipulation and are the first to identify a potential link between csn function and autophagy.
treatment of vector control k <dig> cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin a <dig> recapitulated the growth kinetics, vacuolar morphology and lc3-ii accumulation of csn <dig> knockdown cells indicating that the cellular phenotype of csn <dig> cells arises from autophagy inhibition.
loss of either csn subunit dramatically reduced cell growth but resulted in distinct patterns of cell death.
csn <dig> knockdown caused mitotic defects, g2/m arrest and apoptotic cell death.
csn <dig> knockdown resulted in non-apoptotic cell death associated with accumulation of both the autophagy marker lc3-ii and autophagic vacuoles.
we conclude that csn <dig> is required for csn integrity and the stability of individual csn subunits, and postulate that csn <dig> loss results in a phenotype distinct from that of cells lacking csn <dig> possibly as a consequence of altered csn <dig> activity within a resultant csn subcomplex.
