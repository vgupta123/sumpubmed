however, sequence-related features , orf length, gc content, polycistronic mrna), gene function and essentiality also affected mrna lifetime at all growth rates.
these results will pave the way for discussions of the underlying mechanisms and their interaction with the growth physiology of bacteria.
we used linear covariance models and the best model selected according to the akaike information criterion to identify and rank intrinsic and extrinsic general transcript parameters correlated with mrna lifetime, using mrna half-life datasets for e. coli, obtained at four growth rates.
this study provides the most complete genome-wide analysis to date of the general factors correlated with mrna lifetime in e. coli.
however, the mechanisms regulating mrna lifetime are poorly understood at the genome-wide scale and have not been investigated in bacteria growing at different rates.
the principal parameter correlated with mrna stability was mrna concentration, the mrnas most concentrated in the cells being the least stable.
we also identified sequence motifs within the 5′utrs potentially related to mrna stability.
finally, mrna stability was less strongly correlated with the amount of protein produced than mrna concentration and cai.
growth rate-dependent effects were confined to particular functional categories .
changes to mrna lifetime adjust mrna concentration, facilitating the adaptation of growth rate to changes in growth conditions.

we have generalized for the entire population of transcripts or excluded determinants previously defined as regulators of stability for some particular mrnas and identified new, unexpected general indicators.
