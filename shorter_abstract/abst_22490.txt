unlike vvmyb <dig>  vvmyb <dig> was able to complement the loss-of-function atmyb60- <dig> mutant, indicating that vvmyb <dig> is the only true ortholog of atmyb <dig> in the grape genome.
this event is trigged by a series of signals produced inside guard cells which finally reduce their turgor.
promoter-gus transcriptional fusion assays showed that expression of vvmyb <dig> was restricted to stomatal guard cells and was attenuated in response to aba.
these results show that vvmyb <dig> modulates physiological responses in guard cells, leading to the possibility of engineering stomatal conductance in grapevine, reducing water loss and helping this species to tolerate drought under extreme climatic conditions.
under drought, plants accumulate the signaling hormone abscisic acid , which induces the rapid closure of stomatal pores to prevent water loss.
in addition, vvmyb <dig> was differentially regulated during development of grape organs and in response to aba and drought-related stress conditions.
many of these events are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, including the control exerted by myb proteins.
