six substrate recognition sites  important for the enzymatic conversion were investigated in the described cytochromes p <dig> and display significant variability within the cyp71aj subfamily.
the subclades show significant variability within their substrate recognition sites between the clades, suggesting different biochemical functions and providing insights into the evolution of cytochrome p <dig> ‘blooms’ in response to environmental pressures.

homology models underline a significant modification of the accession to the iron atom, which might explain the difference of the substrate specificity between the cytochromes p <dig> restricted to furanocoumarins as substrates and the orphan cyp71aj.
