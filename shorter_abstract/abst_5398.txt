existing computational analysis methods are limited in the size of their sequence databases, which severely restricts the proteomic sequencing depth and functional analysis of highly complex samples.
proof-of-principle analysis of human hek <dig> lysate with a compil database derived from high-quality genomic libraries was able to detect nearly all of the same peptides as a search with a human database , with a small reduction in sensitivity.
the combination of compil with blazmass allows proteomic searches to be performed with database sizes much larger than previously possible.
these large database searches can be applied to complex meta-samples with unknown composition or proteomic samples where unexpected proteins may be identified.
we designed a broadly applicable metaproteomic analysis method  that addresses protein database size limitations.
the protein database, proteomic search engine, and the proteomic data files for the  <dig> microbiome samples characterized and discussed herein are open source and available for use and additional analysis.
mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics experiments rely on accurate matching of experimental spectra against a database of protein sequences.
