this prediction has been tested thoroughly at the intraspecific level, but few studies have investigated the hypothesis with interspecific data using phylogenetic comparative approaches.
we use this comparative method to investigate whether body mass evolves towards phenotypic optima that are functions of median latitude, maximum latitude or temperature.
allen’s rule was supported in one of the five examined families , but only when forelimb length evolves towards an optimum that is a function of maximum latitude, not median latitude or temperature.
we also found latitude and temperature to significantly predict body mass in geomyidae ; however, the association went in the opposite direction of bergmann’s predictions.
among  <dig> mammalian families, there was weak support for bergmann’s rule in one family: a decrease in temperature predicted increased body mass in canidae .
based on this exhaustive assessment of bergmann’s rule, we conclude that factors other than latitude and temperature are the major drivers of body mass evolution at the family level in mammals.

the method is based on an ornstein-uhlenbeck model of evolution that allows for joint estimation of adaptation and constraints  in the evolution of a trait.
we also assess the closely related allen’s rule in five families, by testing if relative forelimb length evolves as a function of temperature or latitude.
here, we evaluate bergmann’s rule within  <dig> mammalian families—with a dataset that include ~35 % of all described species—using a phylogenetic comparative approach.
