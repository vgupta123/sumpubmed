lactation undernutrition in first  generation offspring affected body composition, reproductive performance parameters and influenced the expression of genes responsible for hypothalamic neural circuits controlling reproductive function of both sexes.
the early developmental plasticity of hypothalamus when challenged with undernutrition during postnatal development not only leads to altered expression of genes controlling hypothalamic neural circuits, altered body composition, delayed puberty and disturbed reproductive performance in f <dig> progeny, but also affects f <dig> offspring, depending on parental malnutrition history and in sexually dimorphic manner.
strikingly, f <dig> offspring showed phenotypes similar to f <dig> progeny; however, they were sex and parental nutritional history specific.
to test this hypothesis we have utilized a mouse model of undernutrition during suckling by exposing lactating mothers to undernutrition.
using a combination of transcriptomic and biological approaches, we demonstrate that molecular programming of hypothalamus may perturb gender specific phenotypes across generations that are dependent on the nutritional environment of the lactation period.
the timing of pubertal initiation and progression in mammals is likely influenced by the nutritional and metabolic state, leading us to the hypothesis that transient malnutrition experienced at critical times during development may perturb pubertal progression through successive generations.
