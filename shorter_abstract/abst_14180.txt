analysis of gene expression indicated that differentiation of blastomeres of the morula-stage embryo into the icm and te of the blastocyst is accompanied by differences between the two cell lineages in expression of genes controlling metabolic processes, endocytosis, hatching from the zona pellucida, paracrine and endocrine signaling with the mother, and genes supporting the changes in cellular architecture, stemness, and hematopoiesis necessary for development of the trophoblast.
here we determined, for the first time, global gene expression patterns in the icm and te isolated from bovine blastocysts.
the first distinct differentiation event in mammals occurs at the blastocyst stage when totipotent blastomeres differentiate into either pluripotent inner cell mass  or multipotent trophectoderm .
