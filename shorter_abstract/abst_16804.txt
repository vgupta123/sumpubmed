in the adhesion phase, c. albicans cells kept a brownian movement in rpmi medium containing hs until a large number of germ tubes were formed.
the expression of the adhesion-related genes bcr <dig>  als <dig>  als <dig>  hwp <dig> and ece <dig> was analyzed by rt-pcr at three time points .
at three time points, hs inhibited expression of the als <dig> and als <dig> genes and promoted expression of the hwp <dig> and ece <dig> genes.
this study evaluated the effect of human serum  on c. albicans biofilm formation and the expression of adhesion-related genes in vitro.
biofilm formation was also inhibited by heat-inactivated and proteinase k pre-treated hs.
human serum reduces biofilm formation by inhibiting the adhesion of c. albicans cells.
however, the presence of hs had no significant inhibitory effect on the pre-adhered biofilms .
the growth of biofilm cells of four strains was monitored by a live cell movie analyzer, and by xtt reduction assay.
a c. albicans laboratory strain  and three clinical strains were grown for 24 h in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with hs or rpmi  <dig> alone .
in the control group, c. albicans cells quickly adhered to the bottom of the reaction plate.
the presence of 50% hs did not significantly affect the planktonic growth of c. albicans .
compared with rpmi  <dig>  medium supplemented with 3–50% hs caused a significant decrease in biofilm development .
candida albicans can form biofilms on intravenous catheters; this process plays a key role in the pathogenesis of catheter infections.
