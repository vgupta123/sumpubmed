comprehensive sensitivity analysis revealed the significant role of pka negative feedback on upstream signaling and the importance of phosphodiesterases as key negative regulators of the network.
normalized hill functions improved quantitative predictions of global functional relationships compared with prior logic-based approaches.
direct comparison of this model to an extensively characterized and validated biochemical model of the same network revealed that the new model gave reasonably accurate predictions of key network properties, even with default parameters.
while mass action and enzyme kinetic approaches require extensive biochemical data, current logic-based approaches are used primarily for qualitative predictions and have lacked direct quantitative comparison with biochemical models.
the normalized-hill differential equation modeling approach allows quantitative prediction of network functional relationships and dynamics, even in systems with limited biochemical data.
