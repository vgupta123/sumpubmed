in order to pinpoint the evolutionary origin of this phenomenon within the genus trifolium, we sequenced and assembled the plastomes of eight additional trifolium species widely sampled from across the genus.
we conclude that the unusual repetitive plastome type previously characterized in trifolium subterraneum had a single origin within trifolium and is characteristic of most  species of subgenus trifolium.
these species form a single clade, which we call the “refractory clade” .
the characteristics of the refractory clade are the presence of numerous short duplications and 7-15% longer genomes than the tractable species.
molecular dating estimates that the origin of the most recent common ancestor  of the refractory clade is approximately  <dig>  million years ago .
the trifolium plastomes fell into two groups: those of trifolium boissieri, t. strictum and t. glanduliferum  were tractable, assembled readily and were not unusual in the general context of fabeae plastomes.
this is considerably younger than the estimated mrca ages of trifolium  and trifolium subg.
the other trifolium species  proved refractory to assembly mainly because of numerous short duplications.
