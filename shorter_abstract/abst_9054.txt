annotation of genes within bacs showed that axolotl introns are on average 10× longer than orthologous vertebrate introns and they are predicted to contain more functional elements, including mirnas and snornas.
considering that axolotl genes are on average 5× larger than human genes, the genic component of the salamander genome is estimated to be incredibly large, approximately  <dig>  gigabases!
this study shows that a large salamander genome has a correspondingly large genic component, primarily because genes have incredibly long introns.
sixteen bac clones from the mexican axolotl  were isolated and sequenced to characterize the structure of genic regions.
unexpectedly, a third novel gene was also discovered while manually annotating bacs.
analysis of human-axolotl protein-coding sequences suggests there are 2% more lineage specific genes in the axolotl genome than the human genome, but the great majority  of genes between axolotl and human are predicted to be 1: <dig> orthologs.
the basis of genome size variation remains an outstanding question because dna sequence data are lacking for organisms with large genomes.
loci were discovered within bacs for two novel est transcripts that are differentially expressed during spinal cord regeneration and skin metamorphosis.
