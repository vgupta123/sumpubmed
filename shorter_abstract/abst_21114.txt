the concentrations of retinol in whole blood , plasma  and serum  were measured by a new rapid cow-side test  and compared with those by hplc in two independent laboratories in germany  and japan .
a similar comparability was observed when whole blood was used .
with the new rapid cow-side test  retinol concentrations in cattle can be reliably assessed within a few minutes and directly in the barn using even whole blood without the necessity of prior centrifugation.
no significant differences in retinol levels were observed between the new rapid cow-side test and hplc performed in different laboratories .
results showed a good agreement between both methods based on correlation coefficients of r2 =  <dig>   and bland-altman blots revealed no significant bias for all comparison.
however, the determination of vitamin a requires a time consuming multi-step procedure, which needs specific equipment to perform extraction, centrifugation or saponification prior to high-performance liquid chromatography .
the ease of the application of the new rapid cow-side test and its portability can improve the diagnostic of vitamin a status and will help to control vitamin a supplementation in specific vitamin a feeding regimes such as used to optimize health status in calves or meat marbling in japanese black cattle.
retinol concentrations in plasma ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l, and in serum from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l .
