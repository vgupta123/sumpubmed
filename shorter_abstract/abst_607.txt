here we applied our protein docking algorithm tcrflexdock, previously developed to perform docking of tcrs to peptide-mhc  molecules, to predict the binding of αβ and γδ tcrs to cd <dig> and mr <dig>  starting with the structures of the unbound molecules.
together these results indicate that flexible docking simulations can provide accurate models and atomic-level insights into tcr recognition of mhc-like molecules presenting lipid and other small molecule antigens.
docking performance was improved by re-training our scoring function with a set of tcr-pmhc complexes, and for a case with an outlier binding mode, we found that alternative docking start positions improved predictive accuracy.
t cell receptors  can recognize diverse lipid and metabolite antigens presented by mhc-like molecules cd <dig> and mr <dig>  and the molecular basis of many of these interactions has not been determined.
we also predicted the structure of an interaction between a mait tcr and mr1-antigen that has not been structurally characterized, yielding a top-ranked model that agreed remarkably with a characterized tcr-mr1-antigen structure that has a nearly identical tcr α chain but a different β chain, highlighting the likely dominance of the conserved α chain in mr1-antigen recognition.
evaluating against tcr-cd1d complexes with crystal structures, we achieved near-native structures in the top  <dig> models for two out of four cases, and an acceptable-rated prediction for a third case.
