its <dig> worked equally well for the fresh and herbarium material .
although seven cases of its <dig> paralogy were noted in the families cyperaceae, juncaceae and juncaginaceae, this intergenic spacer played an important role in resolving congeneric plant species at churchill.
the highest species resolution  was obtained by combining information from all three genes.
however, sequencing success was lower for matk, despite two rounds of pcr amplification, which reflected less effective primer binding and sensitivity to the dna degradation .
a species was considered as taxonomically resolved if its members showed at least one diagnostic difference from any other taxon in the study and formed a monophyletic clade.
despite incomplete resolution, the barcode results revealed  <dig> misidentified herbarium specimens, and enabled the identification of field specimens which were otherwise too immature to identify.
our results provided fast and cost-effective solution to create a comprehensive, effective dna barcode reference library for a local flora.
this investigation examined  <dig> specimens representing  <dig> of the  <dig> species of vascular plants known from churchill.
because arctic plant communities are highly vulnerable to climate change, shifts in their composition require rapid, accurate identifications, often for specimens that lack diagnostic floral characters.
sequencing success was high for rbcl: 95% for fresh specimens and 85% for herbarium samples .
