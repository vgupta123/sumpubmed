a major problem with existing methods lies within the significant number of false positive and false negative annotations.
current prediction models are derived from a set of measured test analytes but they usually require large amounts of training data.
the proposed kernel function is well-suited for the prediction of chromatographic separation in computational proteomics and requires only a limited amount of training data.
we introduce a new kernel function which can be applied in combination with support vector machines to a wide range of computational proteomics problems.
so far, standard algorithms for protein identification do not use the information gained from separation processes usually involved in peptide analysis, such as retention time information, which are readily available from chromatographic separation of the sample.
the performance of this new method is demonstrated by applying it to peptide retention time prediction in ip-rp-hplc and prediction of peptide sample fractionation in sax-spe.
identification can thus be improved by comparing measured retention times to predicted retention times.
furthermore, the predicted retention times are used to improve spectrum identifications by a p-value-based filtering approach.
using the retention time predictor in our retention time filter improves the fraction of correctly identified peptide mass spectra significantly.
finally, we incorporate the predicted chromatographic behavior in a p-value based filter to improve peptide identifications based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
high-throughput peptide and protein identification technologies have benefited tremendously from strategies based on tandem mass spectrometry  in combination with database searching algorithms.
