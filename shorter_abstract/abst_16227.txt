the primary aim of snp-rflping  <dig> is to provide comprehensive pcr-rflp information with multiple functionality about snps, such as snp retrieval to multiple species, different polymorphism types , gene-centric searching, hapmap tagsnps, gene ontology-based searching, mirnas, and snp500cancer.
the rflp restriction enzymes and the corresponding pcr primers for the natural and mutagenic types of each snp are simultaneously analyzed.
