the oral viridans streptococci are pioneer colonizers of dental plaque biofilm.
the acquisition of an abp by oral streptococci provides an interesting example of adaptive evolution.
abps were detected in culture supernatants of  <dig> of  <dig> strains representing  <dig> oral streptococcus species screened using the amylase-ligand binding assay.
abpa-like sequences can be divided into five subgroups based on the n-terminal sequences.
alignment and phylogenetic analyses performed to ascertain evolutionary relationships revealed that abps cluster into at least six distinct, unrelated families  with no phylogenetic evidence that one group evolved from another, and no single ancestral gene found within each group.
among the sequenced abps,  <dig> matched amylase-binding protein a ,  <dig> matched amylase-binding protein b , and  <dig> unique abps were identified as peptidoglycan-binding, glutamine abc-type transporter, hypothetical, or choline-binding proteins.
successful commensal bacteria have evolved to maintain colonization in challenging environments.
genome sequencing and blast searches using n-terminal sequences, protein size, and key words identified the gene associated with each abp.
some of these bacteria have adapted to life in the oral cavity by binding salivary α-amylase, which hydrolyzes dietary starch, thus providing a source of nutrition.
n-terminal sequences from abps of diverse size were obtained from  <dig> strains representing six oral streptococcal species.
oral streptococcal species bind α-amylase by expressing a variety of amylase-binding proteins .
