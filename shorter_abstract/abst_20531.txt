we presented a network-based approach that can infer potential microrna-disease associations and drive testable hypotheses for the experimental efforts to identify the roles of micrornas in human diseases.
herein, we devised a computational model to infer potential microrna-disease associations by prioritizing the entire human micrornaome for diseases of interest.
computational analysis of microrna-disease associations is an important complementary means for prioritizing micrornas for further experimental examination.
we tested the model on  <dig> known experimentally verified microrna-disease associations and achieved an area under the roc curve of  <dig> %.
