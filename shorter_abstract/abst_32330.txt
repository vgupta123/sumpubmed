the results presented here also serve as a guide for the reevaluation of current pudú conservation strategies, for the design of new field studies to detect the presence of this species in human-disturbed areas or remaining patches of native forest, and for the implementation of corridors to maximize the success of conservation efforts.
currently, many species are facing serious conservation problems due to habitat loss.
the impact of the potential loss of biodiversity associated with habitat loss is difficult to measure.
according to these results, the protected area network cannot be considered as a key component of the conservation strategy for this species.
this is particularly the case with inconspicuous species such as the threatened pudú , an endemic cervidae of temperate forests of chile and argentina.
the potential habitat of the pudú was found to be poorly represented in the system  and even the most suitable areas for the species are not currenly protected.
