screening of water samples and spleens from symptomless and infected fishes indicated that the pathogen was already present before the outbreaks, but f. psychrophilum was only quantifiable in spleens from diseased fishes.
tests on spiked spleens with known concentrations of f. psychrophilum  showed no cross-reactions between the spleen tissue and the primers and probe.
this qpcr can be used as a highly sensitive and specific method to detect f. psychrophilum in different sample types without the need for culturing.
qpcr allows a reliable detection and quantification of f. psychrophilum in samples with low pathogen densities.
quantitative data on f. psychrophilum abundance could be useful to investigate risk factors linked to infections and also as early warning system prior to potential devastating outbreak.
flavobacterium psychrophilum is the agent of bacterial cold water disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome, two diseases leading to high mortality.
