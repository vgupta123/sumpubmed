metaphysis: total area, bone area, cortical bone area, cortical thickness, bone mineral density, bone mineral density in the cortex, bone mineral density in the trabecular region, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, polar moment of inertia of the metaphysis, polar moment of inertia of the cortex of the metaphysis.
the effect of age on the bone mineral density and microarchitecture of the equine radius and tibia was investigated.
diaphysis: total volume, bone volume, bone volume ratio, slice area, bone area, marrow area, cortical and marrow thickness, bone mineral density, polar moment of inertia of the cortex.
the following variables were determined: length of the bone, circumference and diameter in the frontal and sagittal planes in the middle of the bone.
there were no significant differences between bones of the left and right limbs or between the radius and tibia.
further experimental studies are necessary to determine whether these changes reduce bone strength.
there were nine geldings and six mares, and none of the horses had any disease influencing bone properties.
