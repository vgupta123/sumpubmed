while we focused on a single qtl region, other qtl regions of importance could be similarly sequenced allowing for biological discovery to take place before a high quality whole-genome assembly is completed.
we found, furthermore, that a quality assembly suitable for serving as a reference genome template could be obtained even with a reduced depth of sequencing coverage.
this pooled bac approach was taken to sequence and assemble a qtl-rich region, of ~ <dig> mbp and represented by twenty-seven bacs, on linkage group  <dig> of the theobroma cacao cv.
bac-based physical maps provide for sequencing across an entire genome or a selected sub-genomic region of biological interest.
our results, as with other pooled bac sequencing reports, suggest that pooling portions of a minimum tiling path derived from a bac-based physical map is an effective method to target sub-genomic regions for sequencing.
annotation of the resulting assembly revealed several genes potentially responsible for three t. cacao traits: black pod disease resistance, bean shape index, and pod weight.
