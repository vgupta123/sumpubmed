database search was performed to investigate the shsp gene family across rice genome sequence followed by comprehensive expression analysis of these genes.
shsps cooperate with hsp100/hsp <dig> and co-chaperones in atp-dependent manner in preventing aggregation of cellular proteins and in their subsequent refolding.
in addition to stress regulation, various shsp genes were differentially upregulated at different developmental stages of the rice plant.
we identified twenty three shsp genes and seventeen acd genes in rice.
the additional  <dig> genes containing acd clustered with acd proteins of arabidopsis.
analysis of expression profiling of shsp genes revealed that these genes are differentially expressed under stress and at different stages in the life cycle of rice plant.
strikingly,  <dig> of  <dig> rice shsp genes were noted to be intronless.
expression analysis based on microarray and rt-pcr showed that  <dig> shsp genes were upregulated by high temperature stress.
besides heat stress, expression of shsp genes was up or downregulated by other abiotic and biotic stresses.
majority of shsp genes were expressed in seed.
three nucleocytoplasmic shsp genes were found only in monocots.
the characteristic feature of the shsps is the presence of α-crystallin domain  at the c-terminus.
we identified  <dig> α-crystallin domain containing genes in rice.
heat shock proteins  constitute an important component in the heat shock response of all living systems.
