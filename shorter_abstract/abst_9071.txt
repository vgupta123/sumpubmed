functional syncres were isolated by screening the syne libray for elements mediating transcriptional activity in plant protoplasts.

using sequential enrichment, deep sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline, candidate responsive syncres were identified within a pool of constitutively active dna elements and further validated.
the identification of endogenous cis-regulatory dna elements  responsive to endogenous and environmental cues is important for studying gene regulation and for biotechnological applications but is labor and time intensive.
