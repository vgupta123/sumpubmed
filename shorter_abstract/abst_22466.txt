the framework consists of novel tufa degenerate primers and a comprehensive database enabling operational taxonomic unit  identification at multiple taxonomic ranks with percent identity thresholds determined herein.
the established companion tufa database and determined identity thresholds allow for otu identification at multiple taxonomic ranks to facilitate the monitoring of phototrophic assemblages via metabarcoding, especially endolithic communities rich in bioeroding ulvophyceae, such as those harboring ‘ostreobium’ spp., phaeophila spp.
in spite of their ecological importance as primary producers and microbioeroders of marine calcium carbonate  substrata, endolithic phototrophs spanning both prokaryotic  and eukaryotic algae lack established molecular resources for their facilitated survey with high throughput sequencing.
the ostreobidineae, and a fifth, phylogenetically remote family in the suborder halimedineae .
the novel degenerate primers allowed for amplification of endolithic phototrophs across a wide phylogenetic breadth as well as their recovery in very large proportions of reads  and diversity .
the newly established tufa database comprises  <dig> non-redundant sequences  including  <dig> classes in  <dig> phyla of phototrophic diversity summarized from data mining on genbank®, our barcoding of > <dig> clones produced from coral reef microfloras, and > <dig> eukaryotic phototrophs .
here, the development of a metabarcoding framework for the elongation factor ef-ttu  was tested on four illumina-sequenced marine caco <dig> microfloras for the characterization of their endolithic phototrophs, especially the abundant bioeroding ostreobium spp.
phototrophic otus belonged to  <dig> classes of phototrophs found in seven phyla, and represented ~98 % of all reads.
