in this study, we have utilized zfn and cas9-catalyzed double strand break followed by homologous recombination-mediated incorporation of premature stop codon and selection marker to target human cell division cycle 14a  and cell division cycle 14b  genes.
furthermore, loxp site-mediated removal of selection markers left a 45 bp scar within the targeted exon that can be traced in mrna without exon skipping.
because the exons had a nucleotide number that could be divided by  <dig>  the reading frame of the exon deletion was maintained.
targeting of the hcdc14a and hcdc14b loci in telomerase immortalized human retinal pigment epithelium  and human colon cancer  cells were confirmed by southern blot hybridization.
engineered zinc-finger nuclease  and crispr-associated protein- <dig> nuclease  offer such an elegant approach for genome editing in vertebrate cells.

this indicates an exon-skipping event possibly due to the insertion of large dna fragment  within the targeted exons.
from this study, we conclude that insertion of a large dna fragment into an exon by genome editing can lead to its skipping from the final transcript.
small alterations in the exon  were transcribed to mrna without exon skipping.
