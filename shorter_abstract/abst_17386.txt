the purpose of the present study was to test for involvement of calcium and to probe calcium-dependent mediators to reveal their role in carbachol-mediated dispersion.
carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion was blocked by the calcium chelator bapta.
a rise in intracellular calcium is necessary for carbachol-induced dispersion; however, the ca2+ requirement is not dependent on extracellular sources, implying that intracellular stores are sufficient to enable pigment granule dispersion to occur.
inside bluegill  retinal pigment epithelial cells, pigment granules move in response to extracellular signals.
the calcineurin inhibitor cypermethrin blocked carbachol-induced dispersion; whereas, two protein kinase c inhibitors  failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion, and the protein kinase c activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to elicit dispersion.
