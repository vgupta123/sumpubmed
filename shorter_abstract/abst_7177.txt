most mirnas identified in the cancer cell line and in keratinocytes were present in tumor samples and cancer-free samples, respectively, with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> still among the most prevalent molecules at all instances.
both constitute cell models for functional studies of micrornas in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , a smoking-related cancer.
critical biological features of cells must be fully understood before they can be chosen as models for functional studies.
we demonstrate that differentially expressed mature mirnas target cell differentiation and apoptosis related biological processes, indicating that they might represent, with acceptable accuracy, the genetic context from which they derive.
functional in vitro studies are fundamental for the comprehension of their role; nevertheless results are highly dependable on the adopted cellular model.
results were compared with small rna transcriptomic sequences from hnscc samples in order to access the applicability of these cell models for cancer phenotype comprehension and for novel molecule discovery.
results indicate that the use of cell models for cancer research demands careful assessment of underlying molecular characteristics for proper data interpretation.
this study provides insights on mirna content of two cell models used for cancer research.
strong evidences suggest that one of them could be a new mirna.
additionally, one new mirna-like molecule with a potential role in cancer was identified in the cell lines and clinical samples.
ten mirnas represented over 70% of the mature molecules present in each of the cell types.
although mir- <dig> has been implicated in cancer development, and evaluated as a biomarker in hnscc progression, no significant expression differences were seen between cell types.
new micrornas were investigated using similarity and structural search, ab initio classification, and prediction of the location of mature micrornas within would-be precursor sequences.
known micrornas were quantified and analyzed in the context of gene regulation.
next generation small rna transcriptomic sequencing data of a tumor cell line and keratinocytes derived from primary culture was generated in order to characterize the microrna content of these systems, thus helping in their understanding.
expression levels of mirnas relate to cell type and tissue context.
