iseerna demonstrates high prediction accuracy and runs several magnitudes faster than other similar programs.
we have implemented iseerna, a support vector machine -based classifier for the identification of lincrnas.
long intergenic non-coding rnas  are emerging as a novel class of non-coding rnas and potent gene regulators.
it can be integrated into the transcriptome data analysis pipelines or run as a web server, thus offering a valuable tool for lincrna study.
