subsequently, the expression patterns of preferentially expressed genes putatively involved in mescaline production were examined and validated by qrt-pcr.
high throughput transcriptome sequencing  analysis allowed us to efficiently identify candidate genes involved in mescaline biosynthetic pathway in l. williamsii; these included tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase, hydroxylases, and o-methyltransferases.
some of the major alkaloids, including mescaline, were identified by gc-ms and relevant metabolic pathways were reconstructed using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database .
in this study, two cdna libraries were generated from l. williamsii.
lophophora williamsii  is a small, spineless cactus with psychoactive alkaloids, particularly mescaline.
