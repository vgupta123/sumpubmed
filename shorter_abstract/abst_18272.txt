an additional analysis of the distribution of putative splice junction to poly distances helped to increase prediction rates by limiting the scanning range.
we discuss the impact of certain regions surrounding the poly sites on prediction rates and contemplate correlating biological mechanisms.
we refined a previously reported method to target 5' splice junctions by incorporating the pyrimidine content of query sequences into a scoring function.
leishmania and other members of the trypanosomatidae family diverged early on in eukaryotic evolution and consequently display unique cellular properties.
