in particular, the highest density of these elements is found in a <dig> euchromatin regions characterized by a high density of small length genes replicating in the early s-phase.
recent emergence of high resolution 3d map of human genome allowed segregating the genome into the large scale chromatin domains of naturally observable nuclear subcompartments, or topologically associated domains , designated by spatial chromatin distribution.
it implies that these elements mediate  or are a side element  of chromatin accessibility.
as a part of comparative genomics section, we elucidated that the dogâ€™s genome non-canonical structure, outstanding in mammals for its high cgis abundance compared to gene number, is explained by the presence of dense tandem cgi extended hotspots  in subtelomeric and pericentromeric regions with highly skewed cg content, and not by cgis global distribution pattern shift.
for the first time it was clearly shown that the clusters density of the alu and cgis monotonically depend on the chromatin accessibility rate.
we elucidated that both methylated and non-methylated cgis display the affinity to chromatin accessibility.
besides cgis in gene promoters, cgis clusters were observed in the homeobox gene regions and in the macrosatellites, but the whole picture of their distribution specifics was not grasped.
we utilized the chromatin map to elucidate relations between large scale chromatin state and cpg rich elements landscape.
the study underlines the close association of cg-rich elements distribution with the newly introduced large scale chromatin state map, proposing a refined standpoint on interrelation of aforementioned genome elements and the chromatin state.
in the course of analysis it was confirmed that genes, alu and cgi clusters maintain obvious, albeit different in strength, preference for open chromatin.
