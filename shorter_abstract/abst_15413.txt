the obtained results are comparable to those published for human medicine and the rate of manual differentiation could be markedly reduced in veterinary laboratories if microscopic examination was used as a validation procedure rather than as a reflexive substitute for automated differentiation.
modern automated haematology instruments are capable of performing leukocyte differentials faster, cheaper and with a higher precision than the traditional 100-cell manual differential count.
thus, in human laboratories, criteria are defined for performing a manual review of the blood smear resulting in a marked reduction of manual differential counts.
while common in human laboratories, this approach to reducing the number of manual differentials in veterinary laboratories is still not commonly performed.
in 21% of canine, 32% of feline and 20% of equine samples, a manual differential was requested.
indistinct separation of the cell population was present in 10% to 15% of the cases.
thus, our aim was to determine the rate and causes of manual leukocyte differentials in a university clinical pathology laboratory using the automated laser-based haematology analyser advia  <dig>  overall,  <dig>  complete blood cell counts from dogs, cats and horses were reviewed.
manual leukocyte differentials were requested if abnormal advia peroxidase and baso cytograms were detected .
