conventional programs identified some sequence motifs, but these are found in less than 5-10% of the total sequence pool.
however, most existing analysis methods require that the binding motifs are enriched in the population relative to earlier rounds, and that motifs are found in a loop or single stranded region of the potential rna secondary structure.
our process accounts for both sequence and structure components by abstracting the overall secondary structure into smaller substructures composed of a single base-pair stack, which allows us to leverage existing approaches already used in k-mer analysis to identify enriched motifs.
by focusing on secondary structure motifs composed of specific two base-pair stacks, we identified significantly enriched or depleted structure motifs relative to earlier rounds.
the structure motifs provide limited accuracy in predicting enrichment suggesting that g. kaustophilus s <dig> can either recognize many different secondary structure motifs or some aspects of the interaction are not captured by the analysis.
discrete substructures are likely to be important to rna-protein interactions, but they are difficult to elucidate.
in this study, we use ht-selex derived populations to study the landscape of rnas that interact with geobacillus kaustophilus ribosomal protein s <dig>  our data show high sequence and structure diversity and proved intractable to existing methods.
this highlights the importance of considering secondary and tertiary structure elements and their role in rna-protein interactions.
