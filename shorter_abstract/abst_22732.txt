moreover, it enables biologists to concentrate on the biological relevance of results, and change the experimental conditions easily.
the whole code and test data are available at https://github.com/southgreenplatform/toggle.
moreover, toggle offers an easy way to manipulate the various options of the different softwares through the pipelines in using a single basic configuration file, which can be changed for each assay without having to change the code itself.
the creation of dedicated, robust and reliable pipelines able to handle dozens of samples from raw fastq data to relevant biological data is a time-consuming task in all projects relying on ngs.
