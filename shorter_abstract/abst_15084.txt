fitness components decreased with time progressively in the h line but not in the d line.
recovery rates of d lines were recorded after every desiccation and did not reveal any trend in time, suggesting that no selection was operating.
if this is true, life in unpredictable habitats should not be seen as the result of competitive exclusion from 'easier' habitats, but a requirement for long-term survival of these parthenogenetic animals.
bdelloids, although aquatic animals, are not only efficient in tolerating desiccation, but seem somehow dependent on anhydrobiosis, a circumstance that might represent a key event in their life cycle.
for both bdelloid species, fecundity was significantly lower in h than in parallel d line.
stress in the form of reiterated desiccations seemed to help both bdelloid species to keep fitness stable; in contrast under stable conditions, like permanent hydration, these bdelloid species had poorer performances.
