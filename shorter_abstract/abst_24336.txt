based on bioinformatic analysis,  <dig> proteins were selected for further study by expressing them in c. burnetii with a c-terminal 3xflag-tag.
tagged proteins expressed by c. burnetii transformants were also found in the soluble fraction of infected vero cells, indicating secretion occurs ex vivo.
mass spectrometry generated a list of  <dig> c. burnetii proteins that could be secreted.
to assess the potential of c. burnetii to secrete proteins into the pv, we analyzed the protein content of modified acidified citrate cysteine medium for the presence of c. burnetii proteins following axenic  growth.
secretion of  <dig> proteins by c. burnetii transformants was confirmed by immunoblotting culture supernatants.
c. burnetii secretes multiple proteins, in vitro and ex vivo, in a sec-dependent manner.
however, additional secretion systems are likely responsible for modification of the pv lumen microenvironment that promote pathogen replication.
these data indicate protein secretion initially requires translocation across the inner-membrane into the periplasm via the activity of the sec translocase.
all secreted proteins contained a signal sequence, and deletion of this sequence from selected proteins abolished secretion.
coxiella burnetii is a gram-negative intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates within a phagolysosome-like parasitophorous vacuole  of macrophages.
pv formation requires delivery of effector proteins directly into the host cell cytoplasm by a type ivb secretion system.
