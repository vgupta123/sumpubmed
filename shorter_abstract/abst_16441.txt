however, docking algorithms propose a number of solutions and it is a challenging task to select the native or near native pose from this pool.
it considers several interface parameters, namely, surface area, evolutionary conservation, hydrophobicity, short contacts and spatial clustering at the interface for scoring.
computational docking permits an early understanding of the feasibility and mode of protein-protein interactions.
the results, on scores and ranks for all the poses, can be downloaded as a csv file and graphical view of the interface of best ranking poses is possible.
we have implemented dockscore in form of a webserver for its use by the scientific community.
the webserver for dockscore is made freely available for the scientific community at: http://caps.ncbs.res.in/dockscore/.
