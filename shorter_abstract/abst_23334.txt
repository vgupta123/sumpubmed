the contour map near r <dig> indicates that substitution of a bulkier and polar group to the ortho position of the benzene ring enhances the inhibitory effect.
p-glycoprotein  is most commonly associated with human mdr; it utilizes energy from adenosine triphosphate  to transport a number of substrates out of cells against concentration gradients.
by the active transport of substrates against concentration gradients, intracellular concentrations of substrates are decreased.
based on contour map information and fragment information, five new molecules with variable r <dig> substituents were designed.
this explains why compounds with a nitro group have good inhibitory potency.
the topomer comfa model showed good correlation between the actual and predicted values for training set molecules.
herein, we report topomer comfa  and hqsar  models for third generation mdr modulators.
the activity of these designed molecules was predicted by the topomer comfa and hqsar models.
fragments analysis showed that the presence of tertiary nitrogen, a central phenyl ring and an aromatic dimethoxy group contributed to the inhibitory effect.
the best hqsar model  with 5- <dig> atom counts was used to predict the activity of test set compounds.
