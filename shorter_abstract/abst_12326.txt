here we report a new flea with transitional characters, pseudopulex tanlan sp.
these new findings further support that fleas had evolved a broad diversity by the early cretaceous.
compared with extant fleas, these large basal fleas have many different features.
nov. might have consumed  <dig>  milliliter  of blood, which is about  <dig> times of the intake volume by extant fleas.
different from the previously described pseudopulicids, p. tanlan has relatively smaller body size but lacking any ctenidia on the tibiae or body, while the male with comparatively smaller and shorter genitalia.
on the other hand, p. tanlan has some characters similar to the transitional fleas of saurophthirids, such as, a small head, short compacted antennae, small pygidium and many stiff setae covering the body.
compared with other reported female flea fossils, we calculate and estimate that p. tanlan sp.
even though other possibilities can not be ruled out, the female specimen with extremely distended abdomen suggests that it might have consumed its last meal before its demise.
