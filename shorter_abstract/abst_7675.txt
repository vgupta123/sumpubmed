we propose a set of genes involved in the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa infection that may be explored to complement human studies.
p. aeruginosa is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human bacterial infections.
however, the genes underlying host susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection are still largely unknown.
a large f <dig> intercross population, obtained by mating p. aeruginosa-resistant c3h/heouj, and susceptible a/j mice, was used for quantitative trait locus  mapping.
the f <dig> progenies were challenged with a p. aeruginosa clinical strain and monitored for the survival time up to 7 days post-infection, as a disease phenotype associated trait.
a significant locus was mapped on chromosome  <dig> and was named p. aeruginosa infection resistance locus  <dig> .

selected phenotypic extremes of the f <dig> distribution were genotyped with high-density single nucleotide polymorphic  markers, and subsequently qtl analysis was performed.
the most promising candidate genes, including dok <dig>  tacr <dig>  cd <dig>  clec4f, gp <dig>  gata <dig>  foxp <dig>  are related to pathogen sensing, neutrophils and macrophages recruitment and inflammatory processes.
as a step towards mapping these genes, we applied a genome wide linkage analysis approach to a mouse model.
the remarkable variability in the clinical outcomes of this infection is thought to be associated with genetic predisposition.
