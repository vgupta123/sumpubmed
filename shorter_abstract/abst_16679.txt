these results suggest that the cyp <dig> gene identified in x. dendrorhous encodes a functional sterol c14-demethylase that is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis.
among these enzymes, the cyp <dig> family, which is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, is one of the most remarkable that has c14-demethylase activity.
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is a basidiomycetous yeast that synthesizes astaxanthin, a carotenoid with great biotechnological impact.
the functionality of this gene was confirmed by heterologous complementation in s. cerevisiae.
furthermore, a cyp <dig> gene mutation in x. dendrorhous reduced sterol production by approximately 40% and enhanced total carotenoid production by approximately 90% compared to the wild-type strain after  <dig> and 120Â h of culture, respectively.
the ergosterol and carotenoid synthetic pathways derive from the mevalonate pathway and involve cytochrome p <dig> enzymes.
additionally, the cyp <dig> gene mutation in x. dendrorhous increased hmgr  and crtr  transcript levels, which could be associated with reduced ergosterol production.
in this study, the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous was isolated and its function was analyzed.
