the identification of expression patterns for both mrna and protein affords a basis for improving biofuel production in this strain and for further genetic manipulations.
the proteins for nitrogenase and the pentose phosphate pathway were highest in the dark, whereas those for glycolysis and the tca cycle were more prominent in the light.
photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and carbon storage relevant genes were expressed during the preceding light or dark period, concurrent with measured nitrogenase activity in the late light period.
the crispr elements were found exclusively at the ends of the large plasmid and we speculate that their presence is crucial to the maintenance of this plasmid.
this investigation of parallel transcriptional and translational activity within cyanothece sp.
we describe many instances of disparity in peak mrna and protein abundances, and strong correlation of light dependent expression of both antisense and crispr-related gene expression.
utilizing transcriptomic and proteomic methods, we quantified the relationships between transcription and translation underlying central and secondary metabolism in response to nitrogen free,  <dig> hour light and  <dig> hour dark conditions.
like other unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterial species, it has a tightly regulated metabolism synchronized to the light–dark cycle.
by combining mass-spectrometry based proteomics and rna-sequencing transcriptomics, we quantitatively measured a total of  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> proteins at four time points across a  <dig> hour light–dark cycle.
pcc  <dig> provided quantitative information on expression levels of metabolic pathways relevant to engineering efforts.
