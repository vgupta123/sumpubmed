there are several tools that allow the exploration of this data, providing different methods to visualize protein network interactions.
we demonstrate the use of pinv with multi-organism interaction networks for a predicted target from mycobacterium tuberculosis, its interacting partners and its orthologs.
we have created a web-based protein interaction network visualizer: pinv, an open source, native web application that facilitates the visualization of protein interactions .
as of october  <dig>  homo sapiens had over  <dig> protein-protein interactions  registered in the interologous interaction database, which is only one of the many public resources where protein interactions can be accessed.
given the advances that web technologies have made recently it is time to bring these interactive views to the web to provide an easily accessible forum to visualize ppi.
