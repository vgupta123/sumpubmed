this new srna has an expression pattern opposite to that of spot  <dig>  and its expression is repressed by glucose.
the gene is ubiquitous in the vibrionaceae family of gamma-proteobacteria.
its genome encodes spot  <dig> with 84% identity to e. coli spot  <dig>
we then used microarray and northern blot analyses to monitor global effects on the transcriptome in order to provide insights into the biological roles of spot  <dig> in this bacterium.
spot  <dig> was discovered in escherichia coli nearly  <dig> years ago as an abundant, small and unstable rna.
in the presence of glucose, we found a surprisingly large number of â‰¥ 2x differentially expressed genes, and several major cellular processes were affected.
spot  <dig> is encoded by the spf gene.
we generated a a. salmonicida spf deletion mutant.
a gene encoding a pirin-like protein showed an on/off expression pattern in the presence/absence of spot  <dig>  which suggests that spot  <dig> plays a key regulatory role in the central metabolism by regulating the switch between fermentation and respiration.
we hypothesize that spot  <dig> plays a key role in the central metabolism, in part by regulating the pyruvat dehydrogenase enzyme complex via pirin.
