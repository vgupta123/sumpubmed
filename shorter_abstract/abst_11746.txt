membrane proteins are influenced by their surrounding lipids.
we investigate the effect of bilayer composition on the membrane transport activity of two members of the small multidrug resistance family; the escherichia coli transporter, emre and the mycobacterium tuberculosis, tbsmr.
phosphatidylethanolamine lipids are native to the membranes of both transporters and also alter the lateral pressure profile of a lipid bilayer.
both emre and tbsmr are found to exhibit a similar dependence on lipid composition, with phosphatidylethanolamine increasing methyl viologen transport.
these findings show that the physical state of the membrane modifies drug transport and that substrate translocation is dependent on in vitro lipid composition.
lipid bilayer lateral pressures affect membrane protein insertion, folding and activity and have been shown to influence reconstitution, topology and activity of membrane transport proteins.
in particular we address the influence of phosphatidylethanolamine and anionic lipids on the activity of these multidrug transporters.
