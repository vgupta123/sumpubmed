nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  is one of the most commonly used organic cofactors in living cells, which plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, storage and regulatory processes.
however, so far an efficient model could not be derived due to the time consuming process of structure determination, and limitations of similarity based approaches.
to provide service to the scientific community, we have developed a user-friendly web server, which is available from url http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nadbinder/.
a support vector machine  based method has been developed using various window lengths of amino acid sequence for predicting nad interacting residues and obtained maximum matthew's correlation coefficient   <dig>  with accuracy  <dig> % at window length  <dig>  we also developed a svm based method using evolutionary information in the form of position specific scoring matrix  and obtained maximum mcc  <dig>  with accuracy  <dig> %.
accurate annotation of their target proteins and binding sites is required for the complete understanding of reaction mechanisms.
attempts have been made to derive a rule for the binding of nad+ to its target proteins.
we extracted  <dig> proteins chains from  <dig> nad binding proteins whose structure is available in protein data bank.
in this study attempts have been made to predict nad binding proteins and their interacting residues  from amino acid sequence using bioinformatics tools.
for the first time a sequence-based method has been developed for the prediction of nad binding proteins and their interacting residues, in the absence of any prior structural information.
