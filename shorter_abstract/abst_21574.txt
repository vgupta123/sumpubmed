both protein and mrna expression of foxp <dig>  a representative marker of tregs, increased in a dose-dependent manner when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with resistin.
at the same time, resistin had no direct effect on the induction of foxp <dig> in cd4+ t cells, suggesting an indirect role through other cells type.
furthermore, foxp <dig> expression is increased in cd4+ t cells when co-cultured with dcs and concomitantly treated with resistin.
however, the mechanism behind the effect of resistin on the expansion of regulatory t cells  remains poorly understood.
since dcs are an important player in the differentiation of t cells, we focused on the role of dcs in the modulation of tregs by resistin.
our results suggest that resistin induces expansion of functional tregs only when co-cultured with dcs.
resistin suppressed the expression of interferon regulatory factor - <dig> and its target cytokines, il- <dig>  il-23p <dig> and il-12p <dig>  in dcs.
