the proliferation and angiogenic activity of dm-msc were severely impaired but significantly improved by pretreatment with oxytocin.
angiogenesis is the main therapeutic mechanism of cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases, but diabetes is reported to reduce the function and number of progenitor cells.
mscs were isolated and cultured from diabetic  or non-diabetic  rat, and proliferation rate was compared.
angiogenic capacity was estimated by tube formation and matrigel plug assay, and therapeutic efficacy was studied in rat myocardial infarction  model.
our results show that diabetes influenced msc by reducing angiogenic capacity and therapeutic potential.
we demonstrate the striking effect of oxytocin on stem cell dysfunction and suggest the use of oxytocin as a priming reagent in autologous stem cell therapy.
in rat mi model, dm-msc injection did not ameliorate cardiac injury, whereas oxytocin-pretreated dm-msc improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis.
