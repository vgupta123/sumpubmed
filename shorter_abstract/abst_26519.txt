through a manual comparison of consensus binding site sequences we have been able to identify a sope in utr sequences of asense-like genes in species belonging to all four arthropod groups .
an increasing number of publications demonstrate conservation of function of cis-regulatory elements without sequence similarity.
a regulatory element, the sensory organ precursor enhancer , is required for this process.
an essential, conserved characteristic of proneural genes is their ability to restrict their own activity to single or a small number of progenitor cells from their initially broad domains of expression.
here we demonstrate the existence of an ancient arthropod regulatory element that functions during the selection of neural precursors.
this is achieved through a process called lateral inhibition.
this would place the origin of this regulatory sequence as far back as the last common ancestor of the arthropoda, that is, in the cambrian,  <dig> million years ago.
the activity of genes of the achaete-scute  family endows cells with neural potential.
in invertebrates such functional conservation has only been shown for closely related species.
