existing frameworks to model this diversity either focus on changes between lineages, neglecting global effects such as mass extinctions, or focus on changes over time which would affect all lineages.
yet it seems probable that both lineages differences and mass extinctions affect the same groups.
overall, we find that lineage shifts are better detected than mass extinctions.
a major open question is the origin of large discrepancies in species number between groups of the same age.
here we used simulations to test the performance of two widely used methods under complex scenarios of diversification.
our results also point toward the need to develop new models of diversification to expand our capabilities to analyse realistic and complex evolutionary scenarios.
this work has significance to assess the methods currently used to estimate changes in diversification using phylogenetic trees.
