we apply our method to cnv regions randomly inserted into the reference mouse genome and show that our method achieves good performance for both detection and reconstruction of tandemly organized de novo cnvs.
copy number variations  have attracted much recent attention due to their effects on gene expression and disease status.
we focus on a special type of cnv, namely tandemly organized de novo cnvs, which have been shown to occur with high frequency in the mouse genome.
the characterization of structural variations  such as insertions, deletions and copy number variations is a critical step in the process of understanding the full genetic architecture of organisms.
