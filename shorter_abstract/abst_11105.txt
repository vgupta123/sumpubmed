campylobacter jejuni is a gastrointestinal pathogen of humans, but part of the normal flora of poultry, and therefore grows well at the respective body temperatures of 37°c and 42°c.
in either single or mixed infections, the mutant was less able to colonize mice than 81– <dig>  the cj <dig> mutant also expressed altered levels of several proteins.
proteomic studies on temperature regulation in c. jejuni strain 81– <dig> revealed the upregulation at 37°c of cj <dig>  a predicted periplasmic chaperone that is similar to proteins involved in outer membrane protein folding and virulence in other bacteria.
a revertant of this mutant was isolated by restoring the gene to its original chromosomal location using streptomycin counterselection.
the cj <dig> mutant strain demonstrated a slightly decreased growth rate and lower final growth yield, yet was more motile and more invasive of human intestinal epithelial cells than wild-type.
mutation of cj <dig> has an effect on phenotypes related to c. jejuni pathogenesis, probably due to its role in the proper folding of critical outer membrane proteins.
