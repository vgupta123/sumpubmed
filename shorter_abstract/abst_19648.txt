in the past, phylogenetic relationships among mollusk classes have been contentious due to the lack of indisputable morphological synapomorphies.
fortunately, recent phylogenetic analyses based on multi-gene data sets are rendering promising results.
phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences showed strong among-lineage rate heterogeneity that produced long-branch attraction biases.
removal of long branches  ameliorated but not fully resolved the problem.
best results in terms of statistical support were achieved when mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data were concatenated.
compared with other mollusks, the relative position of protein-coding genes in the mitochondrial genome of s. ventrolineatus is very similar to those reported for polyplacophora, cephalopoda and early-diverging lineages of bivalvia and gastropoda .
within the latter, cephalopoda was the sister group of gastropoda and bivalvia + scaphopoda.
for mollusks, complete mitochondrial genomes are mostly available for gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods, whereas other less-diverse lineages have few or none reported.
