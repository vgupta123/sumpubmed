analysis using structure based on microsatellite data identified a population in provence  which differed considerably  from populations on the island of corsica and in tuscany in the italian peninsula.
an integrative approach based on microsatellites and mitochondrial and nuclear dna sequences was used to analyze samples taken from a wide area around the tyrrhenian sea and showed how the subspecies evolved from its origins to its most recent form on continental coasts.
this study provides an unusual picture of genetic interaction between termite populations in the tyrrhenian area and suggests that more attention should be paid to the role of introgression and human impact on the recent evolution of european termites.
this new population, principally distributed in urban areas, is highly heterogeneous especially within the its <dig> regions where homogenization by concerted evolution does not appear to have been completed.
