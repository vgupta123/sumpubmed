moreover, our reanalysis of the andamanese-specific lineage m <dig> suggests population specific two clear-cut subclades .
using  <dig> whole mtdna and  <dig> partial coding sequence of indian m lineage selected from  <dig> hvs <dig> sequences across india, we have reconstructed the tree including andamanese-specific lineage m <dig> and calculated the time depth of all the nodes.
macrohaplogroups 'm' and 'n' have evolved almost in parallel from a founder haplogroup l <dig>  macrohaplogroup n in india has already been defined in previous studies and recently the macrohaplogroup m among the indian populations has been characterized.
onge and jarwa share m31a <dig> branch while m31a <dig> clade is present in only great andamanese individuals.
in this study, we attempted to reconstruct and re-evaluate the phylogeny of macrohaplogroup m, which harbors more than 60% of the indian mtdna lineage, and to shed light on the origin of its deep rooting haplogroups.
these deep rooting lineages are not language specific and spread over all the language groups in india.
overall our study supported the one wave, rapid dispersal theory of modern humans along the asian coast.
