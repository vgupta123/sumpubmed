we show that all genes are transcribed and that those ascribed to the host mitochondrial genome are extensively edited at the rna level, as expected for a dinoflagellate mitochondrion-encoded gene.
we also found evidence for extensive recombination in the host mitochondrial genes and that recombination products are also transcribed, as expected for a dinoflagellate.
durinskia baltica and k. foliaceum retain two mitochondria from evolutionarily distinct lineages, and the functions of these organelles are at least partially overlapping, since both express genes for proteins in electron transport.
we have characterized cytochrome c oxidase  <dig> , cytochrome oxidase  <dig> , cytochrome oxidase  <dig> , cytochrome b , and large subunit of ribosomal rna  of endosymbiont mitochondrial ancestry, and cox <dig> and cob of host mitochondrial ancestry.
we show that both host and endosymbiont mitochondrial genomes encode genes for electron transport proteins.
the dinoflagellate host is also reported to retain mitochondrion-like structures, making these cells unique in retaining two evolutionarily distinct mitochondria.
