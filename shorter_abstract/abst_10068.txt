this leads to an inference procedure based on observed length distributions for visible and invisible segments.
the aim is to infer how much dna is deleted at a time, based on segment lengths for alternating deleted  and undeleted  regions.
after deriving a number of analytical results for “one-sided” fractionation, we undertake a series of simulations that help us identify the distribution of segment lengths as a gamma with shape and rate parameters evolving over time.
we propose a new, continuous model of the fractionation process  on the real line.
