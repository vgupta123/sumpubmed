biological sequences play a major role in molecular and computational biology.
an answer to this question benefits formal ontologies that use the notion of biological sequences and analyses in computational biology alike.
the axiom system for the ontology of biological sequences is the first elaborate axiom system for an obo foundry ontology and can serve as starting point for the development of more formal ontologies and ultimately of knowledge-based applications.
we distinguish three distinct kinds of entities that can be referred to as "biological sequence": chains of molecules, syntactic representations such as those in biological databases, and the abstract information-bearing entities.
yet the most basic question about sequences remains unanswered: what kind of entity is a biological sequence?
we provide both an ontological analysis of biological sequences and a formal representation that can be used in knowledge-based applications and other ontologies.
for use in knowledge-based applications and inclusion in biomedical ontologies, we implemented the developed axiom system for use in automated theorem proving.
