however, it remains uncertain whether small rnas are generated from chloroplast genome and how they respond to environmental stress, such as high temperature.
our results reveal that high temperature suppresses the production of some csrnas, which have potential roles in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation.
deep sequencing provided evidence that a novel subset of small rnas were derived from the chloroplast genome of chinese cabbage.
the regulation of some csrnas to the putative target genes were identified by real-time pcr.
some csrnas respond to heat stress by silencing target genes.
we suggest that proper temperature is important for production of chloroplast small rnas, which are associated with plant resistance to abiotic stress.
chinese cabbage is an important vegetable crop, and heat stress usually causes great losses in yields and quality.
in an attempt to determine the heat-responsive small rnas in chloroplast genome of chinese cabbage, we carried out deep sequencing, using heat-treated samples, and analysed the proportion of small rnas that were matched to chloroplast genome.
non-coding small rnas play critical roles in various cellular processes in a wide spectrum of eukaryotic organisms.
several studies in recent years have reported a small number of non-coding small rnas that map to chloroplast genomes.
the chloroplast small rnas  include those derived from mrna, rrna, trna and intergenic rna.
in addition to nucleus, the chloroplast is another important organelle that generates a number of small rnas.
after heat treatment, the abundance of csrnas decreased in seedlings, except those of  <dig> nt in length.
under heat stress, the leaves become etiolated due to the disruption and disassembly of chloroplasts.
many members of csrna families are highly sensitive to heat stress.
