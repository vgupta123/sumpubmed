all brdar genes showed higher expression in flower buds compared to other organs.
taken together, the results of this study indicate that brlim and brdar genes may be involved in resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses in brassica.
in this study, we collected  <dig> lim genes designated as brassica rapa lim  from the brassica database, analyzed the sequences, compared them with lim genes of other plants and analyzed their expression after applying biotic and abiotic stresses in chinese cabbage.
in addition, brwlim2c and brdar <dig> responded to fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
these genes showed distinct clusters when compared to other recognized lim proteins upon phylogenetic analysis.
upon sequence analysis these genes were confirmed as lim genes and found to have a high degree of homology with lim genes of other species.

conglutinans infection, while commonly two brdars and eight brlims responded to cold, aba and ph  stress treatments in chinese cabbage plants.
additionally, organ specific expression of these genes was observed in chinese cabbage plants, with brplim2a, b, c, brdar <dig>  brplim2e, f and g only being expressed in flower buds.
these organ specific expressions were clearly correlated with the phylogenetic grouping.
