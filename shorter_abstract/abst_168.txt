results from this study for the first time highlighted ser <dig> potentially playing an important role in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.
threading approach revealed that the most suitable template to use was the human gastric lipase .
therefore, this study seeks to investigate the structural properties as well as its catalytic mechanism by predicting the three-dimensional  model of the type ii pseudomonas sp.
in addition to this, an extension to the catalytic mechanism was also proposed whereby two tetrahedral intermediates were believed to form during the pha biosynthesis.
the superimposition of the predicted phac1p.sp usm 4– <dig> model with 1hlg covering  <dig> % of the backbone atoms showed an rmsd of  <dig>  Å. the catalytic residues comprising of cys <dig>  asp <dig> and his <dig> were found to be conserved and located adjacent to each other.
the 3d model of the core region of phac1p.sp usm 4– <dig> from residue  <dig> to residue  <dig> was developed using computational techniques and the locations of the catalytic residues were identified.
due to the limited structural information, its functional properties including catalysis are lacking.
these transition state intermediates were further postulated to be stabilized by the formation of oxyanion holes.
based on the sequence analysis and the deduced model, ser <dig> was postulated to contribute to the formation of the oxyanion hole.
the enzyme responsible in catalyzing the formation of pha is pha synthase.
usm 4– <dig> pha synthase  <dig> .
sequence analysis demonstrated that phac1p.sp usm 4– <dig> lacked similarity with all known structures in databases.
