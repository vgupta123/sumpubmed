combined application of atra and tgf-β may shift the th17-treg balance toward tregs, hence facilitating the induction of immunological tolerance after allogenic corneal transplantation and representing a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of posttransplant rejection.
moreover, with the presence of tgf-β, atra upregulated cd4+cd25+foxp3+treg cells and suppressed th <dig> cells in the blood, spleen and draining lymph nodes of recipient mice, as well as enhanced the foxp <dig> expression and inhibited the rorγt expression in grafts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
simultaneously, increased number of foxp3+ cells and decreased number of il-17+ cells in conjunctiva were found in recipients with mixed treatment, along with reduced il- <dig> level in serum and aqueous humor and increased il- <dig> level in aqueous humor.
all-trans retinoid acid  has been proven to skew regulatory t cell-t helper  <dig> cell  balance toward treg in vitro, favoring graft acceptance.
tregs isolated from recipient mice treated with atra + tgf-β presented the strongest suppressive activity in vitro.

balb/c mice were given orthotopic corneal grafts from c57bl/ <dig> donors, and recipient mice were administered with atra, tgf-β, and the combination of both agents for 8 weeks after surgery.
we found that a mixed treatment of atra and tgf-β significantly promoted graft survival.
however, its in vivo effect after solid organ transplantation is under investigation.
