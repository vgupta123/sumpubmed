the induction of most of the genes is delayed during growth of p. aeruginosa in complex medium, cannot be advanced by addition of exogenous signal, and requires additional regulatory components.
we determined the effect on target gene expression by microarray and real-time pcr analysis.
our results show that many target genes  are directly responsive to receptor protein levels.
the direct responsiveness of many quorum sensing target genes to receptor protein levels early in growth confirms the role of super-regulation in quorum sensing gene expression.
the observation that the induction of most target genes is not affected by signal or receptor protein levels indicates that either target promoters are co-regulated by other transcription factors, or that expression is controlled posttranscriptionally.
the majority of promoters advanced by rhlr appeared to be regulated directly, which allowed us to build a rhlr consensus sequence.
many of these late genes can be induced by addition of signals early by using specific media conditions.
quorum-sensing regulation of gene expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa is complex.
to better understand the contributions of super-regulation and co-regulation to quorum-sensing gene expression, and to better understand the general structure of the quorum sensing network, we ectopically expressed the two receptors  and another component that affects quorum sensing, the stationary phase sigma factor rpos, early in growth.
