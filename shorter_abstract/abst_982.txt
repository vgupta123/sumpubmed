our study will extend our knowledge of bryophyte transcriptomes and provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms related to rehydration and desiccation-tolerance.
first, a total of  <dig>  transcript assembly contigs  were obtained from  <dig>  million reads by de novo assembly, with an average length of 863 bp and n <dig> of  <dig>  bp.
among the reconstructed tacs,  <dig>   revealed similarity with existing protein sequences in the public databases.
the desiccation-tolerant moss bryum argenteum is an important component of the biological soil crusts  found in the gurbantunggut desert.
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to desiccation tolerance, we employed rna-seq and digital gene expression  technologies to study the genome-wide expression profiles of the dehydration and rehydration processes in this important desert plant.
in this study, we constructed a pioneering, high-quality reference transcriptome in b. argenteum and generated three dge libraries to elucidate the changes of gene expression upon rehydration.
expression profiles consistent with the rapid recovery of photosynthesis  and the re-establishment of a positive carbon balance following rehydration  were observed.
we applied a two-step approach to investigate the gene expression profile upon rehydration in the moss bryum argenteum using illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing platform.

go function enrichment network, ekgg metabolic pathway and mapman analysis supports the idea of the rapid recovery of photosynthesis after 24 h of rehydration.
desiccation tolerance is defined as the ability to revive from the air dried state.
