first, the average length or size distribution of elements in each superfamily is largely conserved, with the shortest always being tc1/mariner elements, followed by pif/harbinger, hat, mutator and cacta.
we have focused on noncoding elements because of their abundance, and compared superfamily copy number, size and genomic distribution as well as correlation with the level of nearby gene expression.
this order also holds for the ratio of the copy numbers of noncoding to coding elements.
comparative analysis of this robust dataset led to the identification of several previously unknown features of each superfamily related to copy number, element size, genomic distribution and correlation with the expression levels of nearby genes.
these results highlight the importance of distinguishing te superfamilies when assessing their impact on gene and genome evolution.
we have achieved the most comprehensive annotation of class  <dig> tes to date in these four grass genomes.

in contrast, genes with cacta elements have significantly lower expression than genes without class  <dig> tes.
finally, our analysis of microarray data revealed that genes associated with tc1/mariner and pif/harbinger noncoding elements have significantly higher expression levels than genes without class  <dig> tes.
to ensure consistent comparative analyses, we re-annotated class  <dig> tes in brachypodium distachyon, oryza sativa , sorghum bicolor and zea mays and assigned them to one of the five cut-and-paste superfamilies found in plant genomes .
using the complete sequences of four grasses, we have performed a novel comparative analysis of class  <dig> tes.
class  <dig> transposable elements  are the predominant elements in and around plant genes where they generate significant allelic diversity.
