here we present clinical pathoscope, a pipeline to rapidly and accurately remove host contamination, isolate microbial reads, and identify potential disease-causing pathogens.
second, we have demonstrated the ability of our approach to identify multiple pathogens in a single clinical sample, accurately identify pathogens at the subspecies level, and determine the nearest phylogenetic neighbor of novel or highly mutated pathogens using real clinical sequencing data.
furthermore, clinical pathoscope does not rely on genome assembly and thus can more rapidly complete the analysis of a clinical sample when compared with current assembly-based methods.
we have accomplished three essential tasks in the development of clinical pathoscope.
finally, we have shown that clinical pathoscope outperforms previously published pathogen identification methods with regard to computational speed, sensitivity, and specificity.
clinical pathoscope is the only pathogen identification method currently available that can identify multiple pathogens from mixed samples and distinguish between very closely related species and strains in samples with very few reads per pathogen.
clinical pathoscope is freely available at:
however, these samples contain genomic sequences from various sources that complicate the identification of pathogens.
first, we developed an optimized framework for pathogen identification using a computational subtraction methodology in concordance with read trimming and ambiguous read reassignment.
