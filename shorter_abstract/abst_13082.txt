we recommend using the newly constructed dh <dig> pcr system on the f <dig> gene as the primary confirmatory test for pcr positives, but should it fail due to its lower sensitivity, the dh <dig> and dh <dig> pcr systems should be used.
the pcr system on f <dig> did not elicit any false positives and was only slightly less sensitive than our primary is900-system.
as described here, two new real-time pcr systems on the is <dig> gene and one on the f <dig> gene were developed and carefully validated on  <dig> strains and  <dig> positive clinical faecal samples.
our confirmatory pcr systems on is <dig> were found sensitive and specific, only yielding weak false positive reactions in one strain for each system.
dna from both naturally infected and spiked faeces that tested positive with our primary system could be confirmed with all new systems, except one low-level infected sample that tested negative with the f <dig> system.
