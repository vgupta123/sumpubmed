in this work, c. burnetii isolates from livestock and ticks were typed using infrequent restriction site-pcr  and multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats  analysis .
coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of q fever, has a wide host range.
the consistency of the results with independent methods suggests that mlva can be applied for epidemiological studies.
two panels of markers are proposed, panel  <dig> which can be confidently typed on agarose gel at a lower cost and in any laboratory setting , and panel  <dig> which comprises  <dig> microsatellites and provides a higher discriminatory power.
by applying irs-pcr,  <dig> c. burnetii isolates could be divided into six groups containing up to five different isolates.
mlva was then applied to  <dig> additional c. burnetii isolates of different origin and  <dig> different genotypes were identified among the  <dig> isolates investigated.
