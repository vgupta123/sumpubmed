the longitudinal groove, which could be clearly identified at all examination sites because it appeared as a triangular notch, formed the ventral margin of the dorsal sac of the rumen.
the dorsal sac of the rumen was largest at the caudal flank , where it was adjacent to the abdominal wall.
the height of the ventral sac of the rumen exceeded that of the dorsal sac at all examination sites; the maximum height was measured at the 12th intercostal space .
the rumen could be imaged from the right side in  <dig> cows .
the dorsal gas cap, characterised ultrasonographically by typical reverberation artifacts, was visible in all cows from the 12th intercostal space to the caudal flank.
the transition from the gas cap to the fibre mat was marked by the abrupt cessation of the reverberation artifacts.
it was not possible to differentiate a fibre mat and a ventral fluid phase.
the reference values obtained from this study add to the diagnostic tools that are available for the assessment of bovine patients.
it was furthest from the dorsal midline at the 9th intercostal space  and closest at the 12th intercostal space .
it was largest at the 12th intercostal space .
the ventral sac of the rumen extended across the ventral midline into the right hemiabdomen and its ventral margin had a largely horizontal craniocaudal course.
this study describes the ultrasonographic findings of the rumen in  <dig> healthy dairy cows.
