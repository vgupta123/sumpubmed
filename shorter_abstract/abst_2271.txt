considerable attention has been paid to actinomycetes, especially the secondary metabolites obtained from streptomyces species, as the best alternatives to chemicals as biological control agents for polyphagous pests such as helicoverpa armigera and spodoptera litura.
ap- <dig> exhibited significant antifeedant, larvicidal and growth inhibitory activities against polyphagous pests.
on the basis of their novel biocontrol attributes, novel polyketide metabolite isolated from marine streptomyces sp.
the polyketide metabolite presented significant antifeedant activities against h. armigera  and s. litura  at  <dig> ppm concentration.
the metabolite also exhibited high larvicidal activities against h. armigera  and s. litura  and the lc <dig> values were  <dig>  ppm for h. armigera and  <dig>  ppm for s. litura.
the activities of the polyketide metabolite were concentration dependent for both the insects therefore it could be used as an agent to prepare new pesticidal formulations.
