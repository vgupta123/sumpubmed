the l1l <dig> pipeline has proven effective in terms of marker selection and prediction accuracy.
model and snp markers are selected through a dap originally developed in the maqc-ii collaborative initiative of the u.s. fda for the identification of clinical biomarkers from microarray data.
it is however essential that stringent and well documented data analysis protocols  are used to control sources of variability and ensure reproducibility of results.
machine learning approaches to genotype-phenotype mapping may significantly improve genome-wide association studies  results by explicitly focusing on predictivity and optimal feature selection in a multivariate setting.
algebraic indicators of stability of partial lists are used for model selection; the final panel of markers is obtained by a procedure at the chromosome scale, termed ’saturation’, to recover snps in linkage disequilibrium with those selected.
the method gives at the same time a regression model and a dimensionality reduction procedure suitable for correlated features.
this study indicates that machine learning techniques may support quantitative phenotype prediction, provided that adequate daps are employed to control bias in model selection.
quantitative phenotypes emerge everywhere in systems biology and biomedicine due to a direct interest for quantitative traits, or to high individual variability that makes hard or impossible to classify samples into distinct categories, often the case with complex common diseases.
