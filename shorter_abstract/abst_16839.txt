the minimal anaesthetic doses obtained were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for groups s, ks, and kds, respectively.
ketamine alone or in combination with diazepam promoted a good quality of sedation, which improved handling and reduced the stress of the birds.
the heart rate , respiratory rate , systolic arterial blood pressure , and cloacal temperature  were recorded before premedication , 15 minutes after premedication , and after mad determination .
there were no differences in the quality of intubation and recovery from anaesthesia among the three groups, although the induction time was significantly shorter in the pre-medicated groups, and the ks group showed less muscle relaxation.
premedication is rarely used in avian species.
all protocols provided safe anaesthesia in this avian species.
thirty-six adult parrots were randomly distributed in three groups: group s  was premedicated with nacl  <dig> %; group ks  was premedicated with 10 mg.kg- <dig> ketamine; and group kds  was premedicated with 10 mg.kg- <dig> ketamine and  <dig>  mg.kg- <dig> diazepam, delivered intramuscularly.
we hypothesised that premedication would facilitate handling and decrease the minimum anaesthetic dose .
there were no differences in hr, rr, or ct among groups, but sap was significantly lower in group s. sedation was observed in both the premedicated s-ks and s-kds groups.
