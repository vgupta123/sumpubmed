here, we report a draft reference genome of a major crop pathogen albugo candida  with an estimated genome of  <dig>  mb.
this is very similar to the genome size of a necrotrophic oomycete pythium ultimum  but less than half that of h. arabidopsidis .
most intriguingly, a. candida appears to have a much smaller repertoire of pathogenicity-related proteins than h. arabidopsidis including genes that encode rxlr effector proteins, crinkler-like genes, and elicitins.
albugo candida has a comparatively small genome amongst oomycetes, retains motility of sporangial inoculum, and harbours a much smaller repertoire of candidate effectors than was recently reported for h. arabidopsidis.
albugo candida is a biotrophic oomycete that parasitizes various species of brassicaceae, causing a disease  with remarkable convergence in behaviour to unrelated rusts of basidiomycete fungi.
sequencing of a. candida transcripts from infected host tissue and zoosporangia combined with genome-wide annotation revealed  <dig>  predicted genes.
necrosis and ethylene inducing peptides were not detected in the genome of a. candida.
