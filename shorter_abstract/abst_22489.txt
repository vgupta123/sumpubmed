our method increases experimental reproducibility and decreases variability of quantitations of peptides assigned to the same protein.
we recommend to use this method if quantitation is a major objective of research.
recent development of novel technologies paved the way for quantitative proteomics.
regarding the increasing importance of quantitative proteomics we think that this method will be useful in practical applications like model fitting or functional enrichment analysis.
we have developed peptide profiling guided identification of proteins , a statistical analysis workflow for itraq data addressing the problem of ambiguous peptide quantitations.
despite large progress in technology development, still many challenges remain for derivation and interpretation of quantitative results.
making use of quantitative properties of signal patterns identified, ppinguin can reveal new isoform candidates.
motivated by the assumption that peptides uniquely derived from the same protein are correlated, our method employs clustering as a very early step in data processing prior to protein inference.
