these results will improve our understanding of the biology of growth and body composition in cattle.
in general, more qtl were identified in analyses with bigger sample sizes.
we performed a series of genome-wide association studies  using 50Â k genotypes scored in  <dig>  animals from  <dig> us beef cattle breeds with observations for twelve body weights, calving ease and carcass traits.
this largest gwas ever performed in beef cattle, led us to discover several novel across-breed and breed-specific large-effect pleiotropic qtl that cumulatively account for a significant percentage of additive genetic variance .
some identified qtl regions harbor genes known to have large effects on a variety of traits in cattle such as plag <dig> and mstn and others harbor promising candidate genes including ncapg, arrdc <dig>  ergic <dig>  sh3pxd2b, hmga <dig>  msrb <dig>  lemd <dig>  tigar, sept <dig>  and kirrel <dig>  gene ontology analysis revealed that genes involved in ossification and in adipose tissue development were over-represented in the identified pleiotropic qtl.
also, the mapk signaling pathway was identified as a common pathway affected by the genes located near the pleiotropic qtl.
several breed-specific large-effect pleiotropic or closely linked qtl were also identified.
the availability of high-density snp assays including the bovinesnp <dig>  enables the identification of novel quantitative trait loci  and improvement of the resolution of the locations of previously mapped qtl.
