to test the performance of extremely low-coverage wgs  in populations with a complex history and to provide a reference resource for south indian populations, we performed exl-wgs on  <dig> south indian individuals from eight populations to ~ <dig> x coverage.
however, the performance of low coverage wgs in populations with a complex history and no reference panel remains to be determined.
south indian populations are known to have a complex population structure and are an example of a major population group that lacks adequate reference panels.
using two variant discovery pipelines, snptools and gatk, we generated a consensus call set that has ~90% sensitivity for identifying common variants .
the cost of whole genome sequencing  has decreased tremendously in recent years due to advances in next-generation sequencing technologies.
