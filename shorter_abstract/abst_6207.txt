human iecs  grown in the upper chamber of transwell filters were co-cultured with intestinal-like human dcs grown in the basolateral compartment of the transwells.
the system was apically exposed for 4 h to live probiotic l. paracasei cncm i- <dig> obtained from the faeces of breastfed infants or to its cell-free culture supernatant  and challenged with salmonella typhi.
peripheral dcs and murine dcs differ from human gut dcs, and to date there are no data on the action of any probiotic on co-cultured human iecs and human intestinal dcs.
the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the basolateral compartment was determined by immunoassay, and the dc expression pattern of  <dig> tlr signaling pathway genes was analysed by pcr array.
to address this issue, a novel transwell model was used.
the presence of the live probiotic alone significantly increased il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  rantes and ip- <dig> levels and decreased il-12p <dig>  il- <dig>  tgf- β <dig> and mip-1α levels.
this induction was correlated with an overall decrease in the expression of all tlr genes except tlr <dig>  which was strongly up-regulated.
the data presented here clearly indicate that l. paracasei cncm i- <dig> significantly increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhances tlr signaling pathway activation and stimulates rather than suppresses the innate immune system.
the action of probiotics has been studied in vitro in cells isolated from both mice and humans, particularly enterocytes , dendritic cells  and co-cultures of peripheral dcs and iecs.
