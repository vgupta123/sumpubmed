it is revealed that knockout of iclr significantly increased expressions of acebak operon.
knockout of iclr significantly increased gene expression of acebak operon and concomitantly activated glyoxylate pathway.
the acetate concentrations were decreased by more than 50% and the productions of pg and 3hp were increased more than twice in iclr mutants.
the effects of iclr knockout on cell physiology, cell metabolism and production of acetyl-coa-derived chemicals were similar to those of arca knockout in our previous study.
the cell yields and glucose utilization efficiencies were higher than those of control strains.
however, acetate overflow is the major drawback for acetyl-coa-derived chemicals production.
this genetic modification may be a good way to overcome acetate overflow, and improve the production of a wide range of acetyl-coa-derived chemicals.
in this study, a transcriptional regulator iclr was knocked out in e.coli bl <dig> to overcome acetate overflow and improve the chemicals production.
acetyl-coa-derived chemicals are suitable for multiple applications in many industries.
approaches for overcoming acetate overflow may be beneficial for the production of acetyl-coa-derived chemicals.
