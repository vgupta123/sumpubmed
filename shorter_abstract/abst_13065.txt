among those, structure based virtual screening  approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds.
the modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs:  fpocket, to perform pocket identification,  tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and  dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins.
fpocket is written in the c programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level.
for sbvs, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces.
fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package qhull.
fpocket is freely available under the gnu gpl license at .
