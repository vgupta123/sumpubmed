the goals of these analyses were to identify genes and physiological pathways that establish cotton stems and roots as physiological sinks and investigate the role these pathways play in cotton development during seed set.
starch accumulation observed in young field-grown plants was not observed in greenhouse grown plants.
starch accumulated along the length of the stem and the shape and size of the starch grains from stems were easily distinguished from transient starch.
the pathway for starch utilization after flowering was associated with an increase in expression of a glucan water dikinase gene as has been implicated in utilization of transient starch.
analysis of field-grown cotton plants indicated that starch levels peaked about the time of first anthesis and then declined similar to reports in greenhouse-grown cotton plants.
microarray analyses compared gene expression in tissues containing low levels of starch with tissues rapidly accumulating starch.
a suite of genes associated with starch biosynthesis was identified.
statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated increased expression among genes associated with starch synthesis, starch degradation, hexose metabolism, raffinose synthesis and trehalose synthesis.
the anticipated changes in these sugars were largely confirmed by measuring soluble sugars in selected tissues.
cotton is a perennial plant that stores starch in stems and roots to provide carbohydrates for growth in subsequent seasons.
cotton  is an important crop worldwide that provides fiber for the textile industry.
