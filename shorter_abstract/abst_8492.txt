studies to date have focused on competitive interactions within pathogen species, and the level of antagonism tends to increase with the genetic distance between competitors.
here, using two pathogen species that are frequently found in sympatry, we investigated whether the antagonism seen among genotypes of the same species cascades up to influence competition among pathogen species.
we show evidence that competitive exclusion during infection can be greater among closely related pathogen species than among genotypes within species.
for systems where related pathogen species frequently co-occur in the same host populations, these competitive dynamics may substantially impact the spatial segregation of pathogen species.
this pattern follows from prior studies demonstrating that genetic distance and antagonistic interactions are positively correlated in microbotryum.
fungal vegetative incompatibility is a likely mechanism of direct competitive interference, and has been shown in some fungi to be effective both within and across species boundaries.
anther-smut fungi, in the genus microbotryum, have emerged as a tractable model for within-host competition.
sequential inoculation of hosts showed that a resident infection most often excludes a challenging pathogen genotype, which is consistent with prior studies.
however, the challenging pathogen was significantly more likely to invade the already-infected host if the resident infection was a conspecific genotype compared to challenges involving a closely related species.
