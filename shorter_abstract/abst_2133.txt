pplook is freely available for non-commercial users at http://meta.usc.edu/softs/pplook.
pplook can also provide the functions of selecting protein semantic class, counting the number of semantic class proteins which interact with query protein, counting the literature number of articles appearing the interaction relationship about the query protein.
extracting and visualizing of protein-protein interaction  from text literatures are a meaningful topic in protein science.
we developed a ppi search system, termed pplook, which automatically extracts and visualizes protein-protein interaction  from text.
there is a lack of tools to extract ppi, visualize and classify the results.
given a query protein name, pplook can search a dataset for other proteins interacting with it by using a keywords dictionary pattern-matching algorithm, and display the topological parameters, such as the number of nodes, edges, and connected components.
the visualization component of pplook enables us to view the interaction relationship among the proteins in a three-dimensional space based on the opengl graphics interface technology.
moreover, pplook provides heterogeneous search and a user-friendly graphical interface.
