romiplostim, a novel thrombopoietin receptor  agonist, is currently used for the treatment of refractory itp in humans, but not in dogs.
here, we describe the response to romiplostim in five dogs with refractory itp.
five dogs with severe and refractory itp  received romiplostim subcutaneously.
this finding may help to develop and use new therapeutics for itp in dogs and humans.
romiplostim was well-tolerated and administration was associated with an increase in platelet counts in all five dogs.
