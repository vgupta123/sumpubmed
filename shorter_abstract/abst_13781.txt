easydas is an open source project under the gnu lgpl license.
although there are more than  <dig> active registered servers from around  <dig> organizations, setting up a das server comprises a fair amount of work, making it difficult for many research groups to share their biological annotations.
the distributed annotation system  has proven to be a successful way to publish and share biological data.
easydas is an automated das source creation system which can help many researchers in sharing their biological data, potentially increasing the amount of relevant biological data available to the scientific community.
the created sources are hosted on the ebi systems and can take advantage of its high storage capacity and network connection, freeing the data provider from any network management work.
given the clear advantage that the generalized sharing of relevant biological data is for the research community it would be desirable to facilitate the sharing process.
