r <dig> and r <dig> were purified by affinity chromatography from ae.
in addition, a protein with molecular mass of  <dig> kda was purified by affinity chromatography from the midgut extracts.
dengue viruses  attach to the host cell surface and subsequently enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
both proteins were bound by all four serotypes of dengue virus.
our results strongly suggest that r <dig> and r <dig> are receptors for the four serotypes of dengue virus in the midgut cells of ae.
overlay protein binding assay showed two proteins with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda .
specific antibodies against these two proteins inhibited cell binding and infection.
determination of which of them serve as bona fide receptors for this virus in the vector may be relevant to treating denv infection and in designing control strategies.
