in quantitative proteomic analysis, reductive di-methylation of primary amines using stable isotopic formaldehyde variants is increasingly used due to its robustness and cost-effectiveness.
in the present study we show for the first time that isotopic amine dimethylation can be used in a straightforward manner for the quantitative proteomic analysis of ffpe specimens without interference from formalin employed in the ffpe process.
our study establishes isotopic amine dimethylation as a versatile tool for quantitative proteomic analysis of ffpe specimens and underlines proteome alterations in ccrcc.
isotopic amine dimethylation of ffpe specimens showed equal labeling efficiency as for cryopreserved specimens.
in an initial application, we profiled proteome changes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma  ffpe tissue specimens compared to adjacent nonâ€“malignant renal tissue.
for both ffpe and cryopreserved specimens, differential labeling of identical samples yielded highly similar ratio distributions within the expected range for dimethyl labeling.
our findings highlight increased levels of glyocolytic enzymes, annexins as well as ribosomal and proteasomal proteins.
