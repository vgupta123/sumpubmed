most cells in murine striate cortex receive excitatory inputs from both uv- and m-cones.
one type  had little to no spontaneous activity and responded at either the on and/or the off phase of the light stimulus with a few impulses often of relatively large amplitude.
single cells responded to these diffuse stimuli in all areas of striate cortex.
cells that could underlie chromatic contrast detection are present but extremely rare in murine striate cortex.
a second type  had spontaneous activity and responded tonically to light stimuli with impulses often of small amplitude.
most of the cells responded similarly to both spectral stimuli.
we have recorded responses from single neurons in murine visual cortex to determine the effectiveness of the input from the two murine cone photoreceptor mechanisms and whether there is any unique selectivity for cone inputs at this higher region of the visual system that would support the possibility of colour vision in mice.
a small fraction shows either strong selectivity for one or the other cone mechanism and occasionally cone opponent responses.
