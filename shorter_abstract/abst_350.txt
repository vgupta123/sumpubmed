to evaluate the appropriate depth needed for mrna profiling, a random sampling method was used to generate different number of reads from each sample.
the objective of this analysis is to evaluate what sequencing depth might be sufficient to interrogate gene expression profiling in the chicken by rna-seq.
with continued improvement in sequence output, it would be cost-effective if multiple samples are multiplexed and sequenced in a single lane with sufficient transcriptome coverage.
the correlation coefficients of gene expression between technical replicates within the same sample were  <dig>  and  <dig> .
there was a significant increase in correlation coefficients from a sequencing depth of  <dig>  m to  <dig> m for all genes except highly abundant genes.
rna-seq is the recently developed high-throughput sequencing technology for profiling the entire transcriptome in any organism.
with significant improvements in sequencing technology, two technical replicate cdna libraries were re-sequenced.
no significant improvement was observed from the depth of  <dig> m to  <dig> m  reads.
furthermore, the depth of sequencing had a significant impact on measuring gene expression of low abundant genes.
two cdna libraries from chicken lungs were sequenced initially, and  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  m  reads were generated, respectively.
the analysis from the current study demonstrated that  <dig> m  reads is sufficient to detect all annotated genes in chicken lungs.
ten million  reads could detect about 80% of annotated chicken genes, and rna-seq at this depth can serve as a replacement of microarray technology.
finally, the combination of experimental and simulation approaches is a powerful approach to address the relationship between the depth of sequencing and transcriptome coverage.
