however, little is known about specific pathways regulated by mirna during lung development.
in silico analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis  identified specific pathways and networks known to be targets of these mirnas which are important to lung development.
mirnas are differentially regulated across time and between sexes during the canalicular and saccular stages of lung development.
sex-associated differential mirna expression may regulate the differences in structural and functional male and female lung development, as shown by networks generated using in silico analysis.
these data provide a valuable resource to further enhance the understanding of mirna control of lung development and maturation.
pathways targeted by gestation-regulated mirnas include vegfa and mediators of glucose metabolism.
between the canalicular and saccular stages of the developing lung several important cellular events occur, including the onset of surfactant synthesis, microvascular remodeling and structural preparation for subsequent alveolarization.
micrornas play important roles in regulating biological processes, including organ morphogenesis and maturation.
