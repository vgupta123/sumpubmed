even though  <dig> pyrosequencing is not a panacea, it allows for more comprehensive insights into the diversity of protistan communities, and combined with appropriate statistical tools, enables improved ecological interpretations of the data and projections of global diversity.
we detected a substantial number of taxonomic groups like apusozoa, chrysomerophytes, centroheliozoa, eustigmatophytes, hyphochytriomycetes, ichthyosporea, oikomonads, phaeothamniophytes, and rhodophytes which remained undetected by previous clone library-based diversity surveys of the sampling sites.
this study illustrates that our current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, and of the global species richness and genome diversity of protists, is severely limited.
both sampling sites have previously been scrutinized for protistan diversity by traditional clone library construction and sanger sequencing.
our data highlight the magnitude of the under-sampled 'protistan gap' in the eukaryotic tree of life.
two major paradigm-shifting discoveries include the detection of bacterial diversity that is one to two orders of magnitude greater than previous estimates, and the discovery of an exciting 'rare biosphere' of molecular signatures  of poorly understood ecological significance.
we applied a high-throughput parallel tag sequencing  protocol adopted for eukaryotes to investigate protistan community complexity in two contrasting anoxic marine ecosystems .
recent advances in sequencing strategies make possible unprecedented depth and scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity.
we here present a novel, highly conservative bioinformatic analysis pipeline for the processing of large tag sequence data sets.
<dig>  sequence reads revealed that the number of detected operational taxonomic units  far exceeded previous richness estimates from the same sites based on clone libraries and sanger sequencing.
