affected animals had elevated plasma creatine phosphokinase  levels before and immediately after isoflurane challenge and cardiac arrhythmias.
a pedigree containing  <dig> pigs, including  <dig> affected animals, was genotyped with the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip and only one chromosomal region, sscx at  <dig> - <dig>  mb over the dystrophin gene , was significantly associated with the syndrome.
immunoblots of affected heart and skeletal muscle showed a dramatic reduction of dystrophin protein and histopathology of affected hearts indicated muscle fiber degeneration.
a novel stress syndrome was characterized in pigs and the causative genetic factor most likely resides within dmd that results in less dystrophin protein and cardiac abnormalities that can lead to death under stressful conditions.
animals from additional litters were identified as having a stress response, sometimes resulting in death, during regular processing and weighing.
an arginine to tryptophan  polymorphism in exon  <dig> of dmd was the most significant marker associated with stress susceptibility.
at 8 weeks of age, heart rate and electrocardiographs  were monitored during isoflurane anesthesia challenge .
we identified two sibling barrows in the usmarc swine herd that died from apparent symptoms of a stress syndrome after transport at 12 weeks of age.
this defect also provides a unique biomedical model for human cardiomyopathy associated with muscular dystrophy that may be superior to those available because of the similarities in anatomy and physiology and allow advances in gene therapies for human disease.
