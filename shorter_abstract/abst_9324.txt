antimicrobial peptides are present in animals, plants and microorganisms and play a fundamental role in the innate immune response.
gomesin is a cationic antimicrobial peptide purified from haemocytes of the spider acanthoscurria gomesiana.
therefore, data presented in this study reinforces the potential of gomesin as a therapeutic antifungal agent in both humans and animals.
in this study, we evaluate the efficacy of gomesin treatment on disseminated and vaginal candidiasis as well as its toxicity and biodistribution.
candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is part of the human microbiota.
treatment with gomesin effectively reduced candida albicans in the kidneys, spleen, liver and vagina of infected mice.
gomesin proved to be effective against experimental candida albicans infection.
gomesin's mechanism is not fully understood, but we hypothesise that the peptide acts through the permeabilisation of the yeast membrane leading to death and/or releasing the yeast antigens that trigger the host immune response against infection.
the typical treatment for this mycosis comprises three major categories of antifungal drugs: polyenes, azoles and echinocandins; however cases of resistance to these drugs are frequently reported.
it has a broad-spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and tumour cells.
