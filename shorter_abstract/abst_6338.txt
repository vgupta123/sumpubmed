the recombinant proteins of paz and pola were subsequently overexpressed in e. coli and used for protein crystallization.
we demonstrate, by using paz and pola as examples, the feasibility of integrating the gene synthesis, error correction and subcloning techniques into a non-automated gene to crystal pipeline such that genes can be designed, synthesized and implemented for recombinant expression and protein crystallization.
a pcr-based gene synthesis method, referred to as seqtbio, is described to efficiently assemble the coding regions of two novel hyperthermophilic proteins, paz  domain, a sirna-binding domain of an argonaute protein homologue and a deletion mutant of a family a dna polymerase .
gene synthesis technologies are an important tool for structural biology projects, allowing increased protein expression through codon optimization and facilitating sequence alterations.
the gene synthesis procedure is based on sequential assembly such that homogeneous dna products can be obtained after each synthesis step without extensive manipulation or purification requirements.
coupling the gene synthesis procedure to in vivo homologous recombination techniques allows efficient subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis for error correction.
