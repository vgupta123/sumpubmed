we find significant association of mars with the origins of replication, transcription start sites, paused rna polymerase ii sites and exons, but not introns, of highly expressed genes.
we also identified sequence motifs and repeats that constitute mars.
this process is facilitated by the structural framework of nuclear matrix, a nucleo-proteinaceous meshwork.

our data reveal the contact points of genome to the nuclear architecture and provide a link between nuclear functions and genomic packaging.
