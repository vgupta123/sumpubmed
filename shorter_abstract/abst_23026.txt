once localized to presynaptic boutons, net does not recycle via vmat2-positive, small dense core vesicles.
our findings support the hypothesis that scg net is segregated prior to transport from the cell body from proteins comprising large dense core vesicles.
we present evidence that axonal net extensively colocalizes with syntaxin 1a, and to a limited degree with scamp <dig> and synaptophysin.
at the surface of scg boutons, net resides in both lipid raft and non-lipid raft subdomains and colocalizes with syntaxin 1a.
finally, once net reaches presynaptic plasma membranes, the transporter localizes to syntaxin 1a-rich plasma membrane domains, with a portion found in cholera toxin-demarcated lipid rafts.
moreover, net is localized in presynaptic membranes in a manner that can take advantage of regulatory processes targeting lipid raft subdomains.
our findings indicate that activity-dependent insertion of net into the scg plasma membrane derives from vesicles distinct from those that deliver ne.
intracellular net in scg axons and boutons also quantitatively segregates from the vesicular monoamine transporter  <dig> , findings corroborated by organelle isolation studies.
