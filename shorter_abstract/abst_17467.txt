esterification of starch with fatty acids has traditionally been monitored by saponification and back-titration, but in our experience this method is unreliable.
the method was used to monitor the enzymatic esterification of different starches with decanoic acid, using lipase from thermomyces lanuginosus.
natural polysaccharides such as starch are becoming increasingly interesting as renewable starting materials for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers using chemical or enzymatic methods.
lipase-catalysed esterification of starch is feasible in aqueous gel systems, but attention to analytical methods is important to obtain correct ds values.
