hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.
furthermore, an updated integrated map with  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps,  <dig>  traditional markers and  <dig>  bin markers was constructed.
map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed.

moreover, in this population combined with the ibm syn <dig> ril population, we detected  <dig> qtls for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations.
the data were deposited into the iplant discovery environment , which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.
our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community.
eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a  <dig> – <dig>  mb interval.
an updated ibm syn <dig> population and a reliable, verified high-quality snp set between mo <dig> and b <dig> will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.
