polyploidy plays an important role in the adaptation and speciation of plants.
caerulea showed that chromosome changes have occurred during polyploidization process.
the comparative cytogenetic results provide reliable evidence that diploid subspecies caerulea is the direct progenitor of tetraploid subspecies sativa.
distinctly different fish patterns were first observed in diploid ssp.
sativa has been suggested to undergo a partial diploidization by the progressive accumulation of chromosome structural rearrangements during evolution.
however, the tetraploid subspecies falcata is far from a simple autopolyploid from diploid subspecies falcata although no obvious morphological change was observed between these two subspecies.
fish patterns of the repeats in diploid subspecies caerulea were highly similar to those in tetraploid subspecies sativa.
sativa was regarded as having a simple autopolyploid origin from diploid ssp.
caerulea, whereas the autopolyploid origin of tetraploid ssp.
tetraploid subspecies falcata was unexpectedly found to possess a highly variable karyotype, which agreed with neither diploid ssp.
the medicago sativa complex includes both diploid  and tetraploid  subspecies.
reconstruction of chromosome-doubling process of diploid ssp.
