although absent from most normal adult epithelia, fascin- <dig> is upregulated in many human carcinomas, and is associated with poor prognosis because of its promotion of carcinoma cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.
the p-lin-11/isl-1/mec- <dig> kinases , limk <dig> and limk <dig>  act downstream of rho kinases as novel binding partners of fascin- <dig>  and this complex regulates the stability of filopodia.
we investigated the hypothesis that fascin- <dig> is a functional target of rho in normal and carcinoma cells, using experimental approaches that included a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer /fluorescence lifetime imaging  method to measure the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin.
rho activity modulates the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin, as detected by a novel fret method, in skeletal myoblasts and human colon carcinoma cells.
fascin- <dig> is an actin crosslinking protein that is important for the assembly of cell protrusions in neurons, skeletal and smooth muscle, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells.
additionally, experiments have been hampered by the inability to measure the fascin-1/actin interaction directly in intact cells.
during the course of the study, we developed a novel fret method for analysis of the fascin-1/actin interaction, with potential general applicability for analyzing the activities of actin-binding proteins in intact cells.
we have identified a novel activity of rho in promoting a complex between fascin- <dig> and limk1/ <dig> that modulates the interaction of fascin- <dig> with actin.
