c-to-u rna editing is commonly observed in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts.
in this paper, we extend our algorithm cure, which can accurately predict the c-to-u rna editing sites in mitochondria, to predict c-to-u rna editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
the online service allows the processing of entire chloroplast genome sequences.
the in vivo mechanism of recognizing c-to-u rna editing sites is still unknown.
in recent years, many efforts have been made to computationally predict c-to-u rna editing sites in the mitochondria of seed plants, but there is still no algorithm available for c-to-u rna editing site prediction in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
cure-chloroplast is an online service for predicting the c-to-u rna editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
since cure-chloroplast performs very well, it could be a helpful tool in the study of c-to-u rna editing in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
the algorithm achieves over 80% sensitivity and over 99% specificity.
we implement the algorithm as an online service called cure-chloroplast .
