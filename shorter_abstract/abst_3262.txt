these publicly available bac libraries are thus suitable for a broad range of applications in genetic and genomic research in eucalyptus and possibly in related species of myrtaceae, including genome sequencing, gene isolation, functional and comparative genomics.
the two e. grandis bac libraries described in this study represent an important milestone for the advancement of eucalyptus genomics and forest tree research.
eucalyptus species are among the most planted hardwoods in the world because of their rapid growth, adaptability and valuable wood properties.
five selected bac clones were sequenced and assembled using the roche gs flx technology providing the whole sequence of the e. grandis chloroplast genome, and complete genomic sequences of important lignin biosynthesis genes.
these bac resources have a highly redundant genome coverage , contain large average inserts and have a very low percentage of clones with organellar dna or empty vectors.
bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries are key genomic tools that enable positional cloning of important traits, synteny evaluation, and the development of genome framework physical maps for genetic linkage and genome sequencing.
we describe the construction and characterization of two deep-coverage bac libraries eg_ba and eg_bb obtained from nuclear dna fragments of e. grandis  digested with hindiii and bstyi, respectively.
libraries were screened for the presence of several genes of interest via hybridizations to high-density bac filters followed by pcr validation.
