this work is the first to demonstrate that batf joins rorÎ³t as the molecular signature for all il- <dig> producing cells in vivo and identifies batf as a component of the nuclear protein network that could be targeted to regulate il-17-mediated disease.
in this study, tg mice overexpressing batf in t cells were used together with batf null mice to investigate how altering levels of batf expression in t cells impacts the development and function of a recently characterized population of inkt cells expressing il- <dig> .
batf has a direct impact on il- <dig> expression by inkt cells.
batf null mice are deficient in both cd4+ th <dig> cells and t follicular helper cells and possess an intrinsic b cell defect that leads to the complete absence of class switched ig.
interestingly, these studies also reveal that while the il17a gene is a common target for batf regulation in th <dig> and inkt- <dig> cells, this regulation is accompanied by opposite effects on the growth and expansion of these two cell lineages.
