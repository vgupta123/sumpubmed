we have investigated the effects of il-1β and tnf-α on macrophage foam cells in order to assess whether presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines improves or aggravates macrophage foam cell formation by affecting lipid accumulation and lipid turn-over in the cells.
il-1β and tnf-α enhance macrophage foam cell formation, in part by inhibition of macrophage intracellular lipid catabolism.
plaque formation is though to begin with infiltration of monocytes to the intimal layer of the vascular wall, followed by differentiation to macrophages and macrophage uptake of modified lipoproteins, resulting in accumulation of intracellular lipids.
the lipid-filled cells are referred to as macrophage foam cells, a key feature of atherosclerotic plaques.
differentiated primary human macrophages or thp- <dig> cells were lipid loaded by uptake of aggregated low density lipoproteins  or very low density lipoproteins , and then incubated with il-1β  in lipoprotein-free media for  <dig> h. cells incubated in absence of cytokine utilized accumulated neutral lipids, in particular triglycerides.
pro-inflammatory cytokines can affect intracellular lipid metabolism.
levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α  are up-regulated at sites of formation of atherosclerotic plaques.
analysis of fatty acid efflux and intracellular fatty acid activation revealed a pattern of decreased lipid utilization in cytokine-stimulated cells.
addition of exogenous il-1β resulted in a dose-dependent retention of intracellular cholesterol and triglycerides.
