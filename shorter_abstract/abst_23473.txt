we employed whole-head meg to study changes in cortical activation during self-paced volitional swallowing in fifteen healthy subjects with and without ttos.
compared to the normal swallowing task a significantly increased bilateral cortical activation was seen after oropharyngeal stimulation.
thermal tactile oral stimulation  is an established method to treat patients with neurogenic dysphagia especially if caused by sensory deficits.
current strategies of swallowing therapy involve on the one hand modification of eating behaviour or swallowing technique and on the other hand facilitation of swallowing with the use of pharyngeal sensory stimulation.
data were analyzed by means of synthetic aperture magnetometry  and the group analysis of individual sam data was performed using a permutation test.
we suggest that these results reflect short-term cortical plasticity of sensory swallowing areas.
analysis of the chronological changes during swallowing suggests facilitation of both the oral and the pharyngeal phase of deglutition.
dysphagia is a leading complication in stroke patients causing aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition and increased mortality.
these findings facilitate our understanding of the role of cortical reorganization in dysphagia treatment and recovery.
in the present study functional cortical changes elicited by oral sensory stimulation could be demonstrated.
