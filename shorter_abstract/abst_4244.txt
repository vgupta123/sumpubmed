the biodiversity of gut microbiota is affected by ethnicities and environmental factors such as dietary habits or medicine intake, and three enterotypes of the human gut microbiome were announced in  <dig>  these enterotypes are not significantly correlated with gender, age, or body weight but are influenced by long-term dietary habits.
finally, a decision tree was derived to provide a predictive model for the three enterotypes.
in this study, the major bacteria in the enterotypes identified from the fecal samples were bacteroides, prevotella, and enterobacteriaceae, and their correlation with dietary habits was confirmed.
microbiota compositions were analyzed using next-generation sequencing  technology, which is a culture-independent method of constructing microbial community profiles by sequencing 16s ribosomal dna .
we obtained  <dig> human fecal samples from adults in taiwan.
we used ngs technology to characterize the microbiota and constructed a predictive model.

a microbial interaction network in the gut was observed on the basis of the amount of short-chain fatty acids, ph value of the intestine, and composition of the bacterial community .
the most significant finding was that enterobacteriaceae, the predominant subtype, could be a new subtype of enterotypes in the asian population.
gastrointestinal microbiota, particularly gut microbiota, is associated with human health.
