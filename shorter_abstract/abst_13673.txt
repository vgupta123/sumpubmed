the importance of skin barrier homeostasis in the context of inflammatory skin diseases, together with reports identifying phf <dig> as an interferon-induced gene, have led us to examine its role in the innate immune response of keratinocytes.
in addition to a role for phf <dig> in lymphocyte gene expression, we have now shown that phf <dig> was part of the keratinocyte innate immune response by poly.
inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis represent a complex interaction between the skin and infiltrating immune cells, resulting in damage to the skin barrier and increased inflammation.
we developed a cell culture model that allowed us to analyze the effects of the double-stranded rna analogue poly on a confluent cell monolayer immediately after a 24-h treatment, as well as three days after withdrawal of treatment.
this was associated with lower cell density and a decrease in the number of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle.
this was accompanied by nuclear localization of phf <dig> as well the tight junction protein claudin- <dig>  knock-down of phf <dig> resulted in increased interleukin- <dig> expression and secretion immediately following treatment with poly, as well as changes in the cellular distribution of membrane-bound and increased nuclear claudin- <dig> that was observed up to 3Â days after the withdrawal of poly.
as knock-down of phf <dig> was associated with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine il- <dig> and changes in the cellular distribution of claudin- <dig>  a change normally associated with increased proliferation and migration, we suggest that phf <dig> may contribute to epidermal recovery following infection or other damage.
