heat-induced browning  of seed coats is caused by high temperatures which discolors the seed coats of many legumes, affecting the visual appearance and quality of seeds.
we identified three qtl associated with the heat-induced browning of seed coats trait, hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig>  using cowpea ril populations it93k-503- <dig>  x cb <dig>  and it84s- <dig>  x tvu <dig> .
the identification of loci determining heat-induced browning of seed coats and co-segregating molecular markers will enable transfer of hbs alleles into cowpea varieties, contributing to higher quality seeds.
within the syntenic regions of hbs- <dig> in soybean, medicago and common bean, several ethylene forming enzymes, ethylene responsive element binding factors and an acc oxidase  <dig> were observed.
the genetic determinants underlying hbs in cowpea are unknown.
hbs- <dig> was identified in a bac clone in contig  <dig> of the cowpea physical map, where ethylene forming enzymes were present.
hbs- <dig> was positioned on bac clones in contig <dig> of the cowpea physical map, where several acc synthase  <dig> genes were present.
hbs- <dig> was identified in the it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> population and accounted for of  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
hbs- <dig> was identified in the it84s- <dig> x tvu <dig> population and accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
