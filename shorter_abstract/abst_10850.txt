moreover, we would propose that large-scale chromosomal structure has a dominant influence on the intrachromosomal distributions of genomic elements, and provides for an additional shared hierarchy of genomic organization within arabidopsis.
the spatial distributions of all these elements obeyed a common pattern: the density profiles of each element within chromosomes exhibited low-frequency fluctuations indicative of regional clustering, and the individual density profiles tended to correlate with each other at large measurement scales.
at smaller scales the correlations tended to weaken â€“ evidence that localized cis-interactions between the different elements had a comparatively minor, if any, influence on their placement.
the chromosomes of the plant arabidopsis thaliana contain various genomic elements, distributed with appreciable spatial heterogeneity.
