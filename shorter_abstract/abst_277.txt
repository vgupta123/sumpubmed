remarkably, three different forms of introns were found, named introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> based on their different positions in the cox  <dig> alignment.
an alternative scenario that includes horizontal gene transfer events appears to be more suitable to explain the incongruence between the intron  <dig> and the cox  <dig> topologies.
interestingly, sponges harboring the same intron form did not always form monophyletic groups, suggesting that their introns might have been transferred horizontally.
in addition, our results suggest that three different intron forms independently colonized the cox  <dig> gene of tetillids.
a global test of co-phylogeny had significant results; however, when cnidarian sequences were analyzed separately the results were not significant.
these introns had distinct secondary structures and encoded laglidadg orfs belonging to three different lineages.
the co-speciation analyses thus suggest that a vertical transmission of introns in the ancestor of sponges and cnidarians, followed by numerous independent losses, cannot solely explain the current distribution of metazoan group i introns.
reciprocal au tests indicated that the intron and cox  <dig> tree are significantly different, while a likelihood ratio test was not significant.
among these sequences only six were found to possess group i introns.
among sponges, the tetillidae family seems to be experiencing an unusual number of intron insertions.
to better understand the mode of transmission of mitochondrial introns in sponges, we studied cox  <dig> intron distribution among representatives of this family.
