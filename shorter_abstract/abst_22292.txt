the strong linkage disequilibrium  recently found in genic or exonic regions of the human genome demonstrated that ld can be increased by evolutionary mechanisms that select for functionally important loci.
to assess this hypothesis, we used genome-wide polymorphism data from the hapmap project and investigated ld within dna sequences conserved between the human and mouse genomes.
rather, it implies that purifying selection changes the polymorphic patterns of coding sequences but has little influence on the patterns of functional units such as regulatory elements present in non-coding regions, since the former are generally restricted by the constraint of maintaining a functional protein product across multiple exons while the latter may exist more as individually isolated units.
to appropriately understand the relationship between ld and conserved regions, we removed the effect of repetitive elements and found that the high degree of sequence conservation was strongly associated with strong ld in coding regions but not with that in non-coding regions.
our work demonstrates that the degree of sequence conservation does not simply increase ld as predicted by the hypothesis.
we found that interspersed repeats, and not other sequence features, were associated with the weak ld tendency in conserved regions.
this suggests that ld might be stronger in regions conserved among species than in non-conserved regions, since regions exposed to natural selection tend to be conserved.
