we have engineered and produced recombinant proteins of the matriptase protease domain, and have determined the crystal structures of the protease:sfti- <dig> complex at  <dig>  Å as well as the protease:benzamidine complex at  <dig>  Å. these structures elaborate the structural basis of substrate selectivity of matriptase, and show that the matriptase s <dig> substrate specificity pocket is larger enough to allow movement of benzamidine inside the s <dig> pocket.
matriptase is a type ii transmembrane serine protease that is found on the surfaces of epithelial cells and certain cancer cells.
this work helps to define the structural basis of substrate specificity of matriptase and the interactions between the inhibitor and protease.
sunflower trypsin inhibitor- <dig> , a cyclic peptide inhibitor originally isolated from sunflower seeds, exhibits potent inhibitory activity toward matriptase.
