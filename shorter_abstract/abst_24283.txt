the ferric uptake regulator  is a transcriptional regulator that controls iron homeostasis in bacteria.
to reveal potentially novel aspects of the fur regulon in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium under oxygen conditions similar to that encountered in the host, we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type strain  and its isogenic Δfur strain under anaerobic conditions.
finally, this work identified twenty-six new targets of fur regulation, and demonstrates that h-ns repressed genes are down-regulated in Δfur.
this may explain the observed down-regulation of the tdc operon, responsible for the anaerobic degradation of threonine, and ftnb in Δfur.
however, fur activation of ftnb was independent of fnr.
although the regulatory role of fur in escherichia coli is well characterized, most of the studies were conducted under routine culture conditions, i.e., in ambient oxygen concentration.
microarray analysis of anaerobically grown Δfur s. typhimurium identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes.
the regulation of fesod gene, sodb, occurred via small rnas  with the aid of the rna chaperone hfq.
additionally, in Δfur, the expression of the gene coding for the ferritin-like protein  was down-regulated, while the transcription of the gene coding for the nitric oxide  detoxifying flavohemoglobin  was up-regulated.
this study determined that fur is a positive factor in ftnb regulation, while serving to repress the expression of hmpa.
