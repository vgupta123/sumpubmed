here we assessed the possibility of identifying novel functional motifs in plant genes, sharing the tata-box topological constraints.
the tata-box and tata-variants are regulatory elements involved in the formation of a transcription initiation complex.
our observations suggest that the tc-elements might constitute a class of novel regulatory elements participating towards the complex modulation of gene expression in plants.
arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome analysis revealed that tata-box-containing genes were generally those showing relatively high levels of expression and that tc-element-containing genes were generally those expressed in specific conditions.
