after quality control, tests for snps associated with boar taint were performed on  <dig> phenotyped individuals and  <dig>  snps.
for androstenone, a ‘regional heritability approach’ combining information from multiple snps was used to estimate the genetic variation attributable to individual autosomes.
the study agrees with evidence that the cyp2e <dig> gene has effects on skatole breakdown in the liver.
nominal significance was found for effects on skatole associated with  <dig> other snps including a region of ssc <dig> reported previously.
genome-wide significance was found for an association between snps on ssc <dig> and androstenone levels and nominal significance for associations with snps on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  the regional analyses confirmed large effects on ssc <dig> for androstenone and suggest that ssc <dig> explains 23% of the genetic variation in androstenone.
boar taint is an offensive urine or faecal-like odour, affecting the smell and taste of cooked pork from some mature non-castrated male pigs.
in most pig production systems, males, which are not required for breeding, are castrated shortly after birth to reduce the risk of boar taint.
there is evidence for genetic variation in the predisposition to boar taint.
a genome-wide association study  was performed to identify loci with effects on boar taint.

five hundred danish landrace boars with high levels of skatole in fat , were each matched with a litter mate with low levels of skatole and measured for androstenone.
a highly significant association was found between variation in skatole levels and snps within the cyp2e <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> , which encodes an enzyme involved in degradation of skatole.
significant snp associations were found for skatole on ssc <dig> and for androstenone on ssc <dig> in landrace pigs.
autosomal heritability estimates can uncover clusters of smaller genetic effects that individually do not exceed the threshold for gwas significance.
