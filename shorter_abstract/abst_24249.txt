taken together this study demonstrates the functionality of the nf-il <dig> and ap- <dig> elements and suggests an involvement of mt in protection during pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer.
previously we have identified a distal region of the rainbow trout  metallothionein-a  enhancer region, being essential for free radical activation of the rtmt-a gene.
in contrast to mammals the metal responsive elements were not activated by oxidative stress.
in the present study we used the rainbow trout hepatoma  cell line to further examine the involvement of nf-il <dig> and ap <dig> in rtmt-a gene expression following exposure to oxidative stress and tumour promotion.
these studies suggest that ap <dig> primarily is involved in pma regulation of the rtmt-a gene while nf-il <dig> is involved in free radical regulation.
in addition, pma and pq injection of rainbow trout resulted in increased hepatic rtmt-a mrna levels.
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate , a known tumor promoter, resulted in a robust induction of rtmt-a via the ap <dig> elements alone.
