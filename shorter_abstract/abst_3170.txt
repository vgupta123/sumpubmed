these findings show that il- <dig> serves an important role in c. butyricum-mediated immune protection, and in host recognition of c. butyricum.
interleukin  <dig>  plays a central role in preventing certain inflammatory diseases by down-regulating inflammatory cascades.
we treated ht- <dig> cells with anti-il- <dig>  or siil- <dig>  to disrupt il- <dig>  in both cases, the effects of c. butyricum-induced nf-Îºb activation and il- <dig> expression were enhanced.
in a previous study, we observed that the level of il- <dig> mrna was modulated by c. butyricum.
we also found that neutralization or knockdown of il- <dig> could induce apoptosis and necrosis of ht- <dig> cells treated with c. butyricum compared with control cells.
the aim of this study was to investigate whether c. butyricum achieves its beneficial effects through il- <dig>
in the intestine it may increase the resistance of the gut to pathogen invasion via inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
