some evidence of a predator-parasite mutualism was reported from spotted deer or chital  as a prey species, dhole or indian wild-dog  as the predator and a protozoan  as the parasite.
in the case of such parasite species the predator and the parasite have common interests and therefore a mutualistic relationship is possible.
we examine here, with the help of a model, the ecological conditions necessary for the evolution and stability of such a mutualistic relationship.
the available data on the behavioral ecology of dhole and chital suggest that they are likely to meet the stability criteria and therefore a predator-parasite mutualism can be stable in this system.
for parasites with a predator-prey life cycle, the completion of the life cycle often depends on consumption of parasitized prey by the predator.
