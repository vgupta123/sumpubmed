to investigate the kinetic properties and behavior of a substance of interest, we computationally label this species in order to track it throughout its life cycle.
application to the jak-stat signaling pathway in epo-stimulated baf3-epor cells enabled the calculation of the time-dependent label half-life and transit-time of stat species.
we discuss two approaches to quantify the half-life, present the novel method of in silico labeling, and introduce the label half-life and label transit-time.
a profile likelihood approach is used to estimate confidence intervals on the label half-life and transit-time.
in cell biology, two main properties of interest are  the time-period a protein is accessible to other molecules in a certain state - its half-life - and  the time it spends when passing through a subsystem - its transit-time.
the results were robust against parameter uncertainties.
mathematical models of dynamical systems facilitate the computation of characteristic properties that are not accessible experimentally.
the developed method has been motivated by laboratory tracer experiments.
the corresponding mathematical model is extended by an additional set of reactions for the labeled species, avoiding any double-counting within closed circuits, correcting for the influences of upstream fluxes, and taking into account combinatorial multiplicity for complexes or reactions with several reactants or products.
