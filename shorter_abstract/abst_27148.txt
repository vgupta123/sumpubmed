the expression pattern of mirnas among different tissues and developmental stages were further investigated by both qrt-pcr and rna gel blotting.
a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified.
this study depicts a global picture of mirnas and their target genes in the genome of sweet orange, and focused on the comparison among leaf, flower and fruit tissues.
previous studies have demonstrated that mirna-mediated gene silencing pathways play vital roles in plant development.
genome mapping revealed that these mirnas were evenly distributed across the genome with several small clusters, and  <dig> pre-mirnas were co-localized with simple sequence repeats .
this study provides a global view of mirnas and their target genes in different tissue of sweet orange, and focused on the identification of mirna involved in the regulation of fruit ripening.
in plants, micrornas  regulate gene expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level.
the results of this study lay a foundation for unraveling key regulators of orange fruit development and ripening on post-transcriptional level.
an in-house script was used to identify all potential secondary sirnas derived from mirna-targeted transcripts using srna and degradome sequencing data.
interestingly, csi-mir <dig> was highly expressed in fruit ripening stage, and was validated to target a nac transcription factor.
