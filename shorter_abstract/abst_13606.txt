ca2+ binding to cam triggers a conformational change, forming a hydrophobic patch that is important for target protein recognition.
cam regulates a ca2+-dependent inactivation process in store-operated ca2+ entry, by interacting orai <dig>  to understand the relationship between ca2+-induced hydrophobicity and cam/orai interaction, chimera proteins constructed by exchanging ef-hands of cam with those of troponin c  are used as an informative probe to better understand the functionality of each ef-hand.
here, the model of 1: <dig> binding stoichiometry of cam/orai-cmbd established in solution supports the already published crystal structure.
using ans dye to assess induced hydrophobicity showed that exchanging efs for all ca2+-bound chimeras impaired ans fluorescence and/or binding affinity, consistent with general concepts about the inadequacy of hydrophobic exposure for chimeras.
stern-volmer plots of orai-cmbd trp <dig> indicated that the residue is located in a very hydrophobic environment but becomes more solvent accessible when ef <dig> and ef <dig> were exchanged.
ans lifetime measurements indicated that there are two types of ans molecules with rather distinct fluorescence lifetimes, each specifically corresponding to one lobe of cam or chimeras.
calmodulin  plays an important role in ca2+-dependent signal transduction.

ans was used to assess the context of the induced hydrophobic surface on cam and chimeras upon ca2+ binding.
