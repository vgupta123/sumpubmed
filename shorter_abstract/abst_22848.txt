the subspecies-specific variants are enriched for rare alleles, which suggests that cnvs are relatively recent events that have arisen within breeding populations.
higher recombination rates and the presence of homologous gene clusters are probably predispositions for generation of the higher number of cnvs on chromosome  <dig> by non-allelic homologous recombination events.
some cnvs with high frequency differences among groups resided in genes underlying rice adaptation.
we comprehensively assayed cnvs using high-density array comparative genomic hybridization in a panel of  <dig> asian cultivated rice comprising six indica, three aus, two rayada, two aromatic, three tropical japonica, and four temperate japonica varieties.
copy number variation  can lead to intra-specific genome variations.
transposable elements  and other repetitive sequences were identified in the majority of cnvrs.
these genes were significantly enriched for specific biological functions involved in cell death, protein phosphorylation, and defense response.
we used a stringent criterion to identify a total of  <dig> high-confidence copy number variable regions , which span  <dig>  mb  of the rice genome, overlapping  <dig> genes.
