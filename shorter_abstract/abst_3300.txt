among the metazoa, hrs have survived in a cnidarian and in a few protostome groups; hence, it appears that in metazoans the hr gene was lost in deuterostome ancestor after the radiata/bilateria split.
a search for putative hrs in the genomes of  <dig> archaea,  <dig> bacteria and  <dig> eukaryotes, revealed their presence in  <dig> archaea,  <dig> bacteria, several fungi, one apicomplexan, a heterolobosan, a cnidarian and several annelids.
overall hrs exhibit a considerable lack of evolutionary success in metazoans.
the annelid and sipunculan hrs share the same intron-exon structure, different from that of the cnidarian hr.
the phylogenomic profile of hrs demonstrated a limited occurrence in bacteria and archaea and a marked absence in the vast majority of multicellular organisms.
since the Î±-helical bundle is likely to have been among the earliest protein folds, hrs represent an ancient family of iron-binding proteins, whose primary function in bacteria may have been that of an oxygen sensor, enabling aerophilic or aerophobic responses.
signal peptide sequences in several hirudinea hrs suggest for the first time, the possibility of extracellular localization.
about a fourth of the hr sequences were identified as n- or c-terminal domains of chimeric, chemotactic gene regulators.
hemerythrins, are the non-heme, diiron binding respiratory proteins of brachiopods, priapulids and sipunculans; they are also found in annelids and bacteria, where their functions have not been fully elucidated.
