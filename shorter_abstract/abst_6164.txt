the results showed an arrested cell cycle state in the hepatocytes of chronic hcv infection, regardless of any association with genotype  <dig>  cell cycle arrest is characterized by an increased expression of p <dig>  in relation to fibrosis, and of p <dig> in relation to inflammation.
expression of all these proteins was unrelated to the hcv genotype and were detected only rarely in the hepatocytes of normal liver.
the altered expression of these cell cycle proteins in hepatocytes is suggestive of an impaired cell cycle progression that could limit the regenerative response of the liver to ongoing injury, leading to the progression of disease.
the mcm- <dig> and p <dig> expressions were associated with the fibrosis stage  and that of p <dig> with the inflammation grade .
the present study aimed to further elaborate these disruptions by evaluating the expression of key cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in chronic hcv infection with particular reference to genotype  <dig>  archival liver biopsy specimens of chronic hcv-infection  and normal histology  were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against proliferation marker mcm- <dig>  g <dig> phase marker cyclin d <dig>  s phase marker cyclin a, cell cycle regulators p <dig>  and p <dig> , apoptotic protein caspase- <dig> and anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>
elevated mcm- <dig> expression was observed in hepatocytes in chronic hcv infection, indicating increased cell cycle entry.
a disrupted cell cycle progression of hepatocytes was reported in chronic hepatitis c virus  infection, which can contribute significantly in the associated pathogenesis.
