when we evaluated the pcr method for genotyping all nine hla loci  using  <dig> japanese reference subjects who represented a distribution of more than  <dig> % of the hla alleles at each of the nine hla loci, all of the  <dig> alleles genotyped, except for hla-drb3/4/ <dig> alleles, were consistent with known alleles assigned by the conventional methods together with relevant locus balance and no excessive allelic imbalance.
in order to simplify and accelerate the ngs-based hla genotyping method for multiple dna samples, we developed and evaluated four multiplex pcr methods for genotyping up to nine classical hla loci including hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig>
we developed multiplex pcr methods using newly and previously designed middle ranged pcr primer sets for genotyping different combinations of hla loci,  hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>   hla-dqb <dig> ,  hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, and  hla-dpb <dig> .
one multiplex pcr method  was able to provide precise genotyping data even when only 1Â ng of genomic dna was used for the pcr as a sample template.
hla genotyping by next generation sequencing  requires three basic steps, pcr, ngs, and allele assignment.
compared to the conventional methods, such as pcr-sequence specific oligonucleotide primers  and -sequence based typing , pcr-ngs is extremely labor intensive and time consuming.
