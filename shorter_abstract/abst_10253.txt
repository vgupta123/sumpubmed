hexr did not seem to impact hrp gene expression as evidenced by the hexr mutant’s unaltered hypersensitive response in tobacco and its unmodified protein secretion pattern as compared to the wild type under hrp-inducing conditions.
glycinea pg <dig> causes bacterial blight on soybean plants and enters the leaf tissue through stomata or open wounds, where it encounters a sucrose-rich milieu.
p. syringae pg <dig> possesses two functional lsc alleles transcribed at virulence-promoting low temperatures.
our data suggested a co-regulation of genes involved in extra-cellular sugar acquisition with those involved in intra-cellular energy-providing metabolic pathways in p. syringae.
analyses of lsc expression resulted in higher transcript and protein levels in the hexr mutant as compared to the wild type.
a hexr mutant of pg <dig> was significantly growth-impaired when incubated with sucrose or glucose as sole carbon source, but exhibited wild type growth when arabinose was provided.
the hexr mutant’s ability to multiply in planta was reduced.
we hypothesized that transcription of lsc is controlled by the hexose metabolism repressor, hexr, since potential hexr binding sites were identified upstream of both lsc genes.
