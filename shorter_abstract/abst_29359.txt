since, unlike other 3d template approaches, the eta method bypasses the need for experimental knowledge of the catalytic mechanism, it should prove a useful, large scale, and general adjunct to combine with other methods to decipher protein function in the structural proteome.
one approach to recover this information is to use 3d templates â€“ structure-function motifs that consist of a few functionally critical amino acids and may suggest functional similarity when geometrically matched to other structures.
since experimentally determined functional sites are not common enough to define 3d templates on a large scale, this work tests a computational strategy to select relevant residues for 3d templates.
when matches are required to both geometrically match the 3d template and to be sequence homologs found by blast or psi-blast, the annotation accuracy is greater than either method alone, especially in the region of lower sequence identity where homology-based annotations are least reliable.
these data suggest that knowledge of evolutionarily important residues improves functional annotation among distant enzyme homologs.
in many cases  a single most likely function could be predicted as the annotation with the most matches, and in these cases such a plurality vote identified the correct function with 87% accuracy.
based on evolutionary information and heuristics, an evolutionary trace annotation  pipeline built templates for  <dig> enzymes, half taken from the psi, and sought matches in a non-redundant structure database.
structural genomics projects such as the protein structure initiative  yield many new structures, but often these have no known molecular functions.
