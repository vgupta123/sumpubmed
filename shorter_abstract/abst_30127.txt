there was a reduction in the percentage of i- <dig> knockdown cells with a primary cilium, but no apparent alteration in the cilium length, suggesting no change in microtubule-based transport processes.
however, mechanisms to regulate tubulin acetylation in cilia are poorly understood.
knockdown of i- <dig> by sirna significantly reduced the acetylation of microtubules in cilia, without a net decrease in whole cell tubulin acetylation.
the regulatory protein i- <dig> localizes to the primary cilium where it affects both ser/thr phosphorylation and is required for full tubulin acetylation.
rescue of tubulin acetylation in i- <dig> knockdown cells by different chemical inhibitors shows that deacetylases and phosphatases are functionally interconnected to regulate microtubules.
inhibition of either histone deacetylases with trichostatin a, or protein phosphatase- <dig> with calyculin a in i- <dig> knockdown cells partially rescued the acetylation of microtubules in cilia and the percentage of cells with a primary cilium.
primary cilia are flagella-like projections from the centriole of mammalian cells that have a key role in cell signaling.
human diseases are linked to defects in primary cilia.
as a multifunctional protein, i- <dig> may link cell cycle progression to structure and stability of the primary cilium.
endogenous phosphatase inhibitor- <dig>  was found concentrated in cilia of human epithelial cells, and was localized to cilia early in the process of formation, prior to the full acetylation of microtubules.
