the cotyledon petioles showed left-handed twisting while the hypocotyl epidermal cells produced right-handed helical twisting.
all members of the family contain the conserved tpx <dig> motif, which can interact with microtubules, regulate microtubule dynamics or assist with different microtubule functions, for example, maintenance of cell morphology or regulation of cell growth and development.
here, we report the identification of the members of the tpx <dig> family in eucalyptus grandis  and analyse the expression patterns and functions of these genes.
a genome-wide survey identified  <dig> members of the tpx <dig> family in the sequenced genome of eucalyptus grandis.
our results suggest that the tpx <dig> family proteins within different sub-groups are relatively conserved but there are important differences between groups.
the results showed that in the whole plant, the levels of egwdl <dig> transcript are the highest, followed by those of egwdl <dig>  compared with other tissues, the level of the egmap <dig> transcript is the highest in the root.
our results lay the foundation for future efforts to reveal the biological significance of tpx <dig> family proteins in eucalyptus.
in present study, a comprehensive analysis of the plant tpx <dig> family proteins was performed.
quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to confirm the expression levels of the genes in different tissues.
