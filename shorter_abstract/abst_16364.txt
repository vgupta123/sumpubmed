our study demonstrated a high level of resistance to mls antibiotics in staphylococci from bovine mastitic milk, especially with a high rate of the imls phenotype in s. aureus isolates.
minimum inhibitory concentrations  of mls antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method, while differentiation of mls phenotypes was performed by a double-disc diffusion test.
these data suggest that mls antibiotics should be used judiciously to treat or prevent bovine mastitis caused by staphylococci.
mls resistance genotypes were determined by pcr for corresponding resistance genes.
there are limited data available on macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  resistance of staphylococcus aureus  and coagulase-negative staphylococci  from bovine milk in china.
resistance genes also existed in erythromycin-susceptible isolates.
an inactivating enzyme gene lnu, methylase genes erm and erm, efflux genes msr/msr, a phosphotransferase gene mph, an esterase gene ere and the streptogramin resistance determinant vga were detected individually or in combinations.
the erea gene was detected for the first time in staphylococci of bovine milk origin.
to address this knowledge gap, mls resistance was determined in 121 s. aureus and  <dig> cons isolates.
among  <dig> erythromycin-resistant  s. aureus and  <dig> er-r cons isolates, 38 s. aureus and  <dig> cons isolates exhibited the inducible mls  resistance phenotype and 2 s. aureus and  <dig> cons isolates expressed the constitutive mls resistance  phenotype.
forty  s. aureus and  <dig>  cons were resistant to erythromycin, whereas all  <dig> isolates were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.
