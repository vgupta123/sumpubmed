in this study, we present a novel knowledge-driven  approach to effectively extract a large number of drug-se pairs from published biomedical literature.

systems approaches to studying drug-side-effect  associations are emerging as an active research area for both drug target discovery and drug repositioning.
we then extracted a total of  <dig>  drug-se pairs from medline sentences and  <dig>  pairs from abstracts.
in addition, we show that the extracted drug-se pairs can be directly used in drug repositioning.
on average, the kd approach has achieved a precision of  <dig> , a recall of  <dig> , and an f <dig> of  <dig> , which is significantly better than a svm-based machine learning approach  with a  <dig> % increase in f <dig> score.
first, we used known drug-se associations derived from fda drug labels as prior knowledge to automatically find se-related sentences and abstracts.
