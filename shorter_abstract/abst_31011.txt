the assays should be applicable to intact mammalian cells, optimally also to primary cells in culture.
constitutive ppis are usually mediated by large interaction domains.
we measured the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the pro-apoptotic protein bad and the adapter proteins 14-3-3ε and ζ in nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts and in primary cultured neurons.
we furthermore applied split-tev assays to measure the phosphorylation-dependent interactions of neuregulin-1-stimulated erbb <dig> receptors with several adapter proteins.
in this study, we adapted the split-tev system to quantify phosphorylation-dependent and transient ppis that occur at the membrane and in the cytosol of living mammalian cells.
given the high sensitivity of the split-tev system, all assays were performed in multi-plate formats and could be adapted for higher throughput to screen for pharmacologically active substances.
however, the detection of modification-dependent ppis with biochemical methods still remains a labour- and material-intensive task, and many pivotal ppis that are potentially suited for pharmacological intervention most likely remain to be identified.
split-tev assays are well suited to measure phosphorylation-dependent and transient ppis that occur specifically at the membrane and in the cytosol of heterologous and primary cultured mammalian cells.
split-tev is based on a ppi-induced functional complementation of two inactive tev protease fragments fused to interaction partners of choice.
using split-tev assays, we show that bad specifically interacts with 14-3- <dig> isoforms when phosphorylated by protein kinase akt-1/pkb at ser <dig>  we also measured the phosphorylation-dependent bad/14-3- <dig> interactions mediated by endogenous and transient akt- <dig> activity.
in contrast, stimulus-regulated ppis often depend on small post-translational modifications and are thus better suited targets for drug development.
