this distribution pattern suggests a possible role for the messinian salinity crisis  as a driving force in lineage diversification.
divergence estimates indicate that the messinian salinity crisis had a minor impact on sylvia.
the genus is comprised of about  <dig> species, and 70% of these species have distributions at or near the mediterranean sea.
molecular clock calibration suggests that sylvia arose in the early miocene and diverged into three main clades by  <dig>  ma.
long-distance migration is reconstructed as the ancestral character state for the genus, and sedentary behavior subsequently evolved seven times.
instead, over-water dispersals, repeated loss of long-distance migration, and palaeo-climatic events in africa played primary roles in sylvia divergence and distribution.
other species distributions suggest that late miocene to pliocene afro-tropical forest dynamics have also been important in the evolution of sylvia lineages.
using a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis and other methods, we seek to develop a biogeographic hypothesis for sylvia and to explicitly assess the roles of these climate-driven events.
asia is reconstructed as the ancestral area for sylvia.
the old world warbler genus sylvia has been used extensively as a model system in a variety of ecological, genetic, and morphological studies.
