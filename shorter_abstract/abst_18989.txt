the analysis of next generation sequencing  has become a standard task for many laboratories in the life sciences.
to simplify the control of the workflow, neat projects are built around a unique and centralized file containing sample names, replicates, conditions, antibodies, alignment-, filtering- and peak calling parameters as well as cluster-specific paths and settings.
in comparison to many publicly available tools including galaxy, neat provides three main advantages:  through the development of double-clickable executables, neat is efficient , easy to implement and intuitive;  storage space, maximum number of job submissions, wall time and cluster-specific parameters can be customized as neat is run on the institution’s cluster;  neat allows users to visualize and summarize ngs data rapidly and efficiently using various built-in exploratory data analysis tools including metagenomic and differentially expressed gene analysis.
here, we present the next generation analysis toolbox  that allows non-expert users including wet-lab scientists to comprehensively build, run and analyze ngs data through double-clickable executables without the need of any programming experience.
