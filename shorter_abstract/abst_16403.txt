we describe a flexible software package to perform these tasks called splicing analysis kit , available at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/spanki.
splice-junction centric analysis of rna-seq data provides advantages in specificity for detection of alternative splicing.
the production of multiple transcript isoforms from one gene is a major source of transcriptome complexity.
rna-seq experiments, in which transcripts are converted to cdna and sequenced, allow the resolution and quantification of alternative transcript isoforms.
we used rna-seq data to develop sequencing and aligner error models.
by using a series of quantitative and qualitative filters, we eliminated diagnosed errors in the simulation, and applied this to rna-seq data from drosophila melanogaster heads.
our software provides tools to better understand error profiles in rna-seq data and improve inference from this new technology.
