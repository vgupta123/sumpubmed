reduction or elimination of vector populations will tend to reduce or eliminate transmission of vector-borne diseases.
for density-dependent parameters estimated from field data for aedes aegypti, the critical release ratio for population elimination is modeled to be 27% to 540% greater for early-acting rather than late-acting lethality.
additionally, vector populations with strong density-dependent effects will tend to be resistant to sit-based control as the population-reducing effect of induced sterility will tend to be offset by reduced density-dependent mortality.
conventional sit induces early-acting  lethality, but genetic methods potentially allow the lethal phase to be tailored to the program.
we investigated by mathematical modeling the effect of manipulating the stage of development at which death occurs  in an sit program against a density-dependence-limited insect population.
one potential method for environmentally-friendly, species-specific population control is the sterile insect technique .
our success in developing a mosquito strain with the key features that the modeling indicated were desirable demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for improved sit for disease control.
