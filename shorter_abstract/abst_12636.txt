in the presence of ba precursors and under mild gastric stress, a correlation between enhancement of bacterial survival and a synchronous transcriptional activation of the tyramine and putrescine biosynthetic pathways was detected.
the results indicate that ba production may be a mechanism that increases bacterial survival under gastric stress.
ingestion of fermented foods containing high levels of biogenic amines  can be deleterious to human health.

an in vitro model that simulates the normal physiological conditions in the human digestive tract, as well as caco- <dig> epithelial human cell lines, was used to challenge l. brevis ioeb  <dig>  which produced both tyramine and putrescine under all conditions tested.
l. brevis ioeb  <dig> can produce tyramine and putrescine under simulated human digestive tract conditions.
high levels of both ba were observed after exposure of the bacterium to caco- <dig> cells.
less obvious is the threat posed by ba producing organisms contained within the food which, in principle, could form ba after ingestion even if the food product itself does not initially contain high ba levels.
