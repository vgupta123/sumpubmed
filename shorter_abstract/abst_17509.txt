the gene expressions were investigated using applied biosystems rat whole genome survey microarrays and the biological functions were analyzed with ingenuity analysis pathway software.
pyrrolizidine alkaloids  exist in many plants and many of them cause liver toxicity and/or cancer in humans and experimental animals.
although there were large differences between the significant genes and between the biological processes that were altered by comfrey and riddelliine, there were a number of common genes and function processes that were related to carcinogenesis.
there was a strong correlation between the two treatments for fold-change alterations in expression of drug metabolizing and cancer-related genes.
our results suggest that the carcinogenesis-related gene expression patterns resulting from the treatments of comfrey and riddelliine are very similar, and pas contained in comfrey are the main active components responsible for carcinogenicity of the plant.
comfrey  is a perennial plant and has been consumed by humans as a vegetable, a tea and an herbal medicine for more than  <dig> years.
to confirm our hypothesis, we compared the expression of genes and processes of biological functions that were altered by comfrey  and riddelliine  in rat liver for carcinogenesis in this study.
groups of  <dig> big blue fisher  <dig> rats were treated with riddelliine at  <dig> mg/kg body weight by gavage five times a week for  <dig> weeks or fed a diet containing 8% comfrey root for  <dig> weeks.
animals were sacrificed one day after the last treatment and the livers were isolated for gene expression analysis.
it, however, is hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in experimental animals and hepatotoxic in humans.
