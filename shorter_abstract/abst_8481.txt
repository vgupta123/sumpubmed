however, its protein level gradually increased from p <dig> to p <dig>  in the midbrain, the igfbp- <dig> mrna first decreased and reached its lowest level at p <dig> before it increased, while the protein remained constant from p <dig> to p <dig>  at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the levels of igfbp- <dig> mrna in the cerebral cortex were significantly higher than that in the cerebellum or in the midbrain.

a strikingly higher abundance of the igfbp- <dig> protein observed in the cerebellum from p <dig> to p <dig> suggests that igfbp- <dig> may participate in the maintenance of cerebellar plasticity.
a clear immunoreactivity of igfbp- <dig> covered almost the entire embryonic brain  from e <dig>  to e <dig> , except for the area near the ventricle from e <dig> .
the temporal expression pattern of igfbp- <dig> in the embryonic brain from e <dig>  to e <dig>  was consistent with the course of neurogenesis in the ventricular zone, suggesting an important role of igfbp- <dig> in regulating differentiation of neural stem cells.
igfbp- <dig> has been considered as a factor involving in development of the central nervous system , but its role needs to be further clarified.
in present study, the localization of igfbp- <dig> expression in the embryonic forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain was determined using immunohistochemistry, and the levels of igfbp- <dig> protein and mrna were semi-quantified using rt-pcr and western blot in the embryonic  and postnatal brain .
in the cerebral cortex, the igfbp- <dig> mrna increased gradually after birth , while the protein showed little changes from p <dig> to p <dig>  but decreased significantly at p <dig>  in the cerebellum, the igfbp- <dig> mrna decreased gradually from p <dig>  reached the lowest level at p <dig>  and then increased again.
