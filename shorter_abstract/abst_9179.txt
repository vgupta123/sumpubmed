reactive oxygen species can be inactivated through the almost complete armamentarium of enzymatic antioxidants that has the fly to its disposal.
airway epithelial cells not only constitute a physical barrier, but also the first line of defence against airborne pathogens.
to elucidate the molecular architecture of the innate immune system of airway epithelial cells, we choose the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster as a model, because it has the simplest type of airways, consisting of epithelial cells only.
all airway epithelial cells of the fruit fly are able to launch an immune response.
in addition, most peptidoglycan recognition proteins, representing the almost complete collection of pattern recognition receptors, are part of the epithelial cells equipment.
it has become apparent that deregulation of epithelial innate immunity is a major reason for the development of chronic inflammatory lung diseases.
at the same time, they are constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species.
therefore, airway epithelia cells have to possess a sophisticated innate immune system and a molecular armamentarium to detoxify reactive oxygen species.
a great variety of pattern recognition receptors as well as of potential effector molecules are conspicuous, whereas signalling presumably occurs through a single nf-κb activating pathway.
they contain only one functional signal transduction pathway that converges onto nf-κb factors, namely the imd-pathway, which is homologous to the tnf-α receptor pathway.
although vital parts of the toll-pathway are missing, dorsal and dif, the nf-κb factors dedicated to this signalling system, are present.
elucidating the structure of the innate immune system of this "airway epithelial cell culture" might enable us to understand why deregulatory processes in innate immune signalling cascades lead to long lasting inflammatory events.
the innate immune system of the fly's airway epithelium has a very peculiar organization.
