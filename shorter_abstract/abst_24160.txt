in addition these tools output lists of often redundant or too specific go terms, which are difficult to interpret in the context of the biological question investigated by the user.
the go analysis tools used for these enrichment analyses assume that go terms are independent and the semantic distances between all parent–child terms are identical, which is not true in a biological sense.
this new tool will help experimental and computational biologists analyzing genomic and proteomic data according to their specific needs in a more reliable manner.
therefore, there is a demand for a robust and reliable method for gene categorization and enrichment analysis.

we demonstrate that categorizer provides improved categorization and enrichment results of genetic modifiers of huntington’s disease compared to a classical go slim-based approach or categorizations using other semantic similarity measures.
categorizer identifies the biologically best-fit category for each gene by taking advantage of a specialized semantic similarity measure for go terms.
