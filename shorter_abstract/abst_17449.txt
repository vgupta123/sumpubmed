etec exposed to alkaline environments express a specific proteome profile characterized by up-regulation of membrane proteins and secretion of lt toxin.
reduced expression of proteins involved in osmotic stress was found at alkaline conditions while the sec-dependent transport over the inner membrane and outer membrane protein proteins such as ompa and the Î²-barrel assembly machinery  complex were up-regulated.
relative quantitation with isobaric labeling  was used to compare peptide abundance and their corresponding proteins in multiple samples at ms/ms level.
in this study, we determined the surface proteome of etec exposed to alkaline conditions  as compared to neutral conditions  using a lpi hexalane flowcell combined with quantitative proteomics.
secretion of the heat labile ab <dig> toxin  is induced by alkaline conditions.
strong up-regulation of the atp synthase operon encoding f1fo atp synthase and down-regulation of proton pumping proteins nuof, nuog, ndh and wrba were detected among proteins involved in regulating the proton and electron transport under alkaline conditions.
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  is a major cause of diarrhea in children and travelers to endemic areas.
