in mycoplasma synoviae, type strain wvu  <dig>  a single member of the haemaglutinin vlha gene family has been previously shown to be expressed.
nucleotide sequence analysis of the rt-pcr product identified an 1815-nucleotide full-length open reading frame , immediately preceded by a nucleotide sequence identical to that previously reported for expressed vlha genes.
reverse transcription-pcr amplification , using a sense primer located at the 5'-end region of the expected vlha transcript and a reverse primer located at the 3' end of ms2/ <dig>  coding sequence, yielded a consistent amplification product showing that ms2/ <dig>  was indeed transcribed.
overall, the data provide an indication as to which extent the m. synoviae vlha gene could vary its antigenic repertoire.
variants of vlha are expressed from the same unique vlha promoter by recruiting pseudogene sequences via site-specific recombination events, thus generating antigenic variability.
despite the fact that this m. synoviae clone expressed a highly divergent and considerably shorter c-terminal haemagglutinin product, it was found to be expressed at the surface of the bacterium and was able to haemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes.
pcr amplifications using genomic dna isolated from single colonies further confirmed that the full-length orf of ms2/ <dig>  was located downstream of the unique vlha promoter sequence.
