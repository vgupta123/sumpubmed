predicting molecular responses in human by extrapolating results from model organisms requires a precise understanding of the architecture and regulation of biological mechanisms across species.
here, we present a large-scale comparative analysis of organ and tissue transcriptomes involving the three mammalian species human, mouse and rat.
for each organism, we created two expression datasets covering over  <dig> distinct tissue types with curated data from two independent microarray platforms.
overall, the expression variance caused by tissue type was approximately  <dig> times higher than the variance caused by perturbations or diseases, except for a subset of cancers and chemicals.
the results demonstrate that tissue-specific regulation is the main determinant of transcriptome composition and is highly conserved across mammalian species.
to this end, we created a unique, highly standardized compendium of tissue expression.
finally, we show evidence that tissue expression profiles, if combined with sequence similarity, can improve the correct assignment of functionally related homologs across species.
principal component analysis  revealed that the tissue-specific architecture of transcriptomes is highly conserved between human, mouse and rat.
pairs of gene orthologs exhibited higher expression correlation between mouse and rat than with human.
