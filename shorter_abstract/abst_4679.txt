the major pathological findings were malformed bones affecting the head, long bones of the legs and the vertebral column.
the frequency of the mutation in the current population was estimated to be  <dig> %.
the mutation became relatively widespread amongst the current population.
therefore, a control system has to be established and it is highly desirable to map the disease and develop a genetic test system.
at present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in brown swiss cattle.
nevertheless, the arachnomelia syndrome had been observed in the hessian simmental population during the decade 1964â€“ <dig>  recently, stillborn simmental calves were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome.
the first pathologically confirmed arachnomelia syndrome-cases in the current simmental population appeared in the year  <dig>  by  <dig>  an additional  <dig> calves with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified.
together with the data from experimental matings, the pedigree data support an autosomal recessive mutation being the etiology of the arachnomelia syndrome.
we describe the repeated occurrence of the arachnomelia syndrome in simmental calves.
it resembles completely the same defect occurring in the brown swiss breed.
