furthermore, the results could be generated by t-spot.tb assay within  <dig> hours, which was more rapid than tst with 48– <dig> hours.
elispot-based ifn-γ release assay is more sensitive and rapid for the diagnosis of tb infection in chinese hiv-infected individuals with history of bcg vaccination, and could be an effective tool for guiding preventive treatment with isoniazid in latently infected people and for tb control in china.
the subjects were divided into group hiv+atb , group hiv+ltb  and group hiv only .
in group hiv+atb and hiv+ltb, t-spot.tb positive rate in subjects with tst < <dig> mm were 50%  and  <dig> % , respectively.
individuals in group hiv+atb and hiv+ltb with cd4+ t cells <500/μl, t-spot.tb showed a higher sensitivity than tst .
in addition, the sensitivity of t-spot.tb assay in group hiv+atb increased to >85% in patients with tb treatment for less than  <dig> month and cd4+ t cells ≥200/μl, while for patients treated for more than  <dig> months and cd4+ t cells <200/μl, the sensitivity was decreased to only  <dig> %.
the aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic power of enzyme-linked immunospot -based ifn-γ release assay in detecting active and latent tuberculosis in hiv-infected population in bacillus calmette-guerin -vaccinated area.
tuberculin skin test  was performed for all recruited subjects.
