in the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of mobile phone radiation  during hatching on postnatal social behaviors in chicks, as well as the effect on brain size and structural maturity estimated using  <dig>  t magnetic resonance imaging.
mobile phone radiation exposure during chick embryogenesis impaired social behaviors after hatching and possibly induced cerebellar retardation.

at day  <dig> of incubation,  <dig> normally developing chick embryos were divided into the control group  and the radiation group .
the chi-square test and the student’s t test were used for statistical analysis.
no significant differences were found between the radiation and control group for brain size and structural maturity, except for cerebellum size, which was significantly smaller in the radiation group .
behavioral tests were performed 4 days after hatching.
the hatching and heteroplasia rates were also calculated and no significant difference was found between the two groups.
this indicates potential adverse effects of mobile phone radiation on brain development.
eggs in the radiation group were exposed to mobile phone radiation for 10 h each day from day  <dig> to  <dig> of incubation.
compared with controls, chicks in the radiation group showed significantly slower aggregation responses , lower belongingness , and weaker vocalization .
the size of different brain subdivisions  and corresponding dti parameters were measured.
t2-weighted mr imaging and diffusion tensor imaging  were subsequently performed.
the potential adverse effect of mobile phone radiation is currently an area of great concern in the field of public health.
