the emergence of this clonal complex was probably not driven by the antibiotic selective pressure.
the results reveal a human-associated subpopulation in our collection of strains.
we tested a population of  <dig> o. anthropi clinical  and environmental  isolates as well as the type strain o. anthropi atcc49188t and  <dig> strains of ochrobactrum lupini and ochrobactrum cytisi isolated from plant nodules.
a multi-locus sequence typing  scheme for o. anthropi is proposed here for the first time.
therefore, we hypothesise that the versatile species o. anthropi could be considered as a human-specialized opportunistic pathogen.
a major clonal complex corresponded to a human-associated lineage since it exclusively contained clinical isolates.
ochrobactrum anthropi is a versatile bacterial species with strains living in very diverse habitats.
the mlst approach suggested an epidemic population structure.
genomic fingerprinting separated isolates displaying the same sequence type but it did not detect a population structure that could be related to the origin of the strains.
