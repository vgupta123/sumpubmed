the empirical findings suggest that elicitors possibly incite defence or stress responses of the plant by triggering higher accumulation of withanolides.
p450s monooxygenases play a crucial role in secondary metabolism and predominantly help in functionalizing molecule core structures including withanolides.
full length cdnas of wscyp98a and wscyp76a have open reading frames of  <dig> and  <dig> bp encoding  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acid residues, respectively.
in an endeavor towards identification and characterization of different p450s, we here describe molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of two a-type p450s, wscyp98a and wscyp76a from withania somnifera.
exogenous elicitors acted as both positive and negative regulators of mrna transcripts.
entire coding sequences of wscyp98a and wscyp76a cdnas were expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig>  using pgex4t- <dig> expression vector.
two a-types p <dig> wscyp98a and wscyp76a were isolated, sequenced and heterologously expressed in e. coli.

further, transcript profiling after methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid elicitations displayed differential transcriptional regulation of wscyp98a and wscyp76a.
methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid resulted in copious expression of wscyp98a and wscyp76a.
