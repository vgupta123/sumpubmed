in this paper we present a novel system that combines the use of a mediation system with the reasoning capabilities of a large scale reasoner to provide a way of finding new knowledge and of analyzing the integrated information from different databases, which is retrieved as a set of ontology instances.
this process has been applied to develop a demo tool , which uses the biopax level  <dig> ontology as the integration schema, and integrates uniprot, kegg, chebi, brenda and sabiork databases.
ka-sb is a querying and analysis system for final users based on combining a data integration solution with a reasoner.
this tool uses a graphical query interface to build user queries easily, which shows a graphical representation of the ontology and allows users o build queries by clicking on the ontology concepts.
thus, the tool has been created with a process divided into two steps: 1) komf, the khaos ontology-based mediator framework, is used to retrieve information from heterogeneous and distributed databases; 2) the integrated information is crystallized in a  reasoner .
we propose a process for creating persistent and scalable knowledgebases from sets of owl instances obtained by integrating heterogeneous data sources with komf.
these kinds of systems  will provide users with very large amounts of information , which cannot be managed using traditional main memory-based reasoners.
the analysis of information in the biological domain is usually focused on the analysis of data from single on-line data sources.
