we find that the optimized rule-based models provide information about the average steric hindrance between binding regions and the probability that antibodies will bind to these regions.
we simulate the binding of antibody complexes to binding regions of the shrimp allergen pen a  <dig> using a previously developed 3d rigid-body monte carlo simulation, and we analyze the aggregate sizes.
furthermore, geometric rule-based modeling can be used to complement other computational methods that explicitly represent molecular geometry in order to quantify binding site accessibility and steric effects.
these optimized models quantify the variation in aggregate size that results from differences in molecular geometry and from model resolution.
rule-based modeling is a method that can be used to simulate these processes with reasonably low computational cost, but traditional rule-based modeling approaches do not include details of molecular geometry.
we propose a novel implementation of rule-based modeling that encodes details of molecular geometry into the rules and binding rates.
we then perform a study of antigen-antibody aggregation using our proposed method.
we demonstrate how rules are constructed according to the molecular curvature.
then, using our novel approach, we optimize a rule-based model according to the geometry of the pen a  <dig> molecule and the data from the monte carlo simulation.
