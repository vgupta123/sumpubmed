we also consider the effect of incomplete network data on functional and evolutionary inferences.
present protein interaction network data sets include only interactions among subsets of the proteins in an organism.
the effects of the incomplete nature of network data become very noticeable, especially for so-called network motifs.
crucially, when only small, partial network data sets are considered, bias is virtually inevitable.
given the scope of effects considered here, previous analyses may have to be carefully reassessed: ignoring the fact that present network data are incomplete will severely affect our ability to understand biological systems.
