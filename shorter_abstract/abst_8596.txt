recently, robust genotyping methods based on high-throughput sequencing were developed, which provide high marker density, but result in some genotype errors and a large number of missing genotype values.
the high marker density allowed identification of genomic regions with segregation distortion in r. idaeus, which may help to identify deleterious alleles that are the basis of inbreeding depression in the species.
comparison of ssrs to published r. idaeus maps showed that the linkage maps constructed with gbs and our method of imputation were robust, and marker positioning reliable.

microsatellites  linked these results to published maps for cross-validation and map comparison.
detection of precise genomic regions with segregation distortion was possible because of map saturation.
while low coverage and high variance in sequencing resulted in a large number of missing values for some individuals, a novel method of imputation based on maximum likelihood marker ordering from initial marker segregation overcame the challenge of missing values, and made map construction computationally tractable.
the two resulting parental maps contained  <dig> and  <dig> molecular markers spanning  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively over seven linkage groups.
