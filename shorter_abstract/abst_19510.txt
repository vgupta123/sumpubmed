first, we utilized thymidine to arrest cells in g <dig> and released the cells into s phase, at which point specific ssodns direct the highest level of correction.
in this study, we use thymidine to slow down the replication rate to enhance repair frequency and to maintain substantial levels of correction over time.
taken together, we believe that thymidine may be used in a therapeutic fashion to enable the maintenance of high levels of treated cells bearing repaired genes.
