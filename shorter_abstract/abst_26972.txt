during retinal development, transcript levels changed for all of the sema3s examined, as well as nrp <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  and plxna4a.
in the sc there were also changes in transcript levels for all sema3s tested, as well as nrp <dig>  nrp <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  plxna <dig>  and plxna4a.
these new data describing the overall temporal regulation of sema <dig> expression in the rat retina and sc provide a platform for further work characterising the functional impact of these proteins on the development and maturation of mammalian visual pathways.
in this time-course study in the rat, we document for the first time changes in the expression of rnas for the majority of class  <dig> semaphorins  and their receptor components during the development of the rat retina and superior colliculus .
significantly this is a developmental stage when rgcs are growing into and within the sc and are exposed to sema <dig> ligands.
functionally we found that sema3a, sema3c, sema3e, and sema3f proteins collapsed purified postnatal day  <dig> rgc growth cones in vitro.
members of the semaphorin  <dig> family  influence the development of the central nervous system, and some are implicated in regulating aspects of visual system development.
however, we lack information about the timing of expression of the sema3s with respect to different developmental epochs in the mammalian visual system.
