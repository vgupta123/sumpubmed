an artificial neural network  was used to classify the copepod specimens from species acartia spinicauda, bestiolina similis, oithona aruensis, oithona dissimilis, oithona simplex, parvocalanus crassirostris, tortanus barbatus and tortanus forcipatus based on the extracted features.
60% of the dataset was used for a two-layer feed-forward network training and the remaining 40% was used as testing dataset for system evaluation.
copepods are planktonic organisms that play a major role in the marine food chain.
the methods presented in this study enable fast classification of copepods to the species level.
future studies should include more classes in the model, improving the selection of features, and reducing the time to capture the copepod images.
hence, there is an urgent need to introduce novel methods and approaches to automate identification and classification of copepod specimens.
