major intrinsic proteins  also named aquaporins form channels facilitating the passive transport of water and other small polar molecules across membranes.
the total variation of mips and the number of different subfamilies in chlorophyte algae is likely to be even higher than that found in land plants.
in an attempt to investigate the origin of the plant mip subfamilies, genomes of chlorophyte algae, the sister group of charophyte algae and land plants, were searched for mip encoding genes.
a total of  <dig> mips were identified in the nine analysed genomes and phylogenetic analyses classified them into seven subfamilies.
two of these, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins  and glpf-like intrinsic proteins , are also present in land plants and divergence dating support a common origin of these algal and land plant mips, predating the evolution of terrestrial plants.
our results suggest that at least two of the seven subfamilies found in land plants were present already in an algal ancestor.
mips are particularly abundant and diverse in terrestrial plants but little is known about their evolutionary history.
the pip <dig> and pip <dig> groups and the ca2+ gating appear to be specific to land plants whereas the ph gating is a more ancient characteristic shared by all pips.
the subfamilies unique to algae were named mipa to mipe to facilitate the use of a common nomenclature for plant mips reflecting phylogenetically stable groups.
further studies are needed to discern the function of the algal specific subfamilies mipa-e and to fully understand the evolutionary relationship of algal and terrestrial plant mips.
