ceph-x is developed by using image processing techniques with three main models: enhancements x-ray image model, locating landmark model, and computation model.
three orthodontics specialists were involved in the evaluation of accuracy to avoid intra examiner error, and performance for ceph-x, and  <dig> orthodontics specialists were involved in the evaluation of the usability, and user satisfaction for ceph-x by using the sus approach.
this study utilizes some techniques to evaluate reliability, performance, and usability metric using sus methods of the developed cephalometric system which has not been reported in previous studies.
several cephalometric systems have been developed to automate the cephalometric procedure; however, no clear insights have been reported about reliability, performance, and usability of those systems.
manual analysis and measurements of cephalometric is considered tedious, time consuming, and subjected to human errors.
results showed that ceph-x increased the specialist performance, and minimized the processing time to obtain cephalometric measurements of human skull.

cephalometric analysis and measurements of skull parameters using x-ray images plays an important role in predicating and monitoring orthodontic treatment.
ceph-x was then evaluated by using x-ray images of  <dig> subjects  obtained from university of malaya hospital.
in this study a novel system named ceph-x is developed to computerize the manual tasks of orthodontics during cephalometric measurements.
