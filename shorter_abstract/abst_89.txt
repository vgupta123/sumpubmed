using sequences from over  <dig> nuclear genes we estimated the divergence between the two basal avian groups, palaeognathae and neognathae to be  <dig> million years, which is consistent with previous studies using mitochondrial genes.
to understand the patterns of molecular evolution of the nuclear protein-coding genes in brown kiwi  and to determine the timescale of avian history we sequenced a transcriptome obtained from a kiwi embryo using next generation sequencing methods.
furthermore this study suggests a relatively cost-effective way of obtaining a glimpse into the fundamental molecular evolutionary attributes of a genome, particularly when no closely related genomic sequence is available.
our study suggests a significant relationship between gene expression levels and protein evolution.
the results of this investigation revealed patterns of mutation and purifying selection in conserved protein coding regions in birds.
we then assembled the conserved protein-coding regions using the chicken proteome as a scaffold.
kiwi is a highly distinctive, flightless and endangered ratite bird endemic to new zealand.
