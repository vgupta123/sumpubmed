in this work, crosslinking and mass spectrometry were used to identify regions involved in the dimerization of the isolated mo-mlv ntd.
the crosslinking results are consistent with the monomeric structure of ntd in 3nnq, but for the dimer, in our model both polypeptides are oriented in parallel with each other and the contacting areas between the monomers would involve the interactions between helices  <dig> and helices  <dig> and  <dig>
complementation assays have shown that the n-terminal domain  of integrase is essential for concerted integration, contributing to the formation of a multimer through protein-protein interaction.
the 3d coordinates of 3nnq were used to derive a theoretical structure of the ntd dimer with the suite 3d-dock, based on shape and electrostatics complementarity, and filtered with the distance restraints determined in the crosslinking experiments.
