here, we analyzed genomic libraries from two stratiomyidae species from thermally and chemically contrasting habitats and determined the structure and organization of their hsp <dig> clusters.
we demonstrated clear evidence of homogenizing gene conversion in the s. singularior hsp <dig> genes, which form tight clusters in this species.
although the hsp <dig> coding sequences of s. singularior are highly homogenized via conversion, the structure and general arrangement of the hsp <dig> clusters are highly polymorphic, including gross aberrations, various deletions in intergenic regions, and insertion of incomplete mariner transposons in close vicinity to the 3'-utrs.
in contrast, in a population of the stenotopic oxycera pardalina that dwells in a stable cold spring, we did not find hsp <dig> copies in tandem orientation.
in o. pardalina we detected the hsp <dig> gene located next to a hsp <dig> copy in tandem orientation.
previously, we described the heat shock response in dipteran species belonging to the family stratiomyidae that develop in thermally and chemically contrasting habitats including highly aggressive ones.
the hsp <dig> gene families in s. singularior and o. pardalina evolved quite differently from one another.
in the case of the other species, o. pardalina, we found no clear trace of concerted evolution for the dispersed hsp <dig> genes.
