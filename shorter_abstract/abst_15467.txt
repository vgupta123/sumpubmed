we demonstrate the validity of the concept and software implementation with an example of successfully recovering a full-length chrm <dig> gene as well as its upstream and downstream genomic regions from rattus norvegicus reads.
the recursive blast search stops when either no more new matching sequences are found, a given maximal number of queries is exhausted, or a specified maximum number of rounds of recursion is reached.
in the interim, all sequence reads of public sequencing projects are made available in repositories such as the ncbi trace archive.
we have developed software, tracembler, that facilitates in silico chromosome walking by recursively assembling reads of a selected species from the ncbi trace archive starting with reads that significantly match sequence seeds supplied by the user.
tracembler takes one or multiple dna or protein sequence as input to the ncbi trace archive blast engine to identify matching sequence reads from a species of interest.
