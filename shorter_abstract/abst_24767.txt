this software may be used for a range of applications related to rna sequencing by building customized analysis pipelines.
it has reached the point where measuring the rna expression by the depth of coverage has become feasible even for largest genomes.
it is based upon standard bioconductor infrastructure for sequencing data and includes several novel features focused on deeper understanding of coverage expression profiles and discovery of novel transcription regions.
the data back-end may be a mysql database or a set of files in standard bam format.
the main features of rnaseqmap include coverage operations, discovering irreducible regions of high expression, significance search and splicing analyses with nucleotide granularity.
the processing in r can be run on a machine without any particular hardware requirements, and scales linearly with the number of genomic loci and number of samples analyzed.
the applicability and precision is expected to increase in parallel with the progress of the genome coverage in sequencers.
in particular, as rna sequencing software can be regarded genome browsers, exon junction tools and statistical tools operating on counts of reads in predefined regions.
the throughput of commercially available sequencers has recently significantly increased.
