the culture provided  <dig>  mg/l of rartinm, which activity was determined by its one-step purification through affinity chromatography on immobilized d-mannose and glycoarray analysis.
in addition, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy of rartinm indicated that its global fold comprises β-sheet structure.
the conditions for overexpression of soluble artinm were optimized testing different parameters: temperatures  and shaking speeds  during induction, concentrations of the induction agent iptg  and periods of induction .
considering the important biological properties of artinm and its therapeutic applicability, this study was designed to produce high-level expression of active recombinant artinm  in escherichia coli system.
the artinm coding region was inserted in pet29a vector and expressed in e. coli bl21-codon plus-rp.
overall, the optimized process to express rartinm in e. coli provided high amounts of soluble, correctly folded and active recombinant protein, compatible with large scale production of the lectin.
bl21-codonplus-rp cells induced under the optimized conditions  resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of soluble rartinm.
the analysis of intact rartinm by mass spectrometry revealed a  <dig> .5 da molecular mass, and the peptide mass fingerprint and esi-cid-ms/ms of amino acid sequences of peptides from a tryptic digest covered 41% of the total artinm amino acid sequence.
artinm is a d-mannose-specific lectin from artocarpus integrifolia seeds that induces neutrophil migration and activation, degranulation of mast cells, acceleration of wound healing, induction of interleukin- <dig> production by macrophages and dendritic cells, and protective t helper  <dig> immune response against leishmania major, leishmania amazonensis and paracoccidioides brasiliensis infections.
