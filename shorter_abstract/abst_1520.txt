chicken vh and vl genes were amplified from the cdna by pcr to generate full-length scfv constructs consisting of vh and vl fragments joined by a linker sequence.
scfvs from several bacterial clones were expressed in soluble form and crude cell lysates screened for binding to pt-gliadin by elisa.
chicken splenic lymphocytes, selected with antigen-coated magnetic beads, served as rna source for the generation of cdna.
we identified an enriched scfv motif, which showed reactivity to pt-gliadin.
celiac disease  is a chronic, small intestinal inflammatory disease mediated by dietary gluten and related prolamins.

different treatment regimes might be feasible, including masking of toxic celiac peptides with blocking antibodies or fragments thereof.
furthermore, igy competitively displaces scfv from pt-gliadin and natural wheat flour digest, indicating a common epitope of scfv and igy.
scfv can be of benefit for future cd treatment regimes.
scfv binds in a dose-dependent manner to pt-gliadin, comparable to igy.
scfv constructs were ligated in a prokaryotic expression vector, which provides a c-terminal hexahistidine tag.
scfv detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range, while rye is detected to a lesser extent.
the only current therapeutic option is maintenance of a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which implies substantial burden for cd patients.
polyclonal anti-pt-gliadin igy, purified from egg yolk of immunized chicken, served as control.
one selected scfv candidate was expressed and purified to homogeneity.
