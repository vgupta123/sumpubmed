in this work we identified allelic variants with putative impact on c3′h and hqt proteins which are significantly associated with chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant activity.

cynara cardunculus l. offers a natural source of phenolic compounds with the predominant molecule being chlorogenic acid.
in this work we screened a cynara cardunculus collection for new allelic variants in key genes involved in the chlorogenic acid biosynthesis pathway.
chlorogenic acid content, antioxidant and antithrombin activities were also evaluated in cc leaf extracts and an association analysis was performed to assess a putative correlation between these traits and the identified polymorphisms.
chlorogenic acid is gaining interest due to its involvement in various biological properties such as, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anticarcinogenic activities.
the target genes encode p-coumaroyl ester 3′-hydroxylase  and hydroxycinnamoyl-coa: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase , both participating in the synthesis of chlorogenic acid.
we could identify some polymorphisms that may lead to protein conformational changes.
the putative influence of the identified polymorphisms in c3′h and hqt proteins was further evaluated using bioinformatics tools.
further study of these alleles should be explored to assess putative relevance as genetic markers correlating with cynara cardunculus biological properties with further confirmation by functional analysis.
using high-resolution melting, the c3′h gene proved to be highly conserved with only  <dig> haplotypes while, for hqt,  <dig> haplotypes were identified de novo.
