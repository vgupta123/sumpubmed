animals from the same litter are often more alike compared with animals from different litters.
furthermore, sometimes an experimental treatment can only be applied to whole litters rather than to individual offspring.
an example is the valproic acid  model of autism, where vpa is administered to pregnant females thereby inducing the disease phenotype in the offspring.
in addition, few studies reported using randomisation  or blinding , and none indicated that a sample size calculation or power analysis had been conducted.
with this type of experiment the sample size is the number of litters and not the total number of offspring.
only a minority of studies reported using rigorous experimental methods, which is consistent with much of the preclinical in vivo literature.
this litter-to-litter variation, or “litter effects”, can influence the results in addition to the experimental factors of interest.
if such experiments are not appropriately designed and analysed, the results can be severely biased as well as extremely underpowered.
in addition, litter effects accounted for up to 61%  of the variation in behavioural outcomes, which was larger than the treatment effects.
a review of the vpa literature showed that only 9%  of studies correctly determined that the experimental unit  was the litter and therefore made valid statistical inferences.
