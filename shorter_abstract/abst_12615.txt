here we describe a serological test based on light emitting recombinant proteins for the diagnosis of pulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
lips testing of a pilot set of serum samples from african pulmonary tb patients identified a potential subset of diagnostically useful m. tuberculosis antigens.
luciferase immunoprecipitation systems , a fluid-phase immunoassay, was used to examine antibody responses against a panel of  <dig> different m. tuberculosis proteins.
marked heterogeneity of antibody responses was observed in the patients and the combined results demonstrated  <dig>  % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for detection of pulmonary tb.
three different strategies were used for generating the constructs expressing the recombinant fusion m. tuberculosis proteins with luciferase: synthetic gene synthesis, gateway recombination cloning, and custom pcr synthesis.
evaluation of a second independent cohort from thailand validated highly significant antibody responses against seven antigens , which often showed robust antibody levels up to 50- to 1000-fold higher than local community controls.
a pilot cohort of african pulmonary tb patients was used for initial antibody screening and confirmatory studies with selected antigens were performed with a cohort from thailand and healthy us blood donors.
a lips immunoassay employing multiple m. tuberculosis antigens shows promise for the rapid and quantitative serological detection of pulmonary tb.

a lips test simultaneously employing the seven m. tuberculosis antigen as a mixture matched the combined diagnostic performance of the separate tests, but showed an even higher diagnostic sensitivity  when a cut-off based on healthy us blood donors was used.
