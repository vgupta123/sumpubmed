we also bring again into consideration the hypothesis of body size being influenced by the distribution of native vegetation and social systems within this group, although it remains to be tested.
the geographic patterns of genetic variation agree with previous taxonomic subdivisions within each species and the origin of outer islands populations is clearly tracked.
these factors could include different habitats/resources available within each island group, niche differentiation and/or character displacement.
molecular data corroborated the existence of two main lineages, corresponding to the two currently recognized species.
we found no evidence of current gene flow between species, but results pointed to the possibility of gene flow between  subspecies.
our results highlight not only the necessity of clarifying the role of ecology and interspecific interactions in this groupâ€™s morphological diversification and community assemblage, but also the importance of co-evolutionary mechanisms and their importance for appropriate conservation of island biodiversity.
lying in a shallow continental shelf cyclically affected by oscillating sea levels since the miocene, the seychelles islands are particularly interesting for evolutionary studies.
populations from outer islands share mtdna haplotypes with inner island populations, suggesting very recent dispersals .
here we aimed to obtain a detailed depiction of the genetic structure and evolution of one of the most widespread vertebrate groups in the archipelago: the day-geckos of the genus phelsuma.
