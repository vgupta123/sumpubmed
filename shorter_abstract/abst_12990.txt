this study investigated whether common electrolytes will affect the hemolysins of candida species.
the hemolysins from  <dig> candida isolates were investigated using a plate specially designed for candida species in the presence of three electrolytes, cacl <dig>  nacl and kcl, at different concentrations.
our findings indicate that electrolytes reduce hemolysis by candida species and a correlation exists between the peripheral hemolytic index and the translucent hemolytic index.
significant differences existed between varying concentrations of nacl, while no significant differences existed for the cacl <dig> and kcl groups.
additionally, the peripheral hemolytic index was highly correlated with the hemolytic index .
the hemolytic activity was determined after 48Â h and the hemolytic index was calculated.
all three electrolytes caused a decrease in the hemolytic activity.
hemolysins are crucial virulence factors which help pathogens to survive and persist in the host.
