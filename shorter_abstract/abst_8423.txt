further physical mapping showed that  <dig> degs were co-localized with the  <dig> fl qtl identified in the bil population containing the two bils.
among the three candidate genes encoding for proline-rich protein, d-cysteine desulfhydrase, and thaumatin-like protein, a snp of thaumatin-like protein gene showed consistent correlations with fl across all testing environments.
the candidate genes may serve as the foundation for further in-depth studies of the molecular mechanism of natural variation in fiber elongation.
cotton  fibers are single-celled elongated trichomes, the molecular aspects of genetic variation in fiber length  among genotypes are currently unknown.
the two bils differed in  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for fl and were developed from backcrosses between g. hirsutum as the recurrent parent and g. barbadense.
four snp markers in  <dig> degs that showed significant correlations with fl were developed.
this study represents one of the first investigations of positional candidate gene approach of qtl in cotton in integrating transcriptome and snp identification based on rna-seq with linkage and physical mapping of qtl and genes, which will facilitate eventual cloning and identification of genes responsible for fl qtl.
