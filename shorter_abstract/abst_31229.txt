in p. falciparum, this activity is a limiting step in the pathway of synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from serine and plays an important role in the development, replication and survival of the parasite within human red blood cells.
in addition to hexadecyltrimethylammonium, previously known to inhibit pfpmt, two compounds dodecyltrimethylammonium and amodiaquine were also found to inhibit pfpmt activity in vitro.
interestingly, pfpmt activity was not inhibited by the amodiaquine analog, chloroquine, or other aminoquinolines, amino alcohols, or histamine methyltransferase inhibitors.
we have employed an enzyme-coupled methylation assay to screen for potential inhibitors of pfpmt.
the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, pfpmt, of the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, a member of a newly identified family of phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases  found solely in some protozoa, nematodes, frogs, and plants, is involved in the synthesis of the major membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine.
using yeast as a surrogate system we found that unlike wild-type cells, yeast mutants that rely on pfpmt for survival were sensitive to amodiaquine, and their phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was inhibited by this compound.
