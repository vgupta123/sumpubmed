htjoinsolver can rapidly identify v- and j-segments with indels to high accuracy for mutated sequences when the mutation probability is around 30% and 20% respectively.
the d-segment is much harder to fit even at 20% mutation probability.
in our simulations, which include rearrangements with indels, the v-matching success rate improved from 61% for partial alignments of sequences with indels in the original algorithm to over 99% in the approximate algorithm.
our new algorithm enhances the former joinsolver algorithm by processing sequences with insertions and/or deletions  and improves the efficiency for large datasets provided by high throughput sequencing.
an improvement in the alignment of human vdj rearrangements over the initial joinsolver algorithm was also seen when compared to the stanford.s <dig> human ig dataset with an online vdj partitioning software evaluation tool.
for all segments, the probability of correctly matching v, d, and j increases with our alignment score.
