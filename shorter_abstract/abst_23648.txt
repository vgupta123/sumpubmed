in the id protocol, animals showed a marked shift from ll to ss reward when delay increased, and this despite adverse consequences on the total amount of food obtained.
in the id task, the aversion to delay was anti-economical and reflected impulsivity.
it has been suggested that pd protocols also measure impulsivity, however, a clear dissociation has been reported between delay and probability discounting.
in summary, present data do indicate the need to interpret choice behavior in id and pd protocols differently.
in the pd protocol, animals developed a stable preference for lll reward, and maintained it even when ss and lll options were predicted and demonstrated to become indifferent.
in the pd task, preference for large reward was maintained despite its uncertain delivery, suggesting a strong attraction for unitary rewards of great magnitude.
the pd task is suggested not to reflect impulsive behavior, and to generate patterns of choice that rather resemble the features of gambling.
uncertain delivery generated no aversion, when compared to delays producing an equivalent level of large-reward rarefaction.
