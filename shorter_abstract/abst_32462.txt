released under the gnu gpl open source license, musite provides an open and extensible framework for phosphorylation-site prediction.
more than a dozen phosphorylation-site prediction tools have been released in the past decade.
however, there is currently no open-source framework specifically designed for phosphorylation-site prediction except musite.
here we present the musite open-source framework for building applications to perform machine learning based phosphorylation-site prediction.
with the rapid accumulation of phosphoproteomics data, phosphorylation-site prediction is becoming an increasingly active research area.
with its well-designed java application programming interface , musite can be easily extended to integrate various sources of biological evidence for phosphorylation-site prediction.
