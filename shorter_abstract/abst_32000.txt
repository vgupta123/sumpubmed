our results demonstrate that rhoa/rock <dig> signaling play critical roles in the transition of cell activity from autophagy to apoptosis in arv s1133-infected cells.
beclin- <dig> knockdown and treatment with autophagy inhibitors, 3-ma and bafilomycin a <dig>  suppressed arv s1133-induced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously, suggesting the shift from autophagy to apoptosis.
arv s <dig> infection caused autophagy in the early to middle infectious stages in vero and df <dig> cells, and apoptosis in the middle to late stages.
a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the formation of a rhoa, rock <dig> and beclin- <dig> complex coincided with the induction of autophagy.
levels of rhoa-gtp and rock <dig> activity were elevated upon arv s <dig> infection, while inhibition of rhoa and rock <dig> reduced autophagy and subsequent apoptosis.
in the present study, the signaling pathways involved in arv s <dig> regulated switch from autophagy to apoptosis were investigated.
conversion of the autophagy marker lc3-i to lc3-ii occurred earlier than cleavage of the apoptotic marker caspase- <dig>  arv s <dig> also activated the beclin- <dig> promoter in the early to middle stages of infection.
