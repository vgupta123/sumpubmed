using a regulatory impact factor metric analysis, this regulatory network was further confirmed at the transcription factor and mirna levels.
for this reason, the serum metabolome and whole-blood transcriptome and mirnome data were obtained from ten horses before and after a 160 km endurance competition.
in an extended cohort of  <dig> independent animals, multiple factor analysis confirmed the strong associations between lactate, methylene derivatives, mir-21-5p, mir-16-5p, let- <dig> family and genes that coded proteins involved in metabolic reactions primarily related to energy, ubiquitin proteasome and lipopolysaccharide immune responses after the endurance competition.
multiple factor analysis also identified potential biomarkers at t <dig> for an increased likelihood for failure to finish an endurance competition.
we obtained a global regulatory network based on  <dig> unique metabolites,  <dig> metabolic genes and  <dig> mirnas whose expression was significantly altered at t <dig>  relative to t <dig> .
we hypothesized that the identification of the relationships between blood metabolome, transcriptome, and mirnome during endurance exercise in horses could provide significant insights into the molecular response to endurance exercise.
to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide a comprehensive and integrated overview of the metabolome, transcriptome, and mirnome co-regulatory networks that may have a key role in regulating the metabolic and immune response to endurance exercise in horses.
this network provided new insights into the cross talk between the distinct molecular pathways  that were not detectable when analyzing single metabolites or transcripts alone.
