following a preliminary screening of the transformants with increased uox activity in permeabilized yeast cells the optimal cultivation conditions for maximal uox yield namely a 40-fold increase in uox activity were determined.
the construction of uricase  producing yeast by over-expression of the uricase gene of h. polymorpha is described.
a strain of h. polymorpha overproducing uox was constructed.
the detection and quantification of uric acid in human physiological fluids is of great importance in the diagnosis and therapy of patients suffering from a range of disorders associated with altered purine metabolism, most notably gout and hyperuricaemia.
a high urate selectivity with a detection limit of about  <dig> Î¼m was found.
the fabrication of cheap and reliable urate-selective amperometric biosensors is a challenging task.
the uox producing cells were coupled to horseradish peroxidase and immobilized on graphite electrodes by physical entrapment behind a dialysis membrane.
