we analyze the signal processing in our model to elucidate different aspects of the coupling.
we then build on the basic model structure and examine the effects of additional control regulation, switch-like signal processing, and spatial signalling.
we show how different kinds of responses, including "ultrasensitive" and adaptive responses, may occur in this setting.
in this paper we develop a basic modelling and systems framework in a general setting for understanding the coupling of processes and pathways through shared components.
