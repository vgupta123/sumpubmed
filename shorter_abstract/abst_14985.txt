while the expression outputs following stimulation by rich glucose medium or by glucose alone are qualitatively similar, the response to rich medium is stronger.
exit from dormancy results in rapid and global changes consisting of different sequential gene expression subprograms.
we also identified a network of transcription factors that may be regulating the global response.
spore germination of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a multi-step developmental path on which dormant spores re-enter the mitotic cell cycle and resume vegetative growth.
employing detailed gene expression time course data we have analysed the reprogramming of dormant spores during the transition to proliferation stimulated by a rich growth medium or pure glucose.
resumption of growth in germinating spores is characterized by a highly synchronized temporal organisation of up- and down-regulated genes which reflects the metabolic reshaping of the quickening spores.
upon addition of a fermentable carbon source and nutrients, the outer layers of the protective spore wall are locally degraded, the tightly packed spore gains volume and an elongated shape, and eventually the germinating spore re-enters the cell cycle.
moreover, spores sense and react to amino acid starvation within the first  <dig> min after germination initiation, and this response can be linked to specific transcription factors.
here we characterize the global gene expression profiles of germinating spores and identify potential transcriptional regulators of this process with the aim to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transition from cellular dormancy to proliferation.
the regulated genes reflect the transition towards glucose metabolism, the resumption of growth and the release of stress, similar to cells exiting a stationary growth phase.
