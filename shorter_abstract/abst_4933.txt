importantly, our pipeline discovers broad peaks as well as the fine structure of individual transcriptional start sites embedded within them.
we demonstrate that genes have complicated structures of transcription initiation events.
we propose a pipeline to group the single nucleotide tss into larger reproducible peaks and compare their usage across biological states.
among these, cap analysis of gene expression  is specialized in detecting the most 5â€™ ends of rna molecules.
we assess the performance of our approach on a large cage datasets including  <dig> primary cell types and two cell lines with biological replicas.
in particular, we discover that narrow peaks embedded in broader regions of transcriptional activity can be differentially used even if the larger region is not.
by examining the reproducible fine scaled organization of tss we can detect many differentially regulated peaks undetected by previous approaches.
