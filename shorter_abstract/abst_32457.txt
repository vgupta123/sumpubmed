thyanta perditor , edessa meditabunda , loxa deducta  and pellaea stictica  were all associated with three families.
many phylotypes shared a low 16s rrna gene similarity with their closest type strains and formed new phyletic lines on the periphery of several genera.
this is a strong indicative that stinkbug caeca can harbor new species of actinobacteria, which might be derived from specific associations with the species of stinkbugs studied.
piezodorus guildini  and nezara viridula  had the lowest diversity, being associated with two  and one  families, respectively.
dichelops melacanthus held the highest diversity with six actinobacteria families represented by nine phylotypes.
a total of  <dig> phylotypes were placed in  <dig> different actinobacteria families.
