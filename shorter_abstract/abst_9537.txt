we previously identified two hydrolyzable tannins, chebulagic acid  and punicalagin  that blocked herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  entry and spread.
chla and pug were effective in abrogating infection by human cytomegalovirus , hepatitis c virus , dengue virus , measles virus , and respiratory syncytial virus , at Î¼m concentrations and in dose-dependent manners without significant cytotoxicity.
moreover, the natural compounds inhibited viral attachment, penetration, and spread, to different degrees for each virus.
based on this property, we evaluated their antiviral efficacy against several different viruses known to employ gags for host cell entry.
chla and pug may be of value as broad-spectrum antivirals for limiting emerging/recurring viruses known to engage host cell gags for entry.
