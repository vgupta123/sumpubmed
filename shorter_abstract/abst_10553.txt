this first report on genome-wide binding of lxr in a human cell line provides new insights into the transcriptional network of lxr and its target genes with their link to physiological processes, such as apoptosis.
our results show that lxr actions are focused on  <dig> genomic regions that contain up to  <dig> t <dig> target genes per region under the control of highly stringent lxr binding sites with individual constellations for each region.
we could confirm that lxr controls lipid metabolism and transport and observed a strong association with apoptosis-related functions.
the liver x receptors  are oxysterol sensing nuclear receptors with multiple effects on metabolism and immune cells.
