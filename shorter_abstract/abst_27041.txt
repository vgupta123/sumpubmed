bs-seeker <dig> improves mappability over existing aligners by using local alignment.
libraries such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing  and reduced represented bisulfite sequencing  are widely used for generating dna methylomes, demanding efficient and versatile tools for aligning bisulfite sequencing data.
we have developed bs-seeker <dig>  an updated version of bs seeker, as a full pipeline for mapping bisulfite sequencing data and generating dna methylomes.
we also defined cgmap and atcgmap file formats for full representations of dna methylomes, as part of the outputs of bs-seeker <dig> pipeline together with bam and wig files.
our evaluations on the performance show that bs-seeker <dig> works efficiently and accurately for both wgbs data and rrbs data.
moreover, bs-seeker <dig> provides additional function for filtering out reads with incomplete bisulfite conversion, which is useful in minimizing the overestimation of dna methylation levels.
it can also map reads from rrbs library by building special indexes with improved efficiency and accuracy.

dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes.
bisulfite treatment coupled with high-throughput sequencing provides an effective approach for studying genome-wide dna methylation at base resolution.
bs-seeker <dig> is freely available at http://pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/bs_seeker2/ and the galaxy server.
