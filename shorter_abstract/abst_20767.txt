homeostatic processes, encompassing control of gene expression, apoptosis, and protein synthesis, were identified as disrupted during alzheimer’s disease.
this approach identified the androgen and estrogen receptors as key components and regulators of the disrupted homeostatic processes.
focusing on the genes carrying out these functions, a protein-protein interaction network was produced for graph theory and cluster exploration.
our systems biology approach was able to identify the importance of the androgen and estrogen receptors in not only homeostatic cellular processes but also the role of other highly central genes in alzheimer’s neuronal dysfunction.
therefore we performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing hippocampal neurons in alzheimer’s disease to controls.
