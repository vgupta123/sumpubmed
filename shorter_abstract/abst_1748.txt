complete genome level analyses of multiple carriage strains of s. aureus will be important in clarifying molecular determinants of s. aureus nasal carriage.
we have identified unique immunological and ultrastructural properties associated with nasal carriage isolates denoting a role for bacterial factors in nasal carriage.
mlst analysis revealed no lineage specific differences between carrier and non-carrier strains suggesting a role for mobile genetic elements.
these genes, along with a putative pathogenicity island  present uniquely in the carrier strains are likely important in affecting carriage.
comparison revealed the presence of  <dig> genes unique to the carrier strain and strongly suggests a role for type vii secretion systems in nasal carriage.
however, despite extensive molecular level characterizations by several groups suggesting factors necessary for colonization on nasal epithelium, genetic determinants of nasal carriage are unknown.
herein, we have set a genomic foundation for unraveling the bacterial determinants of nasal carriage in s. aureus.
further, pcr-based genotyping of other clinical isolates for a specific subset of these  <dig> genes raise the possibility of nasal carriage being caused by multiple gene sets.
nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus is a major risk factor in clinical and community settings due to the range of etiologies caused by the organism.
we completely sequenced a model carrier isolate  and a model non-carrier strain  to identify differential gene content.
