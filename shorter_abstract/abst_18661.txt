the isolation of unknown dna sequences flanked by known sequences is an important task in the event-specific detection of gmos.
the detection limit of the qualitative pcr assay was  <dig>  % for av43-6-g <dig> potato in 100 ng of potato genomic dna, corresponding to approximately  <dig>  copies of the potato haploid genome.
the flanking sequence between the exogenous fragment and recombinant chromosome of this potato was successfully acquired through exogenous gene 5′-race.
none of event-specific detection method was developed based on the junction sequence of an exogenous integrant in the transgenic potato av43-6-g <dig>
these results indicated that these event-specific methods would be useful for the identification of potato av43-6-g <dig>
the event-specific primers and taqman probe were designed to amplify fragments spanning the exogenous dna and potato genomic dna.
the ddpcr assays for potato av43-6-g <dig> achieved a limit of quantification of approximately  <dig> target copies, with rsd ≤ 25 %.
