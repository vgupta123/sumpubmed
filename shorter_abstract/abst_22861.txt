one of these genes, hecw <dig>  plays an important role in ubiquitination, a prerequisite for chromatin remodelling and acrosome formation, highlighting the involvement of this gene in the knobbed acrosome defect and male infertility.
in the finnish yorkshire pig population a knobbed acrosome defect  has been reported which appears to be of genetic origin.
correct condensation of the sperm head and development of the acrosome are required for fertile sperm.
this type of kad appears to be a previously unknown and serious form of the defect.
the expression of these genes appeared comparable in ka-affected and control boars.
male infertility is an increasing problem in all domestic species including man.
localization and identification of genes involved in defects causing male infertility provide valuable information of specific events in sperm development.
the known function of hecw <dig> in acrosome development highlighted this gene as a good candidate responsible for the kad.
characterization of the knobbed acrosome affected sperm revealed that both the acrosomal granules and chromatin are affected.
however, as this mutation was found in homozygous state in individuals with normal sperm, this is not likely to be the causal mutation.
