in silico analysis revealed more than  <dig> potential targets for the conserved and novel mirnas.
we catalogued and analysed the melon srnas, resulting in the identification of  <dig> known mirna families , the prediction of  <dig> melon-specific mirna candidates, the identification of trans-acting sirnas, and the identification of chloroplast, mitochondrion and transposon-derived srnas.
we constructed  <dig> srna libraries from two stages of developing ovaries, fruits and photosynthetic cotyledons infected with viruses, and carried out high-throughput pyrosequencing.
in plants, they regulate gene expression and heterochromatin assembly, and control protection against virus infection.
the melon research community has recently benefited from the determination of a complete draft genome sequence and the development of associated genomic tools, which have allowed us to focus on small rnas .
