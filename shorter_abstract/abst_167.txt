we used physical map of wheat chromosome arm 3ds to validate the method with two different dna sequence datasets.
here we present a novel approach for anchoring physical maps, based on sequencing three-dimensional pools of bac clones from minimum tilling path.
the existing genetic markers as well as any other dna sequence could be mapped to bac clones in a single in silico experiment.
we demonstrate the utility of the novel approach for bac contig anchoring based on mass parallel sequencing of three-dimensional pools prepared from minimum tilling path of physical map.
physical maps created from large insert dna libraries, typically cloned in bac vector, are valuable resources for map-based cloning and de novo genome sequencing.
the approach reduces significantly the cost and time needed for anchoring and is applicable to any genomic project involving the construction of anchored physical map.

mapping of sequence reads from individual bac pools to the first and the second datasets enabled unambiguous anchoring  <dig> and  <dig> 3ds-specific sequences, respectively, or  <dig> in total.
the maps are most useful if contigs of overlapping dna clones are anchored to chromosome, and ordered along them using molecular markers.
