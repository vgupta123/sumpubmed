altogether, our protocols and resources support the fast and direct generation of new rosa <dig> knock-in alleles and of cas9-mediated in vivo gene editing in the widely used c57bl/ <dig> inbred strain.
using this approach, we established a new mouse line for the cre/loxp-dependent expression of cas <dig>
here we applied crispr/cas <dig> for the knock-in of 8–11 kb inserts into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes.
the crispr/cas <dig> system is increasingly used for gene inactivation in mouse zygotes, but homology-directed mutagenesis and use of inbred embryos are less established.
we found that 10–20 % of live pups derived from microinjected zygotes were founder mutants, without apparent off-target effects, and up to 50 % knock-in embryos were recovered upon coinjection of cas <dig> mrna and protein.
