however, a detailed analysis of the expression patterns of the gro/tle proteins in pancreas development has not been performed.
taken together our studies suggest that gro/tle proteins play a role in the repression of target genes during endocrine cell specification.
many transcription factors critical to pancreas development contain a gro/tle interaction domain and several have been shown to require gro/tle interactions for proper function during neuronal development.
the full-length mammalian homologs of groucho, tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  act as transcriptional corepressors and are recruited by transcription factors containing an eh <dig> or wrpw/y domain.
we describe the expression of gro/tle family members, and of  <dig> different transcription factors that contain a gro/tle interaction motif, in the pancreas utilizing nine sage libraries created from the developing and adult pancreas, as well as the genepaint database.
finally, we demonstrate that tle <dig> modulates the repressive abilities of arx in a β-cell line.
moreover, little is known about the ability of gro/tle proteins to interact with transcription factors in the pancreas.
although tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show overlapping expression in pancreatic progenitors and in the adult islet, the expression of these factors is restricted to different cell types during endocrine cell maturation.
next, we show the dynamic expression of tle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> during pancreas development by qrt-pcr.
we then show that tle <dig> can interact with nkx2- <dig>  hes <dig>  arx, and nkx6- <dig> which are all critical factors in pancreas development.
of note, tle <dig> and tle <dig> are co-expressed with gro/tle interaction domain containing transcription factors that are essential for endocrine pancreas development.
to further define the cell-type specificity of the expression of these proteins we use immunofluorescence to co-localize them with pdx <dig> at embryonic day  <dig>  , ngn <dig> at e <dig> , pdx <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin at e <dig> , as well as insulin and glucagon in the adult.
