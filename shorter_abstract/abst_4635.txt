the observed metabolic responses could be explained to a large degree by upregulation of gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate shunt as well as changes in amino acid catabolism.
we examined three classes of long-lived worms: dauer larvae, adult insulin/igf- <dig> signalling -defective mutants, and a translation-defective mutant.
in addition the dauer larvae, uniquely, had elevated levels of modified amino acids .
these responses point to new possible mechanisms of longevity assurance in worms.
however, up until now there has been no systematic investigation of how the metabolic networks of long-lived mutants differ from those of normal worms.
surprisingly, these ostensibly different long-lived worms share a common metabolic signature, dominated by shifts in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.
the metabolic changes observed in dauer larvae can be explained by the existence of high levels of autophagy leading to recycling of cellular components.
