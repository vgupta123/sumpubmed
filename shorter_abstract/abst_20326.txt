the advent of next-generation sequencing methods allows the investigation of rare variants otherwise hidden deep in large populations, but requires attention to population diversity and primer localization in relatively conserved regions, in addition to recognized constraints typically considered in primer design.
design constraints include degenerate sites to maximize population coverage, matching of melting temperatures, optimizing de novo sequence length, finding optimal bio-barcodes to allow efficient downstream analyses, and minimizing risk of dimerization.
primer design for highly variable dna sequences is difficult, and experimental success requires attention to many interacting constraints.
to facilitate primer design addressing these and other constraints, we created a novel computer program  that automates this complex procedure.
