we have also developed a disorder predictor gsmetadisorder3d that used no third-party disorder predictors, but alignments to known protein structures, reported by the protein fold-recognition methods, to infer the potentially structured and unstructured regions.
as of december  <dig>  approximately  <dig> methods for computational prediction of protein disorder from sequence have been made publicly available.
they are based on different approaches, such as utilizing evolutionary information, energy functions, and various statistical and machine learning methods.
intrinsically unstructured proteins  lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure.
results are presented both in an easily interpretable, interactive mode and in a simple text format suitable for machine processing.
a series of disorder predictors described in this article is available as a metadisorder web server at http://iimcb.genesilico.pl/metadisorder/.
we developed a method based on arbitrarily chosen  <dig> disorder predictors, in which the final consensus was weighted by the accuracy of the methods.
following the success of our disorder predictors in the casp <dig> benchmark, we combined them into a meta-meta predictor called gsmetadisordermd, which was the top scoring method in the subsequent casp <dig> benchmark.
some of them may assume a locally stable structure under specific conditions, e.g.
