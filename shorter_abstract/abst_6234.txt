using a newly developed agilent 10 k custom-made oligonucleotide array, we profiled components of the transcriptome involved in immune defence as well as germline and muscle development during early developmental stages: 8-cell embryos , germ ring stage , 10-somite stage , and hatched embryos .
we have demonstrated maternal transfer of innate and adaptive immune system transcripts into atlantic halibut embryos and their relation with future embryo developmental potential.
we identified several transcripts as potential molecular markers of embryo quality.
twenty transcripts were differentially expressed in 8-cell embryos between low and high quality egg groups.
commercial atlantic halibut  farming is restricted by variable oocyte quality, slow growth, and early maturation of male fish.
the developed microarray represents a useful resource for improving the commercial production of atlantic halibut.
in addition, we identified differentially expressed transcripts in low  and high  quality eggs at 8cs to identify potential maternal markers for embryo quality.
