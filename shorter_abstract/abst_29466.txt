the protein kinase ck <dig> plays an important role in diverse biological processes, including cell growth and proliferation as well as in the governing and transduction of prosurvival signals.
chip analysis demonstrated that both drugs arrest rnapii elongation.
finally, we show that cdk <dig> kinase activity, essential for the triggering of rnapii elongation, was blocked by tbbz and to lesser degree by dmat.
aberrant activation of protein kinases is one of the essential oncogenic driving forces inherent to the process of tumorigenesis.
our approach revealed that small molecules derived from halogenated imidazole compounds may decrease cell proliferation, in part, by inhibiting pathways that regulate transcription elongation.
using a high-throughput microarray approach, we demonstrate that two potent inhibitors of ck <dig>   <dig> , <dig> -tetrabromo-benzimidazole  and 2-dimethyloamino- <dig> , <dig> -tetrabromo-1h-benzimidazole , blocked mitogen induced mrna expression of immediate early genes.
