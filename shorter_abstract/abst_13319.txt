this assay simultaneously detects  <dig> genes namely 16s rrna of enterococcus genus, ddl of e. faecalis and e. faecium, aaca-aphd that encodes high level gentamicin resistance , multilevel vancomycin resistant genotypes such as vana, vanb, vanc and vand and one internal control gene.
the presence of an internal control in the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay helped us to rule out false negative cases.
the diagnostic accuracy was determined using  <dig> clinical specimens, which showed that 97% of the clinical isolates belonged to e. faecalis, of which 26% showed the hlgr genotype, but none were vancomycin resistant.
the sensitivity and specificity of v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay was evaluated against the conventional culture method.
the most common enterococci strains present in clinical isolates are e. faecalis and e. faecium which have acquired resistant to either gentamicin or vancomycin.
the analytical sensitivity of the assay was found to be  <dig> ng at the dna level while the analytical specificity was evaluated with  <dig> reference enterococci and non-enterococcal strains and was found to be 100%.
hence our present study was focused on developing a nanoplex pcr assay for the rapid detection of vancomycin and bifunctional aminoglycoside resistant enterococci .
the nanoplex pcr assay is robust and can give results within  <dig> hours about the  <dig> genes that are essential for the identification of the most common enterococcus spp.
the pcr assay developed in this study can be used as an effective surveillance tool to study the prevalence of enterococci and their antibiotic resistance pattern in hospitals and farm animals.
