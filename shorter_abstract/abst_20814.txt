bottlenecks still impeding a routine implementation - from restricted peptide lengths, low diversity and low array densities to high costs - could so be overcome.
interactions were technically confirmed by fluorescence polarization as well as biolayer-interferometry, and their potential suitability as novel detection tags evaluated by detection of a peptide-fused exemplary test protein.
recombinant peptide chips could constitute a versatile complementation to state-of-the-art in situ  synthesis, particle-based printing, or pre-manufactured peptide spotting.
