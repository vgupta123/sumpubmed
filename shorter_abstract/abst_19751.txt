immunofluorescence experiments revealed that kbp was mainly localized to mitochondria, as has been described for kif1bα.
such an effect is probably due to the lower activity of kif1bα in the absence of kbp, as was revealed in motility assays.
overexpression of a deletion mutant or reduction of the kbp protein level using an anti-sense construct led to an aggregation of mitochondria.
members of the kinesin- <dig> family of kinesin-like proteins mediate transport of axonal vesicles , distribution of mitochondria  and anterograde golgi to er vesicle transport .
until now, little is known about the regulation of kinesin-like proteins.
