to identify genes associated with al stress and tolerance, transcriptome analyses of four different wheat lines  that differ in their response to al were performed.
the stress-associated genes include important enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, alternative oxidase, and galactonolactone oxidase, abc transporter and ascorbate oxido-reducatase.
aluminum is considered the most limiting factor for plant productivity in acidic soils, which cover large areas of the world's potential arable lands.
in this survey, we identified stress- and tolerance-associated genes that may be involved in the detoxification of al and reactive oxygen species.
the inhibition of root growth is recognized as the primary effect of al toxicity.
alternative pathways could help maintain the supply of important metabolites  needed for al tolerance and root growth.
