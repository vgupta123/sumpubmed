the gut microbiota of insects plays a remarkable role in the host life and understanding the relationship dynamics between insects and their microbiota may improve the biological control of insect pests.
unexpectedly, acetic acid bacteria , that are known to establish symbiotic associations with insects relying on sugar-based diets, were not detected.
more than half of the reads could be classified at the genus level and eight bacterial genera were detected in the larval rpw gut at an abundance â‰¥1%: dysgonomonas , lactococcus , salmonella , enterobacter , budvicia , entomoplasma , bacteroides  and comamonas .
these bacteria are supposedly responsible for palm tissue fermentation in the tunnels where rpw larvae thrive and might have a key role in the insect nutrition, and other functions that need to be investigated.
the rpw gut microbiota is composed mainly of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria with a fermentative metabolism.
the 16s rrna gene-based temporal thermal gradient gel electrophoresis  of the gut microbiota of rpw field-trapped larvae revealed low bacterial diversity and stability of the community over seasons and among pools of larvae from different host trees.
high abundance of enterobacteriaceae was also detected by culturing under aerobic conditions.
the larvae bore into the palm trunk and feed on the palm tender tissues and sap, leading the host tree to death.
the purpose of this study was to analyse the diversity of the gut microbiota of field-caught rpw larvae sampled in sicily .
