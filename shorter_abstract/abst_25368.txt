to test whether this observed ensemble conformational change is sequence dependent, we did a control simulation with a hypothetical sequence with 50% proline and 50% serine in alternating residues.
this elongation could relieve conformational auto-inhibition of the ppppx motif binding sites and allow gsk <dig> and ck <dig> to approach their phosphorylation sites, thereby activating lrp <dig> and the downstream pathway.
lrp <dig> is a membrane protein crucial in the initiation of canonical wnt/Î²-catenin signalling.
in our study, we use a computational simulation tool to sample the conformational space of the lrp <dig> intracellular domain, under the spatial constraints imposed by  the membrane and  the close approach of the neighboring intracellular molecular complex, which is assembled on frizzled when wnt binds to both lrp <dig> and frizzled on the opposite side of the membrane.
