the unusual conservation pattern was also found in some of the sssgp cdnas from the asian rice gall midge, but not from the orange wheat blossom midge.
during characterization of genes and transcripts encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins  from the hessian fly, we found exactly the opposite pattern of conservation in several families of genes: the non-coding regions were highly conserved, but the coding regions were highly variable.
except for sssgp-1a <dig>  a gene that encodes a protein identical to that encoded by sssgp-1a <dig>  the other six genes consist of a highly diversified, mature protein-coding region as well as highly conserved regions including the promoter, 5'- and 3'-utrs, a signal peptide coding region, and an intron.
this report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes.
the conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood.
rapid diversification in mature sssgps suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation.
strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence conservation.
