in p. aeruginosa, β-lactamase induction occurs in at least three ways, induction at low β-lactam concentrations by an as yet uncharacterized pathway, at intermediate concentrations by an ampp and ampg dependent pathway, and at high concentrations where although both ampp and ampg play a role, ampg may be of greater importance.
together, these data suggest that the mechanism of β-lactam resistance of p. aeruginosa is distinct from well characterized systems in enterobacteriaceae and involves a highly complicated interaction between these putative permeases and known amp proteins.
mutation of ampg affects resistance to a subset of β-lactam antibiotics.
pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig> has two ampg paralogs, pa <dig>  and pa <dig> .
topology analysis using β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase fusions indicates ampp and ampg encode proteins which possess  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane helices, respectively, that could potentially transport substrates.
similar to ampc, ampp expression is inducible in an ampr-dependent manner.
importantly, ampp expression is autoregulated and ampp also regulates expression of ampg.
low-levels of β-lactamase induction occur independently of either ampp or ampg.
both ampg and ampp are the second members of two independent two-gene operons.
both ampp and ampg are required for maximum expression of β-lactamase, but complementation and kinetic experiments suggest they act independently to play different roles.
both ampp and ampg are required for maximum induction.
