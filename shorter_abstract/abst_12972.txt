although gene duplication plays a major role in genome evolution, studies regarding concerted evolution events among gene family members have been limited in scope and restricted to protein-coding regions, where high sequence similarity is easily detectable.
these concerted evolution events occurred within and between genes from three separate protein families , which often are expressed in mammalian brains and associated with receptor mediated signalling and apoptosis.
the motif has undergone concerted evolution events independently of its neighbouring protein-coding regions, leading to formation of evolutionary chimaeric genes.
despite high protein-coding divergence among mammalian-specific genes, we identified a dna motif common to these genes' 5' utr exons.
these events have led to the generation of chimaeric genes, each with a 5' utr and a protein-coding region that possess independent evolutionary histories.
we suggest that concerted evolution has occurred via gene conversion independently in different mammalian lineages, and these events have resulted in elevated g+c levels in the encompassing genomic regions.
many of these are highly divergent in their protein-coding regions yet contain a conserved sequence motif in their 5' utrs which appears to have been maintained by multiple events of concerted evolution.
