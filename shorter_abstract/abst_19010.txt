ebp1-/- mice were on average 30% smaller than wild type and heterozygous sex matched littermates.
the ebp1-/- mouse line represents a new in vivo model to investigate ebp <dig> function in the whole organism.
the erbb <dig> binding protein- <dig>  belongs to a family of dna/rna binding proteins implicated in cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation.
microarray expression analysis revealed changes in genes important in cell growth including members of the mapk signal transduction pathway.
therefore, we generated ebp1-deficient mice carrying a gene trap insertion in intron  <dig> of the ebp <dig>  gene.
these results indicate that ebp <dig> can affect growth in an animal model, but that the expression of proliferation related genes is cell and context specific.
growth retardation was apparent from day  <dig> until day  <dig>  igf- <dig> production and igbp- <dig> and  <dig> protein levels were reduced in both embryo fibroblasts and adult knock-out mice.
the proliferation of fibroblasts derived from day  <dig>  knock out embryos was also decreased as compared to that of wild type cells.
however, the physiological role of ebp <dig> in the whole organism is not known.
in addition, the expression or activation of proliferation related genes such as akt and the androgen receptor, previously demonstrated to be affected by ebp <dig> expression in vitro, was altered in adult tissues.
