the results indicate that the tolerance to low p of ccm <dig> is mainly due to the rapid responsiveness to p stress and efficient elimination of ros.
determination of root-secretory apase activities showed that the induction of apase by p stress occurred much earlier in ccm <dig> than that in  <dig>  gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes  and cat/pod activities between ccm <dig> and  <dig> under p-sufficient and -deficient conditions demonstrated that ccm <dig> has a greater ability to eliminate reactive oxygen species  than  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> mirnas in roots and  <dig> mirnas in shoots, including mirna399s, were identified as degs between ccm <dig> and  <dig>
our findings increase the understanding of the molecular events involved in the diversity of responses to p stress among maize accessions.
although macro/microarray technologies have greatly increased our general knowledge of maize responses to p stress, a greater understanding of the diversity of responses in maize genotypes is still needed.
we then generated  <dig> strand-specific rna libraries from shoots and roots of ccm <dig> and  <dig> that had been subjected to p stress for  <dig> and 8Â days.
in this study, we first evaluated the tolerance to low p of  <dig> accessions under field conditions, and selected the low p-tolerant line ccm <dig> and the low p-sensitive line  <dig> for further research.
the p deficiency-responsive genes common to ccm <dig> and  <dig> were involved in various metabolic processes, including acid phosphatase  activity.
