this discovery demonstrates complex mechanisms involved with polyploid cottonâ€™s transcriptome response to naturally occurring field water deficit stress.
in this study, we detected differentially expressed transcript derived fragments from water deficit stressed root and leaf tissues in tetraploid cotton and provided their gene ontology, functional/biological distribution, and possible roles of gene duplication.
a global expression analysis using cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism was conducted to compare root and leaf gene expression profiles from a putative drought resistant cotton cultivar grown under water deficit stressed and well watered field conditions.
of these,  <dig> transcript derived fragment sequences were functionally annotated according to their gene ontology.
in this study, our objective was to identify differentially expressed genes in response to water deficit stress in cotton.
we found heat shock protein-related and reactive oxygen species-related transcript derived fragments to be among the major parts of functional pathways induced by water deficit stress.
also, twelve novel transcripts were identified as both water deficit responsive and cotton specific.
differential expression analysis also identified five pairs of duplicated transcript derived fragments in which four pairs responded differentially between each of their two homologues under water deficit stress.
nearly  <dig> percent of transcript derived fragments belonged to four major categories: 1) unclassified, 2) stress/defense, 3) metabolism, and 4) gene regulation.
