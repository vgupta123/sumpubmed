the proposed gene set can constitute a `malignancy marker` that could help to distinguish the most malignant canine mammary carcinomas.
analysis of gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinoma of various grade of malignancy followed by the boosted tree analysis distinguished a `gene set`.
there are significant differences in survival between cases with different tumor grades.
despite this `gene set` is very interesting as an additional tool to estimate canine mammary malignancy, it should be validated using higher number of samples.
unfortunately, the distinction between various grades is not clear.
a major problem in evaluating canine mammary cancer is identifying those, that are “truly” malignant.
so far, only two of them were linked with the cancer development.
that is why the aim of our study was to find the new markers of canine malignancy, which could help to diagnose the most malignant tumors.
the expression of this gene set  differs significantly in the most malignant tumors at mrna level as well as at protein level.
