on the other hand, the reticular alignment search strategy together with sophisticated scoring schemes  overcome fsa and in some accuracy measurement, even mafft.
we implemented the program in the java programming language, and tested it on the balibase database.
the larger the threshold parameter and thus the network, the deeper the search in the alignment space for better scored alignments.
the program contains a threshold parameter on which the size of the network depends.
instead, it defines a set of optimal and suboptimal alignments at each step during the progressive alignment.
reticular alignment is an efficient search strategy for finding accurate multiple alignments.
however, this set-up is not sufficient for outperforming other cutting-edge alignment methods.
reticular alignment can outperform clustalw even if a very simple scoring scheme  is implemented and merely the threshold value is increased.
unlike previous corner-cutting methods, our approach does not define a compact part of the dynamic programming table.
in this paper, we introduce a progressive corner cutting method called reticular alignment for multiple sequence alignment.
