predictive studies concerning the theoretical proteins identified that orf <dig> protein would be a phosphatase involved in dna repair and that the orf <dig> protein would be a membrane polypeptide associated with cell transport.
the sfcola genome was thus revealed to be a natural recombinant virus showing evidence of recent horizontal gene transfer between different baculovirus species occurring in nature.
spodoptera frugiperda , the fall armyworm, represents a significant pest for agriculture in america; it is a host for baculoviruses such as the spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus   having been classified as a group ii alphabaculovirus making it a very attractive target for bioinsecticidal use.
these pathogens infect insects from the orders lepidoptera, hymenoptera and diptera, and have high species diversity which is expressed in their diverse biological properties including morphology, virulence or pathogenicity.
auxiliary genes are numerous in the affected locus which has a homologous region , a repetitive sequence associated with genome replication which became lost in sfcola along with  <dig> orf.
genome analysis by pyrosequencing revealed that sfmnpv cola has  <dig> orfs,  <dig> of which were not present in the other sequenced genotypes of the virus .
an in-depth bioinformatics study showed that orf <dig> and orf <dig> were acquired by a recent homologous recombination process between spodoptera frugiperda and spodoptera litura  nucleopolyhedroviruses.
