third, by penalizing small admixture coefficients for each individual, one can encourage model parsimony, often yielding more interpretable results for small datasets or datasets with large numbers of ancestral populations.
the enhancements we have described make admixture a more accurate, efficient, and versatile tool for ancestry estimation.
the estimation of individual ancestry from genetic data has become essential to applied population genetics and genetic epidemiology.
here we describe four enhancements to admixture, a high-performance tool for estimating individual ancestries and population allele frequencies from snp  data.
software programs for calculating ancestry estimates have become essential tools in the geneticist's analytic arsenal.
second, individuals of known ancestry can be exploited in supervised learning to yield more precise ancestry estimates.
finally, by exploiting multiple processors, large datasets can be analyzed even more rapidly.
