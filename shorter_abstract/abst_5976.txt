plant inducible immunity includes the accumulation of a set of defense proteins during infection called pathogenesis-related  proteins, which are grouped into families termed pr- <dig> to pr- <dig>  the pr- <dig> family is composed of thaumatin-like proteins , which are responsive to biotic and abiotic stress and are widely studied in plants.
a wider phylogenetic analysis of eukaryote tlps - including plant, animal and fungi sequences - shows that tlp gene content and diversity increased markedly during land plant evolution.
in the poplar genome, tlps are over-represented compared with annual species and their transcripts strongly accumulate during stress conditions.
mapping the reported functions of characterized tlps to the eukaryote phylogenetic tree showed that antifungal or glycan-lytic properties are widespread across eukaryote phylogeny, suggesting that these properties are shared by most tlps and are likely associated with the presence of a conserved acidic cleft in their 3d structure.
in particular, we identified a clade of poplar tlps that cluster to a single  <dig> kb locus of chromosome i and that are up-regulated by poplar leaf rust infection.
we have shown that the diverse functions described for tlps are not restricted to specific clades but seem to be universal among eukaryotes, with some exceptions likely attributable to atypical protein structures.
