we used biochemical purification to identify a sequence-dependent exonuclease activity in tetrahymena thermophila cell extracts.
the nuclease activity showed specificity for 5'-ends containing aa or ac sequences, unlike exo <dig>  which showed sequence-independent cleavage.
the tetrahymena nuclease was active on both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrates whereas exo <dig> requires a 5'-phosphate for cleavage.
telomere function requires a highly conserved g rich 3'- overhang.
