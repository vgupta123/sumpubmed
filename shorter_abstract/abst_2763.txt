in this study, we developed a computationally efficient algorithm for: i) the assessment of the significance of gene contributions and ii) the identification of sample outliers in multivariate analysis of microarray data.
multivariate ordination methods are powerful tools for the exploration of complex data structures present in microarray data.
overall, it proved to be particularly effective for the evaluation of the stability of microarray data.
this package includes tools for both inferring the statistical significance of gene contributions and identifying outliers among samples.
however, due to their exploratory nature, multivariate ordination methods do not allow direct statistical testing of the stability of genes.
a statistical package of r functions was developed.
