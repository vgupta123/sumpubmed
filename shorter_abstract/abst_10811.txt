simulations show that stc gives better topological accuracy than other tested methods that also build a first starting tree.
we found that bnni boosts the topological accuracy of all methods including stc, therefore, one should use bnni as a post-processing step to get better topological accuracy.
based on k-representative sets, shortest triplets are reconstructed and serve as building blocks for the stc algorithm to agglomerate sequences for tree reconstruction in o time for n sequences.
however, all tested methods give similar results if balanced nearest neighbor interchange  is applied as a post-processing step.
understanding the evolutionary relationships among species based on their genetic information is one of the primary objectives in phylogenetic analysis.
the results demonstrate that the new approach efficiently reconstructs phylogenies for large data sets.
we propose a new distance-based clustering method, the shortest triplet clustering algorithm , to reconstruct phylogenies.
reconstructing phylogenies for large data sets is still a challenging task in bioinformatics.
