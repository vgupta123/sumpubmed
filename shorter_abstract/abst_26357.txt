comparison of sequences underpinning these snp markers to the m. truncatula genome defined genomic regions containing candidate genes associated with saline stress tolerance.
genetic markers in close linkage with the relevant genomic regions may then be implemented in varietal improvement programs.
sequences associated with the mapped molecular markers were used for comparative genomic analysis with other legume species.
parents and ril progeny were screened at the seedling growth stage for responses to salinity stress, imposed by addition of nacl in the watering solution at a concentration of  <dig> ds m- <dig>  salinity-induced symptoms showed normal distribution, and the severity of the symptoms increased over time.
the snp assays and associated genetic linkage maps developed in this study permitted identification of salinity tolerance qtls and candidate genes.
recent advances in genomics have permitted the development of low-cost high-throughput genotyping systems, allowing the construction of saturated genetic linkage maps for identification of quantitative trait loci  associated with traits of interest.
qtls for salinity tolerance were identified on linkage groups ps iii and vii, with flanking snp markers suitable for selection of resistant cultivars.
and chickpea  than with soybean , lotus japonicus l. and pigeon pea .
crop production is constrained by multiple biotic and abiotic stress factors, including salinity, that cause reduced growth and yield.
field pea  is a self-pollinating, diploid, cool-season food legume.
in this study, single nucleotide polymorphism  markers associated with expressed sequence tags  were developed and used to generate comprehensive linkage maps for field pea.
this constitutes an important set of tools for marker-assisted selection  programs aimed at performance enhancement of field pea cultivars.
