analysis of sage data showed that g/c tracts correlate with the levels of regional gene expression in c. elegans.
the abundance and genomic distribution of g/c tracts in c. elegans, the effect of g/c tracts on regional transcription levels, and the lack of positional conservation of g/c tracts in c. briggsae suggest a role for g/c tracts in chromatin structure but not in the transcriptional regulation of specific genes.
g/c tracts are over-represented and dispersed across all chromosomes in another caenorhabditis species, c. briggsae.
the frequency and distribution of g/c tracts in the genomes of c. elegans and the related nematode, c. briggsae were analyzed to investigate possible biological roles for g/c tracts.
in c. elegans, g/c tracts are distributed along every chromosome in a non-random pattern.
however, the positions and distribution of g/c tracts in c. briggsae differ from those in c. elegans.
furthermore, the c. briggsae dog- <dig> ortholog cbg <dig> can rescue the mutator phenotype of c. elegans dog- <dig> mutants.
most g/c tracts are within introns or are close to genes.
