cortisol stimulated transactivation activity of argr, pbgr2b and pbgr <dig> in vitro; with pbgr2b and pbgr <dig>  the glucocorticoid 11-deoxycortisol was a more potent agonist than cortisol.
the difference in transactivation activity sensitivity between duplicated grs of p. buchholzi suggests potential functional differences between the paralogs emerged early in the teleost lineage.
the hormone sensitivity of pbgr2b and pbgr <dig> differed in the transactivation assay, with pbgr2b having lower ec <dig> values and greater fold induction.
a splice variant of pbgr <dig> produces an isoform that lacked these  <dig> amino acids .
however, the presence of a pbgr <dig> splice variant that lacks this insert, as well as the loss of the exon encoding these amino acids in the genes encoding for other teleost gr <dig> suggests the selection of two receptors with different dna-binding domain structures in teleosts.
to identify factors driving the retention of duplicate grs in teleosts, the current study examined grs in representatives of two basal ray-finned fish taxa that emerged either side of the teleost lineage whole genome duplication event  event, the acipenseriform, acipenser ruthenus,  and the osteoglossimorph, pantodon buchholzi, .
a  <dig> amino acid insert in the dna-binding domain emerged in basal ray-finned fish grs.
duplicated glucocorticoid receptors  are present in most teleost fish.
the evolutionary advantage of retaining two grs is unclear, as no subtype specific functional traits or physiological roles have been defined.
the study identified a single gr in a. ruthenus  and two grs in p. buchholzi .
the teleost gr lineage was subdivded into two sublineages, each of which contained one of the two p. buchholzi grs.
