furthermore, the standardized evaluation framework underlying cma can also be beneficial in statistical research for comparison purposes, for instance if a new classifier has to be compared to existing approaches.
careful model selection and evaluation satisfying accepted good-practice standards is a very complex task for statisticians without experience in this area or for scientists with limited statistical background.
the multiplicity of available methods for class prediction based on high-dimensional data is an additional practical challenge for inexperienced researchers.
in this article, we introduce a new bioconductor package called cma  for automatically performing variable selection, parameter tuning, classifier construction, and unbiased evaluation of the constructed classifiers using a large number of usual methods.
traditional methods often yield unsatisfactory results or may even be inapplicable in the so-called "p â‰« n" setting where the number of predictors p by far exceeds the number of observations n, hence the term "ill-posed-problem".
cma is a user-friendly comprehensive package for classifier construction and evaluation implementing most usual approaches.
