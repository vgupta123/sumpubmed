the availability of comprehensive knowledge resources such as biomedical ontologies and integrated thesauri greatly facilitates this integration effort by means of semantic annotation, which allows disparate data formats and contents to be expressed under a common semantic space.
automatic semantic annotation was applied to tag three collections of abstracts taken from pubmed, one for each target disease of the project, the uniprot database, and the hec patient record database.
such an integration is performed through semantic annotation of the intended biomedical data resources.
in this paper, we propose a multidimensional representation for such a semantic space, where dimensions regard the different perspectives in biomedical research .
this paper shows how these annotations can be exploited for integration, exploration, and analysis tasks.
the latter one reduces the annotation set associated to each collection item into a set of points of the multidimensional space.
this paper presents a novel method for building multidimensional semantic spaces from semantically annotated biomedical data collections.
results over a real scenario demonstrate the viability and usefulness of the approach, as well as the quality of the generated multidimensional semantic spaces.
current knowledge resources and semantic-aware technology make possible the integration of biomedical resources.
the semantic integration of biomedical resources is still a challenging issue which is required for effective information processing and data analysis.
the former one arranges the concepts provided by a reference knowledge resource  into a set of hierarchical dimensions for analysis purposes.
we adopted the umls meta-thesaurus 2010aa as the reference knowledge resource.
additionally, we have developed a visual tool, called 3d-browser, which implements olap-like operators over the generated multidimensional space.
