the non-synonymous snps  that lead to amino acid changes in the protein product may account for nearly half of the known genetic variations linked to inherited human diseases.
we propose a method, named parepro , to identify nssnps having either deleterious or neutral effects on the resulting protein function.
the performance of parepro indicates that it is a powerful tool for predicting the effect of nssnps on protein function and would be useful for large-scale analysis of genomic nssnp data.
one of the key problems of medical genetics today is to identify nssnps that underlie disease-related phenotypes in humans.
using a 20-fold cross validation test on the humvar dataset, parepro achieved a matthews correlation coefficient  of 50% and an overall accuracy  of 76%, both of which were higher than those predicted by the methods, such as polyphen, sift, and hydridmeth.
further analysis on an additional dataset  using parepro yielded similar results.
two independent datasets, humvar and newhumvar, taken from the phd-snp server, were applied to train the model and test the robustness of parepro.
