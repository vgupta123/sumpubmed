<dig> % of isogroups had significant blast hits to the uniprot database and these include putative homologs of a number of genes relevant to regeneration research.
we constructed a cdna library from the naid pristina leidyi, a species that is highly regenerative and also reproduces asexually by fission, using material from a range of regeneration and fission stages for our library.
it also contributes significantly to the still limited genomic resources available for annelids and lophotrochozoans more generally.
using in situ hybridization, we show that two wnt/Î²-catenin pathway genes  present in our transcriptome are expressed in the regeneration blastema of p. leidyi, demonstrating the usefulness of this resource for regeneration research.
this transcriptome dataset will be a valuable resource for molecular analyses of regeneration in p. leidyi and will serve as a starting point for comparisons to non-regenerating naids.
we then sequenced the transcriptome of p. leidyi using  <dig> technology.
the naid annelids contain a number of species that vary in their ability to regenerate lost body parts, making them excellent candidates for evolution of regeneration studies.
