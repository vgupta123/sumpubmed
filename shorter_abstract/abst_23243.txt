using adult plants of near-isogenic lines uc <dig> +/- yr <dig>  there was no significant difference between pst percentage uredia coverage in plants grown at day temperatures of 18°c or 25°c in adult uc1041 + yr <dig> plants.
interestingly, this response was independent of yr <dig>  which has previously been reported as a temperature-responsive resistance gene as pst development in adult uc <dig> -yr <dig> plants was similarly affected by the plants experiencing a temperature reduction.
in addition, uc <dig> -yr <dig> plants grown at the lower temperature then transferred to the higher temperature were effectively resistant and a temperature change in either direction was shown to affect pst development up to 8 days prior to inoculation.
results reveal previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity in the uc <dig> background which is caused by a change in temperature and independently of yr <dig>  this novel phenotype is present in some cultivars but absent in others, suggesting that pst defence may be more stable in some cultivars than others when plants are exposed to varying temperatures.
yr <dig> is effective at 18°c, refining the lower range of temperature at which resistance against pst is conferred compared to previous studies.
results for seedlings were similar, but more variable compared to adult plants.
here we show that a change in day temperature affects wheat resistance to puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici , the causal agent of yellow  rust.

however, when plants were transferred to the lower day temperature at the time of pst inoculation, infection increased up to two fold.
