salicylates were chosen because sa is the only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for which threshold levels exist for plasma and urine in equine sports.
this study investigated synovial concentrations of acetylsalicylic acid  and its metabolite salicylic acid  in the equine fetlock joint following systemic administration of asa.
salicylate concentrations in the joint were determined using microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography .
any anti-inflammatory effect of synovial asa concentrations was assessed using an asa ec <dig>  determined in equine whole blood.
the asa concentration in the synovial fluid  reached a maximum of  <dig> μg/ml, the mean concentration over the entire perfusion period was  <dig> μg/ml.
to avoid animal experiments, the study was conducted using an ex vivo model of the isolated perfused equine distal limb in combination with plasma concentrations obtained from literature.
this suggests a prolonged anti-inflammatory effect within the joint that remains to be further elucidated.

asa and sa concentration in the synovial fluid exceeded systemic concentrations  <dig> h and  <dig>  h after “systemic” administration, respectively.
asa and sa accumulated in the in the synovial fluid of the ex vivo model despite decreasing systemic concentrations.
maximum sa concentration was  <dig> μg/ml, the average was  <dig> μg/ml.
