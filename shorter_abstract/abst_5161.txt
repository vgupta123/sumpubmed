in this study we evaluate the effect of iloprost on immune response in ssc patients.
the effect of iloprost on t cells and monocytes was measured by flow cytometry, real time pcr and measuring cytokines production in vivo and in vitro by elisa.
it reduces t regulatory cells number, but increases their activity after immune stimulation.
these results suggest that iloprost has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects, reducing tnf alpha production by t cells and the number of t regulatory cells and increasing il- <dig> and rankl.
our results demonstrate that iloprost reduces t cell and tnf alpha production both in vivo and in vitro.
iloprost has been suggested to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating actions and it is widely use as a vasodilatator in systemic sclerosis .
