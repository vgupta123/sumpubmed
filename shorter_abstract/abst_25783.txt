the fungal genomes encoded  <dig> –  <dig> aa9s  and  <dig> –  <dig> aa11s  and two of the fungi possessed a gene encoding a putative aa <dig>  the aa9s were mainly found in plant cell wall-degrading asco- and basidiomycetes in agreement with the described role of aa <dig> enzymes.
lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases are important enzymes for the decomposition of recalcitrant biological macromolecules such as plant cell wall and chitin polymers.
the peptides were used for in silico pcr discovery of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases in  <dig> fungal and  <dig> bacterial genomes.
the bacterial genomes encoded  <dig> –  <dig> aa10s .
the results showed that the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases have two conserved regions identified by conserved peptides specific for each aa family.
these results provides an overview of the sequence characteristics and occurrence of the divergent aa <dig>  aa <dig> and aa <dig> families and pave the way for systematic investigations of the of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases and for structure-function studies of these enzymes.
to obtain a systematic analysis of the divergent families of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases we used peptide pattern recognition to divide  <dig> protein sequences resembling enzymes from families aa <dig> , aa <dig>  and aa <dig>  into subfamilies.

these enzymes were originally designated glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> and carbohydrate-binding module family  <dig> but are now classified as auxiliary activities  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the cazy database.
