we provide evidence for genetic interactions between sus <dig> and genes coding for components of p-bodies such as pat <dig>  lsm <dig>  lsm <dig> and dhh <dig>  we demonstrate that sus <dig> deletion is synthetic lethal with 5'â†’3' decay machinery components lsm <dig> and pat <dig> and has a strong genetic interaction with lsm <dig> and dhh <dig>  interestingly, sus <dig> overexpression led to an accumulation of sus <dig> in cytoplasmic granules, which can co-localise with components of p-bodies and stress granules.
moreover, sus <dig> accumulates in discrete cytoplasmic granules, which partially co-localise with p-bodies and stress granules under specific conditions.
in addition, we have identified novel physical interactions between sus <dig> and factors associated to p-bodies/stress granules.
gene expression is achieved by the coordinated action of multiple factors to ensure a perfect synchrony from chromatin epigenetic regulation through to mrna export.
these interactions suggest a role for sus <dig> in gene expression during cytoplasmic mrna metabolism in addition to its nuclear function.
in this study, we found genetic and biochemical association between sus <dig> and components responsible for cytoplasmic mrna metabolism.
