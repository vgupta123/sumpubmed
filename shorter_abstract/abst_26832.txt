the continuous presence of the chek <dig> gene in all eukaryotes and its important role in maintaining genome stability prompted us to investigate the duplicative evolution and phylogeny of chek <dig> and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution.
our detailed analysis revealed the highly dynamic nature of chek <dig> duplication during anthropoid evolution.
our comparative fish results with a chek <dig> fosmid probe revealed the single-copy status of chek <dig> in new world monkeys, old world monkeys and gibbons.
in conclusion, our analysis of chek <dig> duplicon evolution revealed that sds contribute to inter-species variation.
phylogenetic analysis of paralogous and ancestral chek <dig> sequences in human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque confirmed this burst of duplication, which occurred after the radiation of orangutan and african great apes.
segmental duplications  are euchromatic portions of genomic dna  that occur at more than one site within the genome, and typically share a high level of sequence identity .
in addition, we used inter-species quantitative pcr to determine chek <dig> copy numbers.
whereas a single chek <dig> duplication was detected in orangutan, a multi-site signal pattern indicated a burst of duplication in african great apes and human.
an amplification of chek <dig> was detected in african great apes and the highest chek <dig> copy number of all analysed species was observed in the human genome.
we determined a burst of chek <dig> duplication after the radiation of orangutan and african great apes and identified the highest chek <dig> copy number in human.
chek <dig> is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene encoding a cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the dna-damage response signalling pathway.
furthermore, our qpcr analysis led us to presume chek <dig> copy number variation in human, and molecular diagnostics of the cancer susceptibility gene chek <dig> inside the duplicated region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of duplicons.
to study chek <dig> duplicon evolution in anthropoids we applied a combination of comparative fish and in silico analyses.
approximately 5% of the human genome is composed of such duplicated sequences.
