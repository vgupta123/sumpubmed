the topic of the paper is to study the stability of gene clusters, defined by various hierarchical clustering algorithms, of microarrays experiments including or not mvs.
nevertheless, we observe that knn approach is less suitable for the extreme values of gene expression.
however, microarray datasets often contain missing values  representing a major drawback for the use of the clustering methods.
our study highlights the need of statistical treatments in microarray data to avoid misinterpretation.
the mvs replacement by the knn approach clearly improves the identification of co-expressed gene clusters.
nevertheless, the knn approach constitutes one efficient method for restoring the missing expression gene values, with a low error level.
