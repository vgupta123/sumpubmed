comparative fish with the pkd1-cdna clone clearly shows that in all primate species studied distinct single signals map in subtelomeric chromosomal positions orthologous to the short arm of human chromosome  <dig> harbouring the master pkd <dig> gene.
to address this question we applied comparative fish-mapping of a human pkd1-containing genomic bac clone and a pkd1-cdna clone to chromosomes of a variety of primate species and the dog as a non-primate outgroup species.
however, our statistical analyses provide strong indication that gene conversion events may have occurred within the pkd <dig> family members of human and chimpanzee, respectively.
reticulate evolutionary processes such as gene conversion and non-allelic homologous recombination  may have resulted in concerted evolution of pkd <dig> family members in human and chimpanzee and, thus, simulate an independent evolution of the pkd <dig> pseudogenes from their master pkd <dig> genes in human and chimpanzee.
duplicative transposition of the pkd <dig> gene and further amplification and evolution of the pkd <dig> pseudogenes may have arisen in a common ancestor of homo, pan and gorilla ~ <dig> mya.
moreover, there are six pseudogenes of pkd <dig> that are located proximal to the master gene in 16p <dig> .
only in human and african great apes, but not in orangutan, fish with both bac and cdna clones reveals additional signal clusters located proximal of and clearly separated from the pkd <dig> master genes indicating the chromosomal position of pkd <dig> pseudogenes in 16p of these species, respectively.
in contrast, no pseudogene could be detected in the mouse genome, only a single copy gene on chromosome  <dig>  the question arises how the human situation originated phylogenetically.
the phylogenetic reconstruction of the pkd1-tree reveals that all human pseudogenes are closely related to the human pkd <dig> gene, and all chimpanzee pseudogenes are closely related to the chimpanzee pkd <dig> gene.
the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is mostly caused by mutations in the pkd <dig>  gene located in 16p <dig> .
