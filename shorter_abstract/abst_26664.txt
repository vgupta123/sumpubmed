among the 45% of genes with significant expression differences between pairs of temporally adjacent stages, significant differences in gene expression vary from as few as five to more than  <dig>  five adjacent stages have disproportionately more significant changes in gene expression  relative to other stages: four to eight and eight to sixteen cell stages, onset of circulation, pre and post-hatch, and during complete yolk absorption.
this study presents statistical analyses of gene expression during all  <dig> developmental stages in the teleost fundulus heteroclitus using four biological replicates per stage.
yet, at stage  <dig>   the largest number of genes has peak expression.
these data provide statistical support for the temporal dynamics of developmental gene expression during all stages of vertebrate development.
the fewest differences among adjacent stages occur during gastrulation.
unexpectedly, among all ribosomal genes, both strong positive and negative correlations occur.
similar correlated patterns of expression occur among all significant genes.
describing the patterns of gene expression during embryonic development has broadened our understanding of the processes and patterns that define morphogenesis.
yet gene expression patterns have not been described throughout vertebrate embryogenesis.
patterns of gene expression for  <dig>  genes appear to be important as they recapitulate developmental timing.
