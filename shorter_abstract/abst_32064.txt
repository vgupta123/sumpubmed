data obtained strongly indicate that αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib are promising experimental tools to analyze the individual role of the two enzymes during brain development and during migration and proliferation of tumor cells.
both ibs αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib were constructed in the scfv format and their functions characterized in vitro and in vivo.
in cho cells overexpressing st8siaii and st8siaiv, respectively, the transfection with αst8siaii-ib or αst8siaiv-ib inhibited significantly the cell surface expression of polysialylated ncam.
polysialic acid  is a carbohydrate modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule , which is implicated in neural differentiation and plays an important role in tumor development and metastasis.
