a number of genomic changes were found to be undergoing evolutionary selection, some of which were likely to be functional.
our study of the evolution of acquired docetaxel resistance identified several genomic changes that might explain development of docetaxel resistance.
mcf- <dig> cell acquired several copy number gains on chromosome  <dig>  including abc transporter genes, including abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  as well as dmtf <dig>  cldn <dig>  crot, and sri.
resistance to taxane-based therapy in breast cancer patients is a major clinical problem that may be addressed through insight of the genomic alterations leading to taxane resistance in breast cancer cells.
interestingly, the most relevant resistance-associated changes appeared to originate midway through the evolution towards fully resistant cell lines.
for mda-mb- <dig> numerous copy number losses on chromosome x involving more than  <dig> genes was observed.
whole exome sequencing performed at five successive stages during this process was used to identify single point mutational events, insertions/deletions and copy number alterations associated with the acquisition of docetaxel resistance.
in the current study we used whole exome sequencing to discover somatic genomic alterations, evolving across evolutionary stages during the acquisition of docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cell lines.
our data suggest that no single genomic event sufficiently predicts resistance to docetaxel, but require genomic alterations affecting multiple pathways that in concert establish the final resistance stage.
at higher docetaxel concentration mcf- <dig> subclones exhibited a copy number loss in e2f <dig>  and the gene encoding this important transcription factor was down-regulated in mcf- <dig> resistant cells.
two human breast cancer in vitro models  of the step-wise acquisition of docetaxel resistance were developed by exposing cells to  <dig> gradually increasing concentrations of docetaxel.

of the five stages of progression toward resistance, most resistance relevant genomic variation appeared to arise midway towards fully resistant cells corresponding to passage  <dig>  for mda-mb- <dig> and passage  <dig>  for mcf- <dig>  and where the cells also exhibited a period of reduced growth rate or arrest, respectively.
