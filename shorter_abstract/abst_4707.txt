the pgd <dig> peptide exhibited strong antifungal activity against several phytopathogens without any effect on the morphology of the treated fungal hyphae, but strongly inhibited hyphal elongation.
endopiceasin appears to derive from an endo- or epiphytic fungal strain rather than from the plant itself.
pgd <dig> codes for a plant defensin that displays non-morphogenic antifungal activity against the phytopathogens tested, probably by altering membrane permeability.
another completely unrelated defensin gene was identified in the est library and named endopiceasin.
plant defensins represent a major innate immune protein superfamily that displays strong inhibitory effects on filamentous fungi.
the total number of plant defensins in a conifer species is unknown since there are no sequenced conifer genomes published, however the genomes of several angiosperm species provide an insight on the diversity of plant defensins.
screening of a p. glauca est database with sequences of known plant defensins identified four genes with homology to the known p. glauca defensin pgd <dig>  which were designated pgd2- <dig>  whereas in the mature pgd2- <dig> only 7â€“ <dig> amino acids differed from pgd <dig>  pgd <dig> had only 64% sequence identity.
it codes for a precursor of 77-amino acid that is fully conserved within the picea genus and has similarity to plant defensins.
screening of a p. glauca est database resulted in the identification of five new defensin-encoding genes.
here we report the identification of five new defensin-encoding genes from the picea glauca genome and the characterization of two of their gene products, named pgd <dig> and endopiceasin.
