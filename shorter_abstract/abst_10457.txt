as available genomic sequence data accumulate rapidly, there is great demand for tools that can compare whole-genome sequences within practical amounts of time and space.
we compared the performance of cgaln with those of other programs on whole genomic sequences of several bacteria and of some mammalian chromosome pairs.
we previously proposed the cgat  algorithm, which performs an alignment job in two steps: first at the block level and then at the nucleotide level.
the results showed that cgaln is several times faster and more memory-efficient than the best existing programs, while its sensitivity and accuracy are comparable to those of the best programs.
our results show that cgaln is very effective for comparison of large genomes, especially of intact chromosomal sequences.
cgaln takes less than  <dig> hours to finish an alignment between the whole genomes of human and mouse in a single run on a conventional desktop computer with a single cpu and  <dig> gb memory.
however, most existing genomic alignment tools can treat sequences that are only a few mb long at once, and no state-of-the-art alignment program can align large sequences such as mammalian genomes directly on a conventional standalone computer.
we believe that cgaln provides novel viewpoint for reducing computational complexity and will contribute to various fields of genome science.
the former is "coarse-grained" alignment that can explore genomic rearrangements and reduce the sizes of the regions to be analyzed in the next step.
cgaln is not only fast and memory efficient but also effective in coping with genomic rearrangements.
