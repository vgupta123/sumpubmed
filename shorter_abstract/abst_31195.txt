recombination has a profound impact on the evolution of viruses, but characterizing recombination patterns in molecular sequences remains a challenging endeavor.
we also demonstrate hiv- <dig> intrasubtype recombination, confirm the hybrid origin of siv in chimpanzees and further disentangle the recombinant history of siv lineages in a primate immunodeficiency virus data set.
we compare the quartet approach with triplet-based methods that employ additional heuristic tests to identify parental and recombinant sequences.
in agreement with recent findings, we provide evidence that the presumed circulating recombinant crf02_ag is a 'pure' lineage, whereas the presumed parental lineage subtype g has a recombinant origin.
here, we extend a quartet-mapping based recombination detection method to enable identification of recombinant sequences without prior specifications of either query and reference sequences.
quartet scanning makes a valuable addition to triplet-based methods for identifying recombinant sequences without prior specifications of either query and reference sequences.
analysis of phylogenetic simulations reveal that identifying the descendents of relatively old recombination events is a challenging task for all methods available, and that quartet scanning performs relatively well compared to the triplet based methods.
