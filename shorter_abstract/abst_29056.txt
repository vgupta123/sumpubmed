we contrast this approach with the search for a minimal best set of discriminative genes, which can provide only an incomplete picture of the biological complexity.
the classification accuracy on test data remains essentially flat even as hundreds of top-genes are removed.
microarray data sets typically contain far more features  than samples.
through automated and manual analysis of the selected genes, we demonstrate that the selected features expose relevant pathways that other approaches would have missed.
our results challenge the paradigm of using feature selection techniques to design parsimonious classifiers from microarray and similar high-dimensional, small-sample-size data sets.
in our results, the best classifiers were formed using genes with limited univariate power, thus illustrating that deeper mining of features using multivariate techniques is important.
the algorithm is based on recently developed tools in machine learning that are driven by sparse feature selection goals.
we iteratively train a classifier using features identified via a sparse support vector machine.
the fact that there are many subsets of genes that work equally well to classify the data provides a strong counter-result to the notion that there is a small number of “top genes” that should be used to build classifiers.
