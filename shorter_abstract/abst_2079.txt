switching between lysogenic and lytic pathways results in various types of evolution in host-phage systems.
phage infection decreases the speciation rate by more than one order as far as intensified selection blocks the origin of novel viable populations/species, which could carve out potential ecological niches.
non-specific nutrient supplied in the only spatial direction, resulting in its non-uniform distribution in environment.
bacteriophages are known to be one of the driving forces of bacterial evolution.
this influencing varied in its efficiency depending on spatially-ecological factors as well as community state at the moment of phage invasion.
simulations have shown that the spatial location of initial phage invasion may lead to different evolutionary scenarios.
in this study, we have simulated and analyzed a series of computer models of microbial communities evolving in spatially distributed environments under the pressure of phage infection.
the dependence of speciation rate on the invasion node location varied on the time of invasion.
speciation rate was found to be lower when the phage invaded fully formed community of sedentary cells  at the species-rich regions.
besides promoting horizontal transfer of genes between cells, they may induce directional selection of cells .
our simulation study has shown that phage infection affects evolution of microbial community slowing down speciation and stabilizing the system as a whole.

this is especially noticeable in the case of late-time invasion.
we modeled evolving microbial communities living in spatially distributed flowing environments.
