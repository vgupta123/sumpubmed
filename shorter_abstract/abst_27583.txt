kiwi is available as a python package at http://www.sysbio.se/kiwi and an online tool in the biomet toolbox at http://www.biomet-toolbox.org.
gene-sets can represent well-defined biological entities  that interact in networks , to exert their function within the cell.
nevertheless, only the integration of the interactions between these metabolites provides an extra layer of information that highlights how they are tightly connected in the metabolic network.
in two case studies, we demonstrate that standard gene-set analysis points at metabolites regulated in the interrogated condition.
here we present kiwi, a new tool that processes output data from gene-set analysis and integrates them with a network structure such that the inherent connectivity between gene-sets, i.e.
the analysis of high-throughput data in biology is aided by integrative approaches such as gene-set analysis.
data interpretation can benefit from incorporating the underlying network, but there are currently no optimal methods that link gene-set analysis and network structures.
it allows the users not only to discover a list of significant entities or processes as in gene-set analysis, but also to visualize whether these entities or processes are isolated or connected by means of their biological interaction.

not simply the gene overlap, becomes apparent.
kiwi is a tool that enhances interpretability of high-throughput data.
