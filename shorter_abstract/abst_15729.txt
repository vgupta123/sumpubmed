the basal forebrain  regulates cortical activity by the action of cholinergic projections to the cortex.
we conclude that bf activation has a strong influence on contrast sensitivity in v <dig>  we suggest that, in addition to cholinergic modulation, the bf gabaergic projections play a crucial role in the impact of bf dbs on cortical activity.
the spontaneous v <dig> local field potential often exhibited spectral peaks centered at  <dig> and  <dig> hz as well as reliably showed a broad γ-band  increase following bf stimulation, whereas effects in a low frequency band  were less consistent.
bf stimulation robustly increased v <dig> single and multi-unit activity, led to moderate decreases in orientation selectivity and a remarkable increase in contrast sensitivity as demonstrated by a reduced semi-saturation contrast.
the broad γ-band, rather than low frequency activity or spectral peaks was the best predictor of both the firing rate increase and contrast sensitivity increase of v <dig> unit activity.
at the same time, it also sends substantial gabaergic projections to both cortex and thalamus, whose functional role has received far less attention.
