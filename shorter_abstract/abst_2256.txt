we propose a combination technique to reduce the effects of different sliding residue windows in the process of encoding input feature vectors.
experimental results on casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets demonstrate that our method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art protein-ligand binding site prediction methods.
however, such structural information is not commonly available.
in this paper, we propose a sequence-based approach to identify protein-ligand binding residues.
