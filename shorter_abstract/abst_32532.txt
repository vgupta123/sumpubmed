argr also binds to the gltbdf promoter region, upstream of the lrp binding sites, and decreases transcription.
of the seven most-global regulators, together affecting expression of about half of all e. coli genes, two were previously shown to exert direct, positive control on gltbdf transcription: lrp and ihf.
crp and a more local regulator, argr, directly control gltbdf transcription, both acting negatively.
the involvement of nearly half of e. coli's most-global regulatory proteins in the control of gltbdf transcription is striking, but seems consistent with the central metabolic role of this operon.
however the results are consistent with a model in which ihf bends the dna to allow stabilizing contacts between lrp and rnap, argr interferes with such contacts, and crp introduces an interfering bend in the dna and/or stabilizes rnap in a poised but inactive state.
the glutamate synthase operon  contributes to one of the two main pathways of ammonia assimilation in escherichia coli.
