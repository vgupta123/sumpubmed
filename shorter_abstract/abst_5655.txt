while preference of the brca <dig> protein to cruciform structures has been reported previously, our observations demonstrated for the first time a preferential binding of the brca <dig> protein also to triplex and quadruplex dnas, including its visualization by atomic force microscopy.
using electrophoretic retardation assay, atomic force microscopy and dna binding competition assay, we showed the greatest preference of the brca <dig> dna-binding domain to cruciform structure, followed by dna quadruplex, with the weakest affinity to double stranded b-dna and single stranded dna.
brca <dig> protein, located primarily in cell nuclei, interacts with multiple proteins and various dna targets.
it has been demonstrated that brca <dig> protein binds to damaged dna and plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes.
in this study, we provided detailed analyses of brca <dig> protein  binding to topologically constrained non-b dna structures .
the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca <dig> encodes a multifunctional tumor suppressor protein brca <dig>  which is involved in regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle, transcription, dna repair, dna damage response and chromatin remodeling.
when compared to double stranded dna, such a strong preference of the brca <dig> protein to cruciform and quadruplex structures suggests its importance in biology and may thus shed insight into the role of these interactions in cell regulation and maintenance.
