at the genus level, bacteroides was the most abundant division, their otus abundance in three groups was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % respectively.
at the phylum level, the absolute quantity of bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria  significantly differentiated in breast-fed group from low- protein, high- carbohydrate infant formula-fed and human breast milk-fed groups.
in the diet composition, protein and carbohydrate are very important for the growth of microbiota, many infant fomulas  can regulate the development of gut microbiota by different metabolism.
the effect of low-protein, high-carbohydrate infant formula on the establishment of microbiota remains unclear, and the effect of human breast milk on the gut microbiota of the rats has also not been reported.
the finding could support a new thinking to develop infant formulas, and provide much more details than what is known previously.
in a  <dig> d intervention, a total of  <dig> neonatal sd rats  were randomly assigned to the following groups:  breast-fed group ;  low-protein, high-carbohydrate infant formula-fed group ;  human breast milk-fed group .
significantly different  microbial colonisation patterns were observed in the large intestines of breast-fed group from low-protein, high-carbohydrate infant formula-fed and human breast milk-fed rats, but the microbiota of low-protein, high-carbohydrate infant formula-fed group and human breast milk-fed group have high similarity.
lachnospiraceae, bacteroidaceae, porphyromonadaceae and prevotellaceae were the  <dig> top families in breast-fed group, but the top  <dig> families in low-protein, high- carbohydrate infant formula-fed and human breast milk-fed groups were the same, which were bacteroidaceae, enterobacteriaceae, porphyromonadaceae and lachnospiraceae.
this study showed that infant formula closer resembling human milk was more different than rats’ breast milk and led to a microbiota profile similar to that for human breast milk-fed neonates.
