herv-v <dig> offers an almost complete coverage of hervs and their ancestors  at the locus level along with four other repertoires .
to refine our understanding of hervs activity, we introduce here a new microarray, herv-v <dig>  this work was made possible by the careful detection and annotation of genomic herv/malr sequences as well as the development of a new hybridization model, allowing the optimization of probe performances and the control of cross-reactions.﻿﻿﻿
we demonstrate that herv-v <dig> analytical performances are comparable with commercial affymetrix arrays, and that for a selection of tissue/pathological specific loci, the patterns of expression measured on herv-v <dig> is consistent with those reported in the literature.
given its large hervs/malrs coverage and additional repertoires, herv-v <dig> opens the door to multiple applications such as enhancers and alternative promoters identification, biomarkers identification as well as the characterization of genes and hervs/malrs modulation caused by viral infection.
