these two bands are also recognized by an antibody towards the ppiase domain of parvulin.
the n-terminal elongation of par17-qr and par17-rs suggests these isoforms to perform divergent functions within the eukaryotic cell than the well characterized par <dig>
in this study we confirm by rt-pcr the existence of a longer parvulin isoform expressed in all tissues examined so far.
due to its molecular weight of  <dig>  kda we denote the novel parvulin isoform as par <dig> following the e. coli par <dig> and human par <dig> nomenclature.
this isoform contains a 5' extension including a  <dig> bp extended open reading frame with two coupled snps leading to amino acid substitutions q16r and r18s.
the human parvulin promoter is tata-less and situated in a cpg island typical for house keeping genes.
about 1% of all parvulin mrnas include the novel extension as quantified by real-time pcr.
the longer parvulin protein is encoded by the human genome but absent from rodent, bovine and non-mammalian genomes.
in hela and hepg <dig> cell lysates two protein species of about  <dig> and  <dig> kda are detected by an antibody against an epitope within the n-terminal extension.
the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase  parvulin  is highly conserved in all metazoans and is assumed to play a role in cell cycle progression and chromatin remodeling.
thus, different parvulin mrnas seem to arise by alternative transcription initiation.
