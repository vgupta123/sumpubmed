the data confirms that fak regulates glucose uptake through actin reorganization in skeletal muscle.
fak-mediated actin remodeling resulted into subsequent glucose uptake via pi3k-dependent pathway.
focal adhesion kinase  is recently reported to regulate insulin resistance by regulating glucose uptake in c2c <dig> skeletal muscle cells.
however, the underlying mechanism for fak-mediated glucose transporter- <dig> translocation , responsible for glucose uptake, remains unknown.
fak overexpression supports actin remodeling and subsequent glucose uptake in a pi3k dependent manner.
inhibition of fak prevents insulin-stimulated remodeling of actin filaments resulting into decreased glut- <dig> translocation and glucose uptake generating insulin resistance.
to our knowledge this is the first study relating fak, actin remodeling, glut- <dig> translocation and glucose uptake and their interrelationship in generating insulin resistance.
we observed that overexpression of fak induces actin remodeling in skeletal muscle cells in presence of insulin.
therefore, we investigated whether fak contributes to insulin-induced actin remodeling and harbor glut- <dig> for glucose transport and whether downregulation of fak affects the remodeling and causes insulin resistance.
on the other hand fak silencing reduced actin remodeling affecting glut- <dig> translocation resulting into insulin resistance.
