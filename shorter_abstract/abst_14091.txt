this study describes an optimized homologous dna assembly method, termed as multiple patch cloning , for multiple site-directed and saturation mutagenesis.
furthermore, we also utilized this method to prepare a library of mutant gfpuv genes containing saturation mutations at five specific sites, and we found that mupac successfully introduced nnk codons at all five sites, whereas other site remained intact.
various dna manipulation methods have been developed to prepare mutant genes for protein engineering.
we observed that the over 90% of resulting colonies possessed the plasmids containing the reverted gfpuv gene and exhibited fluorescence.
