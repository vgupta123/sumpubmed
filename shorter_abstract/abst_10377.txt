for the snps that involved in these groups of genes, a statistical software plink is employed to compute the pair-wise snp-snp interactions, and snps with significance of p <  <dig>  are chosen to identify snps networks based on their p values.
here snps networks are constructed based on gene ontology knowledge, and therefore each snp network plays a role in the biological process.
in this paper, we use shrunken dissimilarity measure to analyze and select relevant snps for classification problems.
experimental results show that our approach is suitable to handle genetic variations, and provide useful knowledge in a genome-wide snp study.
examples of hapmap data and parkinson disease  data are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and illustrate it has a potential to become a useful analysis tool for snp data sets.
for the unique genes that those snps are located in, a gene-gene similarity value is computed using gosemsim and gene pairs that has a similarity value being greater than a threshold are selected to construct several groups of genes.
however, snp data set typically has a large number of snps  and a few hundred of samples.
conventional classification methods may not be effective when applied to such genome-wide snp data.
we use parkinson disease data as an example, and perform a whole genome analysis.
an analysis shows that such networks have relationships directly or indirectly to parkinson disease.
