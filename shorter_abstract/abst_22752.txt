the purpuratus model was shown to predict splice signals better than a similar model created from vertebrate sequences.
the data presented herein describe the first published analyses of echinoderm splice sites and suggest that the previous methods of identifying splice signals that are based largely on vertebrate sequences may be insufficient.
with that aim in mind, we generated a model for identifying donor and acceptor splice sites that was optimized using sequences from the purple sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
a donor splice site model was generated from s. purpuratus sequences that incorporates non-adjacent dependences among positions within the  <dig> nt splice signal and uses position weight matrices to determine the probability that the site is used for splicing.
