type  <dig> diabetes mellitus results from an autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin.
normally, pancreatic beta cells produce and secrete insulin only in response to increased blood glucose levels.
expression of either human insulin or the beta cell specific transcription factors pdx- <dig>  neurod <dig> and mafa in the hepa1- <dig> cell line or primary liver cells via adenoviral gene transfer, results in production and secretion of insulin.
in the present study we engineered liver cells to produce and secrete insulin and insulin secretion can be stimulated via the nitric oxide pathway.
however in many cases, insulin secretion from non-beta cells engineered to produce insulin occurs in a glucose-independent manner.
the lack of insulin leads to chronic hyperglycemia and secondary complications, such as cardiovascular disease.
therefore, there is a great interest in the development of surrogate beta cells as a treatment for type  <dig> diabetes.
this l-arginine-mediated insulin release is dependent on the production of nitric oxide.
although, the secretion of insulin is not significantly increased in response to high glucose, treatment of these engineered liver cells with l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion up to three-fold.
liver cells can be engineered to produce insulin and insulin secretion can be induced by treatment with l-arginine via the production of nitric oxide.
