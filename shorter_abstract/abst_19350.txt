both algorithms, kec and et, are highly suitable for rapid recovery of error-free haplotypes obtained by 454-sequencing of amplicons from heterogeneous viruses.
most error-correction methods to date are not optimized for amplicon analysis and assume that the error rate is randomly distributed.
recent quality assessment of amplicon sequences obtained using 454-sequencing showed that the error rate is strongly linked to the presence and size of homopolymers, position in the sequence and length of the amplicon.
in this paper, we present two new efficient error correction algorithms optimized for viral amplicons:  k-mer-based error correction  and  empirical frequency threshold .
however, kec and et were significantly more efficient than shorah in removing false haplotypes and estimating the frequency of true ones.
all these parameters are strongly sequence specific and should be incorporated into the calibration of error-correction algorithms designed for amplicon sequencing.
next-generation sequencing allows the analysis of an unprecedented number of viral sequence variants from infected patients, presenting a novel opportunity for understanding virus evolution, drug resistance and immune escape.
all three algorithms show similar accuracy in finding true haplotypes.
