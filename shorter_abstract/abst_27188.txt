our study offers a general overview of the molecular pathways and cellular processes regulating the establishment and maintenance of atrophic state in skeletal muscle, showing also how the different pathways are interconnected.
we suggest that the transcription factors smad3/ <dig>  gnb2l1/rack <dig>  myc, max and jun, whose functions have been extensively studied in tumours but only marginally in muscle, appear instead to play important roles in regulating muscle response to atrophy.
in this study we applied meta-analysis on gene expression signatures pertaining to different types of muscle atrophy for the identification of novel key regulatory signals implicated in these degenerative processes.
skeletal muscle mass can be markedly reduced through a process called atrophy, as a consequence of many diseases or critical physiological and environmental situations.
six functional pathways occupy central positions in the molecular network obtained by the integration of atrophy transcriptome and molecular interaction data.
tgf-β pathway plays a central role with proteins smad3/ <dig>  myc, max and cdkn1a in the general network, and jun, myc, gnb2l1/rack <dig> in the short-term muscle response network.
we found a general down-regulation of genes involved in energy production and carbohydrate metabolism and up-regulation of genes for protein degradation and catabolism.
protein degradation pathway is evident only in the network specific for muscle short-term response to atrophy.
although in the last decade the molecular aspects underlying muscle atrophy have received increased attention, the fine mechanisms controlling muscle degeneration are still incomplete.
they are tgf-β pathway, apoptosis, membrane trafficking/cytoskeleton organization, nfkb pathways, inflammation and reorganization of the extracellular matrix.
atrophy is characterised by loss of contractile proteins and reduction of fiber volume.
