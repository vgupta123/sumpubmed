after in vitro rumen digestion, chlamydospore recovery was not different from the quantity originally incubated  .
rumen digestion resulted in more spore germination  compared to no digestion .
negligible amounts of spores were lost during the in vitro rumen digestion.
in vitro rumen+abomasum digestion caused nearly 36% loss of the chlamydospores originally incubated .
the use of duddingtonia flagrans as a tool for the biological control of gastrointestinal nematodes  is a promising alternative to anthelmintics.
as the number of non-digested spores could be relevant in the design and optimization of dosing programmes for the control of gin infective larvae, the aim of the present study was to estimate the loss of d. flagrans chlamydospores during their passage through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract using in vitro and in vivo techniques.
the chlamydospores of d. flagrans are orally dosed and their thick cell wall gives them the capacity to resist digestion and pass through the gastrointestinal tract .
the efficacy of this control method is based on reducing the numbers of infective larvae leaving the faeces.
in vivo passage through the sheep git resulted in a total loss of  <dig> % of the orally administered spores.
however, in vitro rumen+abomasum digestion resulted in a chlamydospore loss of approximately 36%.
