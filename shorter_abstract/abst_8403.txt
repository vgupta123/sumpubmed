several key contigs in the flavonoid and ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways were repressed.
physiological and biochemical indexes showed that the proline and malondialdehyde content were restored to lower levels at a later stage after benzoic acid treatment.
transcription factors including ap2s/erfs, mybs, and wrkys were up-regulated in roots after benzoic acid treatment.
moreover, reactive oxygen species, peroxidases and superoxide dismutase contigs were up-regulated in roots after benzoic acid treatment.
benzoic acid inhibited the root hair development in a dose-dependent manner, and several differential expressed genes potentially involved in hair development were identified.
finally,  <dig>  alternative splicing  events from  <dig>  genes were found after benzoic acid treatment.
this study revealed the stress-response molecular mechanisms in p. ginseng induced by benzoic acid.

as a valuable medicinal plant, the yield of panax ginseng is seriously affected by autotoxicity, which is a common phenomenon due to continuous cropping.
however, the mechanism of autotoxicity in p. ginseng is still unknown.
interestingly, contigs in the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway underwent as, providing useful information about post-transcriptional regulation in p. ginseng.
compared with control,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly up- and down-regulated across different tissues and time points, respectively.
