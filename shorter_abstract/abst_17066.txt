mutacin f- <dig>  consists of  <dig> amino acids, containing the ygngv consensus sequence of pediocin-like bacteriocins with a molecular mass calculated at  <dig> da.
mutacin d- <dig>  has an identical molecular mass  with the same first  <dig> amino acids as mutacin i. mutacins d- <dig>  and f- <dig>  have wide activity spectra inhibiting human and food-borne pathogens.
mutacin d- <dig>  appears to be identical to mutacin i previously identified in different strains of s. mutans.
mutacins  are small antibacterial peptides produced by streptococcus mutans showing activity against bacterial pathogens.
mutacin f- <dig>  was produced in liquid media by s. mutans  <dig>  while production of mutacin d- <dig>  by s. mutans  <dig>  was obtained in semi-solid media.
mutacins were purified by hydrophobic chromatography.
the amino acid sequences of the mutacins were obtained by edman degradation and their molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry.
mutacin f- <dig>  is the first pediocin-like bacteriocin identified and characterised that is produced by streptococcus mutans.
the objective of the study was to produce and characterise additional mutacins in order to find new useful antibacterial substances.
