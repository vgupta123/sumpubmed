in addition, computational complexity does not scale linearly with the number of unknown parameters; all reaction rate parameters are updated concurrently at the end of each iteration in sparse.
we have developed a novel parameter estimation algorithm—stochastic parameter search for events —that automatically computes parameter configurations for propagating the system to produce an event of interest at a user-specified success rate and error tolerance.
its usability and utility do not diminish with large systems as the algorithmic complexity for a given system is independent of the number of unknown reaction rate parameters.
we also show that the novel heuristic for handling over-perturbing parameter sets enables sparse to compute biasing parameters for a class of rare events that is not amenable to current algorithms that are based on importance sampling.
our results demonstrate that sparse substantially accelerates computation of the parametric solution hyperplane compared to uniform random search.
