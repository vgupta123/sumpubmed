we also showed that the rna sequences adjacent to the gc dinucleotides play an important role in mbnl <dig> binding with the following preference: uridines >cytidines >adenosines >guanosines.
the sequestration of mbnl <dig> by expanded cug and ccug repeats is a major component in causing myotonic dystrophy.
in addition to binding the structured expanded cug and ccug repeats; previous results suggested that mbnl <dig> binds single-stranded rnas containing gc dinucleotides.
these results suggest that mbnl <dig> is highly flexible and able to adopt different conformations to recognize rnas with varying sequence configurations.
however additional gc dinucleotides do not enhance rna binding.
for high affinity binding by mbnl <dig>  the distance between the two gc dinucleotides can vary from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides.
these studies revealed that a single gc dinucleotide in poly-uridine is sufficient for mbnl <dig> binding and that a second gc dinucleotide confers higher affinity mbnl <dig> binding.
although mbnl <dig> contains four znfs, only two znf - gc dinucleotide interactions are necessary for high affinity binding.
