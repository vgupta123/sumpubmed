nmf aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product closely approximates the original matrix.
non-negative matrix factorization  has been shown to be a powerful tool for clustering gene expression data, which are widely used to classify cancers.
we propose a maximum correntropy criterion -based nmf method  for gene expression data-based cancer clustering.
extensive experiments on six cancer benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods in cancer clustering.
the optimization problem can be solved by an expectation conditional maximization algorithm.
correntropy was recently shown to be an effective similarity measurement due to its stability to outliers or noise.
