additionally, morphant embryos for either ortholog display incompletely overlapping defects in the forming vasculature of the dorsal aorta , posterior caudal vein  and caudal vein  which are the first blood vessels to form in the embryo.
vasculogenesis and early angiogenesis in the trunk were similarly compromised in rbm <dig> morphant embryos at  <dig> hours post fertilization .
to determine the role of this gene in cardiac development, we have identified its zebrafish orthologs , and functionally evaluated them during zebrafish embryogenesis.
consistent with our underlying hypothesis, reduction in expression of either ortholog through injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides results in cardiogenic defects including cardiac looping and reduced circulation, leading to increasing pericardial edema over time.
we recently identified rbm <dig> as a novel gene expressed during mouse cardiac development.
