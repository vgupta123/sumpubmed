significant association between disease traits and genotypes was detected for several markers, some of them explaining up to 17% of the phenotypic variance.
a finer mapping will be necessary at the detected qtl intervals to narrow associations and around the closely associated markers to look for candidate genes through comparative genomics or positional cloning strategies.
in the present study, a genome scan for qtl affecting resistance and survival to a. salmonicida in four turbot families was carried out.
genomics strategies have been developed in turbot to look for candidate genes for resistance to furunculosis and a genetic map with appropriate density to screen for genomic associations has been also constructed.
significant qtl for resistance were identified by the linear regression method in three linkage groups  and for survival in two lgs .
furunculosis, caused by the bacterium aeromonas salmonicida, produces important losses to turbot industry.
the observed concordance between different statistical methods at particular linkage groups gives consistency to our results.
we also identified candidate genes located in the detected qtl using data from previously mapped markers.
interactions between fish and pathogens, that may be harmless under natural conditions, often result in serious diseases in aquaculture systems.
several regions controlling resistance to a. salmonicida in turbot have been detected.
this is especially important due to the fact that the strains used in aquaculture are derived from wild strains that may not have had enough time to adapt to new disease pressures.
