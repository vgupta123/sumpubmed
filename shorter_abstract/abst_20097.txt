most known eukaryotic genomes contain mobile copied elements called transposable elements.
in this study, we introduce the concept of a transposable element module, a flexible motif present in at least two sequences of a family of transposable elements and built on a succession of maximal repeats.
the paper proposes an assembly method working on a set of exact maximal repeats of a set of sequences to create such modules.
the study of families of transposable elements is generally founded on a multiple alignment of their sequences, a critical step that is adapted to transposons containing mostly localized nucleotide mutations.
comparison with multiple alignment methods shows that our method is more sensitive for highly variable sequences.
it results in a graphical view of sequences segmented into modules, a representation that allows a flexible analysis of the transformations that have occurred between them.
we have chosen as a demonstration data set in depth analysis of the transposable element foldback in drosophila melanogaster.
