we report that our implementation of the chi-square test yielded a combination of low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy.
target template concentration, nucleic acid integrity, and host nucleic acid composition can each have a profound effect on signal distribution.
exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied.
positive predictive value and false positive rates were examined to assess the utility of three well-established nonparametric methods for the analysis of viral array hybridization data:  mann-whitney u,  the spearman correlation coefficient and  the chi-square test.
