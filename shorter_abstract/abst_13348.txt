here, we present a model of sequence evolution that explicitly accounts for the relative solvent accessibility of each residue in a protein.
structure-aware models of sequence evolution provide a significantly better fit than traditional models that neglect structure.
finally, protein core size affects the slope of the linear relationship between ω and rsa, and gene expression level affects both the intercept and the slope.
we further show that the branch length t and the transition-transverion ratio κ also vary with rsa.
the linear relationship between ω and rsa implies that genes are better characterized by their ω slope and intercept than by just their mean ω.
our model is a variant of the goldman-yang  <dig>  model in which all model parameters can be functions of the relative solvent accessibility  of a residue.
the rsa-dependent gy <dig> model performs better than an rsa-dependent muse-gaut  <dig>  model in which the synonymous and non-synonymous rates individually are linear functions of rsa.
