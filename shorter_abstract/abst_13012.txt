previous studies identified qtls for both resistance to carrier state and resistance to salmonella colonization in the same white leghorn inbred lines.
due to the lack of stability of the qtls detected, we suggest that interesting regions for further studies are those that were identified in several independent studies, which is the case of the qtl regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  involved in resistance to both salmonella colonization and carrier state.
these observations provide evidence of common genes controlling s. typhimurium colonization and s. enteritidis carrier-state in chickens.
in the present study, qtl analysis was achieved using maximum likelihood with qtlmap software, in order to test the effect of the qtl analysis method on qtl detection.
we analyzed the same phenotypic and genotypic data as those used in previous studies, which were collected on  <dig> animals genotyped with  <dig> genome-wide snp markers.
to enrich these data, we added eleven snp markers located within qtls controlling resistance to colonization and we looked for potential candidate genes co-localizing with qtls.
in our case the qtl analysis method had an important impact on qtl detection.
interestingly, two qtls were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  close to the locations of the major qtls controlling resistance to colonization and to candidate genes involved in the immune response identified in other, independent studies.
the serovars enteritidis and typhimurium of the gram-negative bacterium salmonella enterica are significant causes of human food poisoning.
increased resistance to the carrier state in commercial poultry could be a way to improve food safety by reducing the spread of these bacteria in poultry flocks.
