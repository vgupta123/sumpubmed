gmmyb <dig> overexpression enhanced lipid contents in both seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants.
gmmyb <dig> introduction into the arabidopsis try cpc double mutant rescued the total lipids, seed size and thousand-seed weight.
gmmyb <dig> is a small protein with single myb repeat and has similarity to cpc-like myb proteins from arabidopsis.
gmmyb <dig> promoted pldα <dig> expression, whose promoter can be bound and inhibited by gl <dig>  pldα <dig> mutation reduced triacylglycerol levels mildly in seeds but significantly in leaves of arabidopsis plants.
one myb-type gene gmmyb <dig> was found to display differential expression in soybean seeds of different developing stages by microarray analysis and was further investigated for its functions in lipid accumulation.
manipulation of gmmyb <dig> may potentially improve oil production in legume crop plants.
gmmyb <dig> also elevated lipid levels in seeds and leaves of transgenic lotus, and in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants.
gmmyb <dig> interacted with gl <dig> and egl <dig>  and then suppressed gl <dig>  a negative regulator of oil accumulation.
the regulatory genes involved in oil accumulation are largely unclear.
gmmyb <dig> may reduce gl <dig>  and then release gl2-inhibited pldα <dig> expression for lipid accumulation.
seed length and thousand-seed weight were also promoted.
