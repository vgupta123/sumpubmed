this experimental validation demonstrates the reliability of tipmt because amplification profiles showed discrimination of genomic dna samples from leishmania species.
here, we report the development of a tool for identification of primers for multiple taxa , which is a web application to search and design primers for genotyping based on genomic data.
however, the design of taxon-specific primers may be difficult and time consuming due to the need to identify appropriate genomic regions for annealing primers and to evaluate primer specificity.
the tool identifies and targets single sequence repeats  or orthologous/taxa-specific genes for genotyping using multiplex pcr.
this pipeline was applied to the genomes of four species of leishmania  and validated by pcr using artificial genomic dna mixtures of the leishmania species as templates.

a polymerase chain reaction -based molecular marker is very attractive because it is suitable to high throughput automation and confers high specificity.
the tipmt web tool allows for large-scale identification and design of taxon-specific primers and is freely available to the scientific community at http:// <dig> .
