here, we investigate three dna barcode lineages of what has been identified as urbanus belli  in Área de conservación guanacaste , northwestern costa rica.
although no morphological traits appear to distinguish among the three, congruent nuclear and mitochondrial lineage patterns show that “urbanus belli” in acg is a complex of three sympatric species.
interlineage, intralineage and intragenomic compensatory base pair changes were discovered in the secondary structure of its <dig>
however, a combination of dna barcodes, morphology, and natural history data has revealed several cryptic species complexes within them.
a single strain of wolbachia present in two of the three cryptic species indicates that urbanus segnestami burns , urbanus bernikerni burns , and urbanus ehakernae burns  may be biologically separated by wolbachia, as well as by their genetics.
these findings corroborate the existence of three cryptic species.
our confirmation of a novel cryptic species complex, initially suggested by dna barcode lineages, argues for using a multi-marker approach coupled with next-generation sequencing for exploration of other suspected species complexes.
