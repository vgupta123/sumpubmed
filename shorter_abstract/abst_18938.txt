executive functions, learning and attention are imperative facets of cognitive performance, affected in many neuropsychiatric disorders.
to create an experimental basis for further mechanistic insight into erythropoietin-modulated cognitive processes, we employed the five choice serial reaction time task.
male mice were treated for  <dig> weeks with erythropoietin  versus placebo intraperitoneally every other day, beginning at postnatal day  <dig>  after termination of treatment, mice were started on the five choice serial reaction time task, with daily training and testing extending to about  <dig> months.
early erythropoietin treatment leads to lasting improvement of cognitive performance in healthy mice.
