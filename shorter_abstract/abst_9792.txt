further, a close examination of the lipoprotein lpqg  which is only detected in the membrane fractions of m. tuberculosis but not in m. bovis, revealed that the homologous gene in m. bovis lack the signal peptide and lipobox motif, suggesting impaired export to the membrane.
altogether, we have identified a substantial proportion of membrane- and membrane-associated proteins of m. tuberculosis h37rv, compared the relative abundance of the identified proteins and also revealed subtle differences between the different members of the m. tuberculosis complex.
comparison of abundance levels of the identified proteins was performed using the exponentially modified protein abundance index  which takes into account the number of the observable peptides to the number of experimentally observed peptide ions for a given protein.
the outcome showed that among the membrane-and membrane-associated proteins several proteins are present with high relative abundance.
