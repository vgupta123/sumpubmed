by this method we detected known snps at site t640g, which confers the nat1* <dig> allele with frequency of  <dig> , further t1088a and c1095a with frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively and a deletion of taataataa in the poly a signal area with a frequency  <dig> .
a modified automated dna sequencing using only one of the sequence terminators was used to genotype pcr products in single-track sequencing reactions of nat <dig> and was shown to be universal for both dna sequencing using labeled primers and labeled nucleotides.
