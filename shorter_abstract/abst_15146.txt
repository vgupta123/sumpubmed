nonetheless, how whole energy-producing pathways evolve to allow organisms to thrive in different environments and adopt new lifestyles remains little explored.
to address these questions we obtained transcript sequences from seven core glycolysis enzymes, including two pgi paralogues, from  <dig> lanceocercata species.
positive selection among pgi paralogues and orthologues predominately targets amino acids with residues exposed to the proteinâ€™s surface, where changes in physical properties may alter enzyme performance.
our results suggest that, for lancerocercata stick insects, adaptation to new stressful lifestyles requires a balance between maintaining cellular energy production, efficiently exploiting different energy storage pools and compensating for stress-induced oxidative damage.
pgi and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  genes both encode enzymes linking glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway.
the glycolytic pathway is central to cellular energy production.
this permits a broad investigation to determine which steps within glycolysis and what sites within enzymes are the targets of positive selection.
using maximum likelihood methods a signature of positive selection was inferred in two core glycolysis enzymes.
