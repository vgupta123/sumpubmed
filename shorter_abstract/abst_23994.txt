conditional deletion of ezh <dig> in the developing midbrain resulted in decreased neural progenitor proliferation, which is associated with derepression of cell cycle inhibitors and negative regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling.
of note, ezh <dig> ablation also promoted ectopic expression of a forebrain transcriptional program involving derepression of the forebrain determinants foxg <dig> and pax <dig>  this was accompanied by reduced expression of midbrain markers, including pax <dig> and pax <dig>  as a consequence of decreased wnt/β-catenin signaling.
ezh <dig> is required for appropriate brain growth and maintenance of regional identity by h3k27me3-mediated gene repression and control of canonical wnt signaling.
precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression is essential for the establishment of correct cell numbers and identities during brain development.
this process involves epigenetic control mechanisms, such as those mediated by the polycomb group protein ezh <dig>  which catalyzes trimethylation of histone h3k <dig>  and thereby represses gene expression.
