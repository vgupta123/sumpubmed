in order to eliminate position effects, the cre/lox recombination system was used to create control plant lines that contain identical t-dna insertion sites but with the abf <dig> transgene excised.
microarray analysis of control plant lines that underwent cre-mediated excision of the abf <dig> transgene revealed only two genes that were differentially expressed in more than one plant line, suggesting that the impact of cre recombinase on the transcriptome was minimal.
plants engineered for abiotic stress tolerance may soon be commercialized.
while research on unintended effects in transgenic plant systems has been instrumental in demonstrating the substantial equivalence of many transgenic plant systems, it is essential that such analyses be extended to transgenic plants engineered for stress tolerance.
in response to drought stress, overexpression of abf <dig> results in a reprogramming of the drought response, which is characterized by changes in the timing or strength of expression of some drought response genes, without activating any unexpected gene networks.
these results illustrate that important gene networks are highly regulated in arabidopsis and that engineering stress tolerance may not necessarily cause extensive changes to the transcriptome.
in the absence of drought stress, overexpression of abf <dig> had no effect on the transcriptome, but following drought stress, differences were observed in the gene expression patterns of plants overexpressing abf <dig> relative to control plants.
in the absence of drought stress, ectopic activation of drought response pathways does not occur.
this additionally allowed us to determine if cre recombinase can cause unintended effects that impact the transcriptome.
