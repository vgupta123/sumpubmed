in this paper, we present a prediction method for time-to-event traits using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms .
the proposed maxtest can help screen out nonprognostic snps and identify genetic models of prognostic snps.
in conjunction with the maxtest, the proposed method provides more parsimonious prediction models but includes more prognostic snps than some naive prediction methods.
the proposed method is demonstrated with real gwas data.
we also propose a maxtest associating between a time-to-event trait and a snp accounting for its possible genetic models.
