to map early development and subsequent interactions with the rest of the biospheric web, simplified gnotobiotic systems described here may turn to be of general use, complementing similar studies on developing multicellular eukaryots under germ-free or gnotobiotic conditions.
our results suggest that development of a bacterial colony can be considered analogous to embryogenesis in animals, plants, or fungi: to proceed, early stages require thorough insulation from the rest of the biosphere.
growth of an axenic colony, mutual interactions of colonies, and negotiation of the morphospace in consortial ecosystems are results of intricate regulatory and metabolic networks.
bacteria grown on semi-solid media can build two types of multicellular structures, depending on the circumstances.
multicellular structures developed by serratia sp.
standard development can be modified in a characteristic and reproducible manner in close vicinity of other bacterial structures .
building on our previous work, we developed a model system for studying ontogeny of multicellular bacterial structures formed by five serratia sp.
mixed “anlagen” cannot accomplish the first, germ-free phase of development; hence, they will result in the consortium of small colonies.
only later, the newly developing body gets connected to the ecological interactions in the biosphere.
