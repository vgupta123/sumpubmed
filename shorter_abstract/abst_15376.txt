the fully automated assembly and anchorage procedures were validated by bac-by-bac blast of the end sequences against the grape genome sequence, unveiling  <dig> % of chimerical contigs.
the quality of the result was addressed with regard to the effect of high heterozygosity on the accuracy of contig assembly.
map inflation was due to high heterozygosity, which caused either the separation of allelic bacs in two different contigs, or local mis-assembly in contigs containing bacs from the two haplotypes.
whole-genome physical maps facilitate genome sequencing, sequence assembly, mapping of candidate genes, and the design of targeted genetic markers.
genetic markers anchored  <dig> contigs or  <dig>  kbp to chromosomes.
the distribution across the physical map of candidate genes for non-host and host resistance, and for defence signalling pathways was then studied.
despite some limitations that interfere with the correct assembly of heterozygous clones into contigs, the 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map is a useful and reliable intermediary step between a genetic map and the genome sequence.
an automated protocol was used to construct a vitis vinifera 'cabernet sauvignon' physical map.
this tool was successfully exploited for a quick mapping of complex families of genes, and it strengthened previous clues of co-localisation of major nbs-lrr clusters and disease resistance loci in grapevine.
nbs-lrr and rlk genes for host resistance were found in  <dig> contigs,  <dig> of them  were assigned to chromosomes, on which they are mostly organised in clusters.
the physical map included  <dig>  bac clones assembled into  <dig>  contigs, spanning  <dig>  kbp, and corresponding to  <dig> -fold the genome size.
its usefulness for the genome-wide mapping of genes for disease resistance, which is an important trait for grapevine, was then assessed.
