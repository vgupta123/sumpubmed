macrophages play an important role in the innate immunity of the udder.
only s. chromogenes was substantially killed by macrophages.
significant differences between single cns species and s. aureus were observed in both assays.
coagulase-negative staphylococci  cause usually subclinical or mild clinical bovine mastitis, which often remains persistent.
staphylococcus aureus  was also included as a control.
this study examined phagocytosis and killing by mouse macrophage cells of three cns species: staphylococcus chromogenes , staphylococcus agnetis  and staphylococcus simulans .
all the studied cns species were phagocytosed by macrophages, but s. simulans resisted phagocytosis more effectively than the other cns species.
however, clinical mastitis with severe signs has also been reported.
