we designed an ires search system, named irss, to obtain better results for ires prediction.
in addition, all source codes, precompiled binaries, examples and documentations are downloadable for local execution.
two software programs formed the backbone of irss: the rnal fold program, used to predict local rna secondary structures by minimum free energy method; and the rna align program, used to compare predicted structures.
rna secondary structure prediction and comparison software programs were implemented to construct our two-stage strategy for the irss.
ires elements are important factors in viral genomes and are also useful tools for bi-cistronic expression vectors.
most existing rna structure prediction programs are unable to deal with ires elements.
this new search approach for ires elements will provide a useful research tool on ires related studies.
