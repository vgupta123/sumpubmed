a current challenge is to be able to handle this huge amount of sequences in order to build families of homologous sequences in a reasonable time.
as a demonstration of the ability of our software, we clustered more than  <dig> millions sequences from about  <dig> billion blast hits in  <dig> minutes, with a high clustering quality, both in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
