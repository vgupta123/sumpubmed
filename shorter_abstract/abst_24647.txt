maxalign can be used prior to phylogenetic and bioinformatical analyses as well as in other situations where this form of alignment improvement is useful.
we also show that it is not advisable to exclude gapped columns from phylogenetic analyses unless maxalign is used first.
we demonstrate how maxalign is helpful in detecting misaligned or defective sequences without requiring manual inspection.
the presence of gaps in an alignment of nucleotide or protein sequences is often an inconvenience for bioinformatical studies.
