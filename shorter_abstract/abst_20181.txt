hcpt-loaded nanoparticles appear to change the pharmacokinetic behavior of hcpt in vivo.
the tumor inhibition effect in the hcpt-loaded nanosphere-treated group was significantly higher than that of the hcpt-treated group .
tumor inhibition in the control group by peg-pblg nanoparticles was not observed .
in order to enhance its tissue-specific delivery and anticancer activity, we prepared hcpt-loaded nanoparticles made from poly-poly , and then studied their release characteristics, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and anticancer effects.
compared to the hcpt- and control-treated groups, the hcpt-loaded nanoparticle-treated group showed a more sustained release, a longer circulation time, increased delivery to tissue, and an enhanced anticancer effect.
hydroxycamptothecin  has been shown to have activity against a broad spectrum of cancers.
drug-loading capacity and drug encapsulation were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.
the pharmacokinetic parameters of hcpt/peg-pblg nanoparticles were compared with those of hcpt.
the hcpt release profile was biphasic, with an initial abrupt release, followed by sustained release.
a high-performance liquid chromatography  detection method for determining hcpt in rabbit plasma was established.
peg-pblg nanoparticles incorporating hcpt were prepared by a dialysis method.
