we utilize tophat <dig> and gsnap for mapping to the human genome, and bowtie <dig> and stampy for mapping to the human genome and transcriptome for a total of six mapping approaches.
such features facilitate sensitive alignment of non-human primate rna-seq data to a human reference.
for each of these methods, we explore mapping rates and locations, number of detected genes, correlations between computed expression values, and the utility of the resulting data for differential expression analysis.
de novo assembly methods have gained widespread acceptance in the rna-seq community for organisms with no true reference genome or transcriptome.
we show that reference-based mapping methods indeed have utility in rna-seq analysis of mammalian data with no true reference, and the details of mapping methods should be carefully considered when doing so.
