previous evidence indicated that tlk1b can promote repair of plasmids with cohesive ends in vitro, but it was inferred that the mechanism was indirect and via chromatin assembly, mediated by its interaction with the chromatin assembly factor asf <dig>  we recently identified rad <dig> as a substrate of tlk1b, and we presented evidence that the tlk1b-rad <dig> interaction plays some role in dsb repair.
depletion of ku <dig> prevented the ligation of the plasmid but did not affect stimulation of the fill-in of the ends by added tlk1b, which was attributed to rad <dig>  from experiments with the ho-cleavage system, we now show that rad <dig>  a subunit of the "clamp loader", associates normally with the dsb in kd-overexpressing cells.
this established that it is a chaperone activity of tlk1b and not directly the kinase activity that promotes recruitment of 9-1- <dig> to the dsb.
here we present direct evidence that tlk1b can promote repair of linearized plasmids with incompatible ends that require processing prior to ligation.
ligation of incompatible ends also required dna-pk, as addition of wortmannin or immunodepletion of ku <dig> abrogated ligation.
tlks play important roles in dna repair, not only by modulation of chromatin assembly via asf <dig>  but also by a more direct function in processing the ends of a dsb via interaction with rad <dig>  inhibition of rad <dig> phosphorylation in kd-overexpressing cells may have consequences in signaling completion of the repair and cell cycle re-entry, and could explain a loss of viability from dsbs in these cells.
using an adeno-ho-mediated cleavage system in mm3mg cells, we previously showed that overexpression of either tlk1b or a kinase-dead protein  promoted repair and the assembly of rad <dig> in proximity of the dsb at early time points post-infection.
the tousled-like kinases are involved in chromatin assembly, dna repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation.
