statistical properties of these distributions have been studied particularly in relation to the transcriptional regulatory network.
these findings support previous evidence from gene expression patterns for two distinct logical types of control, namely digital control  and analog control .
we distinguish between genes that do not participate in the transcriptional regulatory network , and genes that via transcription factors either are regulated by or regulate other genes.
the systematics of gene-gene distances then become important sources of information on the control, which different biological mechanisms exert on gene expression.
the positioning of genes in the genome is an important evolutionary degree of freedom for organizing gene regulation.
