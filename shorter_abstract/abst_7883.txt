we used a neurod:egfp transgenic line to examine endocrine cell behavior in vivo and developed a novel live-imaging technique to document emergence and migration of late-forming endocrine precursors in real time.
our data show that notch-responsive progenitors for late-arising endocrine cells are predominantly post mitotic and depend on pdx <dig>  by contrast, early-arising endocrine cells are specified and differentiate independent of pdx <dig>
we demonstrate a pdx1-dependent progenitor population essential for the formation of duct-associated, second wave endocrine cells.
loss-of-function studies in mouse and zebrafish demonstrated that the homeobox transcription factors pdx <dig> and hb <dig> are both critical for pancreas and beta cell development and discrete stage-specific requirements for these genes have been uncovered.
a novel imaging approach permitted visualization of the emergence of late endocrine cells within developing embryos for the first time.
in addition, interactions of pdx <dig> and hb <dig> in beta cell formation have not been addressed.
to learn more about endocrine progenitor specification, we examined beta cell formation following morpholino-mediated depletion of pdx <dig> and hb <dig>  we find that after early beta cell reduction, recovery occurs following loss of either pdx <dig> or hb <dig> function.
insulin-producing beta cells emerge during pancreas development in two sequential waves.
recently described later-forming beta cells in zebrafish show high similarity to second wave mammalian beta cells in developmental capacity.
the nearly complete beta cell deficiency after combined loss of hb <dig> and pdx <dig> suggests functional cooperation, which we clarify as distinct roles in early and late endocrine cell formation.
unexpectedly, simultaneous knockdown of both hb <dig> and pdx <dig> leads to virtually complete and persistent beta cell deficiency.
