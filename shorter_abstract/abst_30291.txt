the transcriptional status of the genes comprising the refined iron/heme core modulon was then assessed in vivo, in a chinchilla model of otitis media.
haemophilus influenzae is a significant cause of childhood otitis media, and also has an absolute growth requirement for heme.
in this report, the core iron/heme modulon was further refined following microarray analysis of two additional nontypeable h. influenzae isolates from patients with otitis media.
in vivo studies were performed with two nontypeable h. influenzae strains, 86-028np and hi <dig>  the majority of operons identified as members of the core modulon by microarray were also actively upregulated in the chinchilla ear during otitis media.
this study elucidates a conserved core of h. influenzae genes the transcription of which is altered by the availability of iron and heme in the growth environment, and further assesses transcription of these genes in vivo.
in 86-028np, 70% of the operons were significantly upregulated while in hi <dig> 100% of the operons were upregulated in samples recovered from the chinchilla middle ear.
recent microarray studies using three h. influenzae isolates were used to propose a putative core of genes responsive to iron and heme levels.
defining these core genes is also of potential importance in identifying targets for therapeutic and vaccine designs since products of these genes are likely to be preferentially expressed during growth in iron/heme restricted sites of the human body.
microarray analysis of two additional h. influenzae strains resulted in the definition of a core of iron/heme responsive genes.
included in the core modulon were thirty seven genes that are preferentially expressed under iron/heme limitation, most of which are directly involved with iron and or heme acquisition.
