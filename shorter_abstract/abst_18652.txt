in this study, soybean mirnas associated with stress responses  have been identified and analyzed in combination with deep sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis.
in addition,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas are either uniquely or differently expressed under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many mirnas are inducible and are differentially expressed in response to certain stress.
our study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of mirnas in glycine max.
micrornas  have recently emerged as key regulators in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress tolerance in plants.
