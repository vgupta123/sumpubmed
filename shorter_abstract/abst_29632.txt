in this study, we show that several of  <dig> examined b. licheniformis strains germinate remarkably slower than the type strain when exposed to l-alanine.
a wide selection of b. licheniformis strains was evaluated for l-alanine-induced germination efficiency.
our results show that gera substitutions could only partially explain why spores of some b. licheniformis strains responded slower than others in the presence of l-alanine.
three of the slow-germinating strains were further examined in order to see whether nucleotide substitutions in the gera sequences were responsible for the slow l-alanine germination.
this was performed by complementing the transformable type strain derivate mw3Î”geraa with gera variants from the three slow-germinating strains; nvh <dig>  nvh <dig> and nvh <dig>
