the advantages of haplo2ped over other existing software include straightforward output files, increased accuracy and superior ability to deal with pedigrees showing incomplete penetrance.
the 3d figure clearly displays the linkage signals in each chromosome.
haplo2ped uses haplotype fragments as mapping markers in whole genome linkage analysis.
the results are reported as a hypertext file and a 3d figure to help users to obtain the candidate linkage regions.
the hypertext file contains parameters of the disease linked regions, candidate genes, and their links to public databases.
we tested haplo2ped in a simulated snp dataset and also applied it to data from a real study.
generally, snps are abundant in the genome; however, they display low power in linkage analysis because of their limited heterozygosity.
comparison of haplo2ped with other existing software for linkage analysis further indicated the high effectiveness of this software.
