regeneration in lizards involves differential expression of hundreds of genes that regulate wound healing, musculoskeletal development, hormonal response, and embryonic morphogenesis.
microrna sequencing of green anole lizard  regenerating tail and associated tissues revealed  <dig> putative novel and  <dig> known microrna precursors.
eleven micrornas were differentially expressed between the regenerating tail tip and base during maximum outgrowth , including mir-133a, mir-133b, and mir- <dig>  which have been reported to regulate regeneration and stem cell proliferation in other model systems.
three putative novel differentially expressed micrornas were identified in the regenerating tail tip.
while micrornas are able to regulate large groups of genes, their role in lizard regeneration has not been investigated.
differentially expressed micrornas were identified in the regenerating lizard tail, including known regulators of stem cell proliferation.
