here, we focus on the distributions of the  <dig> different types of 3-grams  in the entire space of sequences accumulated to date in the uniprot database, and focus in particular on the rare 3-grams distinguished by their high entropy-based information content.
the results suggest that recruitment of rare 3-grams may be an efficient mechanism for increasing specificity at functional sites.
three cases, src kinase, hemoglobin, and tyrosyl-trna synthetase, are discussed in details to illustrate the biological significance of the results.
sequence and structure conservations have traditionally been the major criteria adopted in various algorithms to identify functional sites.
comparison of the uniprot distributions with those observed near/at the active sites on a non-redundant dataset of  <dig> enzyme/ligand complexes shows that the active sites preferentially recruit 3-grams distinguished by their low frequency in the uniprot.
a wealth of unannotated and functionally unknown protein sequences has accumulated in recent years with rapid progresses in sequence genomics, giving rise to ever increasing demands for developing methods to efficiently assess functional sites.
in addition it provides us  with a means of identifying potentially functional sites from sequence information alone, when sequence conservation properties are not available.
