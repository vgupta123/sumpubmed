disease was characterized by assessment of body weight loss, titration of virus and bacteria, histopathology, and cytokine production.
considering bacterial infections following influenza are a leading cause of illness and death, it is of particular meaning to investigate the interaction between these two pathogens.
the histological lesions in the brain, spleen and lung were more severe in the civ/sp group than in the singly treated groups.
moreover, the levels of ifn-γ in the spleen and lung were higher in the civ/sp group compared with the civ-only and sp-only groups.
in this study, balb/c mice were used as a mouse model to assess whether inoculation with civ h3n <dig> followed by s. pseudintermedius  <dig> h later resulted in exacerbation of disease.
our findings provide the first demonstration that the secondary infection of mice with sp leads to increased clinical signs and lesions during canine influenza.
there was a significantly greater decrease in body weight in the co-infected group compared with the civ-only and sp-only groups.
civ inoculation increased bacterial colonization, whereas secondary infection with s. pseudintermedius elevated the viral rna load of civ in tissues.
