the calsarcins comprise a novel family of muscle-specific calcineurin-interaction proteins that play an important role in modulating both the function and substrate specificity of calcineurin in muscle cells.
these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing transcription in specific muscle fibre cells.
promoter deletion analysis further suggests that an nf-κb binding site within the cs- <dig> promoter is responsible for the up-regulation of cs- <dig> transcription, but no similar mechanism was evident for cs- <dig>  these findings are further supported by the results of emsa analysis, as well as by overexpression and inhibition experiments in which nf-κb function was blocked by treatment with its inhibitor, pdtc.
however, the transcriptional control of this selective expression has not been previously elucidated.
our real-time rt-pcr analyses suggest that the expression of cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> is increased during the myogenic differentiation of mouse c2c <dig> cells.
