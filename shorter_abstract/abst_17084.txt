results obtained from both microarray experiments clustered together, but were different from those of the mycotoxin patulin.
however, the information on the action mechanism of the toxin is limited.
results from both microarray studies suggest that citrinin treatment induced oxidative stress in yeast cells.
while, the citrinin treatment did not induce the genes involved in the dna repair.
we monitored the citrinin-induced mrna expression profiles in yeast using the orf dna microarray and oligo dna microarray, and the expression profiles were compared with those of the other stress-inducing agents.
citrinin inhibited growth of yeast cells at a concentration higher than  <dig> ppm.
in the functional category, expression of genes involved in "metabolism", "cell rescue, defense and virulence", and "energy" were significantly activated.
in the category of "metabolism", genes involved in the glutathione synthesis pathway were activated, and in the category of "cell rescue, defense and virulence", the abc transporter genes were induced.
mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites commonly present in feed and food, and are widely regarded as hazardous contaminants.
the oxidative stress response genes – aads, flr <dig>  oye <dig>  gre <dig>  and met <dig> – were significantly induced.
however, the oligo dna microarray did not completely overcome cross hybridization.
the reproducibility of the expression profiles was much better with the oligo dna microarray.
