our new algorithm is able to find interesting and biologically meaningful relationships, not found by other algorithms, in previously analyzed data sets.
obtaining physiological insights from microarray experiments requires computational techniques that relate gene expression data to functional information.
we have developed an algorithm that relates patterns of gene expression in a set of microarray experiments to functional groups in one step.
the significance of the relationships between expression data and functional annotations is evaluated based on density histograms that are constructed using product similarity among expression vectors.
the effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated as part of a study of regulation by two-component systems in escherichia coli.
scaling of the algorithm to large data sets can be achieved based on a theoretical model.
we present a biological analysis of three of the resulting functional groups of proteins, develop hypotheses for further biological studies, and test one of these hypotheses experimentally.
