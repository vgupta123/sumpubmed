many methods for performing such comparisons are based on the information in databases of functional annotation, such as those that form the gene ontology .
a new global testing procedure and a method incorporating it are presented.
the new global test is more powerful and accurate with respect to type i errors than the usual class-by-class approach.
enrichment analysis, where a list of genes is compared against a wider universe of genes, is the most common example.
instead of testing separately for each go class, a single global test for all classes under consideration is performed.
when applied to some real datasets, the results suggest that the method may also provide useful information that complements the tests performed using a class-by-class approach if gene counts are sparse in some classes.
the test is based on the distance between the functional profiles, defined as the joint frequencies of annotation in a given set of go classes.
for global comparisons it is preferable to the global chi-square test of homogeneity.
