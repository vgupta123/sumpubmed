polystichum are resolved into three major clades: clade k , clade l , and the hymaso superclade dominated by accessions of p. sect.
haplopolystichum are resolved into eight major clades; and  the monophyly of the afra clade , the australasian clade , and the north american clade  is confirmed.
consequently, the majority of morphological hypotheses/classifications have never been tested using molecular data.
our analyses show that  polystichum is monophyletic, this being supported by not only molecular data but also morphological features and distribution information;  polystichum is resolved into two strongly supported monophyletic clades, corresponding to the two subgenera, p. subg.
previous studies typically had sparse taxon sampling and used limited dna sequence data.

of the  <dig> sections of polystichum recognized in a recent classification of the genus, four  are resolved as non-monophyletic,  <dig> are recovered as monophyletic, and three are monospecific.
