our results show that predicting maps through the pe yields sizeable gains especially for long-range contacts which are particularly critical for accurate protein 3d reconstruction.
although improvements have occurred over the last years, the problem of accurately predicting residue contact maps from primary sequences is still largely unsolved.
in order to alleviate these problems and achieve improved contact map predictions, in this paper we split the task into two stages: the prediction of a map's principal eigenvector  from the primary sequence; the reconstruction of the contact map from the pe and primary sequence.
predicting the pe from the primary sequence consists in mapping a vector into a vector.
we develop architectures composed of ensembles of two-layered bidirectional recurrent neural networks to classify the components of the pe in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> classes from protein primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, and hydrophobicity interaction scales.
on the  <dig> casp <dig> novel fold targets we achieve similar accuracies .
protein topology representations such as residue contact maps are an important intermediate step towards ab initio prediction of protein structure.
we design a system for the prediction of contact maps from the predicted pe.
a suite of predictors of structural features, including the pe, and pe-based contact maps, is available at .
our final system for contact map prediction achieves state-of-the-art performances, and may provide valuable constraints for improved ab initio prediction of protein structures.
our predictor, tested on a non redundant set of  <dig> proteins, achieves classification performances of up to  <dig> %, 16% above a base-line statistical predictor.
this task is less complex than mapping vectors directly into two-dimensional matrices since the size of the problem is drastically reduced and so is the scale length of interactions that need to be learned.
