the purpose of this work was to characterize the expression of drug and nutrient carriers along the anterior-posterior and crypt-villus axes of the intestinal epithelium and to study the validity of utilizing whole gut tissue rather than purified epithelial cells to examine regional variations in gene expression.
for the transporter subclass "carrier activity", which contains the majority of known carriers for biologically active compounds, a significant change  along the anterior-posterior axis was observed.
for nine transporters , the mrna profiles were further measured by rt-pcr in laser micro-dissected crypt and villus epithelial cells corresponding to the aforementioned intestinal regions.
furthermore, we suggest that the distribution characteristics of slc5a <dig> along the intestinal tract render it a suitable candidate carrier for monocarboxylate drugs in the posterior portion of the intestine.
with respect to differentially regulated transporters, the colon had a distinct expression profile from small intestinal segments.
we have characterized the mrna expression profiles of  <dig> % of all currently known transporters along the anterior-posterior axis of the gut.
finally, for the examined genes, profiles measured in whole intestinal tissue extracts are representative of epithelial cell-only gene expression.
the expression profiles of transporters, as defined according to the gene ontology consortium, were measured in whole tissue of the murine duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon using high-density microarrays.
our findings also predict that there is a significant difference in the absorption of carrier-mediated compounds in the different intestinal segments.
this is the first study to describe the expression profiles of the majority of all known transporters in the intestine.
