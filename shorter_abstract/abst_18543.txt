the maternally inherited bacterium wolbachia often acts as a subtle parasite that manipulates insect reproduction, resulting potentially in reproductive isolation between host populations.
this data overall supports the hypothesis that wpip infections, and their allied mitochondria, are associated with regular transfers between cx.
there was a strong association between wolbachia and mitochondrial haplotypes indicating a stable co-transmission in mosquito populations.
pipiens complex are genetically distinct on the basis of nuclear dna, the association of wolbachia and mtdna with members of the cx.
overall, this is suggestive of a recent and likely ongoing cytoplasmic introgression through hybridization events across the cx.
whilst distinct wolbachia strains are documented in a group of evolutionarily closely related mosquitoes known as the culex pipiens complex, their impact on mosquito population genetics remains unclear.
four other wpip groups were also found in mosquito populations and all were shared between diverse cx.
pipiens members rather than specific host associations.
we further examined the wolbachia genetic diversity, the variability in the coinherited host mitochondria and their partitioning among members of the cx.
