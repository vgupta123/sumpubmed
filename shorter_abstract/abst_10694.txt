those proteins are probable targets of the fungus interaction with the host; thus, they could contribute to the invasiveness of the fungus.
by using proteomic analysis, we aimed to identify other proteins of paracoccidioides with the ability of binding to plasminogen.
in the present study, we employed proteomic analysis of the secretome, in order to identify plasminogen-binding proteins of paracoccidioides, pb <dig>  fifteen proteins were present in the fungal secretome, presenting the ability to bind to plasminogen.
the protein fba at the fungus surface and the recombinant fba  bound human plasminogen and promoted its conversion to plasmin, potentially increasing the fibrinolytic capacity of the fungus, as demonstrated in fibrin degradation assays.
previous work from our group demonstrated that paracoccidioides presents enolase, as a protein able to bind and activate plasminogen, increasing the fibrinolytic activity of the pathogen, and the potential for adhesion and invasion of the fungus to host cells.
microbial pathogens express molecules that can interact with human plasminogen, a protein from blood plasma, which presents fibrinolytic activity when activated into plasmin.
these data reveal the possible participation of the fba in the processes of cell adhesion and tissue invasion/dissemination of paracoccidioides.
the addition of rfba or anti-rfba antibodies was capable of reducing the interaction between macrophages and paracoccidioides, possibly by blocking the binding sites for fba.
