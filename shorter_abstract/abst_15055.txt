fifty-seven genes are annotated in other enterobacteriaceae, mainly as hypothetical genes; the remaining  <dig> genes constitute novel discoveries.
these findings demonstrate that ribosomal footprinting can be used to detect novel protein coding genes, contributing to the growing body of evidence that hypothetical genes are not annotation artifacts and opening an additional way to study their functionality.
in addition, protein structure and function were predicted computationally and compared between ehec-encoded proteins and 100-times randomly shuffled proteins.
based on this comparison,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel proteins exhibit predicted structural and functional features similar to those of annotated proteins.
many of the novel genes show differential transcription when grown under eleven diverse growth conditions suggesting environmental regulation.
genomes of e. coli, including that of the human pathogen escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  edl <dig>  still harbor undetected protein-coding genes which, apparently, have escaped annotation due to their small size and non-essential function.
to find such genes, global gene expression of ehec edl <dig> was examined, using strand-specific rnaseq , ribosomal footprinting  and mass spectrometry .
seven were verified by mass spectrometry.
