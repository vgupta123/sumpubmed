the results present here suggested that many mirnas were involved in the regulation of seed germination of sacred lotus, providing a foundation for future studies of sacred lotus seed longevity.
micrornas  play important roles in plant growth and development.
furthermore, some mirna families which have not yet been reported in monocot or eudicot species were detected in n. nucifera, indicating that these mirnas was divergence from monocots and core eudicots during evolution.
in this study, a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified during seed germination using high-throughput small rna sequencing.
go  and kegg pathway analyses showed that many target genes enriched in “regulation of transcription” and involved in “carbohydrate”, “amino acid and energy metabolism”.

mirnas and their targets have been widely studied in model plants, but limited knowledge is available concerning this small rna population and their targets in sacred lotus .
comparative analysis of mirnas from different plants also provided insight into the evolutionary gains and losses of mirnas in plants.
