the alternative diagnostic tools applied to dissection positive samples were characterised by low sensitivity, and no information on the specificity was available at all.
we therefore conducted a systematic review of published studies documenting trypanosome infection prevalence from field surveys or from laboratory experiments under controlled conditions.

an important aspect of the tsetse fly population is its trypanosome infection prevalence, as it determines the intensity of the transmission of the parasite by the vector.
both temporal and spatial variation in trypanosome infection prevalence of field collected tsetse flies exists, but further investigation on real risk factors is needed how this variation can be explained.
publications were screened in the web of science, pubmed and google scholar databases.
improving the sensitivity and determining the specificity of these alternative diagnostic tools should be a priority and will allow to estimate the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies in high-throughput.
the optimisation of trypanosomosis control programs warrants a good knowledge of the main vector of animal and human trypanosomes in sub-saharan africa, the tsetse fly.
the country and the year of publication were found to be significantly factors associated with the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies.
the microscopic examination of dissected flies  remains the most used method to detect trypanosomes and thus constituted the main focus of this analysis.
meta-regression was performed to identify factors responsible for high trypanosome prevalence in the vectors and a random effects meta-analysis was used to report the sensitivity of molecular and serological tests using the dissection method as gold standard.
