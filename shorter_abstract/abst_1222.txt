when transcriptome was compared with the proteomic data available, we observed a correlation of about 50%, suggesting that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are important for determining protein abundance in s. mansoni.
whereas only 8% of the  <dig> most abundant tags found in adult worms of s. mansoni could not be assigned to transcripts of this parasite,  <dig> % of the total ditags could not be mapped, demonstrating that the  <dig> sequence of most of the rarest transcripts are still to be identified.
mapping of our sage tags to s. mansoni genes suggested the occurrence of alternative-polyadenylation in at least  <dig> gene transcripts.
sage revealed the frequency of expression of the majority of the s. mansoni genes.
after extracting mrna from pooled male and female adult-worms, a sage library was constructed and sequenced, generating  <dig>  tags that covered more than  <dig>  genes expressed in this developmental stage.
the generation of sage tags from other life-cycle stages should contribute to reveal the dynamics of gene expression in this important parasite.
an analysis of the ordered tag-list shows the genes of f <dig> eggshell protein, pol-polyprotein, hsp <dig>  14-3- <dig> and a transcript yet to be identified to be the five top most abundant genes in pooled adult worms.
transcriptome data suggests that alternative polyadenylation is likely to be used in the control of mrna stability in this organism.
