the figler 1– <dig> genes are predicted to encode type i transmembrane glycoproteins with 6– <dig> leucine-rich repeats , a c <dig> type ig domain, a fibronectin type iii domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing one to four tyrosine residues.
the non-human figler homologs share 38–99% overall amino acid identity with their human counterpart.
members of this multichromosomal gene family possess 20–47% overall amino acid identity and are differentially expressed in cell lines and primary hematopoietic lineage cells.
genes for figler homologs were identified in macaque, orangutan, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, toad, and puffer fish databases.
