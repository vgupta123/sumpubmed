the etiological factors of the disease have been studied in depth, however, to this day, little is known about the natural course of the disorder and how it can be detected at an early stage in pigs.
in this study, clear signs of subclinical signs of oc were observed, however, we were unsuccessful in producing clinical oc.
the aim of this pilot study was to assess the potential of three non-invasive techniques for the detection and monitoring of early oc processes in piglets.
both visual scoring and pressure mat analyses showed good intra-assay reproducibility, with the pressure mat showing intra-class correlation values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the inter-observer agreement of visual scoring method was between  <dig> and 96Â %, however their correlation to oc lesions detected by histology was very weak, with only  <dig> out of  <dig> traits for the visual scoring method showing significant and biologically logical relations to a specific joint having histological oc lesions.
for the pressure mat, only a maximum of  <dig> associations for specific joints with histological oc lesions were found out of a possible  <dig>
it also shows the difficulty in producing oc regardless of the optimization of the experimental settings in relation to the etiological factors known to induce oc.
a group of weaned piglets  were examined longitudinally using radiographs, a visual lameness scoring scheme and a quantitative pressure-mat based locomotion analysis system to detect oc in the humeroradial, femoropatellar and tarsocrural joints.
all tested in-vivo methods showed good reproducibility.
