candidate genes with regulatory functions involved in maize shade avoidance response have been identified, offering a starting point for further functional genomics investigation of maize adaptation to heavily shaded field conditions.
optimization of shade avoidance response  is crucial for enhancing crop yield in high-density planting conditions in modern agriculture, but a comprehensive study of the regulatory network of sar is still lacking in monocot crops.
co-expression network analysis identified two transcription factor modules as potentially pivotal regulators of sar and de-etiolation, respectively.
the results provide the first transcriptional picture for the early dynamics of maize phytochrome signaling.
a comprehensive cross-species comparison of orthologous dtg pairs between maize and arabidopsis in sar was also conducted, with emphasis on regulatory circuits controlling accelerated flowering and elongated growth, two physiological hallmarks of sar.
clustering of differentially transcribed genes  along with functional enrichment analysis identified important biological processes regulated in response to both treatments.
moreover, it was found that the genome-wide distribution of dtgs in sar and de-etiolation both biased toward the maize <dig> subgenome, and this was associated with differential retention of various cis-elements between the two subgenomes.
in this study, the genome-wide early responses in maize seedlings to the simulated shade  and also to far-red light treatment were transcriptionally profiled.
