epigenetic molecular clocks imply similar mitotic ages for hairs on young and old human heads, consistent with a restart with each new hair, and with genealogies surreptitiously written within somatic cell genomes.
stem cells divide to reproduce themselves and produce differentiated progeny.
a fundamental problem in human biology has been the inability to measure how often stem cells divide.
stem cells with more divisions should produce progeny with more replication errors.
errors may accumulate in long-lived stem cells, or in their differentiated progeny that are eventually shed.
average hair errors increased until two years of age, and then were constant despite decades of replacement, consistent with new hairs arising from infrequently dividing bulge stem cells.
to test this approach, epigenetic errors  in cpg-rich molecular clocks were measured from human hairs.
although it is impossible to observe every division directly, one method for counting divisions is to count replication errors; the greater the number of divisions, the greater the numbers of errors.
