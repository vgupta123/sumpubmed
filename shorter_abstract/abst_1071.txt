as expected, weight loss and viral replication were greater in the dba/2j strain .
these results demonstrate effects of the anesthesia and/or intranasal infection procedure on pulmonary gene expression, which are detectable between approximately  <dig> and 24 h post procedure and vary in intensity and temporal evolution depending on the mouse strain used.
we therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of anesthesia and/or intranasal infection on transcription of selected pulmonary mrnas in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to iav infection.
the interferon-related mrnas stat <dig>  ifng, infl <dig>  and mx <dig> were unaffected by mock treatment in either mouse strain.
pulmonary expression of  <dig> host mrnas  and viral hemagglutinin  mrna were determined at the designated time points.
investigating the host response in the early stage of influenza a virus  infection is of considerable interest.
dba/2j and c57bl/6j mice were evaluated in a time course experiment in which lung tissue was sampled after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h. after anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine, a suspension of mouse-adapted iav strain pr8_mun in 20 μl sterile buffer, or 20 μl sterile buffer only, was instilled intranasally.
four mrnas  were procedure-dependently regulated in dba/2j mice between  <dig> and 24 h, and two  in c57bl/6j mice, although to a lesser extent.
these infection-dependent effects could be separated from procedure-dependent effects beginning around 12 h in dba/2j and 18 h in c57bl/6j mice.
mock infection controls should be included in all studies on pulmonary gene expression in the early phase of infection with iav and, likely, other respiratory pathogens.
all  <dig> mrnas rose after infection, but one  only in dba/2j mice.
the mice receiving anesthesia and pbs only were designated the “mock treatment” group.
mx <dig> and infl <dig> correlated best with ha mrna expression .
