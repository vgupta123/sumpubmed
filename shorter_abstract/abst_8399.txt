our method, which combines a new method of robust nonlinear regression with a new method of outlier identification, identifies outliers from nonlinear curve fits with reasonable power and few false positives.
nonlinear regression, like linear regression, assumes that the scatter of data around the ideal curve follows a gaussian or normal distribution.
however, we know of no practical method for routinely identifying outliers when fitting curves with nonlinear regression.
we describe a new method for identifying outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression.
we first fit the data using a robust form of nonlinear regression, based on the assumption that scatter follows a lorentzian distribution.
outliers can dominate the sum-of-the-squares calculation, and lead to misleading results.
because the method combines robust regression and outlier removal, we call it the rout method.
we then remove the outliers, and analyze the data using ordinary least-squares regression.
to define outliers, we adapted the false discovery rate approach to handling multiple comparisons.
when analyzing data contaminated with one or several outliers, the rout method performs well at outlier identification, with an average false discovery rate less than 1%.
this assumption leads to the familiar goal of regression: to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical or y-value distances between the points and the curve.
