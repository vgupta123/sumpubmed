the b-chain region b11- <dig> is located at the interface between two insulin molecules and not accessible in insulin oligomers.
indeed, native insulin oligomers showed very low dnak affinity  whereas a proinsulin molecule modified to prevent oligomerization showed good binding affinity .
chaperones facilitate proper folding of peptides and bind to misfolded proteins as occurring during periods of cell stress.
of a set of overlapping 13-mer peptides of human preproinsulin high affinity binding to dnak was found for the signal peptide and one further region in each proinsulin domain .
intact insulin only weakly interacts with the hsp <dig> chaperone dnak whereas monomeric proinsulin and peptides from  <dig> distinct proinsulin regions show substantial chaperone binding.
