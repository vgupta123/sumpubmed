when compared to the genome of glycine max, a total of  <dig>  unique hits were observed corresponding to c. 31% of the known gene space.
in terms of genomic resources, lentil is relatively underdeveloped, in comparison to other fabaceae species, with limited available data.
de novo assembly generated a total of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
a substantial collection of ests has been developed from sequence analysis of lentil genotypes using second-generation technology, permitting unigene definition across a broad range of functional categories.
the complete unigene set was sequence-analysed against genome drafts of the model legume species medicago truncatula and arabidopsis thaliana to identify  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique matches, respectively.
simple sequence repeat -containing ests were identified from consensus sequences and a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed.
lentil  is a cool-season grain legume which provides a rich source of protein for human consumption.
