most gene set analysis methods treat genes equally, regardless how specific they are to a given gene set.
in this work we propose a new gene set analysis method that computes a gene set score as the mean of absolute values of weighted moderated gene t-scores.
unlike most gene set analysis methods which are validated through the analysis of 2- <dig> data sets followed by a human interpretation of the results, the validation employed here uses  <dig> different data sets and a completely objective assessment scheme that makes minimal assumptions and eliminates the need for possibly biased human assessments of the analysis results.
the gene weights are designed to emphasize the genes appearing in few gene sets, versus genes that appear in many gene sets.
