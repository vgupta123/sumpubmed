tiling of probes immediately adjacent to various classes of repeat elements did not generate noise.
multivariate assessment of the influence of probe, segment and design characteristics on hybridization intensity demonstrate that whilst increased density significantly depresses fluorescence intensities, this effect is largely consistent when an ultra high density offset is applied.
a high density array was designed to a  <dig>  megabase region of the canine genome to explore the potential for probe competition to introduce noise.
this finding can make an important contribution to optimizing coverage whilst minimizing sources of noise in the design of high density tiling arrays.
in addition to probe sequence characteristics, noise in hybridization array data is thought to be influenced by competitive hybridization between probes tiled at high densities.
this analysis demonstrates the occurrence of competitive hybridization between oligonucleotide probes in high density tiling arrays.
empirical evaluation of competitive hybridization and an estimation of what other non-sequence related features might affect noisy data is currently lacking.
to prevent the introduction of noise from this source, the degree of competition should be regulated by minimizing variation in density across the target region.
it supports that probe competition does not generate random noise when it is maintained across a region.
