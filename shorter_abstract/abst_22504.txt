as clinical mrsa diagnosis is concerned, current diagnostic methodologies are restricted by significant drawbacks and novel methods are required for mrsa detection.
for application,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tested strains had been detected positive by lamp and pcr assays.
high specificity was observed when orfx-lamp assay was subjected to  <dig> reference strains.
the detection rate, positive predictive value  and negative predictive value  of orfx-lamp were  <dig> %, 100% and  <dig> % respectively.
the 25 μl reactant was found to be the most cost-efficient volume, and the detection limit was determined to be  <dig> dna copies and 10 cfu/reaction.
the established orfx-lamp assay had been demonstrated to be a valid and rapid detection method on mrsa.
the protocol was designed by targeting orfx, a highly conserved open reading frame in s. aureus.
one hundred and sixteen reference strains, including  <dig> gram-positive and  <dig> gram-negative isolates, were included for evaluation and optimization of the orfx-lamp assay.
this assay had been further performed on  <dig> staphylococcus  strains and were comparatively validated by pcr assay using primers f <dig> and b <dig>  with rapid template dna processing, simple equipments  and direct result determination  applied.
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has become one of the most prevalent pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections throughout the world.
