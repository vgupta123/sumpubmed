this paper reports a scalable method for the discovery of protein-protein interactions in medline abstracts, using a combination of text analytics, statistical and graphical analysis, and a set of easily implemented rules.
this combination of linguistic and statistical approaches appears to provide the highest precision and recall thus far reported in detecting protein-protein relations using text analytic approaches.
