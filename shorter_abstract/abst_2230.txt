the post-translational modification pathway referred to as pupylation marks proteins for proteasomal degradation in mycobacterium tuberculosis and other actinobacteria by covalently attaching the small protein pup  to target lysine residues.
using a combination of nmr experiments and biochemical analysis we demonstrate that pup remains unstructured when ligated to two well-established pupylation substrates targeted for proteasomal degradation in mycobacterium tuberculosis, malonyl transacylase  and ketopantoyl hydroxylmethyltransferase .

the single target lysine of panb was identified by a combination of mass spectroscopy and mutational analysis.
isotopically labeled pup was linked to fabd and panb by in vitro pupylation to generate homogeneously pupylated substrates suitable for nmr analysis.
in contrast to the functionally analogous eukaryotic ubiquitin, pup is intrinsically disordered in its free form.
chemical shift comparison between pup in its free form and ligated to substrate reveals intrinsic disorder of pup in the conjugate.
its unfolded state allows pup to adopt different structures upon interaction with different binding partners like the pup ligase pafa and the proteasomal atpase mpa.
while the disordered behavior of free pup has been well characterized, it remained unknown whether pup adopts a distinct structure when attached to a substrate.
