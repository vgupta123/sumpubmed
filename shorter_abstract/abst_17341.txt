as a result, different non-african populations may have acquired light skin by alternative ways, and so light skin, and perhaps dark skin too, may be the result of convergent evolution.
we observe strong evidence for positive selection for tyrp <dig> alleles in africans and for dct and tyrp <dig> in asians.
the observed correlation between ultraviolet light incidence and skin color, together with the geographical apportionment of skin reflectance among human populations, suggests an adaptive value for the pigmentation of the human skin.
in order to reveal signatures of selection in loci with a bearing on skin pigmentation in humans, we have resequenced between  <dig> to  <dig> kb of the proximal regulatory regions of three of the most differently expressed genes, in the expectation that variation at regulatory regions might account for intraespecific morphological diversity, as suggested elsewhere.
in europeans, the evidence is more complex, and both directional and balancing selection may be involved in light skin.
diversity patterns clearly evidence adaptive selection in pigmentation genes in africans and asians.
these were complemented with ehh tests  in which the significance was obtained by a novel approach using extensive simulations under the coalescent model with recombination.
we have used affymetrix u133a v <dig>  gene expression microarrays to investigate the expression profiles of a total of  <dig> melanocyte cell lines  plus their respective unirradiated controls.
contrary to our expectations, expression profiles did not cluster the cells into unirradiated versus irradiated melanocytes, or into lightly pigmented versus darkly pigmented melanocytes.
instead, expression profiles correlated with the presence of bovine pituitary extract  in the media.
