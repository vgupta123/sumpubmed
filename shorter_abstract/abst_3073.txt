it is also shown by the experiments that our method is effective to solve real hplc-dad data set.
in order to find all the solutions, an algorithm named multi-areas genetic algorithm  was proposed, where multiple areas of candidate solutions were constructed according to the fitness and distances among the chromosomes.
in this paper, a new separation model named parallel independent component analysis constrained by reference curve  was proposed to transform the separation problem to a multi-parameter optimization issue.
the 3d chromatogram generated by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector  has been researched widely in the field of herbal medicine, grape wine, agriculture, petroleum and so on.
through simulations, it can be seen that our method can separate 3d chromatogram to chromatogram peaks and spectra successfully even when they severely overlapped.
currently, most of the methods used for separating a 3d chromatogram need to know the compounds' number in advance, which could be impossible especially when the compounds are complex or white noise exist.
new method which extracts compounds from 3d chromatogram directly is needed.
our method can separate 3d chromatogram successfully without knowing the compounds' number in advance, which is fast and effective.
