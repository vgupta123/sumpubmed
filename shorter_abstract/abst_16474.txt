additionally, these modifications might be of widespread utility for whole-mount fish in other model organisms.
whole-mount in situ hybridization  and whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization  are critical methods for determining gene expression patterns in planarians.
while expression patterns for a number of genes have been elucidated using established protocols, determining the expression patterns for particularly low-abundance transcripts remains a challenge.
finally, we apply these modifications to elucidate the expression patterns of a few low-abundance transcripts.
to further improve signal sensitivity we optimized blocking conditions for multiple anti-hapten antibodies, developed a copper sulfate quenching step that virtually eliminates autofluorescence, and enhanced signal intensity through iterative rounds of tyramide signal amplification.
the modifications we present here provide significant improvements in signal intensity and signal sensitivity for wish and fish in planarians.
we also show that azide most effectively quenches peroxidase activity between rounds of development for multicolor fish experiments.
for fish on regenerating planarians, we employed a heat-induced antigen retrieval step that provides a better balance between permeabilization of mature tissues and preservation of regenerating tissues.
