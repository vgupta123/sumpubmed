although previous studies have demonstrated the merit of using knock-down phenotypes to predict gene function, it is unclear how the data can be used most effectively.
we compared several methods for detecting gene-gene functional similarity from phenotypic knock-down profiles.
information-based metrics significantly improve the comparison of phenotypic knock-down profiles, based upon their ability to enhance gene function prediction and identify novel functional modules.
an open question is how to optimally make use of phenotypic observations, possibly in combination with other functional genomics datasets, to identify genes that share a common role.
we report the presence of newly predicted modules identified from an integrated functional network containing phenotypic congruency links derived from an information-based measure.
