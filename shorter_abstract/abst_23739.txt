all populations evolved faster growth rates, mostly by decreasing the age at first division.
we tested the generality of this theory by experimental evolution with caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium whose asymmetric division allows mother and daughter to be distinguished.
our results confirm that late-acting deleterious mutations do occur in bacteria and that they can invade populations when selection late in life is weak.
however, we also observed the spread of a mutation causing earlier aging of mothers whose negative effect was reset in the daughters.
they suggest that very few organisms â€“ perhaps none- can avoid the accumulation of such mutations over evolutionary time, and thus that aging is probably a fundamental property of all cellular organisms.
evolutionary changes in aging were inconsistent.
according to evolutionary theory, aging evolves because selection late in life is weak and mutations exist whose deleterious effects manifest only late in life.
