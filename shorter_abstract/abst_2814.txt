for this reason we used, as an animal model of stress, a fish whose brain organization is very similar to that of higher vertebrates, but is generally considered free of emotional reactions.
the high predictivity of probdnf/totbdnf ratio for stress in lower vertebrates indicates that processing of bdnf is a central mechanism in adaptation to stress and predicts that a similar regulation of pro/mature bdnf has likely been conserved throughout evolution of vertebrates from fish to man.
we provide a comprehensive characterization of bdnf gene in the dicentrarchus labrax and its transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation following acute stress.
notably, we provide here the first evidence that fishes possess a simplified proteolytic regulation of bdnf since the pro28kda form, generated by the ski- <dig> protease in mammals, is absent in fishes because the cleavage site has first emerged in reptilians.
acute stress induces also a significant increase in probdnf levels and reduction in mature bdnf suggesting altered regulation of probdnf proteolytic processing.
finally, we show that the probdnf/totbdnf ratio is a highly predictive novel quantitative biomarker to detect stress in fishes with sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 87%, and negative predictive value = 100%.
stress involves alterations of brain functioning that may precipitate to mood disorders.
while total bdnf mrna levels are unchanged, bdnf transcripts 1c and 1d resulted down regulated after acute stress.
the neurotrophin brain derived neurotrophic factor  has recently been involved in stress-induced adaptation.
