second, a dataset of differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells  into osteoblasts is used.
gene expression data can be analyzed by summarizing groups of individual gene expression profiles based on go annotation information.
however, the expression profiles present in go classes are often heterogeneous, i.e., there are several different expression profiles within one class.
the go class "cell wall organization and biogenesis" is shown as a specific example.
for this dataset results are shown in which the go term "skeletal development" is a specific example of a heterogeneous go class for which better associations can be made after preclustering.
after preclustering, this term can be associated with different phases in the cell cycle, where it could not be associated with a specific phase previously.
we show that this method leads to an improved interpretability of results in principal component analysis.
the intra cluster correlation , a measure of cluster tightness, is applied to identify relevant clusters.
