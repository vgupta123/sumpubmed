we propose a new subgraph isomorphism algorithm which applies a search strategy to significantly reduce the search space without using any complex pruning rules or domain reduction procedures.
in future work, our findings may be extended to approximate subgraph isomorphism algorithms.
we compare our method with the most recent and efficient subgraph isomorphism algorithms  on synthetic, molecules, and interaction networks data.
subgraph isomorphism algorithms are intensively used by biochemical tools.
our analysis gives a comprehensive comparison of different software approaches to subgraph isomorphism highlighting their weaknesses and strengths.

an important query is to find all matches of a pattern graph to a target graph.
the common aim of existing algorithms is to eliminate unsuccessful mappings as early as and as inexpensively as possible.
