in the present study, we compared the growth kinetics of b. pseudomallei strain  <dig>  in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells  and macrophages , as well as its ability to stimulate host cell responses with those of b. thailandensis strain ue <dig> .
by contrast, the two bacteria exhibited different growth kinetics in human mφs, where the intracellular growth of bt-ue <dig>  but not bp- <dig>  was significantly suppressed.
the data presented showed that while both strains were similar in their ability to survive and replicate in human modcs, only bp- <dig> could readily replicate in human mφs.
the results were compared with those obtained using the bt-ue <dig>  in human modcs, both bacteria were similar in respect to their ability to survive and replicate intracellularly, induce upregulation of costimulatory molecules and cytokines and bias t helper cell differentiation toward a th <dig> phenotype.
primary human modcs and mφs were infected with bp- <dig> and its intracellular growth kinetics and ability to induce host cell responses were evaluated.
burkholderia pseudomallei  is a category b biothreat organism that causes a potentially fatal disease in humans and animals, namely melioidosis.
