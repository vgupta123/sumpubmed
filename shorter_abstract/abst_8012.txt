contrary to the dramatic niche shift early in the evolution of hypericum most extant species occur in temperate climates including high elevations in the tropics.
these cold/temperate niches are a distinctive characteristic of hypericum.
these findings exemplify important macroevolutionary patterns of plant diversification during large-scale global climate change.
however, the initial shift in the adaptive landscape into colder climates appears to be a precondition, and may not be directly related to increased diversification rates.
our aim is to understand the evolution of species-rich plant groups that shifted from tropical into cold/temperate biomes.
instead, subsequent events of mountain formation and further climate cooling may better explain distribution patterns and species-richness in hypericum.
many plant lineages may have gone extinct in the northern hemisphere due to late eocene climate cooling, while some tropical lineages may have adapted to temperate conditions and radiated; the hyper-diverse and geographically widespread genus hypericum is one of these.
to investigate the effect of macroecological niche shifts on evolutionary success we combine historical biogeography with analyses of diversification dynamics and climatic niche shifts in a phylogenetic framework.
