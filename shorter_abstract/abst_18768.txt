aristaless-related homeobox  is a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and has been implicated in neocortical interneuron specification and migration.
previous studies have examined the effect of germline loss of arx, or targeted mutations in arx, on interneuron development.
our data indicate that early in development, instead of a loss of ventral precursors, there is a shift of these precursors to more ventral locations, a deficit that persists in the adult nervous system.
these data provide further support that the role of arx in interneuron development is to direct appropriate migration of ventral neuronal precursors into the dorsal cortex and that the loss of arx results in a failure of interneurons to reach the cortex and thus a deficiency in interneurons.
the result of this developmental shift is a reduced number of interneurons  at early postnatal and later time periods.

given the role interneurons appear to play in numerous human conditions including those associated with arx mutations, it is essential to understand the consequences of mutations in this gene on neocortical interneurons.
we now present the effect of conditional loss of arx on interneuron development.
