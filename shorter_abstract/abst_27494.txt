transcriptional silencing coupled with the translation of preformed rna makes the microspore of m. vestita a useful system in which to study post-transcriptional regulation of rna.
a subset of masked mrna is stored in association with nuclear speckles during the dormant phase of microspore development in m. vestita.
this asymmetric localization was disrupted by rnai knockdown of the marsilea homolog of the exon junction complex core component mago nashi.
we have characterized the distribution of mrna as well as several conserved markers of subnuclear bodies within the nuclei of desiccating spores.
during this period, nuclear speckles containing rna were seen to aggregate forming a single large coalescence.
this suggests a novel role for nuclear speckles in the post-transcriptional regulation of transcripts.
the asymmetric distribution of specific mrnas to spermatogenous but not sterile cells mirrors their translational activities and appears to require the ejc or ejc components.
during spermatogenesis masked mrna and associated speckle proteins were shown to fragment and asymmetrically localize to spermatogenous but not sterile cells.
