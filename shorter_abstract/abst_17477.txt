nmr chemical shift prediction plays an important role in various applications in computational biology.
in this work, we present the framework nightshift , which enables automated data set generation as well as model training and evaluation of protein nmr chemical shift prediction.
a variety of nmr chemical shift prediction approaches have been presented in the past, but nearly all of these rely on laborious manual data set preparation and the training itself is not automatized, making retraining the model, e.g., if new data is made available, or testing new models a time-consuming manual chore.
among others, structure determination, structure optimization, and the scoring of docking results can profit from efficient and accurate chemical shift estimation from a three-dimensional model.
by demonstrating that the performance of the automatically generated predictors is at least en par with the state of the art, we conclude that automated data set and predictor generation is well-suited for the design of nmr chemical shift estimators.
in addition to this main result – the nightshift framework itself – we describe the resulting, automatically generated, data set and, as a proof-of-concept, a random forest model called spinster that was built using the pipeline.
