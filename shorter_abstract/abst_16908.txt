we report here a whole genome analysis of the olfactory receptor genes of bos taurus using conserved or gene-specific motifs and known or protein sequences from diverse species.
understanding the or gene repertoire in the cattle genome could lead to link the effects of genetic differences in these genes to variations in olfaction in cattle.
our analysis revealed the almost complete or gene repertoire from an individual cattle genome.
our analysis, using the current cattle genome assembly umd  <dig>  covering  <dig> % of the cattle genome, shows that the cattle genome contains  <dig>  or-related sequences including  <dig> functional,  <dig> pseudo, and  <dig> partial or sequences.
though the number of or genes were lower than in pigs, the analysis of the genetic system of cattle ors showed close similarities to that of the pig.
