we show that five subfamilies of vertebrate gnrh receptors evolved early in the vertebrate phylogeny, followed by several independent instances of gene loss.
chief among cases of gene loss are humans, best described as degenerate with respect to gnrh receptors because we retain only a single, ancient gene.
first, the “mammalian” pituitary type gnrh receptor, which is the sole gnrh receptor in humans and previously presumed to be highly derived because it lacks the cytoplasmic c-terminal domain typical of most g-protein coupled receptors, is actually an ancient gene that originated in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates .
the evolutionary history of the receptor family, including ancestral copy number and timing of duplications and deletions, has been the subject of controversy.
to understand the origin of these genes within the larger evolutionary context of the gene family, we performed phylogenetic analyses and probabilistic protein homology searches of gnrh receptor genes in vertebrates and their near relatives.
our results provide a novel evolutionary framework for generating hypotheses concerning the functional importance of structural characteristics of vertebrate gnrh receptors.
most vertebrates possess multiple genes for both the decapeptide gonadotropin releasing hormone  and for the gnrh receptor.
we report here for the first time sequences of three distinct gnrh receptor genes in salamanders , which are orthologous to three gnrh receptors from ranid frogs.
our analyses revealed four points that alter previous views about the evolution of the gnrh receptor gene family.
second, unlike previous studies, we classify vertebrate gnrh receptors into five subfamilies.
fourth, the number of gnrh receptor genes has been dynamic in vertebrates and their ancestors, with multiple duplications and losses.
