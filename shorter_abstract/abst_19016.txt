studies of syntenic gene families are needed to determine the extent of the
we have analyzed in detail  <dig> gene families
seven of the gene families have members on at least three of the human hox
all but two gene families also show teleost-specific duplicates.
a large number of adjacent gene families, supporting expansion of these
vertebrate lineage was proposed, the hox gene clusters have served as the
vertebrate lineages suggested a third tetraploidization .
ever since the theory about two rounds of genome duplication  in the
point was the gene family for the npy family of peptides located near the
prime example of quadruplicate paralogy in mammalian genomes.
hox clusters in the pufferfish takifugu rubripes, the zebrafish
fishes, the observation of additional hox clusters absent in other
sequences the time window when these duplications could have occurred is
hox clusters occupy a quite limited part of each chromosome, and are special
that are syntenic with the hox clusters to see if their phylogenies are
duplicates presumably provided raw material in early vertebrate evolution
