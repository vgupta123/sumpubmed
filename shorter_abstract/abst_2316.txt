a gene ontology  term enrichment analysis showed that paralogs with similar expression levels were enriched in go terms related to ribosomes, whereas paralogs with different expression levels were enriched in terms associated with stress responses.
together with increased mutation rates in the coding sequences, this suggests that similar forces of purifying selection act on coding and non-coding sequences.
loss of conserved non-coding sequences in one gene of a paralogous gene pair correlates with reduced expression levels that are more tissue specific.
several models explain the retention of paralogous genes.
however, how these models are reflected in the evolution of coding and non-coding sequences of paralogous genes is unknown.
here, we analyzed the coding and non-coding sequences of paralogous genes in arabidopsis thaliana and compared these sequences with those of orthologous genes in arabidopsis lyrata.

also, lower-expressed genes had greater tissue specificity.
