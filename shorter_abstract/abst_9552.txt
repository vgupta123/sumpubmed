emt induction was associated with specific alterations to the methylation patterns of gene-related cpg-rich regions, although overall methylation levels were not significantly altered.
however, the mechanisms that underlie methylome changes are not well understood nor is the genomic distribution of dna methylation changes well characterized.
moreover, approximately 40% of the epithelial cell-specific methylation patterns in gene-related regions were altered to those typical of mesenchymal cells, suggesting a cell-type specific regulation of dna methylation.
the most prominent feature of the bcc lines compared to hmec was a massively reduced methylation level particularly in cpg-poor regions.
we also investigated methylome alterations during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  in mcf <dig> cells.
the medip-seq analysis generated non-biased dna methylation maps by covering almost the entire genome with sufficient depth and resolution.
cancer cells undergo massive alterations to their dna methylation patterns that result in aberrant gene expression and malignant phenotypes.
this study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the methylome of human mammary cell lines and has produced novel insights into the mechanisms of methylome alteration during tumorigenesis and the interdependence between dna methylome alterations and morphological changes.
here, we performed methylated dna immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing  to obtain whole-genome dna methylation profiles for eight human breast cancer cell  lines and for normal human mammary epithelial cells .
