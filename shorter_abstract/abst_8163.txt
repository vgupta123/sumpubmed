little is known about the function of mesothelin and there is no information on its possible three-dimensional structure.
three-dimensional structure prediction servers inhub and i-tasser produced structural models for mesothelin, which consisted of superhelical structures with arm-type repeats in conformity with the secondary structure predictions.
the mesothelin superfamily of proteins, which includes mesothelin, mesothelin precursor, megakaryocyte potentiating factor, mpfl, stereocilin and otoancorin, are predicted to have superhelical structures with arm-type repeats.
knowledge of the structure of this protein will be useful, for example, in building a structural model of the muc16-mesothelin complex.
we suggest that all of these function as superhelical lectins to bind the carbohydrate moieties of extracellular glycoproteins.
similar arm-type superhelical repeat structures were predicted by 3d-pssm server for mesothelin precursor and for stereocilin and otoancorin proteins.
secondary structure prediction servers predicted a predominantly helical structure for both mesothelin and mesothelin precursor proteins and also for stereocilin and otoancorin.
mesothelin has been reported to be homologous to the deafness-related inner ear proteins otoancorin and stereocilin, for neither of which the three-dimensional structure is known.
it forms a strong and specific complex with muc <dig>  which is also highly expressed on the surface of mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cells.
the blast and psi-blast searches confirmed that mesothelin and mesothelin precursor proteins are remotely homologous to stereocilin and otoancorin and more closely homologous to the hypothetical protein mpfl .
