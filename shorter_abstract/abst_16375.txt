rpnxiiia could bind to extracellular matrices  and cause hemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes.
pasteurella pneumotropica is a ubiquitous bacterium that is frequently isolated from laboratory rodents and causes various clinical symptoms in immunodeficient animals.
currently two rtx toxins, pnxia and pnxiia, which are similar to hemolysin-like high-molecular-weight exoproteins are known in this species.
the results implicate that pnxiiia is located on the cell surface and participates in adhesion to ecms and enhanced hemagglutination in the rodent pathogen p. pneumotropica.
in this study, we identified and analyzed a further rtx toxin named pnxiiia and the corresponding type i secretion system.
the rtx exoprotein, pnxiiia, contains only a few copies of the rtx repeat-like sequence and  <dig> large repeat sequences that are partially similar to the outer membrane protein found in several prokaryotes.
binding was dependent on the  <dig> large repeat sequences in pnxiiia.
<dig> mouse macrophage cells, whereas cytotoxicity was attenuated by the addition of anti-cd11a monoclonal antibody.
