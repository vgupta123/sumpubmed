giardia was shown to suppress cytokine-induced inos expression, thus the parasite has both inos inducing and suppressive activities.
interestingly, the effects on no production and t cell proliferation could be reversed by addition of external arginine or citrulline.
many pathogens interfere with arginine-utilization in host cells, especially nitric oxide  production, by changing the expression of host enzymes involved in arginine metabolism.
giardia affects the hostâ€™s arginine metabolism on many different levels.
here we used human intestinal epithelial cells  and three different isolates of the protozoan parasite giardia intestinalis to investigate the role of arginine and arginine-metabolizing enzymes during intestinal protozoan infections.
rna expression analyses of major arginine-metabolizing enzymes revealed the arginine-utilizing pathways in human iecs  grown in vitro.
