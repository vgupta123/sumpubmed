we apply bioinformatics and immunoinformatics on sequence and structure of e protein for analysis of crucial substitutions that might cause the genotypic transition, affecting protein-function and altering specificity of epitopes.
sequence and 3d model-structure based analyses of e protein show that only four of all substitutions are critical for genotype-i specific effect of which n103k is common among all isolates indicating its role in the transition of genotype-iii to genotype-i.
predicted b-cell and t-cell epitopes are seen to harbor these critical substitutions that affect overall conformational stability of the protein.
these epitopes were subjected to conservation analyses using a large set of the protein from asian continent.
conservation analysis of these epitopes would be useful for design of genotype-i specific vaccine.

although frequency of substitutions in e glycoprotein of jev <dig>  jev <dig> and jev <dig> isolates vary, its homologous patterns remain exactly similar as earlier japan isolate .
genotype-i  was isolated in  <dig>  and then in  <dig>  from midnapur district, west bengal  for the first time from clinical patients who were previously been vaccinated with live attenuated sa14-14- <dig> strain.
japanese encephalitis virus  is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes japanese encephalitis  and acute encephalitis syndrome  in humans.
the study identifies crucial substitutions that contribute to the emergence of genotype-i.
