these motifs were further used to guide complex assembly.
they dominate many biological processes in living cells.
the physical interactions between proteins constitute the basis of protein quaternary structures.
therefore, it is necessary to further decompose the protein quaternary structural space into a more local representation.
finally, after future improvements such as adding sequence profiles, we expect this new library will be useful to predict structures of unknown protein-protein interactions.
a large-scale benchmark test shows that the native-like binding is highly likely in the structural ensemble of modeled protein complexes that were built through the library.
similar to the space of protein tertiary structures in which discrete patterns are clearly observed on fold or sub-fold motif levels, it has been found that the space of protein quaternary structures is highly degenerate due to the packing of compact secondary structure elements at interfaces.
here we constructed an interface fragment pair library from the current structure database of protein complexes.
our study therefore presents supportive evidences that the space of protein quaternary structures can be represented by the combination of a small set of secondary-structure-based packing at binding interfaces.
after structural-based clustering, we found that more than 90% of these interface fragment pairs can be represented by a limited number of highly abundant motifs.
deciphering the structural features of interacting proteins is essential to understand their cellular functions.
