to determine what protein characteristics might mediate these localization effects, we constructed  <dig> tnaa variants:  <dig> truncated forms and  <dig> missense mutants in which different combinations of  <dig> surface-exposed residues were converted to alanine.
tnaa activity is low when the protein forms foci during mid-logarithmic growth but its activity increases as the protein becomes more diffuse, suggesting that foci may represent clusters of inactive  enzyme.
altering several surface-exposed residues decreased tnaa activity, implying that tetramer assembly may depend on interactions involving these sites.
interestingly, changing any of three amino acids at the base of a loop near the catalytic pocket decreased tnaa activity and caused it to form elongated ovoid foci in vivo, indicating that the alterations affect focus formation and may regulate how frequently tryptophan reaches the active site.
the results suggest that tnaa activity is regulated by subcellular localization and by a loop-associated occlusion of its active site.
equally important, these new tnaa variants are immediately available to the research community and should be useful for investigating how tryptophanase is localized and assembled, how substrate accesses its active site, the functional role of acetylation, and other structural and functional questions.
in contrast, alterations to the d1d3-to-d <dig> domain interface produced diffuse localization of the d1d <dig> variant but did not affect the wild type protein.
mutations affecting the d1d3-to-d1d <dig> interface did not affect polar localization of d1d <dig> but did delay assembly of wild type tnaa foci.
