here we have investigated the role of erk activation in the behavioral sensitization induced by repeated administration of psychostimulants in mice, using sl <dig>  a brain-penetrating selective inhibitor of map-kinase/erk kinase , the enzyme that selectively activates erk.
altogether these results show that erk has a minor contribution to the acute locomotor effects of psychostimulants or to the expression of sensitized responses, whereas it is crucial for the acquisition of locomotor sensitization and psychostimulant-conditioned locomotor response.
pre-treatment with sl <dig>  prior to each drug administration prevented the locomotor sensitization induced by repeated injections of d-amphetamine or cocaine.
repeated exposure to psychostimulants results in a progressive and long-lasting facilitation of the locomotor response that is thought to have implications for addiction.
this study supports the important role of the erk pathway in long-lasting behavioral alterations induced by drugs of abuse.
a dose of sl <dig>  that reduced the number of activated erk-positive neurons by  <dig> to 89% in various brain areas, had virtually no effect on the spontaneous locomotor activity or the acute hyperlocomotion induced by cocaine or d-amphetamine.
the sl <dig> pre-treatment abolished also conditioned locomotor response of mice placed in the context previously paired with cocaine or d-amphetamine.
