integrins are required for normal muscle differentiation and disruptions in integrin signaling result in human muscle disease.
in all, our study reveals kindlin- <dig> as a novel integrin adaptor protein important for muscle differentiation, and identifies it particularly as a critical regulator of myocyte elongation.
rnai knockdown of kindlin- <dig> in c2c <dig> cells results in significant abnormalities during the early stages of myogenesis.
unc- <dig> is an integrin-associated protein required for muscle development in c. elegans.
the intracellular components that regulate integrin function during myogenesis are poorly understood.
these changes are correlated with decreased cell substratum adhesion and increased cell motility.
