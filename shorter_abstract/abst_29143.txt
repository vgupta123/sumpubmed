soil alkalinity shows significant constraints to crop productivity; however, much less attention has been paid to analyze the effect of soil alkalinity on plant growth and development.
<dig>  is an alkalinity tolerant bread wheat cultivar selected from an asymmetric somatic hybridization between the bread wheat cultivar jinan  <dig>  and tall wheatgrass , which is a suitable material for studying alkalinity tolerant associate genes.
sr <dig> expresses a superior tolerance to alkaline stress conditions which is due to its strong absorbing ability for nutrient ions, a strong regulating ability for intracellular and rhizosphere ph and a more active ros scavenging ability.
the root cytosolic na+/k+ ratio in alkalinity stressed sr <dig> was lower than in jn <dig>  while alkalinity stressed sr <dig> contained higher level of nutrient elements than in jn <dig>  sr <dig> plant seedlings accumulated less malondialdehyde  and reactive oxygen species , it also showed higher activity of ros scavenging enzymes than jn <dig> under alkalinity stress.
alkalinity stress conditions up- and down-regulated a large number of genes in the seedling roots that play the functions in the categories of transcription regulation, signal transduction and protein modification.
the growth of sr <dig> plant seedlings was less inhibited than that of jn <dig> when exposed to alkalinity stress conditions.
the root intracellular ph decreased in both alkalinity stressed jn <dig> and sr <dig>  however, it was much lower in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> under alkalinity stress.
the transcriptomes of sr <dig> and jn <dig> seedlings exposed to alkalinity stress were analyzed by digital gene expression tag profiling method.
