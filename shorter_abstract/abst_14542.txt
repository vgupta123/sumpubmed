here, we report the unexpected finding that fission yeast has two distinct eif <dig> complexes sharing common core subunits, but distinguished by the pci proteins eif3e and the novel eif3m, which was previously annotated as a putative csn subunit.
we propose that the pci proteins eif3e and eif3m define distinct eif <dig> complexes that may assist in the translation of different sets of mrnas.
whereas neither eif3e nor eif3m contribute to the non-essential activities of csn in cullin-ring ubiquitin ligase control, eif3m, unlike eif3e, is an essential gene required for global cellular protein synthesis and polysome formation.
the eif <dig> complex is thought to be composed of essential core subunits required for global protein synthesis and non-essential subunits that may modulate mrna specificity.
pci/mpn domain protein complexes comprise the 19s proteasome lid, the cop <dig> signalosome , and eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> .
using a ribonomic approach, this phenotypic distinction was correlated with a different set of mrnas associated with the eif3e and eif3m complexes.
interactions of unclear significance were reported between eif <dig> subunits and pci proteins contained in the csn.
the microarray findings were independently corroborated for a random set of  <dig> mrnas by rt-pcr analysis.
