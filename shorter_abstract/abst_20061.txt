an initial assembly using only gs flx shotgun sequences  with ~30Ã— coverage allowed gene identification, but was incomplete even when  <dig> sanger-generated bac-end sequences  were incorporated.
the number of scaffolds produced by the gs flx assembly was comparable to sanger-generated sequencing; however, the number of gaps was much higher in the gs flx assembly.
these results represent the first use of gs flx paired end reads for de novo sequence assembly.
eight pooled bacs belonging to a minimum tiling path covering ~ <dig> mb of the atlantic salmon genome were sequenced by gs flx shotgun and long paired end sequencing and compared with a ninth bac sequenced by sanger sequencing of a shotgun library.
with a whole genome duplication event and wealth of biological data, salmonids are excellent model organisms for studying evolutionary processes, fates of duplicated genes and genetic and physiological processes associated with complex behavioral phenotypes.
our data demonstrated that this improved the gs flx assemblies; however, with respect to de novo sequencing of complex genomes, the gs flx technology is limited to gene mining and establishing a set of ordered sequence contigs.
it is surprising therefore, that no salmonid genome has been sequenced.
given the cost and time limitations of sanger sequencing as well as recent improvements to next generation sequencing technologies, we examined the feasibility of using the genome sequencer  flx pyrosequencing system to obtain the sequence of a salmonid genome.
atlantic salmon  is a good representative salmonid for sequencing given its importance in aquaculture and the genomic resources available.
currently, for a salmonid reference sequence, it appears that a substantial portion of sequencing should be done using sanger technology.
