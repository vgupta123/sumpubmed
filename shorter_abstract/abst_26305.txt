we show that the refrma workflow, when used in conjunction with a large, biologically diverse training set, results in the same general characteristics as that of rma in its classic form when comparing overall data structure, sample-to-sample correlation, and variation.
furthermore, pre-processing of large numbers of arrays requires loading all the feature-level data into memory which is a difficult task even with modern computers.
although the results we present are specific for rma, similar versions of other multi-array normalization and summarization schemes can be developed.
further, we demonstrate that the refrma workflow and reference set can be robustly applied to na√Øve organ types and to benchmark data where its performance indicates respectable results.
one problem associated with these algorithms is that expression measurements for a particular sample are highly dependent on the set of samples used for normalization and results obtained by normalization with a different set may not be comparable.
our results indicate that a biologically diverse reference database can be used to train a model for estimating probe set intensities of exclusive test sets, while retaining the overall characteristics of the base algorithm.
we utilize a scheme that produces all the information necessary for pre-processing using a very large training set that can be used for summarization of samples outside of the training set.
