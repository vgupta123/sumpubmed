ufl-ag- <dig> cells previously deprived in fbs shown to be a better host for agmnpv propagation, increasing the useful for both in vitro bioinsecticide production and applications such as recombinant protein expression or gene delivery.
anticarsia gemmatalis is a pest in south america's soybean crops, which could be controlled by the multinucleopolyhedrovirus of a. gemmatalis .
results showed that the productivity in fbs deprived cells was  <dig>  times more in bvs and  <dig>  times more in obs with respect to non-treated cells.
culture media containing 1% fbs during the previous  <dig> hours achieved a synchronized condition where 90% of cells were found in g0/g <dig> stage, showing the presence of non-filamentous actin.
