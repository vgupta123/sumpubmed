the reversible oxidation of protein sh groups has been considered to be the basis of redox regulation by which changes in hydrogen peroxide  concentrations may control protein function.
in yeast, when using a high initial h2o <dig> dose, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was identified as the major target of s-glutathionylation which leads to reversible inactivation of the enzyme.
this work shows that both in exponential- and stationary-phase cells, low regulatory h2o <dig> concentrations induce a large upregulation of catalase, a fingerprint of the cellular oxidative stress response, but gapdh oxidation and the ensuing activity decrease are only observed at death-inducing high h2o <dig> doses.
gapdh activity is constant upon incubation with sub-lethal h2o <dig> doses, but in stationary-phase cells there is a differential response in the expression of the three gapdh isoenzymes: tdh1p is strongly upregulated while tdh2p/tdh3p are slightly downregulated.
gapdh inactivation by h2o <dig> functions to reroute carbohydrate flux to produce nadph.
since gapdh inactivation only occurs at cell death-inducing high h2o <dig> doses, gapdh-dependent rerouting of carbohydrate flux is probably important merely in pathophysiological situations.
this work highlights the importance of studying h2o2-induced oxidative stress using concentrations closer to the physiological for determining the importance of protein oxidation phenomena in the regulation of cellular metabolism.
here we report the effect of low regulatory h2o <dig> doses on gapdh activity and expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
in yeast gapdh activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate h2o <dig> doses.
