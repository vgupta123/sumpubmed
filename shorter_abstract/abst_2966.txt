the high resolution of the rxci dynamics was exhibited.
random x-chromosome inactivation  is important for the maintenance of normal somatic cell functions in female eutherian mammals.
the rxci stages of single cells from the same developmental stage showed heterogeneity.
ohnoâ€™s hypothesis of dosage compensation was refuted by our post-implantation stage data.
the inactivation orders of x chromosomal genes were determined by their functions, expression levels, and locations; generally, the inactivation order did not exhibit a parental origin preference.
we found the inactivation orders of x chromosomal genes were determined by their own properties.
generally, the inactivation order did not exhibit a parental origin preference.
instead of artificially assigning the parental origin of the inactive x chromosome, the inactive x chromosomes in this study were randomly selected from the natural developmental periods and thus included both paternal and maternal origins.
to investigate the phenomenon in vivo, we applied rna sequencing to single cells from female embryos obtained from a natural intercrossing of two genetically distant mouse strains.
