phylogenetic analysis suggests that most zebrafish agpcrs cluster closely with their mammalian homologs, with the exception of three zebrafish-specific expansion events in groups ii, vi, and viii.
adhesion g protein-coupled receptors  are the second largest of the five gpcr families and are essential for a wide variety of physiological processes.
importantly, expression profiles of zebrafish agpcrs in adult tissues are similar to those previously reported in mouse, rat, and human, underscoring the evolutionary conservation of this family, and therefore the utility of the zebrafish for studying agpcr biology.
our results support the notion that zebrafish are a potentially useful model to study the biology of agpcrs from a functional perspective.
the zebrafish agpcr repertoire, classification, and nomenclature, together with their expression profiles during development and in adult tissues, provides a crucial foundation for elucidating agpcr functions and pursuing agpcrs as therapeutic targets.
using quantitative real-time pcr, we have defined the expression profiles of  <dig> zebrafish agpcrs at  <dig> developmental time points and  <dig> adult tissues representing every major organ system.
here, we report that there are at least  <dig> agpcrs in zebrafish that represent homologs of  <dig> of the  <dig> agpcrs found in humans; compared to humans, zebrafish lack clear homologs of gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  and emr <dig>  we find that several agpcrs in zebrafish have multiple paralogs, in line with the teleost-specific genome duplication.
additionally, the expression profiles of the agpcr family have never been extensively characterized over a developmental time-course in any species.
however, agpcr repertoires have not been defined in any fish species, nor are agpcr expression profiles in adult tissues known.
