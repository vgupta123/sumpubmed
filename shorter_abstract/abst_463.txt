plant mitochondria contain a relatively large amount of genetic information, suggesting that their functional regulation may not be as straightforward as that of metazoans.
the present study indicated the previously unexpected complexity of plant mitochondrial rna metabolism.
whereas statistical analysis verified the transcription of all previously known functional genes such as the ones related to oxidative phosphorylation, a similar extent of rna expression was frequently observed in the inter-genic regions where none of the previously annotated genes are located.
the newly identified open reading frames  predicted in these transcribed inter-genic regions were generally not conserved among flowering plant species, suggesting that these orfs did not play a role in mitochondrial principal functions.
