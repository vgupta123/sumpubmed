over the past four years, the mycetozoan global biodiversity survey has identified many new isolates that appear to be new species of dictyostelia, along with numerous isolates of previously described species.
we have determined 18s ribosomal rna gene sequences for all of these new isolates.
the new species also expand the known morphological diversity of the previously established four major groups, violating nearly all previously suggested deep morphological patterns.
potential morphological justification was identified for three of the four major groups, on the basis of which tentative names were assigned.
the resulting tree now shows eight well-supported major groups instead of the original four.
phylogenetic analyses of these data show at least  <dig> new species, and these arise from throughout the dictyostelid tree breaking up many previously isolated long branches.
these results also suggest that there is a far greater diversity of dictyostelia yet to be discovered, including novel morphologies.
the group was also shown to consist of four major clades, none of which correspond to traditional genera.
the first molecular phylogeny of dictyostelia included most of the species known at the time and suggested an extremely deep taxon with a molecular depth roughly equivalent to metazoa.
a greatly expanded phylogeny of dictyostelia now shows even greater morphological plasticity at deep taxonomic levels.
