codon substitution probabilities are used in many types of molecular evolution studies such as determining ka/ks ratios, creating ancestral dna sequences or aligning coding dna.
codon mutation matrices have advantages for alignments up to medium evolutionary distances and for usages that require dna such as ancestral reconstruction of dna sequences and the calculation of ka/ks ratios.
from this data, both a probability matrix and a matrix of similarity scores were computed.
however, more sequence data is still needed to construct matrices from different subsets of dna, specific to kingdoms, evolutionary distance or different amount of synonymous change.
until the recent dramatic increase in genomic data enabled construction of empirical matrices, researchers relied on parameterized models of codon evolution.
the amount of genomic data currently available allowed for the construction of an empirical codon substitution matrix.
a set of  <dig>  alignments of orthologous sequences from five vertebrate genomes yielded  <dig>  million aligned codons from which the number of substitutions between codons were counted.
