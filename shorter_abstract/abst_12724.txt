subsequently, partition around medoids clustering  of the similarity scores assesses sequence fragments where functional annotation remains in question.
across a structurally and functionally heterogeneous dataset, phylogenetic motifs have been demonstrated to correspond to a wide variety of functional site archetypes, including those defined by surface loops, active site clefts, and less exposed regions.
the accuracy of the approach is confirmed through comparisons to our previous  results and structural analyses.
in a previous report , we have demonstrated that the identification of phylogenetic motifs, protein sequence fragments conserving the overall familial phylogeny, represent a promising approach for sequence/function annotation.
triosephosphate isomerase and arginyl-trna synthetase are discussed as exemplar cases.
pre-calculated functional site predictions of the cog database and an implementation of the threshold detection algorithm, in the r statistical language, can also be accessed at the website.
the approach relies on significant raw data preprocessing to improve signal detection.
