transfer of ooplasm matching the genetic background of the somatic cell in iscnt embryos is a valuable tool to study the degree of incompatibilities between nuclear and ooplasmic components.
successful development of iscnt  embryos depends on complex interactions between ooplasmic and nuclear components, which can be compromised by genetic divergence.
embryos in all groups were analysed for developmental competence that included cleavage rates, atp content, and expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial- encoded genes at 8â€“ <dig> cell stage.
interestingly, no significant differences were observed in embryo development, atp content, and expression of nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> , mitochondrial transcription factor a  and mitochondrial subunit  <dig> of cytochrome c oxidase  among groups.
this study investigated the effects of ooplasm transfer  on cattle  and plains bison  embryos produced by iscnt and supplemented with or without ooplasm from cattle or plains bison oocytes.
