giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea in a wide range of mammalian species.
we used comparative genomics of the three diverse giardia intestinalis isolates p <dig>  gs and wb to define a core proteome for this species complex and to identify lineage-specific genes.
to further understand the genetic diversity between the giardia intestinalis species, we have performed genome sequencing and analysis of a wild-type giardia intestinalis sample from the assemblage e group, isolated from a pig.
novel members of the vsp, nek kinase and hcmp gene families were identified, which may reveal possible mechanisms for host specificity and new avenues for antigenic variation.
our results indicate that despite a well conserved core of genes there is significant genome variation between giardia isolates, both in terms of gene content, gene polymorphisms, structural chromosomal variations and surface molecule repertoires.
this study improves the annotation of the giardia genomes and enables the identification of functionally important variation.
despite this, there is an unexpectedly large number of chromosomal rearrangements and several smaller structural changes that are present in all chromosomes.
