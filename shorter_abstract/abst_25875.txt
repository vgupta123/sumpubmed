in this paper, we presented an in-depth primary sequence analysis using batch blast search of the database, sequence filtering by programming and motif finding by meme.
the assemblages by class i hydrophobins are extremely stable and possess the remarkable ability to change the polarity of the surface.
we used batch blast to find similar sequences in the ncbi nr database.
all of  <dig> newly identified potential hydrophobins possess the common pattern and hydrophobin domain.
based on the newly found motifs and the well-known c-cc-c-c-cc-c pattern we used mast to search the entire nr database.
after searching the nr database with the new pssm-format motifs identified by meme, many sequences from various species were found by mast.
at the end, domain search and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to confirm the result.
