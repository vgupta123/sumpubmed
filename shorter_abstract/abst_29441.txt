development of high-throughput methods to reliably detect the adventitious presence of such transgenic material would benefit both the scientific and regulatory communities.
we assessed the accuracy of using conventional qualitative polymerase chain reaction  as well as real-time pcr-based assays to quantify the presence of transgenic dna from bulk samples of non-ge papaya seeds.
in this study, an optimized method of extracting high quality dna from dry seeds of papaya was standardized.
we also validated this system by extracting dna from known ratios of ge seeds to non-ge seeds of papaya followed by real-time pcr detection and observed a reliable detection limit of  <dig> %.
a reliable, sensitive real-time pcr method for detecting and quantifying viral coat protein  transgenes in bulk seed samples utilizing the endogenous papain gene is presented.
quantification range was from  <dig>  to  <dig> ng/μl of ge-papaya dna template with a detection limit as low as  <dig> % .
this method for the quick and sensitive detection of transgenes in bulked papaya seed lots using conventional as well as real-time pcr-based methods will benefit numerous stakeholders.
to test this system, we simulated transgene flow using known quantities of ge and non-ge dna and determined that  <dig> %  ge papaya dna could be detected using real-time pcr.
of particular concern is the possibility of transgenic seeds being found in non-ge papaya fruits via cross-pollination.
in particular, this method could be utilized to screen selected fruits from maternal non-ge papaya trees in hawai’i for the presence of transgenic seed at typical regulatory threshold levels.
