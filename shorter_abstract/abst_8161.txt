this work is complemented by in-depth examinations of the straight-nosed pipefish nerophis ophidion, the black-striped pipefish syngnathus abaster, and the potbellied seahorse hippocampus abdominalis.
here we describe a systematic investigation of pre-release development in syngnathid fishes, reviewing available data for  <dig> species distributed across the family.
the classification consists of four developmental periods – early embryogenesis, eye development, snout formation, and juvenile – which are further divided into  <dig> stages.
stages are characterised by morphological traits that are easily visible in live and preserved specimens using incident-light microscopy.
in view of the growing interest in the biology of the syngnathidae, we believe that the classification proposed here will prove useful for a wide range of studies on the unique reproductive biology of these male-brooding fish.
our classification is derived from examinations of species representing the full range of brooding-structure complexity found in the syngnathidae, including tail-brooding as well as trunk-brooding species, which represent independent evolutionary lineages.
we propose a standardised classification of early syngnathid development that extends from the activation of the egg to the release of newborn.
