although the exact probability distribution is also available for the comparison problem, it is rather difficult to compute and cannot be used directly in most cases.
the sulston score is a well-established, though approximate metric for probabilistically evaluating postulated clone overlaps in dna fingerprint mapping.
we propose a straightforward algebraic correction procedure, which takes the sulston score as a provisional value and applies a power-law equation to obtain an improved result.
although only marginally more expensive to compute than the raw sulston score, the correction provides a vastly improved probabilistic description of hypothesized clone overlaps.
