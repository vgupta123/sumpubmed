golden promise were not expressed in the studied barley cultivar barke although showed primer specificity with their cloned dna sequences.
the results quantify the number of moles of transcript contributed to a particular gene family and its subgroups.
more over the results indicate the genotypic specific gene expression.
the results imply that our rapid qrt-pcr system was sensitive enough to identify the presence of alleles and their expression profiles.
primer sets were designed to discriminate the gene expression level of whole families, subfamilies or individual members.
we showed variation in the temporal expression of genes coding for barley storage proteins.
quantitative rt-pcr with sybr green labelling can be a useful technique to follow gene expression levels of large gene families with highly homologues members.
the specificity of the primer sets was validated before successfully applying them to a cdna population derived from developing grains of field grown hordeum vulgare cv.

phylogenetic analysis was performed and the members of the different hordein families were classified into subfamilies.
analysis of temporal gene expression combined with genetic variation in large multigene families with high homology among the alleles is very challenging.
