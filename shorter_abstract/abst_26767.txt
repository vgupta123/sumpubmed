caspases belong to a class of cysteine proteases which function as critical effectors in apoptosis and inflammation by cleaving substrates immediately after unique sites.
datasets containing  the tetrapeptide cleavage sites,  the tetrapeptide cleavage sites, augmented by two adjacent residues, p1' and p2' amino acids and  the tetrapeptide cleavage sites with ten additional upstream and downstream flanking sequences  were tested.
recently, different computational methods have been developed to predict the cleavage sites of caspase substrates with varying degrees of success.
a set of unique caspase substrates cleavage sites were obtained from literature and used for evaluating the svm method.
this study presents an svm approach for predicting caspase substrate cleavage sites based on the cleavage sites and the downstream and upstream flanking sequences.
prediction of such cleavage sites will complement structural and functional studies on substrates cleavage as well as discovery of new substrates.
the method shows an improvement over existing methods and may be useful for predicting hitherto undiscovered cleavage sites.
the svm method achieved an accuracy ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % on independent test sets.
the svm method successfully predicted the cleavage of a novel caspase substrate and its mutants.
