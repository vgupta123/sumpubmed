the reported structural and immunological findings seem to describe ps-ltp <dig> as potential cross-reactive allergen in ltp-sensitized patients, mostly pru p 3+ ones.
spatial structure of the recombinant uniformly 13c,15n-labelled ps-ltp <dig> was solved by heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy.

this work is aimed at isolation of a novel ltp from pea seeds and characterization of its structural, functional, and allergenic properties.
the protein exhibits antifungal activity and is a membrane-active compound that causes a leakage from artificial liposomes.
heat denaturation profile and simulated gastrointestinal digestion assay showed that ps-ltp <dig> displayed a high thermal and digestive proteolytic resistance proper for food allergens.
ps-ltp <dig> was isolated for the first time from the pea seeds, and its complete amino acid sequence was determined.
three novel lipid transfer proteins, designated as ps-ltp1- <dig>  were found in the garden pea pisum sativum, their cdna sequences were determined, and mrna expression levels of all the three proteins were measured at different pea organs.
the garden pea pisum sativum is widely consumed crop and important allergenic specie of the legume family.
they also form one of the most clinically relevant classes of plant allergens.
the minor conformer probably corresponds to the protein with the partially collapsed internal cavity.
similarly to allergenic ltps the potential ige-binding epitope of ps-ltp <dig> is located near the proposed entrance into internal cavity and could be involved in lipid-binding.
in solution the unliganded protein represents the mixture of two conformers  which are interconnected by exchange process with characteristic time ~  <dig> ms. hydrophobic residues of major conformer form a relatively large internal tunnel-like lipid-binding cavity .
