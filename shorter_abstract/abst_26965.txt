first, the presence of proteins that lack predicted classical secretory tags in accessory gland proteomes is common in male accessory glands.
the identified sfps may serve as targets of future efforts to develop species- specific genetic control strategies.
seminal fluid proteins control many aspects of fertilization and in turn, they play a key role in post-mating sexual selection and possibly reproductive isolation.
third, accessory gland transcriptomes are enriched for novel transcripts.
by combining high throughput rna-seq and shotgun proteomic profiling, we have characterized the seminal fluid proteins secreted by the primary male accessory gland of the migratory grasshopper , one of the main agricultural pests in central north america.
fourth, there is conservation of sfps’ functional classes across distantly related taxonomic groups with very different life histories, mating systems and sperm transferring mechanisms.

our study provides new insights into the proteomic components of male ejaculate in orthopterans, and highlights several important patterns.
of special interest are seminal fluid proteins , such as ejac-sp, ace and prostaglandin synthetases, which are known to regulate female oviposition in insects.
using rna sequencing, we characterized the transcripts of ~  <dig>  genes expressed in the long hyaline tubules  of the accessory glands.
proteomic profiling identified  <dig> proteins expressed in the long hyaline tubules .
