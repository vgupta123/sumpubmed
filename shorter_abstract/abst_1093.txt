rumen metabolite study revealed that rumen fluid nitrogen content reduced in high roughage diet fed animals and pathway analysis showed reduction in the genes coding enzymes involved in methanogenesis pathway.
results reveals that high roughage diet feed improved microbial protein synthesis and reduces methane emission.
the rumen microbiota functions as an effective system for conversion of dietary feed to microbial proteins and volatile fatty acids.
principal component analysis demonstrated that roughage proportion, fraction of rumen and type of forage affected rumen microbiome at taxonomic as well as functional level.

in the present study, metagenomic approach was applied to elucidate the buffalo rumen microbiome of jaffrabadi buffalo adapted to varied dietary treatments with the hypothesis that the microbial diversity and subsequent in the functional capacity will alter with diet change and enhance our knowledge of effect of microbe on host physiology.
metagenomic sequences of solid  and liquid  fractions obtained using ion torrent pgm platform were analyzed using mg-rast server and cazymes approach.
eight adult animals were gradually adapted to an increasing roughage diet  containing 50: <dig> , 75: <dig>  and 100: <dig>  roughage to concentrate proportion for 6Â weeks.
functional analysis revealed protein  and carbohydrate  metabolism as the dominant categories.
the findings help determine the role of rumen microbes in plant polysaccharide breakdown and in developing strategies to maximize productivity in ruminants.
