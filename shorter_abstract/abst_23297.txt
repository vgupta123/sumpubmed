we developed an efficient implementation of the algorithm in the program nurd.
the correction makes the isoform expression estimation more reliable under various read distributions.
the package is freely available for academic use at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/nurd/.
rna-seq technology has been used widely in transcriptome study, and one of the most important applications is to estimate the expression level of genes and their alternative splicing isoforms.
nurd is an efficient and reliable tool for estimating the isoform expression level.
published a method that can accurately estimate isoform level expression by considering position-related sequencing biases using nonparametric models.
given the reads mapping result and gene annotation file, nurd will output the expression estimation result.
it uses a binary interval search algorithm.
