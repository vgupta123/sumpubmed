the parasite undergoes major developmental and maturation steps within the mosquito midgut and little is known about anopheles-associated midgut microbiota.
identification and characterization of the mosquito midgut flora is likely to contribute towards better understanding of mosquito biology including longevity, reproduction and mosquito-pathogen interactions that are important to evolve strategies for vector control mechanisms.
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> distinct phylotypes having  <dig> to 99% similarity with the closest database matches were detected among field and lab-reared a. stephensi midgut, respectively.
the dominant bacteria in field-caught adult male a. stephensi were uncultured paenibacillaceae while in female and in larvae it was serratia marcescens, on the other hand in lab-reared mosquitoes, serratia marcescens and cryseobacterium meninqosepticum bacteria were found to be abundant.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the midgut microbiota of a. stephensi from lab-reared and field-collected adult and larvae using "culture-dependent and independent methods".
lab-reared and field-collected a. stephensi male, female and larvae were screened by "culture-dependent and culture-independent" methods.
five 16s rrna gene library were constructed form lab and field-caught a. stephensi mosquitoes and a total of  <dig> culturable isolates from both samples were analyzed further.
altogether,  <dig> genera were identified from midgut of adult and larval a. stephensi,  <dig> from field-caught and  <dig> from lab-reared mosquitoes.
these otus had a shannon diversity index value of  <dig> – <dig>  for lab-reared and in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  for field-caught a. stephensi mosquitoes.
anopheles stephensi is one of the vectors of malaria parasite plasmodium vivax.
vector control is one of the most investigated strategy for the suppression of mosquito-borne diseases.
