to analyze alterations in the gene response in il- <dig> stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes, we performed a time-course microarray experiment and applied grade.
in contrast to standard techniques, the extracted time-resolved gene expression profiles showed that il- <dig> activates genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell division.
the analysis of such changes is complicated, as they consist of multi-layered temporal responses.
we were able to show that including prior knowledge into the separation task leads to a much more structured and detailed separation of the time-dependent responses upon il- <dig> stimulation compared to standard methods.
genes linked to metabolic and apoptotic processes are down-regulated indicating that il- <dig> mediated priming renders hepatocytes more responsive towards cell proliferation and reduces expenditures for the energy metabolism.
using this framework as constraint to the matrix factorization task allows us to set up the fast and robust graph-decorrelation algorithm .
however, such correlation-based methods have so far not be applied in bioinformatics, because large scale biological data rarely imply a natural order that allows the definition of a delayed correlation function.
in signal processing, factorization techniques incorporating data properties like spatial and temporal correlation structure have shown to be robust and computationally efficient.
while classical analyses based on clustering or gene set enrichment only partly reveal this information, matrix factorization techniques are well suited for a detailed temporal analysis.
grade provides a novel framework for the decomposition of large-scale 'omics' data.
a matlab implementation of the grade algorithm is freely available at http://cmb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/grade.
we encode prior knowledge like transcriptional regulation, protein interactions or metabolic pathways in a weighted directed graph.
