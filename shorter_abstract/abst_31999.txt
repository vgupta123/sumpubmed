a program and web server, called proteus, that performs these secondary structure predictions is accessible at .
the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has steadily improved over the past  <dig> years.
now many secondary structure prediction methods routinely achieve an accuracy  of about 75%.
we have developed a method that performs structure-based sequence alignments as part of the secondary structure prediction process.
by mapping the structure of a known homologue  onto the query protein's sequence, it is possible to predict at least a portion of that query protein's secondary structure.
by integrating this structural alignment approach with conventional  secondary structure methods and then combining it with a "jury-of-experts" system to generate a consensus result, it is possible to attain very high prediction accuracy.
by using both sequence and structure databases and by exploiting the latest techniques in machine learning it is possible to routinely predict protein secondary structure with an accuracy well above 80%.
indeed, given the large size of the protein data bank , the probability of a newly identified sequence having a structural homologue is actually quite high.
we believe this accuracy could be further improved by including structure  database comparisons as part of the prediction process.
