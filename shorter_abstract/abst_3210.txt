however, the performance of all the programs is adversely affected by the introduction of other sequences containing false positive motifs.
the reference alignments are organised into different test sets representing real alignment problems and contain examples of experimentally verified functional motifs, extracted from the eukaryotic linear motif  database.
we have shown that none of the programs currently available is capable of reliably aligning lms in distantly related sequences and we have highlighted a number of specific problems.
methods for lm detection are now being developed that are strongly dependent on scores for motif conservation in homologous proteins.
linear motifs  are abundant short regulatory sites used for modulating the functions of many eukaryotic proteins.
the results of the tests suggest possible ways to improve program accuracy for difficult, divergent sequences.
the ranking of the alignment programs based on lm alignment quality is similar to that observed when considering full-length protein alignments, however little correlation was observed between lm and overall alignment quality for individual alignment test cases.
these regions of modular proteins are difficult to align using classical multiple sequence alignment programs that are specifically optimised to align the globular domains.
we have developed a new benchmark, as part of the balibase suite, designed to assess the ability of standard multiple alignment methods to detect and align lms.
they play important roles in post-translational modification, cell compartment targeting, docking sites for regulatory complex assembly and protein processing and cleavage.
the benchmark has been used to evaluate and compare a number of multiple alignment programs.
