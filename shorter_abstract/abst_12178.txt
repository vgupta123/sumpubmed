this general framework has been applied specifically to primary protein-level annotations from uniprotkb-goa, generating go term associations with scop domains and supra-domains.
the functional annotation of all completely sequenced genomes has demonstrated the potential for domain-centric go enrichment analysis to yield functional insights into newly sequenced or yet-to-be-annotated genomes.
we expect, however, to some extent functional signals can be carried by protein domains and supra-domains, and consequently used in function prediction and functional genomics.
the dcgo and its predictor are available at http://supfam.org/superfamily/dcgo including an enrichment analysis tool.
the resulting 'dcgo predictor', can be used to provide functional annotation to protein sequences.
the 'dcgo predictor' holds great promise for contributing to a domain-centric functional understanding of genomes in the next generation sequencing era.
as functional units, domains offer a unique perspective on function prediction regardless of whether proteins are multi-domain or single-domain.

computational/manual annotations of protein functions are one of the first routes to making sense of a newly sequenced genome.
this is due to the natural modularity of proteins with domains as structural, evolutionary and functional units.
