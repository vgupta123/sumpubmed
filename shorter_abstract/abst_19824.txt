both mitochondrial lineage and nuclear cluster were statistically significant predictors for the shell shape indicating morphological divergence.
this detection of a hybrid zone adds an instance to the rare reported cases of hybridisation in land snails.
we investigated the species boundaries of two cryptic lineages of the land snail genus trochulus in a contact zone, using mitochondrial and nuclear dna marker as well as shell morphometrics.
this association however had exceptions: a small number of individuals in the contact zone showed intermediate genotypes  or cytonuclear disequilibrium .
both mitochondrial lineages have a distinct geographical distribution with a small zone of co-occurrence.
in the same area, we detected two nuclear genotype clusters, each being highly significantly associated to one mitochondrial lineage.
mitochondrial dna sequencing increasingly results in the recognition of genetically divergent, but morphologically cryptic lineages.
