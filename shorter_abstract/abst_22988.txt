using the derived networks, we discuss the delayed regulations and robustness of the dna damage seen in the bacterium.
we evaluated our method on time-course gene expressions after dna damage with mitocyin c. several time-delayed interactions were observed with our analysis.
we propose a method based on a skip-chain model to study this phenomena in gene networks.
we compare our results with the gene networks derived with dynamic bayesian networks .
here we look at the delays in the dna repair system of mycobacterium tuberculosis which is unusually slow in the bacteria.
the presence of hubs in the networks indicates that a small number of transcriptional factors regulate the rest of the system.

skip-chain models are capable of capturing, long distant and the time-delayed regulations.
different transcription networks are active at different stages, and constant feedback and regulation is maintained throughout the activities of a biological pathway.
time delays are often found in gene regulation though most techniques of building gene regulatory networks are not capable of capturing such phenomena.
