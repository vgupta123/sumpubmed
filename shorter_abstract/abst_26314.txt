we identified the eukaryotic targets of avra and the cell signaling pathways regulated by avra in vivo.
we found that pathways, such as mtor, nf-kappab, platelet-derived growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling are specifically regulated by avra in vivo and are associated with inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and proliferation.
both early and late phases of the host response exhibit remarkable specificity for the avra+ salmonella.
a whole genome approach combined with bioinformatics assays was used to investigate the in vivo genetic responses of the mouse colon to salmonella with or without avra protein expression in the early stage  and late stage .
at the late stage of salmonella infection, avra is associated with interferon-gamma responses.
in this study, we hypothesized that avra interacts with multiple stress pathways in eukaryotic cells to manipulate the host defense system.
specifically, we examined the gene expression profiles in mouse colon as it responded to pathogenic salmonella stain sl <dig>  or sb <dig> .
our studies provide new insights into the eukaryotic molecular cascade that combats salmonella-associated intestinal infection in vivo.
avra protein mimics the activities of some eukaryotic proteins and uses these activities to the pathogen's advantage by debilitating the target cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells.
at the early stage of salmonella infection, avra mainly targeted pathways related to nuclear receptor signaling and oxidative phosphorylation.
therefore, it is important to understand how avra works in targeting eukaryotic signaling pathways in intestinal infection in vivo.
