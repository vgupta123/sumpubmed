in recent years, xylanases have attracted considerable research interest because of their potential in various industrial applications.
the yeast pichia pastoris can neither utilize nor degrade xylan, but it possesses many attributes that render it an attractive host for the expression and production of industrial enzymes.
therefore, p pastoris is a very useful expression system when the goal is highly specific and large scale production of glycosyl hydrolases.
xylanase was the main protein species in the culture supernatant, and the functional tests indicated that even the non-purified enzyme shows highly specific xylanase activity that is free of cellulolytic side acitivities.
the activity of the recombinant xyn <dig> was highest at 60°c and it was active over a broad range of ph  with maximal activity at ph  <dig> .
using birchwood xylan, the determined apparent km and kcat values were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  s- <dig>  respectively.
the xyn <dig> gene, which encodes the main trichoderma reesei rut c- <dig> endo-β- <dig>  4-xylanase was cloned into the ppiczαa vector and expressed in pichia pastoris.
the p. pastoris expression system allows a high level expression of xylanases.
