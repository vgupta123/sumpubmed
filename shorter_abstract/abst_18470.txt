further, statistical analysis is performed using go curated dataset as ground truth.
the state-of-the-art technologies such as gopubmed use simple keyword-based techniques for retrieving abstracts from the pubmed and linking them to the gene ontology .
this paper changes the paradigm by introducing semantics enabled technique to link the pubmed to the gene ontology, called, segopubmed for ontology-based browsing.
latent semantic analysis  framework is used to semantically interface pubmed abstracts to the gene ontology.
the analysis suggests that the segopubmed performs better than the classic gopubmed as it incorporates semantics.
the lsa technique is applied on the pubmed abstracts obtained based on the user query and the semantic similarity between the query and the abstracts.
the analyses using well-referenced keywords show that the proposed semantic-sensitive technique outperformed the string comparison based techniques in associating the relevant abstracts to the go terms.
the empirical analysis is performed to compare the performance of the segopubmed with the gopubmed.
the segopubmed also extracted the abstracts in which the keywords do not appear in isolation  that could not be retrieved by simple term matching techniques.
pubmed consists of about  <dig> million abstracts as of  <dig> that require methods to efficiently retrieve and browse large volume of relevant information.
the analysis is initially performed using a few well-referenced query words.
