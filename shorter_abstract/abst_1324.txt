in particular, increased fmnl <dig> expression correlates with increased invasiveness of colorectal cancer  in vivo and for a variety of crc cell-lines in vitro.
using rt-pcr we identified four fmnl <dig> isoforms expressed in crc and melanoma cell-lines.
building on previous reports, we also show that fmnl <dig> is required for invasion in a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells.
taken together, these results suggest that fmnl <dig> is likely to be generally required in melanoma cells for invasion, that a specific isoform of fmnl <dig> is up-regulated in invasive crc and melanoma cells and this isoform is the most effective at facilitating invasion.
there are multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of fmnl <dig> and it is predicted that the encoded proteins will differ in their regulation, subcellular localization and in their ability to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics.
