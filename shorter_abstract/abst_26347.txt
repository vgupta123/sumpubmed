we present a first dual transcriptome analysis using an rna-seq approach.
as known from several other phytopathogens, the c. purpurea genome contains more than  <dig> of such genes, many of them clustered and probably highly redundant.
deletion of some candidates led to a reduced virulence of c. purpurea on rye, indicating a role of the respective proteins during the infection process.
we show for the first time that- despite the absence of effective plant defense reactions- the biotrophic pathogen c. purpurea is detected by its host.
interestingly, the set of most highly expressed genes includes a high proportion of genes encoding putative effectors, small secreted proteins which might be involved in masking the fungal attack or interfering with host defense reactions.
indeed, several putative effector genes are among the highest expressed genes in planta.
we can show that at least one candidate accumulates in the plant apoplast.
since the lack of effective defense reactions in spite of recognition of the fungus could very well be achieved by effectors, we started a functional analysis of some of the most highly expressed candidates.
we present a survey of in planta expressed fungal genes, among them several confirmed virulence genes.
though several virulence factors were identified, the exact infection mechanisms are unknown, e.g.
