in prise <dig>  users can specify desired properties of primers, including length, gc content, and others.
prise <dig> is a user-friendly, interactive software package that can be used to design high-quality selective primers for pcr experiments.
they can interactively manipulate the list of candidate primers, to choose primer pairs that are best suited for their needs.
a similar process is used to add probes to selected primer pairs.
in addition to choosing primers, users have an option to add a probe to any selected primer pair, enabling design of taqman and other primer-probe based assays.
the program emphasizes primer selectivity on the 3â€™ end, which is crucial for selective amplification of conserved sequences such as rrna genes.
to achieve high level of selectivity, prise <dig> allows the user to specify a collection of target sequences that the primers are supposed to amplify, as well as non-target sequences that should not be amplified.
prise <dig> is equipped with a graphical, user-friendly interface, and it runs on windows, macintosh or linux machines.
prise <dig> has been tested on two very similar strains of the fungus dactylella oviparasitica, and it was able to create highly selective primers and probes for each of them, demonstrating the ability to create useful sequence-selective assays.
prise <dig> can also be used to design probes for fish and other hybridization-based assays.
prise <dig> is a new software tool for designing sequence-selective pcr primers and probes.
