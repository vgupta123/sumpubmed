we developed an entropy measure to quantify the complexity of expression matrixes and found that, by incorporating this information, the entropy-based selection  scheme is useful for selecting an appropriate imputation algorithm.
we found that the optimal imputation algorithms  are all highly competitive with each other, and that no method is uniformly superior in all the data sets we examined.
the success of each method can also depend on the underlying "complexity" of the expression data, where we take complexity to indicate the difficulty in mapping the gene expression matrix to a lower-dimensional subspace.
gene expression data frequently contain missing values, however, most down-stream analyses for microarray experiments require complete data.
in this report we describe an extensive evaluation of eight current imputation methods on multiple types of microarray experiments, including time series, multiple exposures, and multiple exposures Ã— time series data.
we then introduce two complementary selection schemes for determining the most appropriate imputation method for any given data set.
our findings provide insight into the problem of which imputation method is optimal for a given data set.
global-based imputation methods  performed better on mcroarray data with lower complexity, while neighbour-based methods  performed better in data with higher complexity.
the scheme selects the optimal or near-optimal method with high accuracy but at an increased computational cost.
we also found that the ebs and sts schemes serve as complementary and effective tools for selecting the optimal imputation algorithm.
