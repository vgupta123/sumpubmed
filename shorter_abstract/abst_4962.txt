however, it increased along the growth curve in pseudomonas aeruginosa and in escherichia coli.
deleting the fdx gene in pseudomonas aeruginosa abolished growth, unless a plasmid copy of the gene was provided to the deleted strain.
only fdx genes of bacteria which anaerobically degrade aromatic compounds belong to operons.
the functional importance of the very low potential ferredoxins is unknown.
expression of the ferredoxin gene did not change in response to varying growth conditions, including upon macrophage infection or aerobic growth with 4-hydroxy benzoate as carbon source.
a bioinformatic screening of the sequence features defining very low potential  <dig> ferredoxins has revealed the almost exclusive presence of the corresponding fdx gene in the proteobacteria phylum, without occurrence in archaea and eukaryota.
ferredoxins are small iron-sulfur proteins belonging to all domains of life.
