the high quality of unigenes is evidenced by the proportion  that have significant hits in similarity searches with the a. thaliana proteome.
the sequence collections established in the present study provide an important genomic resource for four silene and one dianthus species and will help to further develop silene as a plant model system.
the genes characterized will be useful for future research not only in the species included in the present study, but also in related species for which no genomic resources are yet available.
our results demonstrate the efficiency of massively parallel transcriptome sequencing in a comparative framework as an approach for developing genomic resources in diverse groups of non-model organisms.
here, we report the results of a comparative transcriptome sequencing study of eight individuals representing four silene and one dianthus species as outgroup.
massively parallel sequencing cdna has recently developed into an efficient method for characterizing the transcriptomes of non-model organisms, generating massive amounts of data that enable the study of multiple species in a comparative framework.
these were annotated with results from blastx searches and gene ontology  terms, and thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were characterized.
the siesta database is accessible at http://www.siesta.ethz.ch.
the genus silene is widely used as a model system for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions in plants, but advances in using the genus as a model system are impeded by the lack of available resources for studying its genome.
