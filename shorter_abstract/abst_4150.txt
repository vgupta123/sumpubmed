in addition, single animal profiling also showed that levetiracetam attenuated the observed kindling-induced ieg expression; an effect that paralleled the anti-epileptic effect of the drug on ad duration.
the present study provides mrna expression data that suggest that levetiracetam attenuates expression of genes known to regulate synaptic remodelling.
the list consists of many synaptic plasticity-related immediate early genes  as well as some late response genes encoding transcription factors, neurotrophic factors and proteins that are known to regulate synaptic remodelling.
cyclooxygenase- <dig> , protocadherin- <dig>  and tgf-beta-inducible early response gene- <dig>  were identified and verified as differentially expressed transcripts in the hippocampus of kindled rats by in situ hybridization and quantitative rt-pcr.
the amygdala-kindled rat is a model for human temporal lobe epilepsy and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.
in the hippocampus, induction of ieg expression was dependent on the afterdischarge  duration.
furthermore, effects of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam on kindling-induced gene expression were examined.
in the kindled rat, levetiracetam does so by shortening the ad duration thereby reducing the seizure-induced changes in mrna expression in the hippocampus.
