during the tenth critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction , we developed and tested four automated methods  that predicted both local and global quality of protein structural models.
since digging out a few good models from a large pool of low-quality models is a major challenge in protein structure prediction, single model quality assessment methods appear to be poised to make important contributions to protein structure modeling.

our experiments showed that the pairwise model assessment methods worked better when a large portion of models in the pool were of good quality, whereas single-model quality assessment methods performed better on some hard targets when only a small portion of models in the pool were of reasonable quality.
protein model quality assessment is an essential component of generating and using protein structural models.
multicom-cluster and multicom-novel were two new support vector machine-based methods of predicting both the local and global quality of a single protein model.
multicom-refine was a clustering approach that used the average pairwise structural similarity between models to measure the global quality and the average euclidean distance between a model and several top ranked models to measure the local quality.
