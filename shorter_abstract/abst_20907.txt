a systematic workflow is introduced for integrating and prioritizing annotation information from the universal protein resource , ncbi protein clusters, and the rapid annotations using subsystems technology  method.
the reconstruction of quality genome-scale metabolic models for organisms with limited annotation resources remains a challenging task.
the genome-scale metabolic models include fully traced photosynthesis reactions and respiratory chains, as well as balanced reactions and gpr associations.
this effort lays the foundation for the expedient construction of curated metabolic models for organisms that, while not being the target of comprehensive research, have a sequenced genome and are related to an organism with a curated metabolic model.

our development workflow provides a path for constructing models using information from curated models of related organisms and reviewed gene annotations.
metabolic differences between the organisms are highlighted such as the non-fermentative pathway for alcohol production found in only cyanothece  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>
here we reconstruct and subsequently analyze and compare the metabolism of five cyanothece strains, namely cyanothece sp.
we compare these phylogenetically related cyanothece strains to assess their bio-production potential.
the genus cyanothece includes unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria that have been shown to offer high levels of hydrogen production and nitrogen fixation.
