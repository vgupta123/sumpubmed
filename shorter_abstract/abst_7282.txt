the morphology of the eeg spectrum recorded from central derivations was highly stable and unique to an individual , while the eeg recorded from occipital derivations, while stable, was much less unique across individuals .
no changes in either measure were observed in the central derivations.
our results indicate that across weekly recordings, power spectra at central derivations exhibit more “trait-like” characteristics than occipital derivations.
these results may be relevant for future studies searching for links between phenotypes, such as psychiatric diagnoses, and the underlying genes  by suggesting that such studies should make use of more anterior rather than posterior eeg derivations.
we also examined the stability of the alpha peak using an anova.
furthermore, our analysis revealed an increase in alpha peak height concurrent with a decline in the frequency of the alpha peak across weeks for occipital derivations.
the human waking eeg spectrum shows high heritability and stability and, despite maturational cortical changes, high test-retest reliability in children and teens.
a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the morphology of the waking eeg spectrum between  <dig> and  <dig> hz is trait-like.
we examined the stability of the morphology of the wake eeg spectrum in children aged  <dig> to  <dig> years recorded over weekly intervals and assessed whether the waking eeg spectrum in children may also be trait-like.
