furthermore, with reduced number of pcr cycles, it also decreases the chance of random mutations.
finally, since this cloning method is also sequence independent, we demonstrated that it can be used for chimera construction, insertion, and multiple mutations spanning a stretch of dna up to  <dig> bp.
our fastcloning technique provides a very simple, effective, reliable, and versatile tool for molecular cloning, chimera construction, insertion of any dna sequences of interest and also for multiple mutations in a short stretch of a cdna.
first, it does not need gel purification of the pcr product or linearized vector.
after dpni digestion of the mixture of the amplified vector and insert to eliminate the dna templates used in pcr reactions, the mixture is directly transformed into competent e. coli cells to obtain the desired clones.
here we report a highly simplified, reliable, and efficient pcr-based cloning technique to insert any dna fragment into a plasmid vector or into a gene  in a vector at any desired position.
with this method, the vector and insert are pcr amplified separately, with only  <dig> cycles, using a high fidelity dna polymerase.
