a tool to evaluate the discrimination power of candidate genes is therefore in high demand by clinical researchers.
set provides a flexible and easy-to-follow platform to evaluate the discrimination power of a gene signature.
here, we demonstrated the application of set for several purposes:  for signatures consisting of a large number of genes, set offers the ability to rapidly narrow down the number of genes;  for a given signature , set can re-evaluate and re-adjust its discrimination power by selecting/de-selecting genes repeatedly;  for multiple microarray datasets, set can evaluate the classification capability of a signature among datasets; and  by providing a module to visualize the prediction strength for each sample, set allows users to re-evaluate the discrimination power on mis-grouped or less-certain samples.
the identification of specific gene expression signature for distinguishing sample groups is a dominant field in cancer research.
signature evaluation tool  is a java-based tool adopting the golub's weighted voting algorithm as well as incorporating the visual presentation of prediction strength for each array sample.
information obtained from the above applications could be useful in prognostic analyses or clinical management decisions.
although a number of tools have been developed to identify optimal gene expression signatures, the number of signature genes obtained is often overly large to be applied clinically.
the simplicity, flexibility and brevity of set could make it an invaluable tool for marker identification in clinical research.
