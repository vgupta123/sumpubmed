we have developed a generic software which permits users to view a single genome in entirety either within its chromosome or supercontig context within a single window.
different data types and data sets are displayed onto the genome, which have been acquired from other types of studies including classical genetics, forward and reverse genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and improved annotation from alternative sources.
omnimapfree provides a unified, versatile and easy-to-use software tool for studying a single genome in association with all the other datasets and data types available for the organism.
in each display, different types of information can be overlapped, then retrieved in the desired combinations and scales and used in follow up analyses.
on most genome browsers, typically, only the dna sequence, est support, motif search results, and go annotations are displayed.
the displays generated are of publication quality.
however, for many species, a growing volume of additional experimental information is available but this is rarely searchable within the landscape of the entire genome.
