some of these sra genes are only present in s. meliloti, sometimes in genomic islands; homologues of others are present in related genomes including those of the pathogens brucella and agrobacterium.
this approach to screening identified ~ <dig> intergenic regions conserved between sinorhizobium meliloti and related members of the alpha-proteobacteria sub-group  <dig>  of these,  <dig> appear to correspond to novel non-coding srnas and three are putative peptide-coding or 5' utr rnas .
small non coding rna  genes can be found in the intergenic regions of alpha-proteobacteria genomes.
the expression of each of these new small rna genes was confirmed by northern blot hybridization.
the number of srnas confirmed in e. coli through various approaches is above  <dig>  with several hundred more srna candidate genes under biological validation.
