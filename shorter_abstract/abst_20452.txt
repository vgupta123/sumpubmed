while prior research analyzed regulated gene sets utilizing defined, in vitro stress related or advanced surgical methods with various animal species, we investigated the intracellular lifestyle of map in the intestines and lymph nodes to understand the map pathways that function to govern this persistence.
while tissues show a "shut-down" of major map metabolic genes, infected macrophages upregulate several map specific genes along with a putative pathogenicity island responsible for iron acquisition.
the map genome sequence was published in  <dig>  yet its transcriptional organization in natural infection is unknown.
transcriptomes of natural infection and in vitro macrophage infection shared genes involved in transcription and inorganic ion transport and metabolism.
map specific genes within large sequence polymorphisms of ancestral m. avium complex were downregulated exclusively in natural infection.
this dichotomy also suggests that in vitro macrophage models may be insufficient in providing accurate information on the events that transpire during natural infection.
regulatory pathways that govern the lifecycle of map appear to be specified by tissue and cell type.
many of these regulatory pathways rely on the advanced interplay of host and pathogen and in order to decipher their message, an interactome must be established using a systems biology approach.
paratuberculosis  persistently infects intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes leading to a prolonged subclinical disease.
identified map pathways place current research into direct alignment in meeting the future challenge of creating a map-host interactome.
we have unveiled common and unique map pathways associated with persistence, cell wall biogenesis and virulence in naturally infected cow intestines, lymph nodes and in vitro infected macrophages.
