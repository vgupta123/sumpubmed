of the three grip domain golgins that capture endosome-to-golgi carriers, golgin- <dig> and golgin- <dig> share a closely related capture motif, whereas that in gcc <dig> is distinct, suggesting that it works by a different mechanism and raising the possibility that the three golgins capture different classes of endosome-derived carriers that share many cargos but have distinct features for recognition at the golgi.
mapping of six different golgins reveals that, in each case, a short 20â€“ <dig> residue region is necessary and sufficient to capture specific carriers.
there appear to be at least four different types of motif, consistent with specific golgins capturing specific classes of carrier and implying the existence of distinct receptors present on each of these different carrier classes.
several types of proteins have been proposed to confer specificity to this process, and we have recently shown that a set of coiled-coil proteins on the golgi, called golgins, are able to capture specific classes of carriers when relocated to an ectopic location.
for six different golgins, the capture of carriers is mediated by a short region at the n-terminus of the protein.
the internal organization of cells depends on mechanisms to ensure that transport carriers, such as vesicles, fuse only with the correct destination organelle.
the vesicle-capturing regions of gmap- <dig>  golgin- <dig>  and tmf capture intra-golgi vesicles and share some sequence features, suggesting that they act in a related, if distinct, manner.
