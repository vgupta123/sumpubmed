blood samples were derived from adult patients with clinical symptoms of sepsis, according to sirs criteria, hospitalized in the intensive care unit.
the qpcr and fish methods described in this study may constitute alternatives to blood culture and to the few existing commercial molecular assays since they enable the detection of the majority of microbial species, and the qpcr method allows their identification in a higher number of samples than the sf test.
fish made it possible to show the presence of microbes in a blood sample even before its culture.
microbiological diagnosis of sepsis relies primarily on blood culture data.
those developed by us: nested, multiplex, qpcr  and fish with commercial methods: septifast   and bact/alert® 3d blood culture system .

it was demonstrated that qpcr was significantly more likely to detect microorganisms than the remaining methods; qpcr confirmed the results obtained with the sf kit in all cases wherein bacteria were detected with simultaneous confirmation of gram-typing.
all data collected through the fish method were corroborated by qpcr.
