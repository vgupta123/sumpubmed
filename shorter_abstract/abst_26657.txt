ten lame dogs with severe hip oa and a control group of  <dig> sound dogs were used for this study.
regenerative medicine using mesenchymal stem cells  alone or combined with plasma rich in growth factors  is a rapidly growing area of clinical research and is currently also being used to treat osteoarthritis .
force platform analysis has been consistently used to verify and quantify the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of oa in dogs including msc associated to prgf, but never with ad-msc alone.
the aim of this study was to use a force platform to measure the efficacy of intraarticular admsc administration for limb function improvement in dogs with severe oa.
results were statistically analyzed to detect a significant increase in peak vertical force  and vertical impulse  in treated dogs.
intraarticular admsc therapy objectively improved limb function in dogs with hip oa.
