finally, results on gene expression data lead to complete solutions, delivering new biclusters corresponding to putative modules with heightened biological relevance.
bicspam also achieves the best match-scores for the recovery of hidden biclusters in synthetic datasets with varying noise distributions and levels of missing values.
additionally, biclustering approaches relying on pattern mining output deliver exhaustive solutions with an arbitrary number and positioning of biclusters.
we propose new biclustering algorithms to perform flexible, exhaustive and noise-tolerant biclustering based on sequential patterns .
results show bicspam ability to capture symmetries, handle planted noise, and scale in terms of memory and time.
strategies are proposed to allow for symmetries and to seize efficiency gains from item-indexable properties and/or from partitioning methods with conservative distance guarantees.
