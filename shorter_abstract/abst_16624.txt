of these, two clones could be differentiated into neuron-, adipocyte- or hepatocyte-like cells under certain culture conditions.
this is the first study to demonstrate that dermal fibroblasts can differentiate into insulin-producing cells without genetic manipulation.
it is of great interest to know whether these cells could be further differentiated into functional insulin-producing cells.
we have previously obtained a clonal population of cells from human foreskin that is able to differentiate into mesodermal, ectodermal and endodermal progenies.
in addition, those two clones were able to differentiate into islet-like clusters under pancreatic induction.
moreover, the islet-like clusters could release insulin in response to glucose in vitro.
sixty-one single-cell-derived dermal fibroblast clones were established from human foreskin by limiting dilution culture.
this may offer a safer cell source for future stem cell-based therapies.
