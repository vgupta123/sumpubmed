dual rna sequencing allows simultaneous capture of the global transcriptome of host and pathogen, during infection.
our results confirm that mycobacterial pathways for cholesterol degradation and iron acquisition are upregulated during infection.
here, we use a strategy that combines enrichment for bacterial transcripts and dual rna sequencing to provide the most comprehensive transcriptome of intracellular mycobacteria to date.
in contrast to other intracellular pathogens, it has remained difficult to capture the transcriptome of mycobacteria during infection due to an unfavorable host-to-pathogen ratio.
we employed microbial enrichment combined with specific ribosomal rna depletion to simultaneously analyze the transcriptional responses of host and pathogen during infection by dual rna sequencing.

in addition, genes involved in the methylcitrate cycle, aspartate metabolism and recycling of mycolic acids were induced.
mycobacterial rna was up to 1000-fold underrepresented in total rna preparations of infected host cells.
in response to m. bovis bcg infection, host cells upregulated de novo cholesterol biosynthesis presumably to compensate for the loss of this metabolite by bacterial catabolism.
however, mycobacteria remained problematic due to their relatively low number per host cell resulting in an unfavorable bacterium-to-host rna ratio.
