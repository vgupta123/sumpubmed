they achieve hypermutation through replacement of the variable region with a strongly mutated cdna copy generated by the element-encoded reverse transcriptase.

most notably, our data suggest that the template rna is transcribed separately from the rest of the element.
in contrast to “selfish” retroelements such as group ii introns and retrotransposons, dgrs impart an advantage to their host by increasing its adaptive potential.
its output allows comprehensive analysis of various aspects of dgr biology, thus deepening our understanding of the role dgrs play in prokaryotic genome plasticity, from the global down to the molecular level.
dgrs were discovered in a bacteriophage, but since then additional examples have been identified in some bacterial genomes.
phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison showed that dgrs move between genomes by associating with various mobile elements such as phages, transposons and plasmids.
we identified  <dig> dgrs which are found in all major classes of bacteria, though exhibiting sporadic distribution across species.
digref is a valuable tool to detect dgrs in genome data.
here we present the program digref that allowed us to comprehensively screen available databases for dgrs.
