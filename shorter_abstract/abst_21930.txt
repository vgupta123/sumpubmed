the earliest low-resolution scoring used simple distance-based "contact potentials," but more recently, the relative orientations of interacting amino acids have been taken into account to improve performance.
we developed a new knowledge-based scoring function, loco, that locates the interaction partners of each individual residue within a local coordinate system based only on the position of its main chain n, cα and c atoms.
successful protein structure prediction requires accurate low-resolution scoring functions so that protein main chain conformations that are close to the native can be identified.
loco was trained on a large set of experimentally determined structures and optimized using standard sets of modeled structures, or "decoys."
when tested against  <dig> other published main chain functions on a group of  <dig> commonly used decoy sets, our function outperformed all others in cα rmsd rank of the best-scoring decoy, with statistically significant p-values <  <dig>  for  <dig> out of the  <dig> other functions considered.
our function demonstrates an unmatched combination of accuracy, speed, and simplicity and shows excellent promise for protein structure prediction.
