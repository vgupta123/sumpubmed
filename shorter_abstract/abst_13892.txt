we found that brp- <dig> and ym <dig> were abundant in the mouse lung, whereas ym <dig> mrna was abundant in the stomach, followed by lung.
the expression levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> in the mouse lung were higher than those of two active chitinases and were comparable to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a housekeeping gene which is constitutively expressed in all tissues.
our results indicate that catalytically inactive brp- <dig> and ym <dig> are constitutive genes in normal mouse lung.
recently, clps have attracted considerable attention due to their increased expression in a number of pathological conditions, including asthma, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis and malignant tumors.
tissue cdnas obtained by reverse transcription from total rna from four embryonic stages and eight adult tissues were analyzed using the qpcr system with the standard dna.
the quantification of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> is an important step in gaining insight into the in vivo regulation of the clps.
we constructed a standard dna for quantitative real-time pcr  by containing three clps target fragments and five reference genes cdna in a one-to-one ratio.
we established a qpcr system detecting clps and comparing their expression levels with those of five reference genes using the same scale in mouse tissues.

mice and humans produce chitinase-like proteins , which are highly homologous to chitinases but lack chitinolytic activity.
although the exact functions of clps are largely unknown, the significance of their increased expression levels during pathophysiological states needs to be determined.
