however, no changes of connexin abundance or gap junction size/abundance were observed in ih-treated nox2-null mice.
since altered conduction through gap junction channels can contribute to the pathogenesis of such arrhythmias, we examined the abundance and distributions of the major cardiac gap junction proteins, connexin <dig>  and connexin <dig>  in mice treated with sleep fragmentation or intermittent hypoxia  as animal models of the components of obstructive sleep apnea.
immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the abundance and size of gap junctions containing cx <dig> or cx <dig> were reduced in atria by ih treatment of mice.

these results demonstrate that intermittent hypoxia  causes reductions and remodeling of atrial cx <dig> and cx <dig>  these alterations may contribute to the substrate for atrial fibrillation that develops in response to obstructive sleep apnea.
moreover, these connexin changes are likely generated in response to reactive oxygen species generated by nox <dig>
obstructive sleep apnea has been linked to the development of heart disease and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation.
