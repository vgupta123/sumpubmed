bacterial growth and division requires a core set of essential proteins, several of which are still of unknown function.
to begin to elucidate ysxc function, a translational fusion of ysxc to the cbp-proteina tag in the staphylococcal chromosome was made, enabling tandem affinity purification  of ysxc-interacting partners.
in this study we demonstrate that ysxc of s. aureus localizes to the ribosomes, is crucial for ribosomal stability and is apparently essential for the life of s. aureus.
ysxc depletion led to a decrease in the presence of mature ribosomes, indicating a role in ribosome assembly and/or stability in s. aureus.
they are also attractive targets for the development of new antibiotics.
here, we demonstrate by the creation of a conditional lethal mutant that ysxc is apparently essential for growth in s. aureus.
these included the ribosomal proteins s <dig>  s <dig> and l <dig>  as well as the Î²' subunit of the rna polymerase.
