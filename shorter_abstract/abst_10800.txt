further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis.
while gse methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, gsva constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology.
moreover, gsva contributes to the current need of gse methods for rna-seq data.
as molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible gse methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
to address this challenge, we introduce gene set variation analysis , a gse method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner.
gsva provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods.
gene set enrichment  analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary.
