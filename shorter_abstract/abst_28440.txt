we rank all the possible substitutions according to a three state classification system and show that the overall accuracy of our predictor is as high as 56% when performed starting from sequence information and 61% when the protein structure is available, with a mean value correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
our method improves the quality of the prediction of the free energy change due to single point protein mutations by adopting a hypothesis of thermodynamic reversibility of the existing experimental data.
in order to overcome this problem we describe a new predictor that discriminates between  <dig> mutation classes: destabilizing mutations , stabilizing mutations  and neutral mutations .
in this paper a support vector machine starting from the protein sequence or structure discriminates between stabilizing, destabilizing and neutral mutations.
in proteomics and genomics studies prediction of protein stability free energy change  upon single point mutation may also help the annotation process.
by this we both recast the thermodynamic symmetry of the problem and balance the distribution of the available experimental measurements of free energy changes.
