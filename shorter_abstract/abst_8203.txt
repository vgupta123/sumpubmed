by this means, a novel capillary network emerges out of combinatorially complex interactions of single cells.
we developed a computational model that bridges the gap between these two perspectives, and addresses a remaining question in angiogenic sprouting: how do the processes of endothelial cell elongation, migration and proliferation contribute to vessel formation?
the activation, proliferation, and movement of these cells lead to capillary growth in three dimensions.
initial results predict tip cell activation, stalk cell development and sprout formation as a function of local vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations and the delta-like  <dig> notch ligand, as it might occur in a three-dimensional in vitro setting.
results demonstrate the differential effects of ligand concentrations, cell movement and proliferation on sprouting and directional persistence.
this systems biology model offers a paradigm closely related to biological phenomena and highlights previously unexplored interactions of cell elongation, migration and proliferation as a function of ligand concentration, giving insight into key cellular mechanisms driving angiogenesis.
rules and parameter ranges are based on literature data on endothelial cell behavior in vitro.
in parallel, mathematical models of angiogenesis have helped characterize a broader view of capillary network formation and have suggested new directions for experimental pursuit.
