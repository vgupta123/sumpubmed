finally, treatment of wild type animals with an anxa <dig> peptido-mimetic, given prophylactically  or therapeutically , ameliorated both signs of inflammation and fibrosis.
up-regulation in epithelial cells and infiltrated granulocytes at day  <dig>  followed by augmented protein levels in alveolar macrophages by day  <dig>  absence of anxa <dig> caused increases in: i) the degree of inflammation at day 7; and ii) indexes of fibrosis  at day  <dig> and  <dig>  these alterations in anxa <dig> null mice were paralleled by augmented tgf-β <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α generation compared to wild-type mice.
annexin-a <dig>  is one mediator of endogenous anti-inflammation, affording regulation of leukocyte trafficking and activation in many contexts, yet its role in lung pathologies has been scarcely investigated, despite being highly expressed in lung cells.
here we have applied the bleomycin lung fibrosis model to anxa <dig> null mice over a 21-day time-course, to monitor potential impact of this mediator on the control of the inflammatory and fibrotic phases.
collectively these data reveal a pathophysiological relevance for endogenous anxa <dig> in lung inflammation and, more importantly, fibrosis, and may open new insights for the pharmacological treatment of lung fibrosis.
