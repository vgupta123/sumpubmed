furthermore, we integrate this approach in the rxncon framework to support automatic model generation and iterative model definition and validation.
here, we address this with a bipartite boolean modelling approach.
taken together, we  present a bipartite boolean modelling approach that retains contextual activation information,  provide software support for automatic model generation, visualisation and simulation, and  demonstrate its use for iterative model generation and validation.
briefly, we use a state oriented approach with separate update rules based on reactions and contingencies.
we benchmark this method with the previously mapped map kinase network in yeast, showing that minor adjustments suffice to produce a functional network description.
this approach retains contextual activation information and distinguishes distinct signals passing through a single component.
that is, these models cannot distinguish between different downstream roles played by the same component activated in different contexts.
