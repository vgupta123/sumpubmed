we identified a large number of genomic elements that superficially reassemble crisprs but don’t contain diverse spacers and have no companion cas genes.
using available genome sequences, we observed that a significant number of genomes have isolated cas loci and/or crisprs.
a typical crispr–cas system consists of a crispr array of repeat and spacer units, and a locus of cas genes.
the crispr–cas systems in prokaryotes are rna-guided immune systems that target and deactivate foreign nucleic acids.
we demonstrated that false-crisprs could be used to reduce the false annotation of crisprs, therefore showing them to be useful for improving the annotation of crispr–cas systems.
the crispr and the cas locus are often located next to each other in the genomes.
in addition, ad-hoc studies have shown that some non-crispr genomic elements contain repeat-spacer-like structures and are mistaken as crisprs.
we found that 11%, 22% and 28% of the type i, ii and iii cas loci are isolated , respectively.
we called these elements false-crisprs and further classified them into groups, including tandem repeats and staphylococcus aureus repeat -like elements.
