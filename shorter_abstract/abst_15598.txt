in an attempt to isolate differentiated mature endothelial cells from mouse lung we found that the lung contains epcs with a high vasculogenic capacity and capability of de novo vasculogenesis for blood and lymph vessels.
a high percentage of these cells are also positive for lyve <dig>  prox <dig>  podoplanin and vegfr- <dig> indicating that a considerabe fraction of the cells are committed to develop lymphatic endothelium.
mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells  were isolated by selection of cd31+ cells.
these highly dividing cells possess the capacity to integrate into various types of vessels including blood and lymph vessels unveiling the existence of local microvascular endothelial progenitor cells  in adult mouse lung.
clonogenic highly proliferating cells from limiting dilution assays were also bipotent.
the lung contains large numbers of epcs that display commitment for both types of vessels, suggesting that lung blood and lymphatic endothelial cells are derived from a single progenitor cell.
combined in vitro and in vivo spheroid and matrigel assays revealed that these epcs exhibit vasculogenic capacity by forming functional blood and lymph vessels.
postnatal endothelial progenitor cells  have been successfully isolated from whole bone marrow, blood and the walls of conduit vessels.
epcs could be amplified > passage  <dig> and still expressed panendothelial markers as well as the progenitor cell antigens, but not antigens for immune cells and hematopoietic stem cells.
