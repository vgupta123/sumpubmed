we attempted to define the cell type specific gene expression patterns for the major constituent cells of blood, including b-cells, cd4+ t-cells, cd8+ t-cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes.
we did this by comparing the global gene expression profiles of purified b-cells, cd4+ t-cells, cd8+ t-cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes using cdna microarrays.
supervised analyses identified gene expression signatures for b-cells , t-cells , cd8+ t-cells , granulocytes , and lymphocytes .
blood is a complex tissue comprising numerous cell types with distinct functions and corresponding gene expression profiles.
lymphocytes were distinguishable from granulocytes based on their higher levels of expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, while granulocytes exhibited characteristic expression of various cell surface and inflammatory proteins.
genes encoding cell surface proteins were disproportionately represented among the genes that distinguished among the lymphocyte subpopulations.
the most prominent feature of the cell type signature genes was the enrichment of genes encoding cell surface proteins, perhaps reflecting the importance of specialized systems for sensing the environment to the physiology of resting leukocytes.
