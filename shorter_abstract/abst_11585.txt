the basic peptidase function is "protein digestion" and this can be potentially dangerous in living organisms when it is not strictly controlled by specific inhibitors.
more importantly, our method can then predict pairs of peptidases and interacting inhibitors, scoring a joint global accuracy of 99% with coverage for the positive cases  close to 100% and a correlation coefficient of  <dig> %.
peptidases are proteolytic enzymes responsible for fundamental cellular activities in all organisms.
a web server specifically developed for annotating peptidases and their inhibitors  is available at
this information can help the design of experiments to detect interacting peptidase/inhibitor complexes and can speed up the selection of possible interacting candidates, without searching for them separately and manually combining the obtained results.
apparently about 2â€“5% of the genes encode for peptidases, irrespectively of the organism source.
