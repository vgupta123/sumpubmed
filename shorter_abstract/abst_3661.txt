the eric 1 +  <dig> minimum-spanning tree from  <dig> strains of c. pseudotuberculosis showed that the great majority of biovar ovis strains clustered together, but separately from biovar equi strains that also clustered amongst themselves.
using evolutionarily conserved genes  and their corresponding amino acid sequences, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among eighteen strains of c. pseudotuberculosis belonging to both biovars ovis and equi.
taken together the results suggest that biovar equi is forming the biovar ovis.
however, molecular evidence has not been established so far to understand this difference, specifically if these c. pseudotuberculosis strains are under an evolutionary process.
we observed that the biovars are different at the molecular phylogenetic level and a probable anagenesis is occurring slowly within the species c. pseudotuberculosis.
however, additional analyses using other genes and other bacterial strains are required to further support our anagenesis hypothesis in c. pseudotuberculosis.
strains isolated from sheep and goats show negative nitrate reduction and are termed biovar ovis, while strains from horse and cattle exhibit positive nitrate reduction and are called biovar equi.
