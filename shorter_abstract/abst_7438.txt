then, genomic prediction  models were tested and prediction accuracy was compared to the one obtained in traditional marker assisted selection  methods.
we have demonstrated that there are good perspectives for gs implementation in perennial ryegrass breeding, and that problems resulting from low linkage disequilibrium  can be reduced by the presence of structure and related families in the breeding population.
genome wide association analysis was performed to uncover the genetic architecture of the trait.
while comprehensive genome wide association analysis is difficult in species with extremely low ld, we did identify variants proximal to genes with a known role in flowering time .
here, we test the opportunity to implement gs in breeding of perennial ryegrass, using real data from a forage breeding program.

genomic selection  has become a commonly used technology in animal breeding.
so far, its implementation in plant breeding has been mainly investigated in species farmed as homogeneous varieties.
gp models gave very high accuracies, which were significantly better than those obtained through traditional mas.
accuracies were higher when predictions were made from related families and from larger training populations, whereas predicting from unrelated families caused the variance of the estimated breeding values to be biased downwards.
heading date was chosen as a model trait, due to its high heritability and ease of assessment.
