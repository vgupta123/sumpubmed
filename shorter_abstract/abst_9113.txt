drosophila suzukii is an invasive pest that drastically expanded its global range in a very short time since  <dig>  spreading to most areas in north america and many countries in europe and south america.
specifically, we observed a trend of higher proportions of flies with the winter morph phenotype, characterized by darker pigmentation and longer wing length, as summer progresses to winter.
a laboratory-simulated winter photoperiod and temperature  were sufficient to induce the winter morph phenotype in d. suzukii.
investigating d. suzukii phenology and seasonal adaptations can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms through which insects express phenotypic plasticity, which likely enables invasive species to successfully colonize a wide range of environments.

we describe seasonal phenotypic plasticity in field populations of d. suzukii.
this work may contribute to more accurate population models that incorporate seasonal variation in physiological parameters, leading to development of better management strategies.
winter morph gene expression is consistent with known mechanisms of cold-hardening such as adjustments to ion transport and up-regulation of carbohydrate metabolism.
this winter morph is associated with increased survival at 1 °c when compared to the summer morph, thus explaining the ability of d. suzukii to survive cold winters.
in addition, transcripts involved in oogenesis and dna replication were down-regulated in the winter morph, providing the first molecular evidence of a reproductive diapause in d. suzukii.
as global climate change and exponential human population growth intensifies pressure on agricultural systems, the need to effectively manage invasive insect pests is becoming increasingly important to global food security.
preliminary ecological modeling predicted a more restricted distribution and, for this reason, the invasion of d. suzukii to northern temperate regions is especially unexpected.
we then used rna sequencing to identify gene expression differences underlying seasonal differences in d. suzukii physiology.
to date, d. suzukii cold resistance studies suggest that this species cannot overwinter in northern locations, e.g.
combining physiological investigations with rna sequencing, we present potential mechanisms by which d. suzukii can overwinter in these regions.
