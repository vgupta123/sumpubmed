high-throughput cultivation and screening methods allow a parallel, miniaturized and cost efficient processing of many samples.
the presented platform allows for high-throughput cultivation and screening of synechocystis sp.
each microtiter-well within the chamber functions as a separate cultivation vessel with reproducible conditions.
these methods however, have not been generally established for phototrophic organisms such as microalgae or cyanobacteria.
the cultivation was performed in  <dig> Â ml deepwell microtiter plates within a cultivation chamber outfitted with programmable shaking conditions, variable illumination, variable temperature, and an adjustable co <dig> atmosphere.
the automated measurement of various parameters such as growth, full absorption spectrum, chlorophyll concentration, maldi-tof-ms, as well as a novel vitality measurement protocol, have already been established and can be monitored during cultivation.
measurement of growth parameters can be used as inputs for the system to allow for periodic automatic dilutions and therefore a semi-continuous cultivation of hundreds of cultures in parallel.
pcc <dig>  the platform should be usable for many phototrophic microorganisms as is, and be adaptable for even more.
in this work we describe and test high-throughput methods with the model organism synechocystis sp.
