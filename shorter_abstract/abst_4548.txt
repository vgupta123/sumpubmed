predicting the location of functionally important sites from protein sequence and/or structure is a long-standing problem in computational biology.
we benchmark the approach on enzyme families of known 3d structure with bound substrates, and find that in nearly all families residues predicted by sdpsite are in contact with the bound substrate, and that the addition of sdps significantly improves functional site prediction accuracy.
the results suggest a better means to predict functional details for the thousands of protein structures determined prior to a clear understanding of molecular function.
most current approaches make use of sequence conservation, assuming that amino acid residues conserved within a protein family are most likely to be functionally important.
