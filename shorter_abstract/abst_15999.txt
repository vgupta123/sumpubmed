bioinformatic analysis of mtss <dig> suggests that differential exon usage may affect interaction with fyn and src, two tyrosine kinases previously recognized as critical for cerebellar cell migration and histogenesis.
these overlap with the actin filament binding site of mtss <dig>  and one also harbors a potential pka and pkc phosphorylation site.
during development, mtss <dig> is transiently expressed in granule cells, from the time point they cease to proliferate to their synaptic integration.
whereas immature granule cells express a mtss <dig> variant observed also in peripheral tissues and comprising exon  <dig>  this exon is replaced by a cns-specific exon, 12a, in more mature granule cells and in adult purkinje cells.
given the prime importance of this pathway for cerebellar development and tumorigenesis, we assessed expression of mtss <dig> in the developing murine cerebellum and human medulloblastoma specimens.
both the pattern of expression and splicing of mtss <dig> is developmentally regulated in the murine cerebellum.
neuronal differentiation is accompanied by a switch in mtss <dig> splicing.
