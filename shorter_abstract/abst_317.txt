our results indicate that allopolyploidization entails significant homoeolog expression modulation, both immediately as a consequence of genomic merger, and secondarily as a result of long-term evolutionary transformations in duplicate gene expression.
within allopolyploid gossypium, approximately 24% of the genes with biased  expression patterns are inferred to have arisen as a consequence of genomic merger, indicating that a substantial fraction of homoeolog expression biases occur instantaneously with hybridization.
relative levels of a- and d-genome contributions to the petal transcriptome were determined for  <dig>  gene pairs.
this comparison permitted partitioning of homoeolog expression biases into those arising from genomic merger and those resulting from polyploidy.
finally, we observed a greater number of genes biased toward the paternal d-genome and that expression biases have tended to increases during allopolyploid evolution.
owing to this redundancy, these genomes can play host to an array of evolutionary processes that act on duplicate genes.
