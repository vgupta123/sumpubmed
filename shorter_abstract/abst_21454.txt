persistent epigenetic changes that result from environmental exposures include gains or losses of dna methylation of cytosine, which can impact gene expression.
we used an unbiased genome-wide dna methylation study, involving chip-seq with antibodies to 5-methylcytosine  and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine  to identify dna regions in which methylation levels have changed  <dig> weeks after a single exposure to proton irradiation.
we used dip-seq to profile changes in genome-wide dna methylation and hydroxymethylation following proton irradiation.
the dna methylation data showed tissue-dependent effects of proton irradiation and revealed significant major pathway changes in response to irradiation that are related to known pathophysiologic processes.
the results demonstrate long-term changes in dna methylation patterns following a single proton irradiation, that these changes are tissue specific, and that they map to pathways consistent with tissue specific responses to proton irradiation.

in the present study, we compared the long-term epigenetic effects of whole body proton irradiation in the mouse hippocampus and left ventricle.
we also observed spatial overlap for regions where both epigenetic marks decreased in the ventricle.
further, the results suggest novel relationships between changes in 5mc and 5hmc.
proton irradiation poses a potential hazard to astronauts during and following a mission, with post-mitotic cells at most risk because they cannot dilute resultant epigenetic changes via cell division.
in addition, we used published rnaseq data to assess whether differentially methylated regions were linked to changes in gene expression.
in hippocampus, increases in 5hmc were most significantly correlated  with regions that had increased 5mc, suggesting that deposition of hippocampal 5mc and 5hmc may be mechanistically coupled.
