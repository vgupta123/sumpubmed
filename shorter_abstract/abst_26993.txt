culturing under different growth conditions revealed no apparent requirement for the aapal expression.
this study investigated the presence and conservation of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein  among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, the immunostimulatory effect of aapal, and whether live cells release this structural outer membrane lipoprotein in free-soluble form independent of vesicles.
the pal locus and its gene product were confirmed in clinical a. actinomycetemcomitans strains by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism and immunoblotting.
in a cell culture insert model , aapal was detected from filtrates when strains d7s and d7ss were incubated in serum or broth in the inserts.
an ex vivo model indicated cytokine production from human whole blood stimulated by aapal.
the filtrates were immunoblot negative for a cytoplasmic marker, cyclic amp  receptor protein.
extracellular release of bacterial outer membrane proteins has been suggested to mainly occur via outer membrane vesicles.
free-soluble aapal can be extracellularly released in a process independent of vesicles.
inactivation of pal in a wild-type strain  and in its spontaneous laboratory variant  resulted in pleiotropic cellular effects.
