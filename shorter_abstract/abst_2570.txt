automated microscopy technologies have led to a rapid growth in imaging data on a scale comparable to that of the genomic revolution.
high throughput screens are now being performed to determine the localisation of all of proteins in a proteome.
the methodology is tested on a high throughput set of images of  <dig> subcellular localisations, and it is shown that the localisations may be distinguished to a statistically significant degree with as few as  <dig> images of each.
while icluster is applicable to moderate  size image sets, the statistical test is simple to implement and will readily be adapted to high throughput pipelines to provide more sensitive discrimination of difference.
the effect of outlier images is also examined and it is shown that while the significance of the test may be reduced by outliers this may be compensated for by utilising more images.
here we introduce a novel method of statistical testing, and supporting software, to give a rigorous test for difference in imaging.
closer to the bench, large image sets of proteins in treated and untreated cells are being captured on a daily basis to determine function and interactions.
