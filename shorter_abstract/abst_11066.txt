starvation decreased and refeeding increased muscle protein synthesis , similarly in both igf-i knockouts and wt mice.
phosphorylation of p70s6k and mtor increased and 4ebp <dig> bound to eif4e decreased in both igf-i knockouts and wt mice after refeeding .
in the present study the role of liver-derived endocrine igf-i for activation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis following feeding was evaluated.
plasma glucose decreased during starvation in all groups in parallel to insulin, while plasma igf-i and gh did not change significantly among the groups during starvation-refeeding.
this study demonstrates that re-synthesis of muscle proteins following starvation is not critically dependent on endocrine liver-derived igf-i.
transgenic female mice with selective knockout of the igf-i gene in hepatocytes were freely fed, starved overnight and subsequently refed for  <dig> hours and compared to wild types .
muscle transcripts of igf-i decreased and igf-i receptor increased  in wild types during starvation but similar alterations did not reach significance in knockouts .
plasma amino acids declined and increased during starvation-refeeding in wild type mice , but less so in igf-i  knockouts .
liver igf-i knockout mice had 70% reduced plasma igf-i.
