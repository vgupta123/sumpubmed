interestingly, the expression patterns observed in arabidopsis indicate that mir168b underwent partial subfunctionalization as determined by the experimental characterization of its expression pattern provided in this study.
we applied different approaches to studying the genomic organization and the structural and functional evolution of mir <dig> homologs in brassicaeae.
while orthology was lacking between arabidopsis and poplar mir <dig> genes, we successfully isolated orthologs of both loci present in arabidopsis  from all the brassicaceae species analyzed, including the basal species aethionema grandiflora, thus indicating that  independent duplication events took place in arabidopsis and poplar lineages and  the origin of mir <dig> paralogs predates both the brassicaceae radiation and the arabidopsis alpha polyploidization.
a whole genome comparison of arabidopsis and poplar, phylogenetic footprinting and phylogenetic reconstruction were used to date the duplication events originating mir <dig> homologs in these genomes.
we found further evolutionary evidence that pre-mir <dig> lower stem  is significantly longer than animal lower stems and probably plays a relevant role in multi-step mir <dig> biogenesis.
different phylogenetic footprints, corresponding to known functionally relevant regions  or for which functions could be proposed, were found to be highly conserved among mir <dig> homologs.
although their duplication happened at least  <dig> million years ago, we found evidence that both mir <dig> paralogs have been maintained throughout the evolution of brassicaceae, most likely functionally as indicated by the extremely high conservation of functionally relevant regions, predicted secondary structure and thermodynamic profile.
we used a comparative phylogenetic footprinting approach to identify the structural and functional constraints that shaped mir <dig> evolution in brassicaceae.
comparative predictions of the identified micrornas also indicate extreme conservation of secondary structure and thermodynamic stability.
in plants, expression of argonaute <dig> , the catalytic subunit of the rna-induced silencing complex responsible for post-transcriptional gene silencing, is controlled through a feedback loop involving the mir <dig> microrna.
