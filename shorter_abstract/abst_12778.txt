aim of the study was to compare the effect of neuroleptic sedation with acepromazine and neuroleptanalgesia with acepromazine and buprenorphine on thermal thresholds  obtained at the nostrils and at the withers.
there is no differential influence of neuroleptic sedation or neuroleptanalgesia on tts obtained at n or w. buprenorphine combined with acepromazine has a long lasting anti-nociceptive effect associated with the typical opioid induced side effects in horses.
thermal stimulation at both described body areas gives comparable results in the assessment of cutaneous anti-nociception in horses.
thermal thresholds were determined by incremental contact heat applied to the skin above the nostril  or the withers .
sedation score, gastrointestinal auscultation score and occurrence of skin lesions were recorded.
all horses had reduced to absent borborygmi after ab administration for  <dig> to 495 minutes.
after ab there was a significant increase above baseline in tt until 405 minutes after treatment.
