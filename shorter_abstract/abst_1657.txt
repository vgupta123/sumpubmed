data herein indicate that balancing selection is common within the extended mhc region and involves several non-hla loci.

no exceptional nucleotide diversity was observed for zscan <dig>  hla-dmb, vars <dig>  ptpn <dig>  bat <dig>  c6orf <dig>  and il10; summary statistics were consistent with evolutionary neutrality for these gene regions.
we suggest that variants with an opposite effect on autoimmune diseases should not be considered a distinct class of disease alleles from the evolutionary perspective and, in a few cases, the opposite effect on distinct diseases may derive from complex haplotype structures in regions with high genetic diversity.
a subset of these polymorphisms displays an opposite risk profile in different autoimmune conditions.
this observation open interesting questions on the evolutionary forces shaping the frequency of these alleles in human populations.
conversely, cdsn/psors1c <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  btnl <dig>  and tap <dig> showed extremely high nucleotide diversity and most tests rejected neutrality, suggesting the action of balancing selection.
yet, the evolutionary history of most snps with an opposite effect for autoimmune diseases is consistent with evolutionary neutrality.
we aimed at testing the hypothesis whereby balancing selection has shaped the frequency of opposite risk alleles.
several susceptibility genetic variants for autoimmune diseases have been identified.
nonetheless, with the exception of variants in trim <dig> and cdsn, our data suggest that opposite risk snps are not selection targets but rather have accumulated as neutral variants.
for tap <dig> and btnl <dig> these signatures are not secondary to linkage disequilibrium with hla class ii genes.
since balancing selection signatures are expected to extend over short genomic portions, we focused our analyses on  <dig> regions carrying putative functional polymorphisms that may represent the disease variants .
