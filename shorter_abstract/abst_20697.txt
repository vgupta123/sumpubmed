therefore, it is necessary to carried out high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of rubber tree bark to generate enormous transcript sequences for the functional characterization and molecular marker development.
moreover, this study also supported that transcriptome analysis based on illumina paired-end sequencing is a powerful tool for transcriptome characterization and molecular marker development in non-model species, especially those with large and complex genomes.
among  <dig> hevea germplasms, pcr success rate and polymorphism rate of  <dig> markers were separately  <dig> % and  <dig> % in this study.
<dig> potential marker sites were randomly selected to validate the assembly quality and develop est-ssr markers.
this research generated a substantial fraction of rubber tree transcriptome sequences, which were very useful resources for gene annotation and discovery, molecular markers development, genome assembly and annotation, and microarrays development in rubber tree.
in rubber tree, bark is one of important agricultural and biological organs.
however, the molecular mechanism involved in the bark formation and development in rubber tree remains largely unknown, which is at least partially due to lack of bark transcriptomic and genomic information.
among the main kegg categories, metabolism was the biggest category , suggesting the active metabolic processes in rubber tree bark.
in addition, a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unigenes, and the characterizations of est-ssrs were further analyzed in rubber tree.
by assembling and analyzing de novo transcriptome sequencing data, we reported the comprehensive functional characterization of rubber tree bark.
the est-ssr markers identified and developed in this study will facilitate marker-assisted selection breeding in rubber tree.

the similarity search indicated that  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes showed significant similarities to known proteins from ncbi non-redundant and swissprot protein databases, respectively.
in this study, more than  <dig> million sequencing reads were generated using illumina paired-end sequencing technology.
when  <dig>  unigenes searched against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway  database,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> main categories including  <dig> kegg pathways.
in total,  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 485â€‰bp were obtained with de novo assembly.
