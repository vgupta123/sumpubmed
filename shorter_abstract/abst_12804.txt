the use of synthetic rnas and samstrt in normalization enabled comparison of gene expression levels in the highly heterogenous samples and facilitated discovery of differences between the tissue samples and cultured cells.
transciptomics revealed clear difference both between tissue and cell culture samples and between primary kcs and immortalized hacat cells.
we performed strt rna sequencing on 10 ng samples of total rna from three different sample types: i) epidermal tissue , ii) cultured primary kcs, and iii) hacat cell line.
the transcriptome analysis sensitively revealed genes involved in kc differentiation in skin grafts and cell cycle regulation related genes in cultured kcs and emphasized the fluctuation of transcription factors and non-coding rnas associated to sample types.
moreover, when analyzing kc transcriptomes, fluctuation of polya+ rna content during the kcs’ lifecycle has been omitted.
we observed significant variation in cellular polya+ rna content between tissue and cell culture samples of kcs.
the epidermal keratinocytes derived from tissue and cell culture samples showed highly different polya+ rna contents.
cultured primary cells and various immortalized cells have been frequently used as skin models but their comparability to intact skin has been questioned.
the use of samstrt and synthetic rna based normalization allowed the comparison between tissue and cell culture samples and thus proved to be valuable tools for rna-seq analysis with translational approach.
