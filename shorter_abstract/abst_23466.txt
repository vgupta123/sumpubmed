its adoption will contribute to guarantee the quality of activities in the process of cytotoxicity tests and enforce the use of good laboratory practices .

however, the execution of these assays in large scale and different laboratories requires, among other things, the management of protocols, reagents, cell lines used as well as the data produced, which can be a challenge.
in this work, we have used a workflow based lims -- the flux system -- and the together workflow editor as a framework to develop fluxcttx, a tool for management of data from cytotoxicity assays performed at different laboratories.
researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds or screen "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.
cytotoxicity assays have been used by researchers to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries.
however, a tool that performs this task designed specifically for cytotoxicity assays is not yet available.
this workflow models the activities of cytotoxicity assays performed as described in the oecd  <dig> guidance document.
fluxcttx presents a solution for the management of the data produced by cytotoxicity assays performed at interlaboratory comparisons.
the main work is the development of a workflow, which represents all stages of the assay and has been developed and uploaded in flux.
