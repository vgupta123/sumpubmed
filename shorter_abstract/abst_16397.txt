here we show using rice  loss-of-function mutants of four selected oswak genes, that individual oswaks are required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, magnaporthe oryzae.
wak genes are often transcriptionally regulated during infection but the pathways involved in this regulation are not known.
moreover, the direct requirement of rice oswak genes in regulating defense has not been explored.
in addition, we show that the very early transcriptional regulation of the rice oswak genes is triggered by chitin and is partially under the control of the chitin receptor cebip.
we conclude that the rice oswak genes studied are part of basal defense response, potentially mediated by chitin from fungal cell walls.
while oswak <dig>  oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> positively regulate quantitative resistance, oswak112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance.
this work also shows that some oswaks, like oswak112d, may act as negative regulators of disease resistance.
receptor-like kinases are well-known to play key roles in disease resistance.
among them, the wall-associated kinases  have been shown to be positive regulators of fungal disease resistance in several plant species.
the possibility that several waks participate in different ways to basal defense has not been addressed.
