however, functional and molecular analyses of such processes require a wide array of molecular tools for genetic engineering.
so far there are only a limited number of molecular tools available in volvox.
two novel molecular tools for genetic engineering of volvox are now available: the nitrate-inducible nita promoter of v. carteri and the codon-adapted luciferase reporter gene of g. princeps.
the multicellular green alga volvox carteri represents an attractive model system to study various aspects of multicellularity like cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, epithelial folding and ecm biogenesis.
long-term stability of inducible expression of the chimeric nita/g-luc transgenes after stable nuclear transformation was demonstrated by transcription analysis and bioluminescence assays.

strong expression is triggered by simply changing the nitrogen source from ammonium to nitrate.
we also show that the luciferase  gene from the marine copepod gaussia princeps, which previously was engineered to match the codon usage of the unicellular alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is a suitable reporter gene in v. carteri.
here, we show that the promoter of the v. carteri nitrate reductase gene  is a powerful molecular switch for induction of transgene expression.
emitted light of the chemiluminescent reaction can be easily detected and quantified with a luminometer.
these novel tools will be useful for future molecular research in v. carteri.
