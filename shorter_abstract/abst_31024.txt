data showed a transition toward greater nocturnal activity in the fall, preceding hibernation.
insertable cardiac monitors that were developed for use in human heart patients  were implanted in  <dig> hibernating bears.
devices recorded low heart rates  and low respiration rates  during hibernation, dramatic respiratory sinus arrhythmias in the fall and winter months, and elevated heart rates in summer ) and during interactions with hunters .
although important data have been obtained in both captive and wild bears, long-term physiological monitoring of bears has not been possible until the recent advancement of implantable devices.
annual variations in heart rate and activity have been documented for the first time in wild black bears.
this technique has broad applications to wildlife management and physiological research, enabling the impact of environmental stressors from humans, changing seasons, climate change, social interactions and predation to be directly monitored over multiple years.
