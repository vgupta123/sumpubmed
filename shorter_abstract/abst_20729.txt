here, we present an in silico analysis of potential mirna- oncogene interactions.
a list of putative targets for different oncomirs, validation of which would be of special interest, is proposed and two such interactions have been experimentally validated.
in this work both bioinformatic and experimental approaches for the prediction and validation of possible targets for mirnas have been used.
despite the postulated involvement of mirnas in tumourigenesis, there are only a few examples where an oncogene or a tumour suppressor has been identified as a mirna target.
micrornas  are one of the most abundant groups of regulatory genes in multicellular organisms, playing important roles in many fundamental cellular processes.
moreover, we have tested the validity of two possible interactions of mirnas with genes related to cancer.
