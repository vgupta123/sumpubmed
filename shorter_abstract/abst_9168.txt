we sequenced and analysed the chloroplast genomes of  <dig> species of the order nemaliales as a case study in the use of phylogenomics as an approach to achieve well-supported phylogenies of red algae.
chloroplast genomes of the order nemaliales are highly conserved, gene-dense and completely syntenic with very few cases of gene loss.
the conserved nature of red algal chloroplast genomes is a convenient and accessible source of data to resolve their ancient relationships.

analyses of subsets of the data showed that >90 % bootstrap support can be achieved with datasets as small as 2500 nt and that fast and medium evolving genes perform much better when it comes to resolving phylogenetic relationships.
in this study we show that phylogenomics is an efficient and effective approach to investigate phylogenetic relationships.
the six currently circumscribed nemaliales families are clustered into two evolutionary lineages with strong statistical support based on chloroplast phylogenomic analyses.
