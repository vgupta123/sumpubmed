quantitative  rt-pcr  experiments confirmed that the microarray data accurately reflect expression levels in the different samples.
these est and microarray data are the first publicly-available functional genomics resources for this devastating forestry pest.
candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in terminal steps of biosynthetic pathways for exo-brevicomin and frontalin were tentatively identified.
we produced ests from male and female midguts and associated fat bodies and used custom oligonucleotide microarrays to study gene expression patterns and thereby made preliminary identification of pheromone-biosynthetic genes.
custom nimblegen 4-plex arrays representing the  <dig>  tentative unique genes were queried with rna from eleven different biological states representing larvae, pupae, and midguts and associated fat bodies of unfed or fed adults.
the mountain pine beetle  is a significant coniferous forest pest in western north america.
the ests are broadly distributed among go functional groups, suggesting they reflect a broad spectrum of the transcriptome.
its three major pheromone components, trans-verbenol, exo-brevicomin, and frontalin, are thought to arise via different metabolic pathways, but the enzymes involved have not been identified or characterized.
clones from two un-normalized cdna libraries were directionally sequenced from the 5' end to yield  <dig>  ests following sequence cleansing.
