here we describe three protein domains of unknown function found mainly in bacteria: duf <dig>  duf <dig> and duf <dig>  structures of representatives of each of these domains: bt_ <dig> from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  , cj0202c from campylobacter jejuni subsp.
these domains serve a range of different functions within the proteins in which they are found, including both catalytic and non-catalytic versions.
jejuni serotype o: <dig>  , rumgna_01855) and rumgna_ <dig> from ruminococcus gnavus   have been solved by x-ray crystallography.
the ntf2-like superfamily is a versatile group of protein domains sharing a common fold.
