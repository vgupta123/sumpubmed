we present evidence for both specific and common transcriptional responses during the aging process in these tissues.
in parallel to genetic studies, genomic expression approches have given us significant information on the gene expression modifications that occur during aging either in wild type or long-lived mutant animals.
during the last two decades progress in the genetics of aging in invertebrate models such as c. elegans and d. melanogaster has clearly demonstrated the existence of regulatory pathways that control the rate of aging in these organisms, such as the insulin-like pathway, the jun kinase pathway and the sir <dig> deacetylase pathway.
but most of the genomic studies of invertebrate models have been performed so far on whole animals, while several recent studies in mammals have shown that the effects of aging are tissue specific.
this work also emphasizes the need for such experiments to reveal in greater detail the consequences of the transcriptional modifications induced by aging regulatory pathways.
in addition, a detailed comparison with other microarray data indicates that in aged flies there are significant deviations from the canonical responses to oxidative stress and immune stress.
we used oligonucleotide microarrays to address the specificities of transcriptional responses in aging drosophila in head, thorax or whole body.
simultaneous age-related impairment of synaptic transmission gene expression is observed in fly heads.
our data demonstrates the advantages and value of regionalized and comparative analysis of gene expression in aging animals.
greater downregulation of mitochondrial genes, activation of the jnk pathway and upregulation of proteasome subunits in the thorax of aged flies all suggest that muscle may be particularly sensitive to aging.
