the method's performance was evaluated using data from the  <dig> trec genomics track, producing a mean average precision of  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  relevant documents within the top  <dig> and  <dig> retrieved abstracts, respectively.
while much of the data and results described in these articles are entered and annotated in the various existing biomedical databases, the scientific literature is still the major source of information.
this paper presents quext, a new pubmed-based document retrieval and prioritization tool that, from a given list of genes, searches for the most relevant results from the literature.
the main advantage of the system is to give the user control over the ranking of the results by means of a simple weighting scheme.
advances in biotechnology and in high-throughput methods for gene analysis have contributed to an exponential increase in the number of scientific publications in these fields of study.
by changing these weights, users can modify the ranking of the results in order to focus on documents dealing with a specific concept.
quext follows a concept-oriented query expansion methodology to find documents containing concepts related to the genes in the user input, such as protein and pathway names.
there is, therefore, a growing need for text mining and information retrieval tools to help researchers find the relevant articles for their study.
