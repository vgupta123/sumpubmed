recently, several methods have been presented to predict protein complexes in a protein interaction network.
we evaluate cfa using several protein interaction networks on reference protein complexes in two benchmark data sets , containing  <dig> and  <dig> known complexes respectively.
many real complexes with different connectivity level in protein interaction network can be predicted based on connectivity number.
we propose a more appropriate protein complex prediction method, cfa, that is based on connectivity number on subgraphs.
protein complexes play an important role in cellular mechanisms.
we show that cfa predicts more complexes correctly at a competitive level of precision.
in these methods, a protein complex is predicted as a dense subgraph of protein interactions.
our cfa program and results are freely available from http://www.bioinf.cs.ipm.ir/softwares/cfa/cfa.rar.
however, interactions data are incomplete and a protein complex does not have to be a complete or dense subgraph.
we compare cfa to some existing protein complex prediction methods  in terms of recall and precision.
