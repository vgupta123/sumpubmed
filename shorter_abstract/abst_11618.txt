we further find two single-strand binders .
to date, telomere research in fungi has mainly focused on saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe, despite the fact that both yeasts have degenerated telomeric repeats in contrast to the canonical ttaggg motif found in vertebrates and also several other fungi.
using label-free quantitative proteomics, we here investigate the telosome of neurospora crassa, a fungus with canonical telomeric repeats.
intriguingly, homologs in yeast species with degenerated telomeric repeats are also ttaggg-binding proteins, e.g.
by quantitative label-free interactomics we identify ttaggg-binding proteins in neurospora crassa, suggesting candidates for telomeric factors that are supported by phylogenomic comparison with yeast species.
while a rudimentary core ttaggg-recognition machinery may be conserved across yeast species, our data suggests neurospora as an emerging model organism with unique features.
