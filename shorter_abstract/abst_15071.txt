samples of the testis, epididymis and scrotal skin were collected surgically from  <dig> animals from each group at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> d, and  <dig> d post-treatment, and analysed using real-time pcr.
castration of male cattle has been shown to elicit inflammatory reactions and acute inflammation is initiated and sustained by the participation of cytokines.
sixty continental × beef bulls   <dig>  months; mean weight  <dig> ±   <dig>  kg) were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to one of three treatments : 1) untreated control ; 2) banding castration at  <dig> min ; 3) burdizzo castration at  <dig> min .
burdizzo caused more severe acute inflammatory responses, in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, in the testis and epididymis than banding.
transitory effects were observed in the gene expression of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post treatment.
banding castration caused more inflammatory associated gene expression changes to the epididymis and scrotum than burdizzo.
