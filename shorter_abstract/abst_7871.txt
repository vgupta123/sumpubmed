second, the resulting biclusters are used to index external omics databases—for instance, gene ontology —thus offering a new way of accessing publicly available resources.
the ged analysis problem gets transformed into the exploration of a sequence of lattices enabling the visualization of the hierarchical structure of the biclusters with a certain degree of granularity.
by using different kinds of cost structures to quantify expression we obtain different sequences of hierarchical bi-clusterings for gene under- and over-expression using thresholds.
we illustrate the exploration procedure on a real data example confirming results previously published.
this is often addressed by means of gene set enrichment analysis .
first, we give a proper theoretical background to bi-clustering using lattice theory and provide a set of analysis tools revolving around k-formal concept analysis , a lattice-theoretic unsupervised learning technique for real-valued matrices.
we focus on the adaptation to human cognition of data interpretation and visualization of the output of eda.
gene expression data  analysis poses a great challenge to the scientific community that can be framed into the knowledge discovery in databases  and data mining  paradigm.
we put forward a framework in which ged analysis is understood as an exploratory data analysis  process where we provide support for continuous human interaction with data aiming at improving the step of hypothesis abduction and assessment.
the ability of fca-based bi-clustering methods to index external databases such as go allows us to obtain a quality measure of the biclusters, to observe the evolution of a gene throughout the different biclusters it appears in, to look for relevant biclusters—by observing their genes and what their persistence is—to infer, for instance, hypotheses on their function.
