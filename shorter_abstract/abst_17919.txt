however, some observations point to a completely different scenario.
we have measured the rates of nucleotide divergence and indel fixation of three hox genes, labial , proboscipedia  and abdominal-a , and compared them with those of three genes derived by duplication from hox <dig>  bicoid , zerknüllt  and zerknüllt-related , and  <dig> non-hox genes in sets of orthologous sequences of three species of the genus drosophila.
our results show that the evolutionary rate of hox genes is higher than that of non-hox genes when both amino acid differences and indels are taken into account:  <dig> % of the amino acid sequence is altered in hox genes, versus  <dig> % in non-hox genes and  <dig> % in hox-derived genes.
these results show that hox genes have a higher evolutionary dynamics than other developmental genes, and emphasize the need to take into account indels in addition to nucleotide substitutions in order to accurately estimate evolutionary rates.
hox genes fulfill these criteria and thus, should have a low evolutionary rate.
hox genes are usually highly conserved inside the homeobox, but very variable outside it.
these rates were compared to test the hypothesis that hox genes evolve slowly.
microsatellites scattered along the coding sequence of hox genes explain partially, but not fully, their fast sequence evolution.
