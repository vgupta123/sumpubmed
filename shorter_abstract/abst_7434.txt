in both cases, the certainty values estimated using the subset bootstrap method are all higher than those calculated based upon the standard bootstrap method, suggesting our bootstrap scheme is applicable for the estimation of clustering certainty.
for influenza a h <dig> viruses, ten ha clusters were estimated and the vast majority of sequences could be assigned to a cluster with a certainty of more than  <dig> .
the certainties for clusters, however, varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; such certainty variation is likely attributed to the heterogeneity of sequence data in different clusters.
we formulated a clustering analysis approach with the estimation of certainties and 3d visualization of sequence data.
there remain issues such as how to cluster molecular sequences accurately and in particular how to evaluate the certainty of clustering results.
we analysed  <dig> sets of influenza a ha sequences and the results indicate our approach was applicable for clustering analysis of influenza viral sequences.
we presented a model-based clustering method to analyze molecular sequences, described a subset bootstrap scheme to evaluate a certainty of the clusters, and showed an intuitive way using 3d visualization to examine clusters.
clustering is a common technique used by molecular biologists to group homologous sequences and study evolution.
