our results provide a foundation for comparative gene expression studies between wt and precocious trifoliate orange.
additionally, a number of candidate genes required for the early flowering process of precocious trifoliate orange were identified.
these results provide new insight into the molecular processes regulating flowering time in citrus.
comparative transcript profiling of spring shoots after self-pruning was performed on a spontaneously early flowering trifoliate orange mutant  with a short juvenile phase and the wild-type  tree by using massively parallel signature sequencing .
after several years in the juvenile phase, trees undergo flowering transition to become mature  trees.
however, relatively little is known about the molecular processes regulating flowering transition in woody plants compared with herbaceous plants.
interpretation of the mpss signatures revealed that the total number of transcribed genes in the mt  was larger than in the wt , suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurs in the mt.
