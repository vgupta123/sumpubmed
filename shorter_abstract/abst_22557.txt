the equations with two variables are better to use because they are effective and will be an alternative method to estimate body composition in the clinical routine.
the present study was done to evaluate the influence of weight loss on biometry , bioimpedance analysis  and ultrasonography  in cats, proposing equations to estimate fat  and lean  body mass, as compared to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry  as the referenced method.
for this were used  <dig> gonadectomized obese cats  in a weight loss program.
dxa, bio, bia and us were performed in the obese state , after 10% of weight loss  and after 20% of weight loss .
for estimated lean mass the equations using body weight associated with biometrics measures can be proposed.
for estimated fat mass the equations using body weight associated with bioimpedance analysis can be proposed.
few equations have been developed in veterinary medicine compared to human medicine to predict body composition.
stepwise regression was used to analyze the relationship between the dependent variables  determined by dxa and the independent variables obtained by bio, bia and us.
the independent variables determined by bio, bia and us that best correlated  with the dependent variables  were bw , tc , pc , r  and sflt .
