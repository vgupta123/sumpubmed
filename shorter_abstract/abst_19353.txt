the principal component analysis is first employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space to  <dig>  then, the resulting 32-dimensional feature vectors are fed into a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, called intimate sorting, to predict gpcrs at five levels.
jackknife tests on this training dataset show that the overall accuracies of pca-gpcr at five levels  can achieve up to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.
we propose a new method called pca-gpcr, to predict gpcrs using a comprehensive set of  <dig> sequence-derived features.
the comprehensive set of  <dig> features is believed to be capable of capturing information about amino acid composition, sequence order as well as various physicochemical properties of proteins.
the  <dig> d structures of gpcrs are largely unavailable; however, a large number of gpcr primary sequences are known.
to facilitate the identification and characterization of novel receptors, it is therefore very valuable to develop a computational method to accurately predict gpcrs from the protein primary sequences.
g-protein-coupled receptors  play a key role in diverse physiological processes and are the targets of almost two-thirds of the marketed drugs.
