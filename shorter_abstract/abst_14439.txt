this problem has been recognized for some time, and earlier methods of compensation have attempted to identify probes affected by genome variants using statistical models.
however, most model organisms and all humans have genomes that deviate from their reference.
these methods may require replicate microarray measurement of gene expression in the relevant tissue in inbred parental samples, which are not always available in model organisms and are never available in humans.
genetic experiments comparing individuals bearing different population-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that intersect microarray probes are therefore subject to systemic bias, as the reduction in binding efficiency due to a technical artifact is confounded with genetic differences between parental strains.
gene expression microarrays measure the levels of messenger ribonucleic acid  in a sample using probe sequences that hybridize with transcribed regions.
i demonstrate how use of equalizer on experiments mapping germline influence on gene expression in a genetic cross between two divergent mouse species and in human samples significantly reduces probe hybridization-induced bias, reducing false positive and false negative findings.
the equalizer package reduces probe hybridization bias from experiments performed on the affymetrix microarray platform, allowing accurate assessment of germline influence on gene expression.
