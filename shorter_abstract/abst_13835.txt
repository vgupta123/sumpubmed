an analysis of the performance of norma-gene compared to reference gene normalization on artificially generated data-sets showed that the norma-gene normalization yielded more precise results under a large range of parameters tested.
norma-gene does not require the identification and validation of reference genes allowing researchers to focus their efforts on studying target genes of biological relevance.
here we present the norma-gene algorithm that is applicable to all biological and biomedical qpcr studies, especially those that are based on a limited number of assayed genes.
the method is based on a data-driven normalization and is useful for as little as five target genes comprising the data-set.
normalization of target gene expression, measured by real-time quantitative pcr , is a requirement for reducing experimental bias and thereby improving data quality.
furthermore, when tested on three very different real qpcr data-sets norma-gene was shown to be best at reducing variance due to experimental bias in all three data-sets compared to normalization based on the use of reference gene.
the currently used normalization approach is based on using one or more reference genes.
