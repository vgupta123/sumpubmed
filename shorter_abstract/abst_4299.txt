we presume that translational control is an essential process in the control of adipogenesis, especially in the first hours after hormonal stimulation.
changes in relative abundance in unbound and polysomal mrna pools were calculated to detect putative changes in translational activity.
we conclude that a moderate reorganisation of the functionality of the ribosomal machinery and translational activity are very important steps for growth and gene expression control in the initial phase of adipogenesis.
we identified  <dig> genes that shifted towards the polysomal fraction  and  <dig> genes that shifted towards free mrna fraction .
up-regulated genes comprise factors that are nucleic acid binding , form part of ribosomes , act on the regulation of translation  or transcription .
3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes were cultured to confluency and adipogenesis was induced by standard protocols using a hormonal cocktail.
mrnas attached to ribosomes  were separated from unbound mrnas by velocity sedimentation.
cells were harvested before and  <dig> hours after hormonal induction.
pools of polysomal and unbound mrna fractions were analyzed by microarray analysis.
changes of expression levels of selected genes were verified by qpcr and western blotting.
