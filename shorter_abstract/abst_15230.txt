in patient tissue microarrays and cell lines, sclc can be separated into syk-positive and -negative.
we derived an sclc-specific classifier from weighted gene co-expression network analysis  of a lung cancer dataset.
the classifier, termed sclc-specific hub network , robustly separates sclc from other lung cancer types across multiple datasets and multiple platforms, including rna-seq and shotgun proteomics.
oncogenic mechanisms in small-cell lung cancer remain poorly understood leaving this tumor with the worst prognosis among all lung cancers.
unlike other cancer types, sequencing genomic approaches have been of limited success in small-cell lung cancer, i.e., no mutated oncogenes with potential driver characteristics have emerged, as it is the case for activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor in non-small-cell lung cancer.
nonetheless, additional genomic approaches are warranted, due to the increasing availability of suitable small-cell lung cancer datasets.

in summary, wgcna represents an alternative strategy to large scale sequencing for the identification of potential oncogenic drivers, based on a systems view of signaling networks.
the classifier was also conserved in sclc cell lines.
syk sirna decreases proliferation rate and increases cell death of syk-positive sclc cell lines, suggesting a role for syk as an oncogenic driver in a subset of sclc.
sshn is enriched for co-expressed signaling network hubs strongly associated with the sclc phenotype.
our wgcna analysis identifies syk both as a candidate biomarker to stratify sclc patients and as a potential therapeutic target.
twenty of these hubs are actionable kinases with oncogenic potential, among which spleen tyrosine kinase  exhibits one of the highest overall statistical associations to sclc.
