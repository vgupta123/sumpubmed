our results show that the syringeal skeleton is optimized for low weight driven by physiological constraints on song production.
the birdsong system has emerged as a widely used experimental animal model for understanding the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for vocal production learning.
in addition, we identify a cartilaginous structure suited to play a crucial role in the uncoupling of sound frequency and amplitude control, which permits a novel explanation of the evolutionary success of songbirds.
first and foremost, we lack a detailed understanding of syringeal morphology.
the present refinement of muscle organization and identity elucidates how apposed muscles actuate different syringeal elements.
like human infants, songbirds learn their species-specific vocalizations through imitation learning.
our dataset allows for more precise predictions about muscle co-activation and synergies and has important implications for muscle activity and stimulation experiments.
to fill this gap we combined non-invasive  and invasive techniques  to construct the annotated high-resolution three-dimensional dataset, or morphome, of the zebra finch  syrinx.
we identified and annotated syringeal cartilage, bone and musculature in situ in unprecedented detail.
we also demonstrate how the syrinx can be stabilized during song to reduce mechanical noise and, as such, enhance repetitive execution of stereotypic motor patterns.
