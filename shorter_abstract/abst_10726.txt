identifying pockets on protein surfaces is of great importance for many structure-based drug design applications and protein-ligand docking algorithms.
ligsitecsc performs slightly better than the other tools and achieves a success rate of 71% and 75%, respectively.
ligsitecsc is based on the notion of surface-solvent-surface events and the degree of conservation of the involved surface residues.
over the last ten years, many geometric methods for the prediction of ligand-binding sites have been developed.
the use of the connolly surface leads to slight improvements, the prediction re-ranking by conservation to significant improvements of the binding site predictions.
