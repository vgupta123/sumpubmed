single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant source of genetic variation among individuals of a species.
this snp-array will be extended thanks to recent sequencing effort using new generation sequencing technologies and will include snps from comparative orthologous sequences that were identified in the present study, providing a wider collection of anchor points for comparative genomics among the conifers.
based on  <dig> markers segregating in both pedigrees, we were able to generate a consensus map comprising  <dig> snps from  <dig> different loci.
our results show that the goldengate assay can be used successfully for high-throughput snp genotyping in maritime pine, a conifer species that has a genome seven times the size of the human genome.
we designed a custom goldengate assay for  <dig>  snps detected through the resequencing of gene fragments  and from sanger-derived expressed sequenced tags assembled into a unigene set .
in this paper, we evaluated the potential of highly-multiplexed snp genotyping for genetic mapping in maritime pine , the main conifer used for commercial plantation in southwestern europe.
the success rate of the assay was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for in silico and in vitro snps, respectively.
