overall, an accurate result in prediction and differentiation of date palm tree cultivars was achieved with average prediction in tenfold cross-validation is  <dig> % and reached 100% in one of the best ann.
the aim of this study is to differentiate date palm tree varieties by analysing leaflet cross sections with technical/optical methods and artificial neural networks .
fluorescence microscopy images of leaflet cross sections have been taken from a set of five date palm tree cultivars .
