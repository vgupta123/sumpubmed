fungal biomass was reduced in spikes inoculated with the fgdon- strain as compared with the wild-type strain.
our results show that bd exhibits defense hallmarks similar to those already identified in cereal crops.
histological analysis of the interaction of the bd <dig> ecotype with both fg strains showed extensive fungal tissue colonization with the fgdon+ strain while the florets infected with the fgdon- strain exhibited a reduced hyphal extension and cell death on palea and lemma tissues.
in particular, our metabolite profiling analysis showed that tryptophan-derived metabolites, tryptamine, serotonin, coumaroyl-serotonin and feruloyl-serotonin, are more induced upon infection by the fgdon+ strain than by the fgdon- strain.
don has been described as a virulence factor enabling efficient colonization of spikes by the fungus in wheat, but its precise role during the infection process is still elusive.
together with its amenability in laboratory conditions, this makes bd a very good model to study cereal resistance mechanisms towards the major disease fhb.
the transcriptional analysis showed that jasmonate and ethylene-signalling pathways are induced upon infection, together with genes encoding putative detoxification and transport proteins, antioxidant functions as well as secondary metabolite pathways.
while the fungus uses don as a virulence factor, the host plant preferentially induces detoxification and the phenylpropanoid and phenolamide pathways as resistance mechanisms.
this disease both reduces yields and causes quality losses due to the production of deoxynivalenol , the major type b trichothecene mycotoxin.
here, a functional genomics approach was performed in order to characterize the responses of bd to fg infection using a global transcriptional and metabolomic profiling of b. distachyon plants infected by two strains of f. graminearum: a wild-type strain producing don  and a mutant strain impaired in the production of the mycotoxin .
fusarium head blight  caused primarily by fusarium graminearum  is one of the major diseases of small-grain cereals including bread wheat.
