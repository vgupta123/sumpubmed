our novel comparative genomics approach enriches existing t. aestivum gene annotations based on cliques of predicted 1-to- <dig> orthologs, phylogenetic relationships and existing gene ontologies from  <dig> other plant species.
cliques of predicted 1-to- <dig> orthologs were identified and an annotation enrichment model was defined based on existing gene-go term associations and phylogenetic relationships among wheat and  <dig> other plant species.
overall, based on clique size equal or larger than  <dig>  our model enriched the existing gene-go term associations for  <dig>   wheat genes, of which  <dig>  had no previous annotation.
dna and protein sequences and corresponding annotations for t. aestivum and  <dig> other plant species were collected from ensembl plants release  <dig> and curated.
a total of  <dig> cliques of size  <dig> were identified, which represent putative functionally equivalent genes and proteins in the  <dig> plant species.
previous experimental studies carried out on model plant organisms such as a. thaliana and o. sativa provide a plethora of gene annotations that can be used as potential starting points for wheat gene annotations, proven that solid cross-species gene-to-gene and protein-to-protein correspondences are provided.
while the gargantuan multi-nation effort of sequencing t. aestivum gets close to completion, the annotation process for the vast number of wheat genes and proteins is in its infancy.
eighty-five new and more specific go terms were associated with wheat genes in the  <dig> cliques of size  <dig>  which represent a 65% increase compared with the previously  <dig> known go terms.
