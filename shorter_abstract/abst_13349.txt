other amino acid changes are specific for the asian/american, asian and american strains.
therefore, an understanding of the relationship between virus variants with altered amino acids and high pathogenicity will provide more information on the molecular epidemiology of den.
we suggested that this amino acid change may be used as a signature for isolates arising in the caribbean islands and pertaining to the asian/american genotype.
we found that isoleucine was replaced by valine at residue  <dig> of protein c in the isolates from these 2005– <dig> outbreaks and in those from the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks in the caribbean islands.
interestingly, denv- <dig> and denv- <dig> were the only serotypes related to dhf cases.
in contrast, denv- <dig> and denv- <dig> were poorly represented according to epidemiological data reported in mexico.
phylogenetic analysis showed that denv- <dig> isolates belonged to the asian/american genotype.
accordingly, knowledge of the denv serotypes and genotypes circulating in the latest den outbreaks around the world, including mexico, will contribute to understanding den infections.
in addition, the asian/american genotype was divided into two clusters, one containing the isolates from  <dig> and the other the isolates from 2005– <dig> with high bootstrap support of 94%.
denv- <dig> was the predominant serotype in the df and dhf outbreak from  <dig> to  <dig> in oaxaca state as well as in the  <dig> outbreak in veracruz state, with the asian/american genotype prevalent in both states.
