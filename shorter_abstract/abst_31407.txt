elevated autophagy, induced by amino acid starvation, rapamycin, or overexpression of ulk <dig> caused aggregation of the eres, a region of the er dedicated for the budding of copii vesicles.
recently, ulk <dig> has been demonstrated to phosphorylate sec <dig> and affects the transport of serotonin transporter at the er exit sites , but whether ulk <dig> may affect the transport of other cargo proteins and general secretion has not been fully addressed.
ulk <dig> phosphorylates a number of target proteins and regulates many cellular processes including the early secretory pathway.
transport of cargo proteins was also inhibited under these conditions and was retained at the eres.
