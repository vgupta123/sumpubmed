furthermore, various assays such as native gel electrophoresis, surface plasmon resonance , size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering , and small-angle x-ray scattering  measurements, were performed to elucidate the structural and functional role of the internal disulfide bond in e. coli pmrd.
polymyxin b resistance protein d  plays a key role in the polymyxin b-resistance pathway, as it is the signaling protein that can act as a specific connecter between pmra/pmrb and phop/phoq.
the findings help explain the different protective mechanism of e. coli compared to other gram-negative bacteria.
the structural characteristics of e. coli pmrd were clearly identified via diverse techniques.
the x-ray crystal structure of e. coli pmrd was determined at a  <dig>  Å resolution, revealing novel information such as the unambiguous secondary structures of the protein and the presence of a disulfide bond.
we conducted structural analysis to characterize escherichia coli  pmrd, which exhibits different features compared with pmrd in other bacteria.
