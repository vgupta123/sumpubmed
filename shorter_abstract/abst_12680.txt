we showed a high representation of veillonella in more than a quarter of the infants and being able to persistently colonize premature gut.
coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly the staphylococcus epidermidis, was found in all the infants during the study period and was the most represented  from the first days of life.
we report here an extensive longitudinal study of gut colonization in very preterm infants.
results of high-throughput studies validate and renew the interest in approaches with lower resolution such as pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis  for the follow-up of dominant microbiota dynamics.
later enterobacteriaceae and the genus clostridium appeared and were found in  <dig>  and  <dig> infants , respectively.
combining comparison with a diversity ladder and sequencing allowed affiliation of  <dig> species-level operational taxonomic units  as well as semi-quantitative estimation of operational taxonomic units .
despite low resolution, pcr-ttge remains complementary to high-throughput sequencing-based approaches because it allows the follow-up of dominant bacteria in gut microbiota in a large longitudinal cohorts of preterm neonates.
the very-preterm infant gut microbiota is increasingly explored due to its probable role in the development of life threatening diseases.
we described the development of pre-term gut microbiota that should be now replaced regarding the functional role of major otus.
enterococci, present in 60% of the infants were early, highly represented and persistent colonizers of the premature gut.
the genera anaerococcus, aquabacterium, bacillus, bifidobacterium, corynebacterium, micrococcus, oceanobacillus, propionibacterium, pseudomonas, rothia, sarcina, sneathia and streptococcus were observed as transient or persistent colonizers, each genus being found in a minority of infants.
