phylogenetic analysis revealed two duplication and divergence events subdividing this family into three clades.
combined phylogenetic and dna methylation analysis allows for the identification of novel regions of variable methylation.
this approach increases the number of known metastable epialleles in the mouse, which can serve as biomarkers for environmental modifications to the epigenome.
select retrotransposons in the long terminal repeat  class exhibit interindividual variation in dna methylation that is altered by developmental environmental exposures.
yet, neither the full extent of variability at these “metastable epialleles,” nor the phylogenetic relationship underlying variable elements is well understood.
the murine metastable epialleles, avy and cabpiap, result from independent insertions of an intracisternal a particle  mobile element, and exhibit remarkably similar sequence identity .
to characterize interindividual variation across clades, liver dna from  <dig> isogenic mice was subjected to combined bisulfite and restriction analysis  for  <dig> separate ltr transposons .
within each mouse, average methylation across all ltrs was not significantly different .
