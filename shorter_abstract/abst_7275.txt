the natriuretic peptide  found is the first np for any asian elapid, and distantly related to australian elapid nps.
here, we have sequenced  <dig> expressed sequence tags  from the venom gland of a b. flaviceps.
the main venom protein families identified were three-finger toxins , kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors , phospholipase a <dig> , natriuretic peptide , crisps, and c-type lectin.
although the venoms of most species of the snake genus bungarus have been well characterized, a detailed compositional analysis of b. flaviceps is currently lacking.
our study identifies several unique toxins in b. flaviceps venom, which may help in understanding the evolution of venom toxins and the pathophysiological symptoms induced after envenomation.
we found three groups of kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors ; one group was comparable to the classical spis and the other two groups to chain b of Î²-bungarotoxins  based on sequence identity.
