the denoising is performed with the classical sureshrink method and the detection of transcriptionally active regions is based on the computation of the continuous wavelet transform .
the challenge was to identify those transcripts whose expression decreases in the absence of sigma b.
as a proof-of-principle, we applied the zcl algorithm to the analysis of the custom tiling microarray hybridization results of a s. aureus mutant deficient in the sigma b transcription factor.
the proposed method archives the best performance in terms of positive predictive value  while its sensitivity is similar to the other algorithms used for the comparison.
the algorithm described has been applied to the public saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset and it has been compared with two well-known algorithms: pseudo-median sliding window  and the structural change model .
high-density oligonucleotide microarray is an appropriate technology for genomic analysis, and is particulary useful in the generation of transcriptional maps, chip-on-chip studies and re-sequencing of the genome.transcriptome analysis of tiling microarray data facilitates the discovery of novel transcripts and the assessment of differential expression in diverse experimental conditions.
finally, the quantification and differential expression analysis of s. aureus dataset have demonstrated the valuable utility of this novel device to the biological analysis of the s. aureus transcriptome.
the computation time needed to process the transcriptional signals is low as compared with model-based methods and in the same range to those based on the use of filters.
