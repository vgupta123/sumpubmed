environmental conditions were changed in partial random order for all locations, so each horse was tested in its familiar box stall and stocks, in the morning and evening and at warm and cold ambient temperatures.
skin temperatures were significantly different during warm and cold ambient temperatures at all three locations, but remained constant over repeated stimulation.
an obvious response to stimulation before reaching cut-out temperature could be detected most frequently at n and w in boxes during warm ambient temperatures.
the outcome of thermal threshold testing depended on ambient temperature, stimulation site and environment.
best results with the wtt <dig> in horses were obtained at the nostrils or withers in a familiar environment at warm ambient temperatures.
the aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of contact heat thermal stimulation in horses at different body sites and under different environmental conditions and different test situations.
skin temperature and reaction temperature  at each location were measured and percent thermal excursion / was calculated.
five warm-blood horses were equipped with the thermal probe located on the skin of nostril , withers  or coronary band .
the most frequent type of reaction to thermal stimulation at the nostril was headshaking , skin twitching at the withers  and hoof withdrawal at the coronary band .
the stimulation sites were examined for the occurrence of possible skin lesions.
