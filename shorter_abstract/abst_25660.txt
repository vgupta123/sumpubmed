these may be manifested in genetic and phenotypic differences such as a diverse immunogenetic repertoire in species from tropical latitudes that have greater and/or different parasite burdens than more temperate species.
when populations evolve under disparate environmental conditions, they experience different selective pressures that shape patterns of sequence evolution and gene expression.
our data indicate there are significant differences in the expression of genes among the spleen transcriptomes of these species and that a number of these differentially expressed genes do not show the same pattern of differential expression in another tissue type.
gene ontology terms including “immune response” were associated with  <dig>  of the  <dig> upregulated genes.

this points to the possibility of expression differences between these species specific to the spleen transcriptome.
to test this idea, we compared the transcriptomes of one tropical species  and two species from temperate latitudes  from the heteromyidae.
we identified  <dig> genes that were upregulated in h. desmarestianus  and  <dig>  that were downregulated.
we found preliminary evidence for positive selection on three genes  along the h. desmarestianus lineage.
we identified  <dig>  contigs and annotated  <dig>  of these, identifying immune genes associated with interleukins, cytokines, and the production of mast cells.
we did so in a search for positive selection on sequences and/or differential expression, while controlling for phylogenetic history in our choice of species.
