up-regulation of genes related to two component signal transduction systems and a denitrification enzyme pathway suggest that the b. pseudomallei high biofilm producer is able to sense the surrounding environmental conditions and regulate the production of extracellular polymeric substance matrix, a hallmark of microbial biofilm formation.
however, the underlying biology of b. pseudomallei biofilm development remains unresolved.
we utilised rna-sequencing to identify genes that contribute to b. pseudomallei biofilm phenotype.
transcriptome analysis of a high and low biofilm producer identified  <dig> differentially regulated genes, implying that expression of ~ <dig>  % of the total b. pseudomallei gene content was altered during biofilm formation.
the transcriptome profile described here provides the first comprehensive view of genes that contribute to the biofilm phenotype in b. pseudomallei.
chronic bacterial infections occur as a result of the infecting pathogen’s ability to live within a biofilm, hence escaping the detrimental effects of antibiotics and the immune defense system.
genes involved in surface-associated motility, surface composition and cell wall biogenesis were over-expressed and probably play a role in the initial attachment of biofilms.
burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative facultative pathogen, is distinctive in its ability to survive within phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, to persist in vivo for many years and subsequently leading to relapse as well as the development of chronic disease.
