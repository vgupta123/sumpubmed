the strategy developed in this work for the sustainable production of bp <dig> peptide using rice seeds as biofactories represents a promising system for future production of peptides for plant protection and possibly in other fields.
here we report the production and recovery of a bioactive bp <dig> peptide using rice seeds as biofactories.
the bp <dig> peptide accumulated in the seed endosperm and was easily recovered from rice seeds using a simple procedure with a yield of 21 μg/g.
the transgene was stably inherited for at least three generations, and peptide accumulation remained stable during long term storage of transgenic seeds.
bp <dig> peptide is a synthetic bp100-magainin derivative possessing strong inhibitory activity against plant pathogenic bacteria, offering a great potential for future applications in plant protection and other fields.
among the three endosperm-specific rice promoters , best results were obtained when using the globulin  <dig> promoter.
the gene was efficiently expressed in transgenic rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter.
a synthetic gene encoding the bp <dig> peptide was prepared and introduced in rice plants.
