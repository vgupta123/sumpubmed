allium cepa is an excellent plant and a useful biomarker for environmental monitoring.
we suggest that variations in nucleoli and the alterations of antioxidant enzyme activities, mda and soluble protein contents in allium cepa can serve as useful biomarkers, which can provide valuable information for monitoring and forecasting effects of exposure to al in real scenarios conditions.
limited information is available about the effects of al on nucleoli, antioxidant enzyme system, contents of mda and soluble protein in a. cepa.
the results showed that the root growth exposed to  <dig> μm al was inhibited significantly.
increased al concentration causes reduction of mitotic activity, induction of nucleolar alteration, increase of the production of ros and alteration of several antioxidant enzyme activities in plant cells.
among the antioxidant enzymes sod and pod appear to play a key role in the antioxidant defense mechanism under al toxicity condition.
data from mda concentration show that al indirectly produces superoxide radicals, resulting in increased lipid peroxidative products and oxidative stress.
therefore, we carried out the investigation in order to better understand the effects of al on the growth, nucleoli in root tip cells and selected physiological and biochemical characters.
<dig> μm al could induce some particles of argyrophilic proteins scattered in the nuclei and extruded from the nucleoli into the cytoplasm.
the soluble protein content in leaves treated with  <dig> μm al was high significantly  at 6th day and increased with prolonging the treatment time.
at  <dig> μm al the content of mda in leaves was high significantly  at 9th day and in roots increased  with prolonging the treatment time during 6- <dig> days.
