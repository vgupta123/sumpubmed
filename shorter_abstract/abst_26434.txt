ectopic activation of beta-catenin-dependent wnt signaling with lithium chloride in the wound resulted in epithelial cysts and occasional rudimentary hair follicle structures within the epidermis.
in contrast, forced expression of wnt-5a in the deeper wound induced changes in the interfollicular epithelium mimicking regeneration, including formation of epithelia-lined cysts in the wound dermis, rudimentary hair follicles and sebaceous glands, without formation of tumors.
these findings suggest that adult interfollicular epithelium is capable of responding to wnt morphogenic signals necessary for restoring epithelial tissue patterning in the skin during wound repair.
cutaneous wound repair in adult mammals does not regenerate the original epithelial architecture and results in altered skin function.
