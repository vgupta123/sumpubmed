we compare the molecular variation of samples collected in oscoda county, michigan across three time periods: 1903– <dig>  1929– <dig> and 2008– <dig>
subsequent conservation management has allowed the species to recover to over  <dig> males by  <dig>  in this study, we directly examine the impact that low population sizes have had on genetic variation in kirtland’s warblers.
in a hierarchical rarified sample of  <dig> genes and one time period, allelic richness was highest in 1903– <dig> sample , followed by the 1929– <dig> sample , and was lowest in the 2008– <dig> sample .
