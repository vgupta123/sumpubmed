auxiliary splicing sequences play an important role in ensuring accurate and efficient splicing by promoting or repressing recognition of authentic splice sites.
increased evolutionary conservation for ises/isss within intronic flanks and effect of modulation of predicted elements on splicing suggest functional significance of found elements in splicing regulation.
we used orthologous exons extracted from the university of california santa cruz multiple genome alignments of human and  <dig> tetrapoda organisms to predict candidate enhancers and silencers that have reproducible and statistically significant bias towards annotated exonic boundaries.
predicted intronic motifs flanking 3' and 5' splice sites had higher evolutionary conservation than other sequences within intronic flanks and the intronic enhancers were markedly differed between 3' and 5' intronic flanks.
