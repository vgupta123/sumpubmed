however, the mammalia are a diverse group in terms of mating habits, population sizes and germ line generation times.
reproductive proteins are central to the continuation of all mammalian species.
we have examined the selective pressures at work on a number of novel reproductive proteins across a wide variety of mammalia.
we show that selective pressures on reproductive proteins are highly varied.
this work has highlighted the widespread rate heterogeneity in mutational rates across the mammalia and specifically has shown that the evolution of reproductive proteins is highly varied depending on the species and interacting partners.
our analysis of sp <dig> and col1a <dig> are entirely novel and the results show positively selected sites present in each gene.
of the  <dig> genes analyzed in detail, all contain signatures of positive selection either across specific sites or in specific lineages or a combination of both.
positive selection has been demonstrated in many of these proteins with particular focus on primate lineages.
our findings for the col1a <dig> gene are suggestive of a link between positive selection and severe disease type.
we have shown that positive selection and disease are closely linked in the col1a <dig> gene.
our in silico analyses show positively selected sites are occurring near catalytically important regions suggesting selective pressure to maximize efficient fertilization.
