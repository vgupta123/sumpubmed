mutations in an  <dig> bp "hot spot" region of the rpob of m. tuberculosis lead to different levels of resistance to rifampin.
in this study eight different mutations identified in an  <dig> bp section of a "hot spot" region of the rpob gene of rmp resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains were evaluated in respect to drug resistance.
some mutations in this "hot spot" region of rpob require a specific genetic background for the host strain to develop resistance to rifampin.
gene rpob carrying mutations in codon  <dig>  introduced into an m. tuberculosis laboratory strain did not cause resistance to rifampin, however the same gene introduced into two different clinical strains did, with the level of resistance depending on the host strain.
tubercle bacilli achieve resistance to rifampin by accumulation of mutations in a short- <dig> bp region of the rpob gene.
among many mutations identified in the rpob gene, few were verified by molecular genetic methods as responsible for resistance to rifampin .
it was found that: mutations in positions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  result in high level resistance to rifampin; mutations in positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or a double mutation in codons  <dig>  and  <dig>  relate to low level of resistance.
