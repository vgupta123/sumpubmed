alongside behaviour modification programmes, a range of psychopharmacological agents may be recommended to treat such problems, but few are licensed for use in dogs and the onset of action of some can be delayed.

twenty dogs were enrolled into the study, attended a behaviour consultation and underwent routine laboratory evaluation.
there was a significant reduction in negative activation  with  <dig> % of owners opting to continue imepitoin at their own expense after completion of the study.
this study provides initial evidence indicating the potential value of imepitoin  alongside appropriate behaviour modification for the rapid alleviation of signs of fear and anxiety in dogs.
the low affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist imepitoin  is licensed for treating canine epilepsy, has a fast onset of action in dogs and has demonstrated anxiolytic properties in rodent models.
a positive and negative activation scale  of temperament was also completed by owners during baseline and at the end of the study.
treatment with imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme resulted in owner reported improvement with reduced awg and reduced awr for anxiety across a range of social and non-social eliciting contexts including noise sensitivities.
average weekly reaction scores  for each type of eliciting context was used as a secondary outcome.
the primary outcome measure was average weekly global scores  from the owner diaries.
progress was monitored via owner report through daily diary entries and telephone follow-up every two weeks.
further research with a larger subject population and a placebo control would be useful to confirm the apparent efficacy reported here.
