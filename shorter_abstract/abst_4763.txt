our previous studies have demonstrated that epidermal fatty acid binding protein , widely expressed in immune cells, in particular in dendritic cells  and t lymphocytes, fuels the overactive immune responses in the mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .
in the present study, we conducted an intensive computational docking analysis to identify novel e-fabp inhibitors for regulation of immune cell functions and for treatment of eae.
most importantly, mice treated with this newly identified compound exhibited reduced clinical symptoms of eae in mouse models.
multiple sclerosis  is an autoimmune disease in which dysregulated immune cells attack myelin in the central nervous system , leading to irreversible neuronal degeneration.
