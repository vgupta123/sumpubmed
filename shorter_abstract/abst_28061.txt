this study employs a comparative genomics approach to identify analogous and contrasting gene expression patterns between rice and barley.
there were no major conserved expression patterns between the two species in response to salt stress.
this apparent lack of analogous transcriptional programs in response to salt stress is further highlighted through close examination of genes associated with root growth and development.
these results demonstrate that, at transcriptome level, rice is strikingly different compared to the more closely related barley and wheat.
the analysis provides support for the hypothesis that conservation of transcriptional signatures in response to environmental cues depends on the genetic similarity among the genotypes within a species, and on the phylogenetic distance between the species.
a hierarchical clustering approach identified several interesting expression trajectories among rice and barley genotypes.
rice and barley are both members of poaceae  but have a marked difference in salt tolerance.
