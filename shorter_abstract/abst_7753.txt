moreover, rectangular substitution score matrices and their associated statistical parameters can have applications in any study involving an alphabet reduction.
first, we show that an optimal neighborhood indexing combining an alphabet reduction and a longer neighborhood leads to a reduction of 35% of memory involved into the process, without sacrificing the quality of results nor the computational time.
second, our approach led us to develop a new kind of substitution score matrices and their associated e-value parameters.
in the case of protein similarity search, we propose to decrease the index size by reducing the amino acid alphabet.
we propose a practical index size reduction of the neighborhood data, that does not negatively affect the performance of large-scale search in protein sequences.
in contrast to usual matrices, these matrices are rectangular since they compare amino acid groups from different alphabets.
