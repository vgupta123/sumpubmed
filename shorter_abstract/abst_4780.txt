most cellular proteins function as part of stable protein complexes.
our results demonstrate that cotranslational protein-mrna associations can be used to identify new components of protein complexes.
we found that the fission yeast exo <dig> protein, which encodes an exonuclease of the xrn <dig> family, coimmunoprecipitates with the eti <dig> mrna, which codes for a protein of unknown function and uninformative sequence.
here we hypothesise that these cotranslational protein-mrna associations can be used to predict protein-protein interactions.
we recently showed that around 38% of proteins associate with mrnas that encode interacting proteins, reflecting the cotranslational formation of the complex between the bait protein and the nascent peptides encoded by the interacting mrnas.
