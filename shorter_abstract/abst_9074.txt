the assay resulted in identification of at least  <dig> different allelic profiles or subpopulations among 91â€‰f. noatunensis isolates from farmed cod in norway.
in this study, a simplified multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeat analysis  targeting five highly polymorphic variable number of tandem repeat  loci in a single multiplex pcr was developed to rapidly discriminate between outbreak strains.
mlva displayed greater discriminatory power than pulse-field gel electrophoresis .
the vntr loci appear relatively stable, with isolates originating from individual outbreaks showing identical mlva profiles following repeated passage.
the mlva method presented here is robust, easy to perform and provides a good alternative to other typing systems for f. noatunensis subsp.
noatunensis, remains a serious threat to atlantic cod  farming in norway and potentially in other countries.
