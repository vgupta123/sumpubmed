taken together, these data show that gα <dig> is the dominant gαq family member detected.
we utilized rt-pcr, immunocytochemistry and single-cell gene expression profiling to examine the expression of the gαq family  in mouse taste buds.
further, expression of gα <dig> mrna is limited to type ii/receptor cells in taste buds.
this staining persists in gαq knockout mice and immunostaining with a gα11-specific antiserum shows no immunoreactivity in taste buds.
thus, sweet taste transduction may rely on different downstream transduction elements in posterior and anterior taste fields.
immunocytochemistry on vallate papillae using a broad gαq family antiserum reveals specific staining only in type ii taste cells .
single cell gene expression profiling confirms a tight correlation between the expression of gα <dig> and both t1r <dig> and t1r <dig>  the receptor combination that forms sweet taste receptors.
gα <dig> is co-expressed with the sweet taste receptor in posterior tongue, although not in anterior tongue.
"type ii"/receptor cells express g protein-coupled receptors  for sweet, umami  or bitter , as well as the proteins for downstream signalling cascades.
