in the case of multiple genes for ef-tu, the gene copies are nearly identical; in the case of multiple ef-g genes, the gene copies have been considerably diverged.
proteins of the cysn/nodq subfamily have acquired functions in sulfur metabolism and production of signaling molecules.
translational gtpases are a family of proteins in which gtpase activity is stimulated by the large ribosomal subunit.
we found all the genes for translational gtpases in  <dig> fully sequenced bacterial genomes.
analysis of the results shows that three translational gtpases, the translation factors ef-tu, ef-g and if <dig>  are present in all organisms examined.
surprisingly, some of the well studied translational gtpases are present only in a very small number of bacteria.
this defines the set of translational gtpases essential for basic cell functions.
the genes coding for cysn/nodq proteins were found in  <dig> genomes.
the specialized translation factor for selenocysteine incorporation – selb – was found in only  <dig> organisms.
the translation regulator, typa, is also present in most of the organisms examined, being absent only from bacteria with small genomes.
the translation termination factor rf <dig> is absent from many groups of bacteria with both small and large genomes.
