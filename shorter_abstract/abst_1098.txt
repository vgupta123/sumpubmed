we computed network topological properties and ascertained that this newly constructed immune network is densely connected, possesses hubs, exhibits high modularity, and displays hallmarks of a “real” biological network.
detailed analyses of these functional modules reveal new insight into the topological properties of immune co-expression networks and a comprehensive understanding of multifaceted plant defense responses.
we employed both linear and non-linear models to generate arabidopsis immune co-expression regulatory  network.

we have generated a large-scale immune co-expression network using a comprehensive set of arabidopsis thaliana  transcriptomic data, which consists of a wide spectrum of immune responses to pathogens or pathogen-mimicking stimuli treatments.
the combinatorial and cooperative action of multiple transcription factors defines a regulatory network that enables plant cells to respond to distinct biological signals.
in light of known and newly discovered cis-regulatory elements, we evaluated biological significance of two key immune-related functional modules and proposed mechanism to explain how large sets of diverse go genes coherently function to mount effective immune responses.
gene ontology  enrichment analyses provided insight into the key biological processes involved in determining finely tuned immune responses.
