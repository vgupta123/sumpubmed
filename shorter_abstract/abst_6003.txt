the ability of thirty-one arabidopsis genes encoding important components of sa and ja synthesis and signaling in conferring resistance to soybean cyst nematode  are investigated.
we demonstrate that overexpression of three of thirty-one arabidoposis genes in transgenic soybean roots of composite plants decreased the number of cysts formed by scn to less than 50% of those found on control roots, namely atnpr <dig>  attga <dig> , and atpr- <dig> .

extensive studies using the model system arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate plant defense signaling and pathway networks indicate that salicylic acid  is the key hormone triggering the plant defense response against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens, while jasmonic acid  and derivatives are critical to the defense response against necrotrophic pathogens.
when the genes, atnpr <dig>  atga <dig>  and atpr- <dig>  encoding specific components involved in sa regulation, synthesis, and signaling, are overexpressed in soybean roots, resistance to scn is enhanced.
knowledge of the pathogen defense system gained from studies of the model system, arabidopsis, can be directly translated to soybean through direct overexpression of arabidopsis genes.
three additional arabidopsis genes decreased the number of scn cysts by 40% or more: atacbp <dig> , atacd <dig> , and atcm- <dig> .
overexpression of atdnd <dig> greatly increased susceptibility as indicated by a large increase in the number of scn cysts .
this demonstrates functional compatibility of some arabidopsis genes with soybean and identifies genes that may be used to engineer resistance to nematodes.
