we also show that there was little evolution of hermaphrodite fitness under conditions of selfing or under conditions of outcrossing with unrelated tester males.
using experimental evolution in six populations with initially low standing levels of genetic diversity, we show with head-to-head competition assays that population-wide fitness improved during  <dig> generations.
we nonetheless find a positive genetic correlation between hermaphrodite self-fitness and population-wide fitness, and a negative genetic correlation between hermaphrodite mating success and population-wide fitness.
we have previously shown that the experimental evolution of increased outcrossing rates in populations of the male-hermaphrodite nematode caenorhabditis elegans were correlated with the experimental evolution of increased male fitness.
these results suggest that the several hermaphrodite traits measured are fitness components.
it has long ago been suggested that outcrossing is favoured when it facilitates adaptation to novel environments.
our findings indicate that outcrossing facilitates adaptation to novel environments.
tradeoffs expressed in hermaphrodites, particularly noticed between self-fitness and mating success, may in turn explain their lack of change during experimental evolution.
they further indicate that the experimental evolution of increased outcrossing rates depended little on hermaphrodites because of fitness tradeoffs between selfing and outcrossing.
why most organisms reproduce via outcrossing rather than selfing is a central question in evolutionary biology.
however, it is unknown whether outcrossing led to adaptation, and if so, which fitness components can explain the observed increase in outcrossing rates.
