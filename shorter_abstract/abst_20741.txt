in addition, the false positive rate of fba is significantly lower than others via pathway co-expression analysis.
this study proposes a method that identifies the pathway relations by measuring the functional relations between pathways based on the gene ontology  annotations.
using  <dig> pathway interactions from pid as testing data, the function-based approach  is able to identify 93% of pathway interactions, better than the existing methods based on the shared components and protein-protein interactions.
this function-based approach appears to be more sensitive and able to infer more biologically significant and explainable pathway relations.

in biological systems, pathways coordinate or interact with one another to achieve a complex biological process.
