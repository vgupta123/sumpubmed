in both schizophrenia and addiction, pathological changes in dopamine release appear to induce alterations in the circuitry of the nucleus accumbens that affect coordinated thought and motivation.
neighboring presynaptic varicosities showed strikingly heterogeneous responses to da agonists, suggesting that da receptors may be differentially trafficked to individual varicosities on the same medium-spiny neuron axon.
assuming that post-receptor signaling is restricted to the microdomains of medium-spiny neuron varicosities, the heterogeneous distribution of dopamine receptors on individual varicosities is likely to encode patterns in striatal information processing.
to examine dopamine action at single medium-spiny neuron synapses, we imaged ca2+ levels in their presynaptic varicosities in the acute brain slice using two-photon microscopy.
dopamine receptors are present on the presynaptic varicosities of medium-spiny neurons, where they potently control gabaergic synaptic transmission.
studies using d <dig> and d <dig> receptor knockout mice revealed that quinpirole inhibition was either d <dig> or d <dig> receptor-mediated, while facilitation was mainly d <dig> receptor-mediated.
