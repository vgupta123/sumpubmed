the attenuation of contraction force proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle was significantly  higher in gluteus  and femoris  as compared to gastrocnemius .
the present data show that the correlation of density of dihydropyridine receptors can be one of the important factors influencing the overall contractile properties of the muscle and for its part explain the contradictory results of previous studies on coupling process.
this supports our finding that the abundance of dihydropyridine receptors of iia fibres outnumbers that in the other fibre types.
contraction forces before and after the addition of blocker for the three muscles investigated were: gluteus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n, femoris  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n and gastrocnemius  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  n, respectively.
the results indicate that the attenuation of the contraction force was largest in muscles with a high percentage of type iia fibres.
the staining was most evident in type iia fibres.
in gastrocnemius the content of iia fibres was  <dig>  %.
the major fibre type in gluteus and femoris, revealed by matpase staining, was iia .
histochemical experiments revealed that fluorophore conjugated dihydropyridines stain selectively the membranes of muscle fibres.
