this study describes a new method of gene and sirna delivery into human pancreatic islets by microporation technology.
taken together, our results demonstrate that microporation technology can be used to modify gene expression in whole rodent and human islets without altering their in vitro function and will be key to the elucidation of the factors responsible for proper islet function.
we demonstrated that mild islet distention with accutase greatly enhanced the transfection efficiency without compromising in vitro function .
microporation can also be used on rodent islets.
