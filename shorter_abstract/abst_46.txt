we propose an integrative framework to identify genetic and epigenetic features related to ovarian cancer and to quantify the causal relationships among these features using a probabilistic graphical model based on the cancer genome atlas  data.
we built a bayesian network model with a logit link function to quantify the causal relationships among these features and discovered a set of  <dig> hub genes including arid1a, c19orf <dig>  cskn2a <dig> and col5a <dig>  the directed graph revealed many potential genetic pathways, some of which confirmed the existing results in the literature.
over the past years, tremendous efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular basis of the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer.
in the feature selection, we first defined a set of seed genes by including  <dig> candidate tumor suppressors or oncogenes and an additional  <dig> ovarian cancer related genes reported in the literature.
in addition, two genes related to glycoprotein synthesis, psg <dig> and galnt <dig>  were found highly predictive for the overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients.
the constructed bayesian network has identified some new genetic/epigenetic pathways, which may shed new light into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer.
clustering analysis further suggested four gene clusters, three of which correspond to well-defined cellular processes including cell division, tumor invasion and mitochondrial system.
the seed genes were then fed into a stepwise correlation-based selector to identify  <dig> additional features including  <dig> genes,  <dig> copy number variation sites,  <dig> methylation sites and  <dig> somatic mutation .
