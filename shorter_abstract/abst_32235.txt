we engineered and tested a synthetic homing endonuclease, pb <dig>  derived from the i-crei endonuclease of chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which was re-designed to recognize and cleave a newly specified dna sequence.
interestingly, under certain conditions the repair of the dna junctions resulted in a conservative pairing of recognition half sites to remove the intervening dna and reconstitute a single functional recognition site.
we further demonstrate that this engineered endonuclease can very efficiently excise unwanted transgenic dna, such as an herbicide resistance marker, from the genome when the marker gene is flanked by pb <dig> recognition sites.
a systematic method for plant genome manipulation is a major aim of plant biotechnology.
these results establish parameters needed to use engineered homing endonucleases for the modification of endogenous loci in plant genomes.
hence, a site-specific endonuclease capable of targeting double-strand breaks to unique locations in the plant genome is needed.
one approach to achieving this involves producing a double-strand dna break at a genomic target site followed by the introduction or removal of dna sequences by cellular dna repair.
