peptide ligands have tremendous therapeutic potential as efficacious drugs.
however, since costly and time-consuming synthesis procedures represent a problem for high-throughput screening, novel procedures to reduce the time and labor involved in screening peptide ligands are required.
we propose the novel approach of 'in silico panning' which consists of a two-stage screening, involving affinity selection by docking simulation and evolution of the peptide ligand using genetic algorithms .
the evolution of peptide ligands for a target enzyme was achieved by combining a docking simulation with evolution of the peptide ligand using genetic algorithms , which mimic darwinian evolution.
designation of the target area as next to the substrate-binding site of the enzyme in the docking simulation enabled the selection of a non-competitive inhibitor.
in silico panning was successfully applied to the selection of peptide inhibitor for water-soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase .
we demonstrate an effective methodology of in silico panning for the selection of a non-competitive peptide inhibitor from small virtual peptide library.
pqqgdh activity, in terms of the vmax value, was 3-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of this peptide.
one of the top three selected peptides with the lowest docking energy, 'serg' showed an inhibitory effect with ki value of  <dig> μm.
our study highlights the usefulness of this strategy for structure-based screening of enzyme inhibitors.
the mechanism of the serg blockage of the enzyme was identified as non-competitive inhibition.
we confirmed the specific binding of the peptide, and its equilibrium dissociation constant  value was calculated as  <dig> μm by surface plasmon resonance  analysis.
this study is the first to demonstrate the usefulness of in silico evolution using experimental data.
