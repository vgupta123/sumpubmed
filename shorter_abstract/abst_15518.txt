to better understand the evolutionary significance of this association in nature, further studies addressing a diversity of hosts across locations and evolutionary history are necessary.
however there are still many remaining questions about these associations including what factors drive host-associated bacterial composition.
our work is revealing important aspects of the biology of hosts in structuring the diversity and abundance of these host-associated bacterial communities including the role of host phylogeny and shared evolutionary history.
our correlation results  found that host phylogeny can influence the overall bacterial community, but that geographic location had no effect.
using next generation sequencing  and bioinformatics tools, this study explores the microbial community of > <dig> species of polyrhachis distributed across the old world and compares the microbiota of samples and related hosts across different biogeographic locations and in the context of their phylogenetic history.
ants of the genus polyrhachis  are distributed across the old world and exhibit generalist diets and habits.
the predominant bacteria across samples were enterobacteriaceae , followed by wolbachia , lactobacillus, thiotrichaceae, acinetobacter, nocardia, sodalis, and others.
