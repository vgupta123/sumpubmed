antidepressants probably induce the activity of cdp-diacylglycerol synthase leading to increased production of cdp-diacylglycerol and facilitation of downstream phosphatidylinositol synthesis.
to examine this question, we tested selected agents in serotonin-depleted brain tissues, in pc <dig> cells devoid of serotonin transporters, and on the enzymatic activity of brain cdp-diacylglycerol synthase - the enzyme that catalyzes the physiological synthesis of cdp-diacylglycerol.
each drug significantly increased the enzymatic activity of cdp-diacylglycerol synthase following incubations with cortical or hippocampal brain tissues.
recent studies demonstrate that diverse antidepressant agents increase the cellular production of the nucleolipid cdp-diacylglycerol and its synthetic derivative, phosphatidylinositol, in depression-relevant brain regions.
however, the nucleolipid responses were resistant to inhibition by serotonin receptor antagonists, even though antidepressant-facilitated inositol phosphate accumulation was blocked.
pharmacological blockade of downstream phosphatidylinositide signaling disrupted the behavioral antidepressant effects in rats.
