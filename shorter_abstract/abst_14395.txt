rna molecules, especially non-coding rnas, play vital roles in the cell and their biological functions are mostly determined by structural properties.
furthermore, we analyse the relationship of hishapes to locally optimal structures, the results of which strengthen the use of the hishape abstraction for studying folding kinetics.
exact approaches to kinetic folding are computationally expensive and, thus, limited to short sequences.
