kegg pathway analysis uncovered important altered metabolic pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sucrose and starch metabolism, and plant hormone signalling.
to date, there is limited gene regulation information on viral stress responses in cassava, and global transcriptome profiling in sacmv-infected cassava represents an important step towards understanding natural host responses to plant geminiviruses.
cassava mosaic disease is caused by several distinct geminivirus species, including south african cassava mosaic virus- .
molecular mechanisms for tme <dig> tolerance are proposed, and differences in patterns and levels of transcriptome profiling between t <dig> and tme <dig> with susceptible and tolerant phenotypes, respectively, support the hypothesis that viruses rearrange their molecular interactions in adapting to hosts with different genetic backgrounds.
alterations in the expression of other interesting genes such as transcription factors, resistance  genes, and histone/dna methylation-associated genes, were observed.
a rna-seq time course  study, monitoring gene expression in sacmv-challenged susceptible  and tolerant  cassava landraces, was performed using the applied biosystems  solid next-generation sequencing platform.
the multiplexed paired end sequencing run produced a total of 523 mb and 693 mb of paired-end reads for sacmv-infected susceptible and tolerant cdna libraries, respectively.
using a log <dig> fold cut-off , comparative analysis between the six normalized cdna libraries showed that  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in total were differentially expressed in t <dig> and tme <dig>  respectively, across  <dig>   <dig> and 67 days post infection, compared to mock-inoculated.
