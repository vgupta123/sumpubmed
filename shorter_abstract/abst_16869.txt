we find evidence for two coalitions of proteins and the role of co-adaptation in protein evolution is identified and could be used in future research within a functional context.
cellular atp levels are generated by glucose-stimulated mitochondrial metabolism and determine metabolic responses, such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion  from the Î²-cells of pancreatic islets.
respiratory chain and glutathione pathway proteins evolve faster, exhibiting lower rates of gene duplication.
members of the glycolysis, tca cycle, metabolite transport, pyruvate and nadh shuttles have low rates of protein sequence evolution, as inferred from a human-mouse comparison, and relatively high rates of evolutionary gene duplication.
our results provide insights into the evolution of the involved proteins.
the proteins involved in this system belong to ancient enzymatic pathways: glycolysis, the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
we identify two sets of proteins, or protein coalitions, in this group of  <dig> enzymes with distinct evolutionary patterns.
we describe an analysis of the evolutionary processes affecting the core enzymes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mammals.
a small number of proteins in the system evolve significantly faster than co-pathway members and may serve as rapidly evolving adapters, linking groups of co-evolving genes.
