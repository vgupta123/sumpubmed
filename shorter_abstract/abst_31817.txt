ontological classification of deregulated genes using ipa uncovered a variety of functional categories similarly affected in both scnt groups with a preponderance of genes required for biological processes.
significance analysis of microarray results revealed that of  <dig>  targeted gene transcripts represented on the microarray slide, a relatively small number of genes were differentially expressed in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt  compared to ivf embryos.
the results obtained suggest that despite the extensive reprogramming of donor cells that occurred by the blastocyst stage, scnt-specific errors are of a non-random nature in bovine and are not responsive to epigenetic modifications by tsa.
although tsa markedly changed epigenetic reprogramming of donor cells , reconstituted oocytes , and blastocysts , these changes did not recapitulate parallel marked changes in chromatin remodeling, and nascent mrna and oct4-egfp expression of tsa-nt vs. crt-nt embryos.
a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin a , was used to understand the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on transcriptional profiles of scnt blastocysts and to identify specific or categories of genes affected.
examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that the wnt and fgf pathways were similarly affected in both scnt groups.
tsa improved the yield and quality of in vitro embryo development compared to control .
for both scnt groups, the majority of downregulated and more than half of upregulated genes were common and as much as 15Â % of all deregulated transcripts were located on chromosome x. correspondence analysis clustered ctr-nt and ivf transcriptomes close together regardless of the embryo production method, whereas tsa changed scnt transcriptome to a very clearly separated cluster.
