in this study, two tibetan wild barley accessions , differing greatly in salt tolerance, were used to determine changes of ionomic, metabolomic and proteomic profiles in the shoots exposed to salt stress at seedling stage.
tibetan wild barley  has been confirmed to contain elite accessions in tolerance to abiotic stresses, including salinity.
salt stress caused significant reduction in concentrations of sucrose and metabolites involved in glycolysis pathway in xz <dig>  and elevated level of tricarboxylic acid  cycle, as reflected by up-accumulation of citric acid, aconitic acid and succinic acid, especially under high salinity, but not in xz <dig>  correspondingly, proteomic analysis further proved the findings from the metabolomic study.
xz <dig> maintained a lower na concentration in the shoots and developed superior shoot adaptive strategies to salt stress.
the current result provides possible utilization of tibetan wild barley in developing barley cultivars for salt tolerance.
however, molecular mechanisms underlying genotypic difference of salt tolerance in wild barley are unknown.
compared with xz <dig>  xz <dig> showed better shoot growth and less na accumulation after  <dig> days treatments.
