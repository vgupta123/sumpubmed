furthermore, an iaa treatment significantly delayed the ripening process in papaya fruit at the early stages.
however, how aux/iaa genes function in the fruit development and ripening of papaya  is largely unknown.
to understand the putative biological functions of the cpiaa genes involved in fruit development and ripening, quantitative real-time pcr was used to test the expression profiling of cpiaa genes at different stages.
the involvement of cpiaa gene expression changes in fruit development and ripening gives us an opportunity to understand the roles of auxin signaling in the maturation of papaya reproductive organs.
our study provided comprehensive information on the aux/iaa family in papaya, including gene structures, phylogenetic relationships and expression profiles.
most of the cpiaa genes are responsive to various phytohormones and expressed in a tissues-specific manner.
the expression changes of cpiaa genes in acc and 1-mcp treatments suggested a crosstalk between auxin and ethylene during the fruit ripening process of papaya.
