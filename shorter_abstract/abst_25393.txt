thus, it is flexible to analyze various disease models, especially for interaction detection.
we achieve this by introducing a sparsity constraint in our model based on the fact that only a small fraction of snps is disease-associated.
for the analysis of high throughput data, the main difficulty is that the number of snps far exceeds the number of samples.
single nucleotide polymorphism  based association studies aim at identifying snps associated with phenotypes, for example, complex diseases.
by using a wide range of simulated datasets and a real dataset from wtccc, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.
