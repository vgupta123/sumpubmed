high-throughput sequencing results indicated that we have got more than  <dig> million 17nt clean tags from both species, respectively.
the number of unique clean tags was nearly same in both species .
according to the gene annotation results, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> olfaction related transcripts from h. armigera and h. assulta, respectively.
among the olfaction related transcripts, more odorant binding protein and g protein-coupled receptor were identified in h. armigera than in h. assulta.
p <dig>  carboxypeptidase and atpase in h. assulta than in h. armigera.
these differences partially explain that because of the narrow host plant range of h. assulta, more detoxification enzymes would help them increase the food detoxification and utilization efficiency.
cotton bollworm  and oriental tobacco budworm  are noctuid sibling species.
as serious agricultural insect pests, cotton bollworms are euryphagous insects, but oriental tobacco budworms are oligophagous insects.
these genes will be useful information for studying on the evolution of host plant selection.
under artificial manipulation, they can mate and produce fertile offspring.
to identify the differentially expressed genes that affect host recognition and host adaptation between the two species, we constructed digital gene expression tag profiles for four developmental stages of the two species.
it also provides some important target genes for insect species-specific control by rnai technology.
this study supplied some differentially expressed genes affecting host selection and adaptation between the two sibling species.
