the aim of this study was to assess the effects of nefas on the intracellular calcium  influx, nitric oxide production, and icam- <dig> and il- <dig> expression in primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells .
myristic , palmitic , stearic , oleic  and linoleic acid  rapidly increased ca2+i.
nonesterified fatty acids  are involved in proinflammatory processes in cattle, including in the increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells.
the calcium response to all tested nefas showed an extracellular calcium dependence and only the la response was significantly inhibited until the intracellular calcium was chelated.
only the calcium response to ma was significantly reduced by gw <dig>  a selective g-protein-coupled free fatty acid receptor  antagonist.
these findings strongly suggest that each individual nefa stimulates endothelial cells in a different way, with clearly different effects on intracellular calcium mobilization, no production, and il- <dig> and icam- <dig> expression in primary buvecs.
the ec <dig> values for ma and la were 125 μm and 37 μm, respectively, and the ma and la effects were dependent on calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum stores and on the l-type calcium channels.
