prostate cancer  is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the world.
aiming to identify key players in the complex prostate cancer system, we reconstructed prca co-expressed modules within functional gene sets defined by the gene ontology  annotation .

we primarily identified  <dig> go_bp terms that were well-preserved between two independent gene expression datasets and a consequent  <dig> conserved co-expression modules within them.
five modules were then found to be significantly enriched with prca candidate genes collected from expression quantitative trait loci , somatic copy number alteration , somatic mutation data, or prognostic analyses.
collectively, our results indicated that genes with similar functions may play important roles in disease through co-expression, and modules with different functions could be regulated by similar genetic components, such as tfs and micrornas, in a synergistic manner.
furthermore, most prca candidate genes have not been rigorously replicated, and the methods by which they biologically function in prca remain largely unknown.
specifically, two transcription factors   and three micrornas  regulating these five candidate modules were found to be critical to the development of prca.
