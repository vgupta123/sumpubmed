these results provide a framework for further genetic studies in the kuchinoshima-ushi population and research on functions of snp-containing genes, which would aid in understanding the molecular basis underlying phenotypic variation of economically important traits in cattle and in improving intrinsic defects in domestic cattle breeds.
furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using sequence data from  <dig> genes  showed that kuchinoshima-ushi is clearly distinct from european domestic breeds of cattle.
because the japanese native cattle kuchinoshima-ushi have been isolated in a small island and their lineage has been intensely protected, it has been assumed to date that numerous and valuable genomic variations are conserved in this cattle breed.
a total of  <dig>  gb of sequence was generated, of which 86% of the obtained reads were successfully mapped to the reference sequence  with bwa.
in this study, we evaluated genetic features of this breed, including single nucleotide polymorphism  information, by whole-genome sequencing using a genome analyzer ii.
