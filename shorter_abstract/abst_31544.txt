furthermore, microarray and semi-quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses show that a number of populus hsp <dig> genes are differentially expressed upon exposure to various stresses.
microarray and rt-pcr analyses show that most pthsp90s were induced by various stresses, including heat stress.
however, no systematic analysis of genome organization, gene structure, and expression compendium has been performed in the populus model tree genus to date.
gene structure and motif composition are relatively conserved in each group.
the gene structure and motif composition of pthsp90s are highly conserved among group members, suggesting that members of the same group may also have conserved functions.
unlike many other well-characterized molecular chaperones, hsp90s play key roles in signal transduction, cell-cycle control, genomic silencing, and protein trafficking.
we performed a comprehensive analysis of the populus hsp <dig> gene family and identified  <dig> populus hsp <dig> genes, which were phylogenetically clustered into two major groups.
members of the heat shock protein  <dig>  class of proteins are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones.
they are involved in protein folding, assembly, stabilization, activation, and degradation in many normal cellular processes and under stress conditions.
in populus trichocarpa, we identified three paralogous pairs, among which the pthsp90-5a/pthsp90-5b paralogous pair might be created by duplication of a genome segment.
