a major reservoir of nipah virus is believed to be the flying fox genus pteropus, a fruit bat distributed across many of the world’s tropical and sub-tropical areas.
to characterize the spatial habitat of flying fox populations along thailand’s central plain, and to map potential contact zones between flying fox habitats, pig farms and human settlements, we conducted field observation, remote sensing, and ecological niche modeling to characterize flying fox colonies and their ecological neighborhoods.
nipah has been identified in a number of indigenous flying fox populations in thailand.
passive and active surveillance programs should be prioritized around bangkok, particularly on farms with low biosecurity, close to water, and/or on which orchards are concomitantly grown.
flying fox colonies are found mainly on thailand’s central plain, particularly in locations surrounded by bodies of water, vegetation, and safe havens such as buddhist temples.
high-risk areas for nipah zoonosis in pigs include the agricultural ring around the bangkok metropolitan region where the density of pig farms is high.
such proactive planning would help conserve flying fox colonies and should help prevent zoonotic transmission of nipah and other pathogens.
a potential surface analysis was applied to map contact zones among local epizootic actors.
