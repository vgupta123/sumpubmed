birth and weaning weights were measured to estimate growth rates.
the lacteal-derived cr fed at the study dose was a viable colostrum alternative in the event of poor quality pooled mc for the prevention of preweaning diarrhea and resulted in higher growth rates in comparison to calves fed pooled mc in the study herd.
the objective of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effect of feeding a commercial lacteal-derived colostrum replacer  or pooled maternal colostrum  on preweaning morbidity, growth and mortality in holstein heifer calves.

use of lacteal-derived colostrum replacer was not significantly associated with respiratory disease , omphalitis , or mortality  in the study calves.
calves fed cr were significantly less likely to be affected with a diarrhea event  and had a higher rate of daily weight gain  compared to calves fed pooled mc.
