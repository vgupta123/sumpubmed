retroviral vectors carrying an optimized high-level expression cassette do not produce infectious virions when introduced into packaging cells by transfection of dna.
by exploiting a new method of producing the retroviral genome in vitro it is possible to produce infectious retroviral particles carrying a high-level expression cassette that completely prohibits production of infectious retroviral particles by conventional methods.
we produced an expression cassette comprising a strong enhancer/promoter, an optimised intron, the gfp open reading frame and a strong polyadenylation signal.
however, genetic elements required for high-level gene expression are incompatible with standard systems.
this cassette was cloned into both a conventional mmlv retroviral vector and a vector designed to allow in vitro transcription of the retroviral genome by t <dig> rna polymerase.
when the conventional retroviral vector was transfected into packaging cells, the expression cassette drove strong gfp expression, but no infectious retrovirus was produced.
introduction of the in vitro produced uncapped retroviral genomic transcript into the packaging cells did not lead to any detectable gfp expression.
furthermore strong enhancer/promoters within the retroviral payload lead to detrimental competition with the retroviral enhancer/promoter.
the applications of this technique are not limited to producing the higher levels of transgene expression demonstrated here.
infectious retrovirus carrying the same cassette is readily produced when packaging cells are transfected with in vitro transcribed retroviral genomic rna.
