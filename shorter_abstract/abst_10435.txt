the peptide sequences included in zera®-vp2ep contained epitopes that bound antibodies produced against native vp <dig>  preliminary murine immunogenicity studies showed that the pb vaccine candidates elicited anti-vp <dig> immune responses in mice without the use of adjuvant.
both these candidate vaccines were successfully made in n. benthamiana via transient agrobacterium-mediated expression, and in situ tem analysis showed that the expressed proteins accumulated within the cytoplasm of plant cells in dense membrane-defined pbs.
these proof of concept results demonstrate that zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig> have potential as btv vaccines and their development should be further investigated.
in this study, two novel protein body  plant-produced vaccines were developed, zera®-vp2ep and zera®-vp <dig>  zera®-vp2ep contained b-cell epitope sequences of multiple btv serotypes and zera®-vp <dig> contained the full-length btv- <dig> vp <dig> codon-optimised sequence.
in addition to fulfilling the diva requirement, zera®-vp2ep was aimed at being multivalent with the ability to stimulate an immune response to several btv serotypes.
recombinant vaccines are preferable to minimize the risks associated with these vaccines, and would also enable the development of candidate vaccines that are diva-compliant.
the live-attenuated virus vaccines are not able to distinguish naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals .
