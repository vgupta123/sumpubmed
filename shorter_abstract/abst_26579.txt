furthermore, the concept of a transcript pattern has been introduced that may minimize potential confounding factors of multi-platform comparison and may be useful for similar evaluations.
here, we present a more extensive and yet precise assessment to elucidate differences and similarities in performance of numerous aspects including dynamic range, fidelity of raw signal and fold-change with sample titration, and concordance with qrt-pcr .
this study suggests that microarrays can perform on nearly equal footing with rna-seq, in certain key features, specifically when the dynamic range is comparable.
thus, three levels of data were examined: entire data sets, data derived from a subset of  <dig>  refseq genes common across platforms, and data derived from the transcript pattern defined subset of  <dig>  refseq genes.
to date, cross-platform comparisons of these technologies have been relatively few in number of platforms analyzed and were typically gene name annotation oriented.
to ensure that these results were not confounded by incompatible comparisons, we introduce the concept of probe mapping directed “transcript pattern”.
furthermore, these  <dig> platforms  demonstrated over 80 % fold-change concordance with the gold standard qrt-pcr .
a transcript pattern identifies probes across platforms that target a common set of transcripts for a specific gene.
in general, there were substantial core similarities between all  <dig> platforms evaluated; but, to varying degrees, the two rna-seq protocols outperformed three of the four microarray platforms in most categories.
notably, a fourth microarray platform, agilent with a modified protocol, was comparable, or marginally superior, to the rna-seq protocols within these same assessments, especially in regards to fold-change evaluation.
