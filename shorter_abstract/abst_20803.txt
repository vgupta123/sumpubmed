conservation of natural product gene clusters within mycobacterium, streptomyces and frankia suggest crucial roles for natural products in the biology of each genus.
such studies will be increasingly necessary to study the diversity and ecology of natural products as the number of genome sequences available continues to grow.
the genomes of actinomycetes revealed that these bacteria have a large number of natural product gene clusters, although many of these are difficult to tie to products in the laboratory.
a large-scale analysis of natural product gene clusters presents a useful foundation for hypothesis formulation that is currently underutilized in the field.
the abundance of natural product classes is also found to vary greatly between genera, revealing underlying patterns that are not yet understood.
large scale comparisons of these clusters are difficult to perform due to the presence of highly similar repeated domains in the most common biosynthetic machinery: polyketide synthases  and nonribosomal peptide synthetases .
