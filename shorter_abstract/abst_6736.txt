because a few lgi <dig> disease mutations described in the literature cause secretion failure, we experimentally analyzed the secretion efficiency and subcellular localization of several lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> mutant proteins corresponding to observed non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  affecting the signal peptide, the leucine-rich repeats and the ear propeller.
mapping of disease-causing mutations in the ear domain region onto a 3d-structure model shows that many of these mutations co-localize at an evolutionary conserved surface region of the propeller.
interestingly, mutations at structurally homologous positions in the ear domain have the same effect on secretion in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig>
this similarity of experimental mislocalization phenotypes for mutations at homologous positions of lgi <dig> and the established epilepsy gene lgi <dig> suggests that both genes share a potentially common molecular pathogenesis mechanism that might be the reason for genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of epilepsy.
in another family member, lgi <dig>  mutations are responsible for autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy .
the lgi <dig>  gene, a prime candidate for partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes, belongs to a family encoding secreted, beta-propeller domain proteins with eptp/ear epilepsy-associated repeats.
