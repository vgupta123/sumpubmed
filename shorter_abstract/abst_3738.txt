the second conclusion is, on one hand, the decrease in the amount of enzymes linked to the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates of the cell wall, and, on the other hand, the increase in enzymes linked to the turnover of proteins.
the new available techniques allow to cast new light on the mechanisms involved in the changes occurring in plants under iron deficiency.
of about two thousand spots found, only those showing at least a two-fold increase or decrease in the concentration were considered for subsequent identification by mass spectrometry.
on the other hand, the proteins being decreased belong to the metabolism of sucrose and complex structural carbohydrates and to structural proteins.
two main conclusions may be drawn.
the first one is the confirmation of the increase in the glycolytic flux and in the anaerobic metabolism to sustain the energetic effort the fe-deficient plants must undertake.
most of the increased proteins belong to glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism in agreement with the biochemical evidence.
the data obtained from this proteomic study confirm the metabolic changes occurring in cucumber as a response to fe deficiency.
this effort needs a reorganization of metabolic pathways to efficiently sustain activities linked to the acquisition of iron; in fact, carbohydrates and the energetic metabolism has been shown to be involved in these responses.
the proteome pattern of soluble cytosolic proteins extracted from roots was obtained by 2-de.
