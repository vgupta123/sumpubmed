correspondent pcr fragments of about  <dig>  bp were found in eight out of fourteen isolates; in ps <dig> samples they were  <dig> -bp long due to the absence of one repetitive region, as detected in pb <dig>  we also compared fifty-six pbgp <dig> 3' utr sequences from ten isolates and have not observed polymorphisms; however we detected two main poly clusters  of multiple cleavage sites.
the peculiar structure of tandem repetitive fragments in the 5' intergenic region of pbgp <dig>  their characteristic sequences, besides the presence of multiple poly cleavage sites in the 3' utr will certainly guide future studies.
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic fungus that causes paracoccidiodomycosis .
next, we cloned and sequenced the 5' intergenic region up to position - <dig>  from p. brasiliensis pb <dig> and observed that it is composed of three tandem repetitive regions of about  <dig> bp preceded upstream by  <dig> bp.
glycoprotein gp <dig> is the fungal main diagnostic antigen, which can also protect against murine pcm and interact with extracellular matrix proteins.
