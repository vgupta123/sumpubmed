despite the crucial role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for zoonosis and some of the most threatening diseases for wild carnivores such as distemper and parvovirosis, little is known about the epidemiological features and the risk factors involved in pathogen exposure of dogs that live in human/wildlife interfaces and actually contacts wildlife.
according to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog’s movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance.
widespread exposure to canine parvovirus , canine distemper virus  and canine adenovirus  was detected, but none for canine coronavirus.
dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks.
the study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of atlantic forest’s wild carnivores.
promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary.
through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six atlantic forest fragments in southeast brazil.
