we report an immediate induction of isgs in leukocytes in response to lps supporting a link between the interferon system and defense against bacterial infections.
a control group of five goats received corresponding volumes of sterile saline.
interestingly, increased mrna levels of seven interferon stimulated genes  were observed peaking at 2 h, corroborating the increasing evidence that isgs respond immediately to bacterial endotoxins.
clinical examinations were performed continuously, and blood samples were collected throughout the trial.
early events of this syndrome can be mimicked by experimental administration of lipopolysaccharides .
characteristic signs of acute sepsis, such as sickness behavior, fever, and leukopenia were observed within 1 h of lps administration.
the extrahepatic expression of apps suggests that leukocytes contribute to synthesis of these proteins at the beginning of a systemic inflammation.
compared with mice, small ruminants and humans are highly sensitive to lps, making goats valuable in inflammatory models.
