phylogenetic analysis revealed close similarities between predicted proteins from hadv- <dig> of species d and hadvs from species b and e. however, virtual 2d gel analyses of predicted viral proteins uncovered unexpected differences in pi and/or size of specific proteins thought to be highly similar by phylogenetics.
the whole genome comparisons and virtual 2d gel analyses reported herein suggest potent areas for future studies.
while hadv- <dig> has been known for over  <dig> years as an important cause, the complete genome sequence of this serotype has yet to be reported.
we sequenced and annotated the complete genome of hadv- <dig>  and performed genomic and bioinformatics comparisons with other hadvs to identify differences that might underlie the unique corneal tropism of hadv- <dig>  global pairwise genome alignment with hadv- <dig>  a human species d adenovirus not associated with corneal infection, revealed areas of non-conserved sequence principally in genes for the virus fiber , penton , hexon , and e <dig> .
although disparities between hadv- <dig> and other hadv within species d in genes encoding structural and host receptor-binding proteins were to some extent expected, differences in the e <dig> region suggest as yet unknown roles for this area of the genome.
this genomic and bioinformatics analysis of the hadv- <dig> genome provides a valuable tool for understanding the corneal tropism of this clinically important virus.
human adenovirus type  <dig>  is a major etiologic agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, a common and severe eye infection associated with long-term visual morbidity due to persistent corneal inflammation.
