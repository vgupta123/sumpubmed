the objective of this study was to use a comparative genomics approach to identify and characterise the β-defensin gene repertoire in sheep using the bovine genome as the primary reference.
β-defensin genes in ovis aries  have been poorly annotated, having been identified only by automatic gene prediction algorithms.
all  <dig> currently predicted bovine β-defensin genes were used to find orthologous sequences in the most recent version of the sheep genome .
the orthologous genes were located in four clusters across the genome, with  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>  conserved gene order for the β-defensin genes was apparent in the two smaller clusters, although gene order was reversed on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting an inversion between sheep and cattle.
qpcr was used to profile the expression of  <dig> β-defensin genes, representing each of the four clusters, in the ram reproductive tract.
this is the first comprehensive analysis of β-defensin genes encoded by the ovine reference sequence, and the first report of an expanded repertoire of β-defensin genes in this species.
complete conservation of gene order was also observed for chromosome  <dig> β-defensin orthologs.
in this cluster, the defensin-beta  <dig>  gene matched to eleven bovine neutrophil beta-defensin  genes on chromosome  <dig> with almost uniform similarity, as well as to tracheal, enteric and lingual anti-microbial peptides , suggesting that annotation of the bovine reference sequence is still incomplete.
distinct site-specific and differential expression profiles were detected across the reproductive tract of mature rams with preferential β-defensin gene expression in the epididymis, recapitulating observations for orthologous genes in other species.
the preferential expression of these genes in the epididymis suggests a role in fertility, possibly providing immunoprotection for sperm within the female reproductive tract.
