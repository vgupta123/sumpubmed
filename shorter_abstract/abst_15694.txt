computational experiments show that maximum compatibility is less sensitive than maximum parsimony to the inclusion of nucleotide data that, though derived from actual sequence reads, has been identified as likely to be misleading.
maximum compatibility is a method of phylogenetic reconstruction that is seldom applied to molecular sequences.
maximum compatibility is a useful tool for certain phylogenetic problems, such as inferring the relationships among closely-related bacteria from whole-genome sequence data.
although based on solutions to the maximum clique problem, this algorithm deals properly with ambiguities in the data.
it may be ideal for certain applications, such as reconstructing phylogenies of closely-related bacteria on the basis of whole-genome sequencing.
run times are several seconds or less.
here i present an algorithm that rapidly computes phylogenies according to a compatibility criterion.
