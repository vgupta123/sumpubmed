its antiviral compound is a kind of lignan, which is formed with the action of dirigent proteins .
analysis of transcription profiling database from i. indigotica revealed a family of  <dig> full-length unique dir and dir-like proteins.
sequence analysis found that i. indigotica dir and dir-like proteins  were all-beta strand proteins, with a signal peptide at the n-terminus.
new dir and dir-like proteins were discovered from the transcription profiling database of i. indigotica through bioinformatics methods for the first time.
however, the dir and dir-like protein gene family in i. indigotica has not been analyzed in detail yet.
this study focuses on discovery and analysis of this protein gene family in i. indigotica for the first time.
dir proteins are members of a large family of proteins which impart stereoselectivity on the phenoxy radical-coupling reaction, yielding optically active lignans from two molecules of e-coniferyl alcohol.
phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> proteins indicated that the iidir genes cluster into three distinct subfamilies, dir-a, dir-b/d, and dir-e, of a larger plant dir and dir-like gene family.
it showed that most iidir genes were expressed comparatively higher in roots and flowers than stems and leaves.
this study will provide basic data necessary for further studies.
gene-specific primers were designed for  <dig> unique iidirs and were used to evaluate patterns of constitutive expression in different organs.
sequence characteristics and transcript abundance of these new genes were analyzed.
