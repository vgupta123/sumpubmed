results show extensive age-related changes in every component of the mouse liver transcriptome and a pronounced increase in inter-individual variation.
moreover, integration of the altered non-coding rnas and protein-coding transcripts into interaction networks of age-related change revealed inflammation, cellular proliferation, and metabolism as the dominant aging phenotypes in mouse liver.
functional annotation of the protein-coding mrnas and isoforms indicated broad alterations in immune response, cell activation, metabolic processes, and rna modification.
our analyses provide the first comprehensive dissection of the transcriptional landscape in aging mouse liver.
here, using directional whole transcriptome rna-sequencing of aged mouse liver we have identified a comprehensive high-resolution profile of differentially expressed liver transcripts comprised of canonical protein-coding transcripts, transcript isoforms, and non-coding rna transcripts, including pseudogenes, long non-coding rnas and small rna species.
however, studies have shown microarray-based transcriptional profiling is less accurate and not fully capable of capturing certain intricacies of the global transcriptome.
previous studies have relied on microarray analysis to examine gene expression profiles in different tissues of aging organisms.
