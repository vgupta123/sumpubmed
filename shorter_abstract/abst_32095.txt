analysis of subcellular compartments by immunoprecipitations and 2d western blots substantiated these findings and revealed furthermore a tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of vcp/p <dig> in the cytosolic but not in the nuclear fractions.
the aaa atpase valosin-containing protein  contributes to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively, and it was of interest to study a possible role of vcp/p <dig> during this myelomonocytic differentiation and retrodifferentiation.
separation of autonomously proliferating human u <dig> myeloid leukemia cells by centrifugal elutriation demonstrated unaltered vcp/p <dig> expression levels throughout distinct phases of the cell cycle.
together with a down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> by sirna, these results suggested an association of this aaa atpase in the differentiation/retrodifferentiation program.
however, phorbol ester-induced g0/g <dig> cell cycle arrest in differentiating human u <dig> leukemia cells was associated with a significantly increased protein and mrna amount of this aaa atpase.
these elevated vcp/p <dig> levels progressively decreased again when growth-arrested u <dig> cells entered a retrodifferentiation program and returned to the tumorigenic phenotype.
these altered tyrosine phosphorylation levels, according to distinct subcellular distributions, indicated a possible functional involvement of vcp/p <dig> in the leukemic differentiation process.
the findings demonstrated that monocytic differentiation and g0/g <dig> growth arrest in human u <dig> leukemia cells was accompanied by an increase in vcp/p <dig> expression and a distinct subcellular distribution to be reverted during retrodifferentiation.
