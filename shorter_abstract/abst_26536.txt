therefore, within-population variation in parental care emerges by sexually different mechanisms; between-individual variation was responsible for the observed pattern of offspring desertion in females, whereas within-individual variation was responsible for the observed pattern in males.
to our knowledge, our study is the first that investigates repeatability of offspring desertion behavior in nature.
we studied the consistency of offspring desertion in a small passerine bird, the eurasian penduline tit remiz pendulinus, that has an extremely variable breeding system.
using a three-year dataset from southern hungary we show that offspring desertion by females is consistent between nests.
this difference may lead to sexual conflict between parents over care provisioning in animals that breed with multiple mates.
one of the most obvious manifestations of sexual conflict over care is offspring desertion whereby one parent deserts the young to increase its reproductive success at the expense of its mate.
our results raise an intriguing question whether the sexual difference in caring/deserting decisions explain the extreme intensity of sexual conflict in penduline tits that produces a high frequency of biparentally deserted  offspring.
the contrasting strategies of the sexes imply complex evolutionary trajectories in breeding behavior of penduline tits.
male desertion, however, depends on ambient environment, because all males desert their nests early in the season and some of them care late in the season.
