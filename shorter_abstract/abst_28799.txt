the ubiquitin-proteasome system  is a key player in protein degradation in eukaryotes.
plants respond to abiotic stress on physiological, biochemical and molecular levels.
single homozygous t-dna insertion mutants of atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> displayed hypersensitivity to water stress; this was not observed for similar mutants of atpub <dig>  although the three genes show a similar spatial expression pattern, the steady state levels of their transcripts are differentially affected by abiotic stresses and plant hormones.
our data suggest that despite encoding highly homologous proteins, atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> biological activity does not fully overlap.
atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> encode plant u-box e3s and are involved in the response to water stress.
