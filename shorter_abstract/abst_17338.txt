the pubic louse, pthirus pubis, has its  <dig> mt genes known on  <dig> minichromosomes.

our results provide insights into the process of mt genome fragmentation in the sucking lice in a relatively fine evolutionary scale.

seventeen of the  <dig> minichromosomes of the chimpanzee louse have the same gene content and gene arrangement as their counterparts in the human head louse and the human body louse.
however, five genes, cob, trns <dig>  trnn, trne and trnm, which are on three minichromosomes in the human head louse and the human body louse, are together on one minichromosome in the chimpanzee louse.
pubis, as an outgroup for comparison, we infer that a single minichromosome has fragmented into three in the lineage leading to the human head louse and the human body louse since this lineage diverged from the chimpanzee louse ~ <dig> million years ago.
to understand the process of mt genome fragmentation in the sucking lice of great apes, we sequenced the mt genome of the chimpanzee louse, pe.
blood-sucking lice in the genera pediculus and pthirus are obligate ectoparasites of great apes.
unlike most bilateral animals, which have  <dig> mitochondrial  genes on a single circular chromosome, the sucking lice of humans have extensively fragmented mt genomes.

we identified all of the  <dig> mt genes typical of bilateral animals in the chimpanzee louse; these genes are on  <dig> types of minichromosomes.
