antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins with bcl-2/bax ratio, cd <dig>  cd <dig> markers with cd4+/cd8+ ratio, cd45ro+, cd45ra+ markers with memory/naïve ratio .
and memory/naïve ratio of pbl was higher in severe than in mild asthmatics.
the aim of this study was to explore the differences in apoptotic potential, cd4/cd <dig> ratio, memory compartment, and t- helper   <dig> and  <dig> profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes  in patients with mild intermittent asthma and severe persistent asthma during exacerbation periods.
mild intermittent asthma is mainly th <dig> allergen-oriented reaction during exacerbations with good level of apoptosis making the inflammation as self-limiting, while in severe persistent asthma, the inflammatory reaction mediated mainly by th <dig> cytokines with progressive loss of apoptosis leading to longer exacerbations, largely expanded memory cells, cd45ro+, leading to persistent baseline inflammation.
it was found that bcl-2/bax ratio was higher in severe than in mild asthmatics which in turn was higher than in healthy group.
four research lines were investigated and compared among mild asthmatics, severe asthmatics, and healthy groups by applying immunocytochemical staining of pbl.
interestingly, the dominant profile of cytokines appeared to change from t helper  <dig>  in mild asthmatics to t helper  <dig>  in severe asthmatics where the lowest in vitro il-4/ifn-γ ratio and highest ifn-γ were found.
however, cd8+ cells were correlated directly with memory cells, cd45ro+, in severe asthmatics only.
moreover, memory cells, cd45ro+ and cd45ro+/cd45ra+ ratio were correlated directly with bcl-2/bax, in severe and mild asthma patients.
asthma is a complicated network of inflammatory reactions.
it is classified into mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma.
in contrast, cd4+/cd8+ ratio was not changed significantly among healthy group, mild and severe asthmatics.
th2/th <dig> cytokines balance represented by il-4/ifn-γ ratio was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for in vitro pbl cytokine synthesis.
the success of asthma therapy relies much on understanding the underlying mechanisms of inflammation at each stage of asthma severity.
