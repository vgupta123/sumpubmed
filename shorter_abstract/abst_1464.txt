divergent selection can be a major driver of ecological speciation.
the low number of shared divergent loci between continents suggests a relatively limited number of genomic regions determining key typological traits likely to be driving incipient speciation and/or adaptation of molestus to anthropogenic habitats.
in the west nile virus vector culex pipiens, intraspecific pipiens and molestus forms vary in ecological and physiological traits.
divergence between pipiens and molestus forms from usa was higher than in both inter- and intra-continental comparisons with european samples.
in insects of medical importance, understanding the speciation process is both of academic interest and public health importance.
this study supports the molestus and pipiens status as distinct evolutionary entities with low genomic divergence.
only two of the outlier loci were shared between inter-form comparisons made within europe and usa.
the proportion of outlier loci between pipiens and molestus  was low but consistent in both continents, and similar to those observed between sibling species of other mosquito species which exhibit contemporary gene flow.
