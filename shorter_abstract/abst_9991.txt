both loci are flanked by insertion sequences of the same family suggesting a possible event of horizontal gene transfer.
the genomic region of dld likely has been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
shermanii, a bacterium used in swiss-type cheese making.
heterologous expression of dld from c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> in c. efficiens enabled this species to grow with d-lactate as sole carbon source.
inactivation of dld resulted in the loss of the ability to grow with d-lactate, which could be restored by plasmid-borne expression of dld.
quinone-dependent l-lactate dehydrogenase lldd is known to be essential for utilization of l-lactate by c. glutamicum.
d-lactate also serves as sole carbon source for c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>
homologs of dld of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> are not encoded in the sequenced genomes of other corynebacteria and mycobacteria.
however, the dld locus of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> shares  <dig> bp of  <dig> bp identical nucleotides with the dld locus of propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp.
here, the gene cg <dig> was shown to encode the quinone-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase  by enzymatic analysis of the protein purified from recombinant e. coli.
corynebacterium glutamicum is able to grow with lactate as sole or combined carbon and energy source.
dld is essential for growth with d-lactate as sole carbon source.
cg <dig> encodes quinone-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase dld of corynebacterium glutamicum.
