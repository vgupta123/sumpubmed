extensive phenotypical and functional characterization showed that in both tcm and tem cells, the cd300a/c+ subset contained a higher number of th <dig>  cells.
co-ligation of the tcr and cd300a/c in cd4+ t cells inhibited ca2+ mobilization evoked by tcr ligation alone and modulated ifn-Î³ production on th <dig> polarized cells.
we conclude that the cd300a/c receptors are differentially expressed on human th <dig> and th <dig> cells and that their ligation is capable of modulating tcr mediated signals.
human memory cd4+ t cells can be either cd300a/c+ or cd300a/c- and subsequent analyses showed that cd4+ effector memory t  cells are mostly cd300a/c+, whereas cd4+ central memory t  cells have similar frequencies of cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- cells.
