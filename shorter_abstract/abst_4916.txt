the renal  and intestinal  electrogenic na+/hco3- cotransporter variants differ in their primary structure, transport direction, and response to secretagogues.
regulation of pnbc <dig> by secretagogues appears to be not solely dependent on its primary structure, but also on properties of the cell type in which it is expressed.
acid-activated na+/hco3- cotransport via pnbc <dig> expressed in renal cells is thus inhibited by camp and not affected by cholinergic stimulation, as opposed to the findings in native intestinal tissue.
after preincubation with carbachol , the phi recovery was enhanced to the same degree both in transfected and untransfected cells, indicating activation of endogenous alkalizing ion transporters.
na+- and hco3--dependent phi recovery from an acid load  was enhanced by 5-fold in gfp-positive cells compared to the control cells in the presence of co2/hco3-.
forskolin  had no effect in untransfected cells, but inhibited the phi recovery in cells expressing pnbc <dig> by 62%.
