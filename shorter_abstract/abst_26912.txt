computer aided analysis of the sequence of the d4ecr <dig> indicated the potential transcription factors that could modulate its function.
d4ecr <dig> contained multiple consensus sequences for binding the transcription factor sp <dig>  a factor previously implicated in drd <dig> expression.
bioinformatic analysis complemented by functional analysis of the drd <dig> gene locus has identified a) a strong enhancer that functions in neurons and b) a transcription factor that may modulate the function of that enhancer.
the most conserved non-coding ecr  supported high reporter gene expression in primary cultures derived from neonate rat frontal cortex.
detecting functional variants contributing to diversity of behaviour is crucial for dissecting genetics of complex behaviours.
