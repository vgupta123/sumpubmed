the increasing clinical use of genomic profiling demands identification of more effective methods to segregate patients into prognostic and treatment groups.
tumours identified within the same bicluster were more likely to present with similar clinical features.
many studies have revealed correlations between breast tumour phenotypes, variations in gene expression, and patient survival outcomes.
bicluster membership combined with clinical information could predict patient prognosis in conditional inference tree and ridge regression class prediction models.
biclustering identified tightly co-expressed gene sets in the tumours of restricted subgroups of breast cancer patients.
the molecular heterogeneity between breast tumours revealed by these studies has allowed prediction of prognosis and has underpinned stratified therapy, where groups of patients with particular tumour types receive specific treatments.
