presented here is a novel study of two porcine tissues based on integrative analysis of data from expression profiling of identical samples using cdna microarray, 454-sequencing and itraq-based proteomics.
we show that the reproducibility within cdna microarray and 454-sequencing is high, but that the agreement across these two technologies is modest.
we demonstrate that the regulation of transcript and protein levels across identical tissue samples is positively correlated when the tissue expression ratios are used for comparison.
furthermore, most comparisons of transcript and protein levels have been based on absolute expression values from within the same tissue and not relative expression values based on tissue ratios.
both transcript-based technologies showed high reproducibility between sample replicates of the same tissue, but the correlation across these two technologies was modest.
the recent development within high-throughput technologies for expression profiling has allowed for parallel analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes in biological systems such as comparative analysis of transcript and protein levels of tissue regulated genes.
the results presented are of interest in systems biology research in terms of integration and analysis of high-throughput expression data from mammalian tissues.
protein expression ratios were determined for  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> could be mapped to both microarray and 454-sequencing data.
a comparison of the expression ratios from the three technologies revealed that differences in transcript and protein levels across heart and muscle tissues are positively correlated.
the relationship between the regulation of transcript and protein levels was analyzed by integrating itraq-based proteomics data.
sequence homology identified  <dig>  unique transcripts that are detectable by both microarray hybridizations and 454-sequencing of  <dig>  million cdna tags.
