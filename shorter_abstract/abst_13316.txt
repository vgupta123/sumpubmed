additionally, c mice, but not epo-treated ih-exposed mice had significantly elevated levels of nadph oxidase expression, as well as increased mda and 8-ohdg levels in cortical and hippocampal lysates.
in rodents, exposure to intermittent hypoxia , a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea , is associated with neurobehavioral impairments, increased apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as increased oxidant stress and inflammation.
ih induced only transiently increased expression of epo mrna in hippocampus, which was continued in -exposed mice.
ih, but not sh, adversely affected two forms of spatial learning in the water maze, and increased markers of oxidative stress.
the oxidative stress responses and neurobehavioral impairments induced by ih during sleep are mediated, at least in part, by imbalances between epo expression and increased nadph oxidase activity, and thus pharmacological agents targeting epo expression in cns may provide a therapeutic strategy in sleep-disordered breathing.
