we show that gene expression during the first month of leaf development was largely determined by a developmental program although leaf expansion, chlorophyll accumulation and the speed of progression through this program was regulated by the temperature.
identify marker genes for certain developmental stages or treatments, as well as to assess natural variation in gene expression.
genomic studies are routinely performed on young plants in controlled environments which is very different from natural conditions.
in mature leaves, weather factors were important for gene regulation.
in reality plants in temperate countries are exposed to large fluctuations in environmental conditions, in the case of perennials over several years.
this study shows that multivariate methods together with high throughput transcriptional methods in the field can provide additional, novel information as to plant status under changing environmental conditions that is impossible to mimic in laboratory conditions.
we were also able to define "transcriptional signatures" for four different substages of leaf development.
we have studied gene expression in leaves of a free-growing aspen  throughout multiple growing seasons
