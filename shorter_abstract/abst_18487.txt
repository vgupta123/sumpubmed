ffpe rna-seq provides reliable genes expression data, comparable to that obtained from fresh frozen tissue.
on hierarchical cluster analysis, samples clustered by patient identity rather than method of preservation.
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tissue samples are routinely archived in the course of patient care and can be linked to clinical outcomes with long-term follow-up.
rna-seq expressions from ff and ffpe samples from the same renal cell carcinoma  correlated highly .
next-generation sequencing  is rapidly becoming accepted as an effective tool for measuring gene expressions for research and clinical use.
expression fold changes were considered, to assess biologic relevance of gene expressions.
however, ffpe tissues have degraded rna which poses challenges for analyzing gene expression.
gene expression measured by ffpe rna-seq was compared to two different standards: rna-seq from fresh frozen  tissue and quantitative pcr .

however, the feasibility of ngs has not been firmly established when using ffpe tissue.
we optimized strategies for whole transcriptome sequencing  using ffpe tissue.
ribosomal rna  was successfully depleted by competitive hybridization using the ribo-zero™ kit , and rrna sequence content was less than one percent for each library.
expression fold changes between ffpe tumors  correlated well when comparing qpcr and rna-seq .
expression fold changes between tumors from different risk groups  also correlated well when comparing rna-seq from ff and ffpe tumors .
both ff and ffpe tumors were sequenced on an illumina genome analyzer iix with an average of  <dig> million reads.
taqman qpcr of  <dig> rcc-related genes correlated highly with ffpe rna-seq expressions .
