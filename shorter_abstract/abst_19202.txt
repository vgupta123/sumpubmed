the non-structural protein gene, nsp <dig>  the structural protein gene, the capsid protein gene, and the 3'-untranslated region  of the novel getah virus isolate were cloned and sequenced.
getah virus, belonging to the family togaviridae in the genus alphavirus, is a mosquito-borne enveloped rna virus that was identified using the virus-discovery-cdna rapd  method.
a novel getah virus was identified by vidiscr from suckling mice exposed to mosquitoes  collected in yunnan province, china.
nucleotide sequence identities of each gene were determined to be  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> %, and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively, when compared with the genomes of  <dig> other representative strains of getah virus.
the vidiscr method was able to identify known virus isolates and a novel isolate of getah virus from infected mice.
thus, we developed a new method for the discovery of unknown viruses based on the cdna - random amplified polymorphic dna  technique.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the yn <dig> isolate was more closely related to the hebei hb <dig> strain than the yn <dig> strain, and more genetically distinct from the mm <dig> malaysia primitive strain.
the identification of new virus strains is important for the study of infectious disease, but current  molecular biology methods are limited since the target sequence must be known to design genome-specific pcr primers.
