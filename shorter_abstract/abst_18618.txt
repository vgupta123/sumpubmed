we show here that pans <dig> protein is found mainly in prophase i of meiosis, with its level declining late in prophase i during diplotene.
our results show that pans <dig> is expressed mainly in meiosis i where it has an important function and together with previous studies indicate that pans <dig> and osd <dig> are part of a network linking centromere cohesion and cell cycle progression through control of apc/c activity.
retention of sister centromere cohesion during meiosis i and its dissolution at meiosis ii is necessary for balanced chromosome segregation and reduction of chromosome number.
we demonstrate that, in addition to the previously reported premature loss of centromere cohesion during interkinesis, pans <dig> mutants show partially penetrant defects in centromere cohesion during meiosis i. we also determine that pans <dig> shows synthetic lethality at the level of the sporophyte, with omission of second division  <dig> , which encodes a known inhibitor of the apc/c that is required for cell cycle progression during mitosis, as well as meiosis i and ii.
pans <dig> also shows expression in dividing tissues.
patronus <dig>  has recently been proposed to regulate centromere cohesion in arabidopsis after meiosis i, during interkinesis.
pans <dig> mutants lose centromere cohesion prematurely during interkinesis and segregate randomly at meiosis ii.
