however, the linearized cosmid produced an incomplete assembly because the two dna termini, though greatly overrepresented in the clone library used for sequencing, were separated from neighboring sequences by gaps of ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  kb.
mapping of shearing breakpoints revealed a paucity of breaks in the subterminal regions of the linearized cosmid and also near chromosome ends of the fungus neurospora crassa.
we propose that this causes dna termini to be overrepresented in the resulting fragment population but ultimately prevents their incorporation into sequence assemblies.
the dna sheared in circular form assembled into a single sequence contig.
a shotgun strategy was used to sequence and assemble circular and linear cosmid dnas sheared using conditions typical for a genome project.
these gap sizes were reduced, but not eliminated, by shearing the linear cosmid into smaller fragments.
we surmised that the problem might lie in the dna shearing conditions used to create clone libraries for genome sequencing.
