this article presents the first software library for local, global, and semi-global pairwise intra-sequence alignments and improves the performance of previous intra-sequence implementations.
the software library is designed for  <dig> bit linux, os x, or windows on processors with sse <dig>  sse <dig>  or avx <dig>  source code is available from https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail
for the first time, simd global, semi-global, and local alignments are available in a stand-alone c library.
using a  <dig> residue query sequence a speed of  <dig> billion cell updates per second  was achieved on a dual intel xeon e5- <dig> 24-core processor system, the highest reported for an implementation based on farrar’s ‘striped’ approach.
for global alignments, parasail’s prefix scan implementation is generally the fastest, faster even than farrar’s ‘striped’ approach, however the opal library is faster for single-threaded applications.

sequence alignment algorithms are a key component of many bioinformatics applications.
though various fast smith-waterman local sequence alignment implementations have been developed for x <dig> cpus, most are embedded into larger database search tools.
applications that require optimal alignment scores could benefit from the improved performance.
