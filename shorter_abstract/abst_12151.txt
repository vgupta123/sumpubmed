translation termination factors erf <dig>  and erf <dig>  participate not only in the last step of protein synthesis but also in mrna degradation and translation initiation via interaction with such proteins as pab <dig>  upf <dig>  upf <dig> and upf <dig>
in this work we have used previously isolated sup <dig> mutants of s. cerevisiae to characterize degradation of aberrant mrna in conditions when translation termination is impaired.
in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of the nmd pathway depends on the recognition of the ptc by the translational machinery.
this is the first demonstration that sup <dig> mutations do not only change translation fidelity but also acts by causing a change in mrna stability.
we have sequenced his7- <dig>  lys9-a <dig> and trp1- <dig> alleles which are frequently used for analysis of nonsense suppression.
