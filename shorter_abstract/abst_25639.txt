in caenorhabditis elegans, the egf-ras and wnt signaling pathways have been shown to interact to specify cell fate in three equivalence groups: the vulval precursor cells , the hook competence group  and p11/ <dig>  in the vpcs, hcg and p11/ <dig> pair, egf and wnt signaling positively regulate different hox genes, each of which also functions during fate specification.
our results suggest that dbl-1/dpp is not required for vpc and p <dig> specification, highlighting another difference among these egf-dependent equivalence groups.
lastly, we find that a dbl-1/dpp null mutation did not cause any vulval or p <dig> defects and did not enhance vulval and p <dig> defects of reduction-of-function mutations of components of the egf pathway.
in addition, our results indicate that lin-44/wnt, mom-2/wnt and lin-17/fz are necessary to maintain the division of bγ along a longitudinal axis.
we show that egf-ras signaling is required for bγ expression of ceh-13/labial/hox <dig>  the transcription factors lin-1/ets and lin-31/forkhead, functioning downstream of the egf pathway, as well as sur-2/med <dig>  also control ceh- <dig> expression in bγ.
we also show that dbl-1/dpp acts either in parallel or downstream of egf pathway to regulate ceh-13/hox <dig> expression in bγ.
ceh-13/labial/hox <dig> expression in bγ is regulated by the egf pathway and downstream factors lin-1/ets lin-31/forkhead and sur-2/med <dig>  wnt signaling is required for proper bγ division, perhaps to orient the bγ mitotic spindle.
in the male, egf-ras signaling is required to specify the bγ fate within the bγ/δ equivalence pair, while notch signaling is required for bδ fate specification.
during development, different signaling pathways interact to specify cell fate by regulating transcription factors necessary for fate specification and morphogenesis.
