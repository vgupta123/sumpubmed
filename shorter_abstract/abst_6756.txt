comparative analysis using anchor markers showed strong co-linearity to previously reported cassava genetic and physical maps.
eighteen linkage groups were resolved with an overall size of  <dig>  cm and an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers.
besides, there has been a lack of information about the number of genes related to immunity as well as their distribution and genomic organization in the cassava genome.
the enrichment of the physical map with novel scaffolds is in line with the efforts of the cassava genome sequencing consortium.
these data build a solid basis for future studies to map and associate markers with single loci or quantitative trait loci for agronomical important traits.
the development of dense genetic and physical maps, as the basis for implementing genetic and molecular approaches to accelerate the rate of genetic gains in breeding program represents a significant challenge.
physical mapping of scaffolds of cassava whole genome sequence draft using the mapped markers as anchors resulted in the orientation of  <dig> scaffolds covering  <dig> % of the genome.
one hundred eighty nine new scaffolds are anchored to the genetic cassava map leading to an extension of the present cassava physical map with  <dig>  mb.
based on physical map of the corresponding sequencing scaffolds, unambiguous genetic localization was possible for  <dig> irps.
