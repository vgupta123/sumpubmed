previous studies have shown modular structures in ppi  networks.

the results show that omim outperforms several other popular methods in identifying high quality modular structures.
nodes that have positive effects on more than two modules are defined as overlapping parts.
however, most of the existing methods are insufficient when applied to networks with overlapping modular structures.
as well, we designed de-noising steps based on a clustering coefficient and hub finding steps based on nodal weight.
more recently, many genome and metagenome investigations have focused on identifying modules in ppi networks.
then experiments on real ppi networks from the mips saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset were carried out.
the low computational complexity and few control parameters prove that our method is suitable for large scale ppi network analysis.
