our results indicate that advanced-backcross progeny allowed us to detect and confirm qtls with relatively small additive effects, and the natural variation in rice heading date could result from combinations of large- and small-effect qtls.
among the detected qtls,  <dig> qtls corresponded to genomic positions of heading date genes identified by previous studies, such as hd <dig>  hd <dig>  hd3a, ghd <dig>  dth <dig>  and rft <dig>  the other  <dig> qtls were detected in different chromosomal regions than heading date genes.
although considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular regulation of heading date in rice during last two decades, the previously isolated genes and identified quantitative trait loci  cannot fully explain the natural variation for heading date in diverse rice accessions.
qtl analyses of over  <dig>  backcrossed individuals revealed  <dig> qtls distributed widely across the rice genome.

we also found differences in the genetic architecture of heading date  among maize, arabidopsis, and rice.
to genetically dissect naturally occurring variation in rice heading date, we collected qtls in advanced-backcross populations derived from multiple crosses of the japonica rice accession koshihikari  with  <dig> diverse rice accessions  that originate from various regions of asia.
