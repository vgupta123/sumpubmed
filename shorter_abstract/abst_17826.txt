no involvement of pestivirus or bluetongue virus was detected by immunohistochemistry.
in many human cases the disease has a genetic basis.
here we report neuropathological findings in  <dig> newborn lambs from a pure churra breed flock, with clinical signs of weakness, inability to walk, difficulty in sucking and muscular rigidity observed immediately after birth.
the study describes the clinical and pathological findings of lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia in churra lambs for which an autosomal recessive inheritance was the most likely cause.
histologically, the normal layers of the cerebral cortex were disorganized and, using an immunohistochemical technique against neurofilaments, three layers were identified instead of the six present in normal brains.
this report suggests that lissencephaly should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital neurological disease in newborn lambs showing weakness, inability to walk and difficulty sucking.
in sheep, brain malformations, mainly cerebellar hypoplasia and forms of hydrocephalus, are frequently due to in utero viral infections.
all the lambs showed near-total agyria with only a rudimentary formation of few sulci and gyri, and a severe cerebellar hypoplasia.
lissencephaly is a rare developmental brain disorder in veterinary and human medicine associated with defects in neuronal migration leading to a characteristic marked reduction or absence of the convolutional pattern of the cerebral hemispheres.
heterotopic neurons were present in different areas of the white matter.
histopathological features observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are consistent with a possible failure in neuronal migration during brain development.
