1) it covers a broad range of rmsd values ;
2) it has been obtained from molecular dynamics trajectories, starting from different non-native-like conformations which have diverse behaviour, with secondary structure elements correctly or incorrectly formed, and in one case folding to a native-like structure.
this allows not only for scoring of static structures, but also for studying, using free energy estimators, the kinetics of folding;
the statistical and physical effective energy functions tested on the set behave differently when native simulation snapshots are included or not in the set and when averaging over the trajectory is performed.
an evaluation of the energy of the decoys is given using: i) a residue based contact potential supplemented by a term for the quality of dihedral angles; ii) a recently introduced combination of four statistical scoring functions for model quality estimation ; iii) molecular mechanics with solvation energy estimated either according to the generalized born surface area  or iv) the poisson-boltzmann surface area  method.
the quality of the covalent structure therefore does not suffer from steric or covalent problems.
3) all structures have been obtained from accurate md simulations in explicit solvent and after molecular mechanics  energy minimization using an implicit solvent method.
as these estimators still present inaccuracies, they are frequently evaluated by discriminating native or native-like conformations from large ensembles of so-called decoy structures.
