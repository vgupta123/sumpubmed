damselfishes show high levels of ontogenetic allometry during their post-settlement growth.
quantitative studies of the variation of disparity during ontogeny exhibited by the radiation of coral reef fishes are lacking.
the damselfishes  have a bipartite life-cycle, as do the majority of demersal coral reef fishes.
the diversity of organic form, over ontogeny could be a first step in detecting evolutionary mechanisms in these fishes.
during their pelagic dispersion phase, all larvae feed on planktonic prey.
we also show that the high levels of shape disparity at the adult stage are correlated to a higher level of ecological and functional diversity in this stage.
the bipartite life-cycle of damselfishes exemplifies a case where the variation of environmental factors, i.e.
using geometric morphometrics, we study the ontogenetic dynamic of shape disparity of different head skeletal units  in this fish family.
the disparity levels increase significantly throughout ontogeny for each skeletal unit.
diversification throughout ontogeny of damselfishes results from the interaction among several developmental novelties enhancing disparity.
such studies dealing with the variation of disparity, i.e.
the divergence of allometric patterns largely explains the changes in patterns and levels of shape disparity over ontogeny.
the transition from the more homogeneous oceanic environment to the coral reef offering a wide range of feeding habits, promotes increasing shape disparity of the head skeleton over the ontogeny of fishes.
at settlement, all larval shapes are already species-specific.
the rate of shape change and the length of ontogenetic trajectories seem to be less variable among species.
