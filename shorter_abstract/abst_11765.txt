split-decomposition analysis indicated that intraspecies recombination played a role in generating genotypic diversity amongst isolates.
phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of eight mlst loci indicated that the isolates belonged to two major groups, a  and b .
our results indicated that mlst is a valuable tool for typing l. lactis isolates that can be used for further monitoring of evolutionary changes and population genetics.
linkage disequilibrium analyses indicated that recombination occurred at a low frequency in l. lactis, indicating a clonal population structure.
economically, leuconostoc lactis is one of the most important species in the genus leuconostoc.
in this study, a novel mlst protocol was developed for  <dig> l. lactis isolates from mongolia and china.
multilocus sequence typing  is a robust and reliable method for characterising bacterial and fungal species at the molecular level.
