in c. elegans, a bmp-like pathway, the dbl- <dig> pathway, controls body size and is involved in innate immunity.
consistent with a role for dbl- <dig> in control of body size, we find positive regulation by dbl- <dig> of genes involved in physical structure, protein synthesis and degradation, and metabolism.
we also identified genes in a hedgehog-related pathway, which may comprise a secondary signaling pathway downstream of dbl- <dig> that controls body size.
our results indicate that body size in c. elegans is controlled in part by regulation of metabolic processes as well as protein synthesis and degradation.
however, cell cycle genes were mostly absent from our results.
in addition, dbl- <dig> signaling up-regulates pro-innate immunity genes.
we also identified the up-regulation of genes involved in innate immunity, clarifying the role of dbl- <dig> in innate immunity.
one of the highly regulated genes is expressed at very low levels in wild-type animals, but is strongly up-regulated in sma/mab mutants, making it a useful reporter for dbl-1/bmp-like signaling in c. elegans.
