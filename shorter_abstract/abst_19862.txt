mitochondrial synonymous rates also show the body mass effect, but for apparently quite different reasons, and the strength of the relationship with maximum lifespan provides support for the hypothesis that mtdna damage is causally linked to aging.
particular attention is paid to the widespread correlations between the components of mammalian life history, which can complicate the interpretation of results.
here we present a comprehensive study of the life history correlates of substitution rate variation across the mammals, comparing results for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and for synonymous and non-synonymous sites.
a substantial proportion of variation in mammalian substitution rates can be explained by aspects of their life history, implying that molecular and life history evolution are closely interlinked in this group.
in contrast to the mitochondrial results, the same trends are evident in rates of nonsynonymous substitution.
the strength and consistency of the nuclear body mass effect suggests that molecular dating studies may have been systematically misled, but also that methods could be improved by incorporating the finding as a priori information.
we find that mitochondrial synonymous substitution rates, estimated from the  <dig> longest mitochondrial genes, show strong negative correlations with body mass and with maximum recorded lifespan.
nuclear synonymous substitution rates, estimated from  <dig> genes, show strong negative correlations with body mass and generation time, and a strong positive correlation with fecundity.
but lifespan is the sole variable to remain after multiple regression and model simplification.
