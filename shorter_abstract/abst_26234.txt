different approaches were applied and found that a hybrid approach of binary and structural information achieved highest area under the curve  of  <dig> .
the hybrid approach is efficient not only to predict kingdom-wise modifications but also to classify them into two most prominent ums: pseudouridine  and dihydrouridine .
in the first step, we developed a common prediction model for all the kingdoms using a dataset from modomics- <dig>  support vector machine  based prediction models were developed and evaluated by five-fold cross-validation technique.
recently it has been shown that trna modifications play direct role in the genome structure and codon usage.
this study is an attempt to understand kingdom-wise trna modifications particularly uridine modifications , as majority of modifications are uridine-derived.
in the second step, we used newly added trna sequences  of modomics- <dig> for the kingdom-wise prediction performance evaluation of previously developed  common model and achieved performances between the auc of  <dig>  to  <dig> .
a three-steps strategy has been applied to develop an efficient method for the prediction of ums.
a webserver called trnamod  has been developed, which predicts ums from both trna sequences and whole genome.
in contrast, limited attempt has been made to understand post-transcriptional modifications.
in the third and last step, we used different datasets from modomics- <dig> for the kingdom-wise individual prediction models development and achieved performances between the auc of  <dig>  to  <dig> .
