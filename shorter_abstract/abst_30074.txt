one of these genes, un- <dig>  encodes both nonself recognition function and the large subunit of a type i ribonucleotide reductase, an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that is essential for the conversion of ndp precursors into dndps for use in dna synthesis.
our work shows that heat shock proteins may function to deactivate vegetative incompatibility systems, as required for entry into the sexual cycle.

previous studies have shown that co-expression of the two allelic forms of un- <dig>  oakridge  and panama , in the same cell results in cell death.
low-level expression of this domain results in several cytological and phenotypic characteristics consistent with an incompatibility reaction in filamentous fungi.
results from this study provide insights into the mechanism and control of vegetative nonself recognition mediated by ribonucleotide reductase in n. crassa, thus establishing the yeast system as a powerful tool to study fungal nonself recognition.
finally, our results suggest that variations on the pa incompatibility domain may serve as novel and specific antimicrobial peptides.
when the pa incompatibility domain is switched to high-level expression, the incompatibility phenotype transitions to wild-type concomitant with the appearance of a complex containing the pa incompatibility domain and ssa1p, an hsp <dig> homolog.
these incompatibility phenotypes are correlated with the presence of a non-reducible complex consisting of the pa incompatibility domain and rnr1p, a large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase in yeast.
we identify a  <dig> amino acid nonself recognition domain in the c-terminus region of un- <dig> that confers an incompatibility-like phenotype when expressed in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.
