association studies are of great interest to identify genes explaining trait variation since they deal with more than just a few alleles like classical qtl analyses.
gai was highly polymorphic with an average of  <dig> bp between two consecutive snps and  <dig> haplotypes in which  <dig> were more frequent.
synthetic varieties in which linkage disequilibrium declines rapidly with distance are suitable for association studies using the "candidate gene" approach.
they are usually performed using collections representing a wide range of variability but which could present a genetic substructure.
this demonstration is based on an example of association between the gibberellic acid insensitive gene  polymorphism and leaf length polymorphism in 'herbie', a synthetic variety of perennial ryegrass.
the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that association studies can be performed using synthetic varieties obtained after several panmictic generations.
leaf growth parameters, consisted of leaf length, maximum leaf elongation rate  and leaf elongation duration , were evaluated in spring and autumn on  <dig> plants of herbie with three replicates.
broad sense heritabilities were higher for leaf length and lermax with about  <dig>  in each period and  <dig>  considering both periods than for led with about  <dig>  in each period and  <dig>  considering both periods.
a single snp explained 4% of the phenotypic variance of leaf length in both periods which represents a difference of  <dig> mm on an average of  <dig> mm.
gai polymorphism was found to be associated with leaf length polymorphism which was more correlated to lermax than to led in herbie.
it is a good candidate to explain leaf length variation in other plant material.
sequence polymorphism of gai explained 8-14% of leaf growth parameter variation.
linkage disequilibrium declined rapidly with distance with r  <dig> values lower than  <dig>  beyond  <dig> bp.
genetic effect was highly significant for all traits.
