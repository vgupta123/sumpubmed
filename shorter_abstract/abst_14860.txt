thirty-four up-regulated components of the wnt pathway were identified in these spheres.
a few reports suggested that low levels of wnt signaling might drive cell reprogramming, but these studies could not establish a clear relationship between wnt signaling and self-renewal networks.
qpcr array analyses further revealed interactions of physiological wnt/β-catenin signaling with other pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tgf-β, activin, bmpr, fgfr <dig>  and lifr- and il6st-mediated cell self-renewal networks.
wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates self-renewal networks and plays a central role in the control of pluripotency genes, tumor suppressive pathways and expression of cancer stem cell markers.
the nasopharyngeal carcinoma hone <dig> cells have low expression of β-catenin and wild-type expression of p <dig>  which provided a possibility to study regulatory mechanism of stemness networks induced by physiological levels of wnt signaling in these cells.
introduction of increased β-catenin signaling, haploid expression of β-catenin under control by its natural regulators in transferred chromosome  <dig>  resulted in activation of wnt/β-catenin networks and dedifferentiation in hone <dig> hybrid cell lines, but not in esophageal carcinoma slmt <dig> hybrid cells that had high levels of endogenous β-catenin expression.
this current study provides a novel platform to investigate the interaction of physiological wnt/β-catenin signaling with stemness transition networks.

additionally, whether physiological β-catenin signaling generates stem-like cells through interactions with other pathways is as yet unclear.
hone <dig> hybrid cells displayed stem cell-like properties, including enhancement of cd24+ and cd44+ populations and generation of spheres that were not observed in parental hone <dig> cells.
