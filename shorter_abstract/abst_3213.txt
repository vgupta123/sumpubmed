the algorithm makes it possible to create complex queries based on the residues' function and then to compare only subsets of the selected residues.
functional information is also essential to speed up the comparison and the analysis of the results.
at the same time, the method also finds their structural neighbours in the whole pdb.
however, the lack of functional and structural information on single residues, together with the low level of integration of this information in comparison methods, is a limitation that prevents these methods from being fully exploited in high-throughput analyses.
the identification of local similarities between two protein structures can provide clues of a common function.
the method conserves a copy of all the residues of the protein data bank annotated with a variety of functional and structural information.
here we describe query3d, a program that is both a structural dbms  and a local comparison method.
