both transcriptome and metabolome data were visualized on a metabolic pathway map.
in order to combine datasets from heterogeneous "omics" sources, we present the web-based prometra system that visualizes and combines datasets from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics on user defined metabolic pathway maps.
enriched svg images or animations are generated and can be obtained via the user friendly web interface.
the interpretation and visualization of the results of this complex experiment was facilitated by the prometra software.
the rapid progress of post-genomic analyses, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has resulted in the generation of large amounts of quantitative data covering and connecting the complete cascade from genotype to phenotype for individual organisms.
to demonstrate the functionality of prometra, we use quantitative data obtained during a fermentation experiment of the l-lysine producing strain corynebacterium glutamicum dm <dig>  during fermentation, oxygen supply was switched off in order to perturb the system and observe its reaction.
at six different time points, transcript abundances, intracellular metabolite pools, as well as extracellular glucose, lactate, and l-lysine levels were determined.
the visualization of "omics" data using metabolic pathway maps is intuitive and has been applied in various software tools.
