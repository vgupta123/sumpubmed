we created novel donor and acceptor vectors that facilitate the transfer of expression cassettes from the donor into novel acceptor plasmid.
tetrahymena thermophila is one of the best characterized unicellular eukaryotes and its genome is sequenced in its entirety.
the cre dependent recombinase system in combination with the modular structure of the donor vectors ease cloning and expression of foreign genes in the ciliate system, providing a powerful tool for protistology research in future.
expression vectors were used that encode the  <dig> kda c-terminus of the msp <dig> protein of plasmodium falciparum and a blasticidin s  resistance gene, respectively.
to overcome these technical hiatuses we developed a cre-dependent recombinase system.
