as a novel exon-centric microarray platform, exon array enables a comprehensive analysis of as by investigating the expression of known and predicted exons.
identifying of as events from exon array has raised much attention, however, new and powerful algorithms for exon array data analysis are still absent till now.
as a new lasso regression algorithm based on hierarchical model, remas has been demonstrated as a reliable and effective method to identify as events from exon array data.
here, we considered identifying of as events in the framework of variable selection and developed a regression method for as detection .
alternative splicing  is an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression and protein diversity in eukaryotes.
secondly, we designed a hierarchical model which can represent gene structure and transcriptional influence to exons, and the lasso type penalties were introduced in calculation because of huge variable size.
to avoid negative effects introduced by small sample size, we ranked genes as parameters indicating their as capabilities in an iterative manner.
after that, both simulation and real data evaluation showed that remas could efficiently identify potential as events, some of which had been validated by rt-pcr or supported by literature evidence.
