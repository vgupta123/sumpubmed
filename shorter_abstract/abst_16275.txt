wt- and mmtv-neu cells formed aberrant acini structures resembling dcis, while ca-erbb <dig> overexpression induced invasive lesions.
we tested whether erbb <dig> signaling influenced eif2α signaling and whether enhanced phosphorylation of the latter affected erbb2-deregulated mammary acinar development.
this occurred without apparent modulation of basal phosphorylation of perk and eif2α or induction of its downstream target atf <dig>  however, inhibition of eif2α dephosphorylation with salubrinal was sufficient to inhibit wt- and ca-erbb2- as well as mmtv-neu-induced deregulation of acinar growth.
erbb <dig> uncouples in basal conditions eif2α phosphorylation from chop induction.
however, this signal was restored by salubrinal treatment in wt-erbb <dig> expressing mcf10a cells as these dcis-like structures underwent luminal clearing.
here we explore whether erbb <dig> modulates eif2α phosphorylation and whether forced phosphorylation of the latter can antagonize erbb <dig> deregulation of mammary acinar morphogenesis.
depending on the strength of erbb <dig> signaling there is a differential regulation of chop and eif2α phosphorylation.
this was linked to enhanced chop expression, inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and luminal clearing in wt-erbb <dig> and to inhibition of cyclin d <dig> levels and subsequent proliferation in ca-erbb <dig> cells.
we obtained stable mcf10a cells overexpressing wild-type  neu/erbb <dig> or a constitutively active  variant via retroviral delivery or mammary tumor cells from mmtv-neu tumors.
