we also present feedback provided by domain experts and discuss the benefits, as well as the limitations, of the approach.
the development of families of such models, either by a single research group or by different groups working within the same area, presents significant challenges that range from identifying structural similarities and differences between models to understanding how these differences affect system dynamics.
models are clustered using a custom similarity metric, and a visual interface is provided that allows a researcher to interactively compare the structures of pairs of models as well as view simulation results.
we illustrate the usefulness of mosbie via two case studies in the cell signaling domain.
