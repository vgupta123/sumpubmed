a new csfv-bac  derived from the riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the e <dig> coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses  with potential as new marker vaccine candidates.
the complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the e <dig> protein coding sequence were stably maintained.
these results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel rna genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other rna viruses.
here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses  from full-length cdnas present within bacterial artificial chromosomes  is described.
a single amino acid substitution  in the rna dependent rna polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vr26_e2gif and vr <dig>  which was reversion to the parental riems sequence.
this strategy allows manipulation of viral cdna by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria.
infectious cdna clones are a prerequisite for directed genetic manipulation of rna viruses.
