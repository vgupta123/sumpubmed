the new algorithm computes absent words for the human genome in  <dig> minutes on standard hardware, using only  <dig>  mb of space.
analysis of sequence composition is a routine task in genome research.
we describe a new algorithm and software for the computation of absent words.
relative to a random sequence of the same length, unique subsequences are overrepresented in real genomes.
we compute unwords of human and mouse as well as some other organisms, covering a genome size range from  <dig> down to  <dig> bp.
moreover, it avoids the space requirements of index structures such as suffix trees and suffix arrays.
shortest words absent from a genome have been addressed in two recent studies.
