here we describe and demonstrate a modified supermatrix method termed mega-phylogeny that uses databased sequences as well as taxonomic hierarchies to make extremely large trees with denser matrices than supermatrices.
large phylogenies have facilitated the discovery of differential rates of molecular evolution between trees and herbs.
the implemented algorithm is demonstrated with a dataset and phylogeny for asterales  containing  <dig> species and  <dig>  sites and an rbcl matrix for green plants  with  <dig>  species and  <dig>  sites.
these demonstrations underscore the importance of using large phylogenies to uncover important evolutionary patterns and we present a fast and simple method for constructing these phylogenies.
the phylogeny of viridiplantae successfully reconstructs major relationships of vascular plants that previously required many more genes.
the mega-phylogeny approach addresses the former as the latter is accomplished by employing recently developed methods that have greatly reduced the run time of large phylogeny construction.
although these methods are continually being developed, they have yet to be made fully accessible to comparative biologists making extremely large trees rare.
in addition to these broad evolutionary questions there is increasing awareness of the importance of large phylogenies for addressing conservation issues such as biodiversity hotspots and response to global change.
we present an algorithm that requires relatively little human intervention.
