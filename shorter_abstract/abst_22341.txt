a genetic map was constructed using  <dig> polymorphic markers .
comparison with already published chickpea genetic maps showed that these regions conferred salinity tolerance across two other populations and the markers can be deployed for enhancing salinity tolerance in chickpea.
although chickpea , an important food legume crop, is sensitive to salinity, considerable variation for salinity tolerance exists in the germplasm.
the qtl analysis revealed two key genomic regions on calg <dig>  and on calg <dig> , that harboured qtls for six and five different salinity tolerance associated traits, respectively, and imparting either higher plant vigour  or higher reproductive success .
in the present study,  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  derived from the cross iccv 2 × jg  <dig> were used to assess yield and related traits in a soil with 0 mm nacl  and 80 mm nacl  over two consecutive years.
based on the gene ontology annotation, forty eight putative candidate genes responsive to salinity stress were found on calg <dig>  and calg <dig>  in a distance of  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on chickpea reference genome.
two major qtls for yield in the salinity treatment  were identified within the two key genomic regions.
further fine mapping of these key genomic regions may lead to novel gene identification for salinity stress tolerance in chickpea.

salinity significantly  affected almost all traits across years and yield reduction was in large part related to a reduction in seed number but also a reduction in above ground biomass.
identification of putative candidate genes further strengthens the idea of using calg <dig> and calg <dig> genomic regions for marker assisted breeding .
