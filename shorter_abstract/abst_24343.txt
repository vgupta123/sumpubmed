a large number of bioinformatics applications in the fields of bio-sequence analysis, molecular evolution and population genetics typically share input/ouput methods, data storage requirements and data analysis algorithms.
available components include classes for data storage and handling , various input/output formats, basic sequence manipulation , phylogenetic analysis , population genetics/genomics  and various algorithms for numerical calculus.
such common features may be conveniently bundled into re-usable libraries, which enable the rapid development of new methods and robust applications.
a special concern was given to the library design to enable easy extension and new methods development.
we present bio++, a set of object oriented libraries written in c++.
