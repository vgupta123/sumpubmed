the evolution of land plants is characterized by whole genome duplications , which drove species diversification and evolutionary novelties.
because of its broad taxonomic sampling the dataset provides the basis for reliable future identification of further whole genome duplications.
established methods for reconstructing wgds include intra- and inter-genome comparisons, ks age distribution analyses, and phylogenetic tree constructions.
phylogenetic trees of the myosin motor domains revealed orthologous and paralogous relationships and were consistent with recent species trees.
based on the myosin inventories and the phylogenetic trees, we have identified duplications of the entire myosin motor protein family at timings consistent with  <dig> wgds, that had been reported before.
notably, the myosin data support the two recently reported wgds in the common ancestor of all extant angiosperms.
we predict single wgds in the manihot esculenta and nicotiana benthamiana lineages, two wgds for linum usitatissimum and phoenix dactylifera, and a triplication or two wgds for gossypium raimondii.
in contrast to other protein families, many myosins are still present in extant species.
we have shown that the myosin inventories in angiosperms retain evidence of numerous wgds that happened throughout plant evolution.
they are closely related and have similar domain architectures, and their phylogenetic grouping follows the genome duplications.
