the prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  was increased each year in a taiwan hospital.
one of the  <dig> fusidic acid-resistant mrsa harboured both fusb and fusc, which is the first time this has been identified.
low-level resistance to fusidic acid  was found in most our collection.
our results indicate that the increase in the number of fusidic acid resistant among the mrsa isolates in this hospital is due mainly to the distribution of fusc determinants.
moreover, more than one fusidic acid-resistance mechanism was first detected in a same stain in our collection.
the most common resistance determinant was fusc, found in  <dig> of the  <dig> mrsa isolates.
