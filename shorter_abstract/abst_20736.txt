the traditional knowledge in treatment of livestock diseases of the study districts needs further scientific evaluations by phytochemical and antimicrobial experimentation to determine safety, efficacy, mode of delivery, drug development and dosage in pharmacological laboratory.
traditional medicines have been used for nearly 90% of livestock populations in ethiopia where complimentary remedies are required to the modern health care system.
a community based cross - sectional survey was conducted to investigate ethno-veterinary knowledge and practices of study area by purposive sampling techniques.
the greater varieties of medicinal plant species that accounted for  <dig> % were used against management of blackleg which was common livestock diseases in the study area.

the three families: asteraceae, cucurbitaceae and solanaceae make up larger proportion of reported medicinal plants which accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
of reported medicinal plants,  <dig> % informant consensus was recorded for the species croton macrostachyus del.,  <dig> % for nicotiana tabacum l. and  <dig> % for olea capensis l.subsp.
eighty one percent of medicinal plants reported by respondents were collected from wild habitats, and leaves reported to be used by 68% of the informants for ethnoveterinary medicines preparations.
ethnoveterinary practices significantly suggested to play greater roles in livestock health care as an alternative or integral part of modern veterinary practices.
in the study, a total of  <dig> species of ethnoveterinary medicinal plant species from  <dig> families have been identified for treating  <dig> different livestock ailments.
