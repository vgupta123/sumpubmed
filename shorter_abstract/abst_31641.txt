modelling of time series data should not be an approximation of input data profiles, but rather be able to detect and evaluate dynamical changes in the time series data.
this method was applied to time series datasets from bacillus subtilis and arabidopsis thaliana grown under stress conditions; in the former, only gene expression was studied, whereas in the latter, both gene expression and metabolite accumulation.
here we demonstrate the effectiveness of a markov model, named the linear dynamical system, to simulate the dynamics of a transcript or metabolite time series, and propose a probabilistic index that enables detection of time-sensitive changes.
objective criteria that can be used to evaluate dynamical changes in data are therefore important to filter experimental noise and to enable extraction of unexpected, biologically important information.
our method not only identified well-known changes in gene expression and metabolite accumulation, but also detected novel changes that are likely to be responsible for each stress response condition.
