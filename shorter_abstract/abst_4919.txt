we recovered only three different sequences from  <dig> gal치pagos hawks, while we amplified  <dig> unique sequences in  <dig> swainson's hawks.
in small or bottlenecked populations, however, genetic drift may be strong enough to overwhelm the effect of balancing selection, resulting in reduced mhc variability.
the corresponding loss in neutral diversity suggests that the reduced variability present at gal치pagos hawk mhc class ii b genes compared to the swainson's hawk is primarily due to a founder event followed by ongoing genetic drift in small populations.
however, purifying selection could also explain the low number of mhc alleles present.
in this study we investigated mhc evolution in two recently diverged bird species: the endemic gal치pagos hawk , which occurs in small, isolated island populations, and its widespread mainland relative, the swainson's hawk .
genes at the major histocompatibility complex  are known for high levels of polymorphism maintained by balancing selection.
this lack of variation at genes involved in the adaptive immune response could be cause for concern should novel diseases reach the archipelago.
neutral genetic diversity at  <dig> microsatellite loci was also reduced in the gal치pagos hawk compared to the swainson's hawk.
most of the sequences clustered into two groups in a phylogenetic network, with one group likely representing pseudogenes or nonclassical loci.
