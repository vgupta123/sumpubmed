although all the observed biases are less pronounced than the  <dig> -fold excess of c > t mutations in cg dinucleotides, the three  <dig> bp mutation contexts mentioned above  are well distinguished from all other mutation contexts.
we compared rates of inherited mutations in 1- <dig> bp nucleotide contexts using reconstructed ancestral states of human single nucleotide polymorphisms  from intergenic regions.
the molecular mechanisms underlying this bias are important factors in human genome evolution and cancer development.
we uncovered  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold excesses of t > c mutations in the second position of attg and atag words, respectively, and a  <dig> -fold excess of a > c mutations in the first position of the acaa word.
the substitution rates within different nucleotide contexts are subject to varying levels of bias.
the discovery of other nucleotide contexts that have profound effects on substitution rates can improve our understanding of how mutations are acquired, and why mutation hotspots exist.
