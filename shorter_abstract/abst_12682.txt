we used these characteristics to predict the metabolic involvement for a transcriptional regulator  of unknown function, identified and confirmed its biological activity.
we analyzed bxe_b <dig> from burkholderia xenovorans, a tr of unknown function and predicted that this tr was related to the glycine, threonine and serine degradation.
these studies provide the proof of concept and validation of a systematic approach to the discovery of the biological activity for proteins of unknown function, in this case a tr.
a software tool that identifies the genes encoded within a defined genomic neighborhood for the subject tr and its homologs was developed.
when a set of trs of known function was analyzed, we observed that their homologs frequently had conserved genomic neighborhoods that co-located the metabolically related genes regulated by the subject tr.
the output lists of genes in the genetic neighborhoods, their annotated functions, the reactants/products, and identifies the metabolic pathway in which the encoded-proteins function.

bxe_b <dig> is a methylglyoxal responsive tr that controls the expression of an operon composed of a putative efflux system.
