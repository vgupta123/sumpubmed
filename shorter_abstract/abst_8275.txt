the nerve net of nematostella is generated using a conserved cascade of neurogenic transcription factors.
however, positive regulators required for the expression of neurogenic transcription factors remain poorly understood.
double fluorescence in situ hybridization and transgenic analysis confirmed that nvasha targets represent both unique and overlapping populations of neurons.
our forward molecular approach provided insight about the mechanisms of embryonic neurogenesis.
we show that treatment with the mek/mapk inhibitor u <dig> severely reduces the expression of known neurogenic genes, nvath-like, nvsoxb, and nvasha, and known markers of differentiated neurons, suggesting that mapk signaling is necessary for neural development.
interestingly, ectopic nvasha fails to rescue the expression of neural markers in u0126-treated animals.
lastly, analysis of the mapk targets in the early embryo suggests that mapk signaling is critical not only to neurogenesis, but also endomesoderm formation and aboral patterning.
for example, nvasha, a homolog of the achaete-scute family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is necessary and sufficient to specify a subset of embryonic neurons.
we identified  <dig> likely neural transcription factors, and surprisingly identified ~ <dig> signaling genes and transcription factors that are expressed in either the aboral domain or animal pole that gives rise to the endomesoderm at late blastula stages.
