interestingly, attachment of leukocytes, platelets, and insect haemocytes requires the same adhesion complexes as epithelial and neuronal cells.
in mammalian neuronal cells phosphorylated neurofascin, another l1-type cell adhesion molecule interacts with a nucleokinesis complex containing the microtubule binding protein lissencephaly- <dig>   <cit> .
at the cell periphery of haemocytes neuroglian may be involved in cell-cell interactions, while at the cell centre neuroglian regulates the localisation of the nucleokinesis complex protein lissencephaly- <dig>
the amino acid sequence figqy containing a conserved phosphorylated tyrosine is found in the intracellular domain of all l1-type cell adhesion molecules.
this conserved tyrosine is phosphorylated at the cell periphery of plasmatocytes and lamellocytes prior to parasitisation, but dephosphorylated after immune activation.
after attaching to the wasp egg control plasmatocytes extend filopodia laterally from their cell periphery; as well as extending lateral filopodia plasmatocytes from nrg mutants also extend many filopodia from their apical surface.
the drosophila cellular adhesion molecule neuroglian is expressed in haemocytes and its activity is required for the encapsulation of l. boularli eggs.
this requires these circulating immunosurveillance cells  to change from a non-adhesive to an adhesive state enabling them to bind to the invader.
