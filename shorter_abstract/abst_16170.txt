the reliability of the method was tested using mixtures of cdna templates as well as rna samples from different sources.
the method described here, is easy to set up and does not need unrelated reference genes and time consuming, error-prone standard curves.
here, we present an improved method to determine the relative incidence of transcripts that arise from alternative splicing at a single site.
independent calculations of the relative incidence of each variant were performed.
since the relative incidences of variants have to add upto 100Â %, the method provides an internal control to monitor experimental errors and uniform reverse transcription.
it provides a reliable and precise technique to distinguish small differences of the relative incidence of two splice variants.
the majority of protein isoforms arise from alternative splicing of the encoding primary rna transcripts.
splice variants were quantified within a single sample using one-step reverse transcription quantitative pcr.
amplification products obtained with variant specific primer pairs were compared to those obtained with primer pairs common to both variants.
the identities of variant specific amplicons were simultaneously verified by melt curve analysis.
