we provide a better visualization and analysis tool named tv-curve of rna, especially for long rna, which can characterize both sequence and structure features.
firstly, we designed a novel numerical representation of rna secondary structure termed as rna triple vectors curve .

additionally, based on tv-curve representation of rnas, a multi-scale similarity measure for rna comparison is proposed, which can capture the local and global difference between the information of sequence and structure of rnas.
in order to comprehensively understand the rnaâ€™s function, the better similarity measure among rnas should be designed to consider their structure features .
furthermore, we compared the results to the two well-known rna comparison tools: rnadistance and rnapdist.
the results in this paper show the potentials of our method in rna classification and rna mutation analysis.
current methods for rna comparison could be generally classified into alignment-based and alignment-free.
in this paper, we propose a novel wavelet-based method based on rna triple vector curve representation, named multi-scale rna comparison.
compared with the well-known rna comparison approaches, the proposed method is validated to be outstanding and effective in terms of non-coding rna classification and rna mutation analysis.
