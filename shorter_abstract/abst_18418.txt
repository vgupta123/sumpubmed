we have developed a high throughput, quantitatively precise multi-analyte gene expression platform for biomarker discovery that approaches low density dna arrays in numbers of genes analyzed while maintaining the high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility that are characteristics of rt-pcr.
multiplexed reverse transcription reactions were performed using a gene specific primer pool containing  <dig> unique primers.
we have recently shown that taqmanÂ® rt-pcr can be scaled up to profile expression for  <dig> genes in fixed paraffin-embedded  clinical study tumor specimens.
we have now scaled our rt-pcr assay to efficiently screen  <dig> biomarkers across hundreds of patient samples and applied this process to biomarker discovery in colon cancer.
hierarchal clustering demonstrates that genes expected to co-express form obvious, distinct and in certain cases very tightly correlated clusters, validating the reliability of this technical approach to biomarker discovery.
a similar need exists in colon cancer for a test that provides information on the likelihood of disease recurrence in colon cancer  and the likelihood of tumor response to standard chemotherapy regimens .
rna was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded  tissue, as old as  <dig> years, from  <dig> patients enrolled in nsabp c- <dig> and c- <dig> colon cancer studies.
reverse transcription pcr  is widely recognized to be the gold standard method for quantifying gene expression.
studies using rt-pcr technology as a discovery tool have historically been limited to relatively small gene sets compared to other gene expression platforms such as microarrays.
