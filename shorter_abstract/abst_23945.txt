comparative analysis of the transcriptome of six conifer species yielded  <dig> orthologues, from which we inferred a phylogenetic tree, evolutionary patterns and calculated rates of gene diversion.
furthermore, these data will facilitate future studies of the comparative genomics of p. tabuliformis and other related species.
the first p. tabuliformis transcriptome from a normalised cdna library of multiple tissues and individuals was sequenced in a full  <dig> gs-flx run, producing  <dig>  sequencing reads.
large-scale transcriptome data were obtained using a next-generation sequencing platform to compensate for the lack of p. tabuliformis genomic information.
a large collection of high-quality ests was obtained, de novo assembled and characterised, which represents a dramatic expansion of the current transcript catalogues of p. tabuliformis and which will gradually be applied in breeding programs of p. tabuliformis.
we also identified  <dig> fast evolving sequences that may be useful for identifying genes that perhaps evolved in response to positive selection and might be responsible for speciation in the pinus lineage.
the increasing amount of transcriptome data on pinus provides an excellent resource for multi-gene phylogenetic analysis and studies on how conserved genes and functions are maintained in the face of species divergence.
the chinese pine  is an indigenous conifer species in northern china but is relatively underdeveloped as a genomic resource; thus, limiting gene discovery and breeding.
