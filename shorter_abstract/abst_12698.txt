species coexistence in mosquito assemblages may depend on mechanisms related to interspecific resource partitioning occurring at multiple scales.
in the present work we investigated co-occurrence or spatial segregation in mosquito assemblages sharing resources at micro-habitat, habitat and landscape scales.
huisman-olff-fresco  and generalized additive  models were employed to explore relationships between abundances of potential competitors in mosquito assemblages and vegetation gradient .
co-occurrences and spatial segregation of mosquito species showed evidences of three scales of coexistence mechanisms: 1) micro-habitat - scale 1: different behaviors in response to food availability in specific vertical strata within larval container; 2) habitat - scale 2: specialized strategies related to heterogeneity of resource availability among larval containers and 3) landscape - scale 3: asymmetrical competition dependent upon the context of abiotic and biotic variables.
results of the present work suggest that coexistence mechanisms can concomitantly work at multiple scales.
we tested hypotheses concerning mosquito species co-occurrence or spatial segregation employing binomial logistic regression models.
