we present a variable-order paired hmm that we term varhmm, which addresses central issues involved with higher order modeling for sequence alignment.
genome sequencing provides a powerful tool for pathogen detection and can help resolve outbreaks that pose public safety and health risks.
in a series of comparison tests, in which ion torrent sequenced dna was mapped to similar bacterial strains, varhmm consistently provided better strain discrimination than any of the other alignment methods that we compared with.
our results demonstrate the advantages of higher ordered probability distribution modeling and also suggest that further development of such models would benefit read mapping in a range of other applications as well.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
compared with existing alignment methods, varhmm is able to model higher order distributions and quantify alignment probabilities with greater detail and accuracy.
accuracy might be improved by using higher order paired hidden markov models , which model neighbor effects, but introduce design and implementation issues that have typically made them impractical for read mapping applications.
