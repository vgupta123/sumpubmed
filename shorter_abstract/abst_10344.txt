there is limited information about the mechanisms and signal transduction pathways involved in adenoviral recognition.
the aim of this study was to investigate the signal transduction of the innate immunity after adenoviral dna internalization in keratinocytes.
a stable transgene expression and a reduced inflammatory response in immunodeficient mice have been observed.
for optimization of cutaneous gene therapy it is necessary to investigate molecular mechanisms of virus recognition in epidermal cells.
the results suggest an induction of the innate immunity triggered by cytoplasm localised dna which is mediated by pi3k-, p <dig> mapk-, jnk-, nfkappab-, jak/stat- and erk1/2-dependent pathways.
the results show an acute induction of type-i-interferon after in vitro transfection.
these results provide potential for an effective adenoviral gene delivery into immunosupressed skin.
in vivo, immunocompetent and athymic mice  were twice transduced with an ad-vector.
in contrast to immunocompetent mice, athymic mice demonstrated a constant transgene expression and reduced inflammatory response in vivo.
adenoviral vectors have provided effective methods for in vivo gene delivery in therapeutic applications.
