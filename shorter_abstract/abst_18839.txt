the innate immune system plays an important role in the defense against different infections.
low-producer mbl <dig> genotypes were associated with an increased number of fungal infections in asct patients, which would suggest that mbl has a protective role against such infections.
asct patients with mbl <dig> variant genotypes are more likely to die as a result of an infection.
although not statistically significant, there was a higher incidence of major infections in the mbl <dig> variant group as well as a higher number of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
serious infections are common in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation  mainly because of the effects of immunosuppression.
multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression.
a statistically significant higher number of fungal infections was found in patients with mbl <dig> variants causing low mbl levels .
relative risks   as measure of association were calculated.
there are several promoter polymorphisms and structural variants of the mbl <dig> gene that encodes for this protein.
the incidence, severity of infections and mortality in  <dig> consecutive patients with hematologic diseases who underwent asct between february  <dig> and june  <dig> in a tertiary referral center were analyzed according to their mbl <dig> genotype.
