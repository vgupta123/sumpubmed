these data taken together suggest that ige in the absence of antigen promotes hlmc survival through the autocrine production of il- <dig>  this provides a further mechanism through which il- <dig> and ige contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma, and through which anti-ige therapy might achieve its therapeutic effect.
quantitative real time rt-pcr was carried out to examine il- <dig> mrna expression and il- <dig> protein was measured in hlmc supernatants by elisa.
purified hlmc were cultured for  <dig> weeks and survival assays then performed over  <dig> days following cytokine withdrawal in the presence or absence of human myeloma ige.
ige alone promoted the survival of hlmc in a dose-dependent manner following cytokine withdrawal.
mast cells play a key role in asthma and recent evidence indicates that their ongoing activation in this disease is mediated, in part, via ige in the absence of antigen.
