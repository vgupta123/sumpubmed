in this study, tracheid wall structures and compositions of two grades of mcws  and scw were investigated and compared with ow in slightly tilted radiata pine  stems.
the neutral monosaccharide compositions of the non-cellulosic polysaccharides of these wood types were determined on small, well defined discs, and showed the proportion of galactose was higher for cws and increased with severity.
the tracheid walls of these wood types differ structurally and chemically.
the four wood types were identified by the distribution of lignin in their tracheid walls.
only the tracheid walls of ow and mcw <dig> had a s <dig> layer and this was thin in mcw <dig>  the tracheid walls of only scw had a s <dig> layer with helical cavities in the inner region .
using immunomicroscopy, -β-d-galactans and -β-d-glucans were detected in the tracheid walls of all cws, but in only trace amounts in ow.
the proportions of galactose were consistent with the labelling results for -β-d-galactans.
areas containing the four wood types were clearly differentiated depending on colour intensity.
although much is known about the most severe form of cw, severe cw , mild cws , also occur, but less is known about them.
the -β-d-galactans were located in the outer region of the s <dig> layer, whereas the -β-d-glucans were in the inner s2i region.
the areas and intensities of labelling increased with cw severity.
the presence of an s <dig> wall layer is a marker for very mcw and the presence of helical cavities in the s <dig> wall layer for scw.
