sequencing libraries were prepared with both poly-dt and random hexamer primers to detect all rna classes, including long non-coding , intronic and intergenic transcripts, and transcripts lacking poly-a tails, providing additional data not previously available.
rna sequencing identifies distinct and consistent differences in gene expression between brain regions, with non-coding rna displaying greater diversity between brain regions than mrnas.
we used rna sequencing to analyze transcript profiles of ten autopsy brain regions from ten subjects.
brain regions were selected from five subjects with a documented history of smoking and five non-smokers.
the study was designed to generate a database of the complete transcriptomes in brain region for gene network analyses and discovery of regulatory variants.
profiles of rna isoforms varied across brain regions and subjects at multiple gene loci, with neurexin  <dig>  a prominent example.
mathematical modeling was used to identify rnas stably expressed in all brain regions , linked to basic cellular functions.

an initial analysis of differential expression analysis between smokers and nonsmokers implicated a number of genes, several previously associated with nicotine exposure.
allelic rna ratios deviating from unity were identified in >  <dig> genes, detectable in both protein-coding and non-coding genes, indicating the presence of cis-acting regulatory variants.
