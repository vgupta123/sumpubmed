the present study asked whether the processing of affective prosody is modulated by spatial attention.
pseudo-words with a neutral, happy, threatening, and fearful prosody were presented at two spatial positions.
the electro-encephalogram  was recorded to assess processing differences as a function of spatial attention and emotional valence.
while emotional prosody effects interacted with effects of spatial attention at early processing levels , these effects were additive at later processing stages .
emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention.
whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.
event-related potentials  differed as a function of emotional prosody both when attended and when unattended.
