taken together, the results suggest that translational selection is the dominant mechanism underlying the control of differential protein expression in these organisms.
synonymous codon bias is correlated with trna gene copy number and with protein expression level in trypanosomatids.
here, the evidence for translational selection, the enrichment of 'favoured' codons in more highly expressed genes, is explored.
consistent with translational selection, cognate trna genes for favoured codons are over-represented.
a set of highly expressed, tandem-repeated genes display codon bias in trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosoma brucei and leishmania major.
importantly, codon usage  correlates with predicted and observed expression level.
different proteins are required in widely different quantities to build a living cell.
in addition, relative codon bias is broadly conserved among syntenic genes from different trypanosomatids.
in most organisms, transcription control makes a major contribution to differential expression.
