novel genetic constructions for the expression of heterologous proteins combined with optimized cultivation method allowed to obtain the secretion level of biologically active recombinant fviii increased by almost ten times as compared with the previously published analogues.
purified fviii-bdd has a specific activity of  <dig>  iu/mg, similar to known recombinant fviii drugs.
efficacy and safety of this fviii deletion variant are similar to full-length fviii preparations while the level of production in cho cells is substantially higher.
the recombinant fviii-bdd was produced in cho cells without addition of any animal-derived materials, purified and characterized.

typical levels of productivity for cho cell lines producing deletion variant fviii-bdd sq, described elsewhere, are  <dig> –2 iu/ml, corresponding to the concentration of fviii of about  <dig>  μg/ml.
using standard vectors based on the cytomegalovirus promoter  and the dihydrofolate reductase cdna we have previously obtained the cell line secreting  <dig>  iu/ml of fviii-bdd, which roughly corresponds to the previously published data.
its productivity may be further increased approximately two-fold by adding sodium butyrate and butylated hydroxyanisol to the culture medium.
recombinant factor viii , used for haemophilia a therapy, is one of the most challenging among the therapeutic proteins produced in heterologous expression systems.
a five-stage purification process for the factor viii was employed.
it allowed isolation of the intact fviii-bdd as was confirmed by mass spectrometry.
