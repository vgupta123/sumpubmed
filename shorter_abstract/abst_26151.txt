in pten-null cells, these waves still propagate with normal speed but loose their regular periodicity.
in a motile polarized cell the actin system is differentiated to allow protrusion at the front and retraction at the tail.
transitions in the actin system propagate as waves that are initiated at single sites by the amplification of spontaneous fluctuations.
the modes of state transitions in the actin and pten systems differ.
the state transitions in actin organization and the reversible transition from cytoplasmic to membrane-bound pten are synchronized but their patterns differ.
to study de-novo cell polarization, we first depolymerized actin and subsequently recorded the spontaneous reorganization of actin patterns in relation to pten.
in a transient stage of recovery from depolymerization, symmetric actin patterns alternate periodically with asymmetric ones.
this differentiation is linked to the phosphoinositide pattern in the plasma membrane.
the transitions in actin organization are independent of pten, but when pten is present, they are coupled to periodic changes in the membrane-binding of this pip3-degrading phosphatase.
