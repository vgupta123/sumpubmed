the protein uses internal serine and glutamine ladders for stabilization and is predicted to dimerize via the burying of a solvent-exposed tyrosine ladder to make an intimate hydrophobic contact along the dimerization interface.
both sides of the pbinp structure have tandem arrays of amino acids that can organize waters into the ice-like clathrate structures seen on antifreeze proteins.
as pbinp is highly similar to all known bacterial inps, we predict its fold and mechanism of action will apply to these other inps.
the manner in which pbinp dimerizes also allows for its multimerization, which could explain the aggregation-dependence of inp activity.
dimerization dramatically increases the 'ice-active' surface area of the protein by doubling its width, increasing its length, and presenting identical ice-forming surfaces on both sides of the protein.
