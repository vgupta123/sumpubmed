physical maps allow the description of the co-linearity between wheat and grass genomes and provide a powerful tool for positional cloning of new genes.
we observed chromosomal rearrangements between ae.
the  <dig> contigs were aligned to the rice and b. distachyon genomic sequences and a high density snp genetic map of barley.
as expected, the mapped region is highly collinear to the orthologous chromosome  <dig> in rice, chromosome  <dig> in b. distachyon and chromosome 3h in barley.
gene co-linearity between the grasses can be exploited by extrapolating from rice and brachypodium distachyon to ae.
tauschii for the construction of the physical map of a large distal region of chromosome arm 3ds.
tauschii physical and genetic maps showed that the recombination rate across the region dropped from  <dig>  cm/mb in the distal region to  <dig>  cm/mb in the proximal region.
physical maps employing libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome  clones are essential for comparative genomics and sequencing of large and repetitive genomes such as those of the hexaploid bread wheat.
the barley diploid genome also provides a good model for the triticeae and t. aestivum since it is only slightly larger than the ancestor wheat d genome.
a physical map of  <dig>  mb was constructed by anchoring bac clones of ae.
the physical map reported here is the first physical map using fingerprinting of a complete triticeae genome.
this study demonstrates that global fingerprinting of the large plant genomes is a viable strategy for generating physical maps.
the size of the gaps between contigs was evaluated by comparing the recombination rate along the map with the local recombination rates calculated on single contigs.
