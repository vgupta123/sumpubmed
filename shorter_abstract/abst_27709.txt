it can also contribute immensely in the existing mulberry improvement programs.
high potential of morus laevigata and morus serrata has been proposed in the breeding programs for morus sp.
we thus, sequenced the transcriptomes of these two wild morus species and utilized the data for marker development.

we generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb of transcriptome data from m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively.
the transcriptomes from m. laevigata and m. serrata, were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts, respectively, and annotated.
