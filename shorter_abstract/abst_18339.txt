aims of this study were three-fold:  to determine unique temporal magnetic resonance imaging  patterns at the acute, subacute and chronic stages after stroke in macaques by combining quantitative t <dig> and diffusion mri indices into mri ‘tissue signatures’,  to evaluate temporal differences in these signatures between transient  and permanent  middle cerebral artery occlusion, and  to correlate histopathology findings in the chronic stroke period to the acute and subacute mri derived tissue signatures.
these exploratory results demonstrate the potential of temporally and spatially combined voxel-based methods to generate tissue signatures that may correlate with distinct histopathological features.

another signature identified less severe but pronounced neuronal and axonal degeneration, while the other signatures depicted tissue remodeling with vascular proliferation and astrogliosis.
two signatures identified areas of progressive injury marked by severe necrosis and the presence of gitter cells.
