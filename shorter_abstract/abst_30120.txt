our evaluation demonstrates that the mba system performs better than the others.
we propose a systematic method to extract abbreviations effectively.
existing approaches fall into four broad categories: rule based, machine learning based, text alignment based and statistically based.
a literature mining system mba was constructed to extract both acronym-type and non-acronym-type abbreviations.
we present a new literature mining system mba for extracting biomedical abbreviations.
at first a scoring method is used to classify the abbreviations into acronym-type and non-acronym-type abbreviations, and then their corresponding definitions are identified by two different methods: text alignment algorithm for the former, statistical method for the latter.
state of the art methods either focus exclusively on acronym-type abbreviations, or could not recognize rare abbreviations.
it can identify the definition of not only acronym-type abbreviations including a little irregular acronym-type abbreviations , but also non-acronym-type abbreviations .
an abbreviation-tagged literature corpus, called medstract gold standard corpus, was used to evaluate the system.
mba achieved a recall of 88% at the precision of 91% on the medstract gold-standard evaluation corpus.
