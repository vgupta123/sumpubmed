here we compare how several scoring functions perform on both real and semi-simulated data sets in a common test environment.
transcription factor binding site  prediction is a difficult problem, which requires a good scoring function to discriminate between real binding sites and background noise.
many scoring functions have been proposed in the literature, but it is difficult to assess their relative performance, because they are implemented in different software tools using different search methods and different tfbs representations.
llbg may provide an interesting alternative to current scoring functions for tfbs prediction.
scoring functions based on positional bias performed quite poorly in this study.
