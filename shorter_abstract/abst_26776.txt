knowing the transcription factor activity  can be exploited to predict novel target genes regulated by the same transcription factor.
we then apply the model to time course gene expression data obtained from chemostat cultures of m. tuberculosis under reduced oxygen availability.
chemostat cultures are an ideal experimental system for controlling noise and variability when monitoring the response of bacterial organisms such as m. tuberculosis to finely controlled changes in culture conditions and available metabolites.
time course gene expression data enable us to dissect this response on the gene regulatory level.
various approaches have been proposed to reconstruct tfas from gene expression data.
to test the validity of the proposed approach, we reconstruct the hidden tfa of p <dig>  a tumour suppressor activated by dna damage, using published time course gene expression data.
after estimation of the tfa of dosr based on a number of known target genes using the gp model, we predict novel dosr-regulated genes: the parameters of the model are interpreted as relevance parameters indicating an existing functional relationship between tfa and gene expression.
apart from the documented dosr-regulated genes, our prediction yields ten novel genes under direct control of dosr.
in this paper, we approach the problem of inferring dynamic hidden tfas using gaussian processes .
nonlinear hidden tfa dynamics of regulators can be reconstructed remarkably well with gaussian processes from such data.
most of them capture only a first-order approximation to the complex transcriptional processes by assuming linear gene responses and linear dynamics in tfa, or ignore the temporal information in data from such systems.
