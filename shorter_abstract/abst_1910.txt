here we show that, despite their high similarity, gdf <dig> is a more potent activator of smad2/ <dig> and signals more effectively through the type i activin-like receptor kinase receptors alk4/5/ <dig> than gdf <dig>  resolution of the gdf11:fs <dig> complex, apo-gdf <dig>  and apo-gdf <dig> crystal structures reveals unique properties of both ligands, specifically in the type i receptor binding site.
