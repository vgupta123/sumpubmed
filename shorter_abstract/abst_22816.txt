greek males only show increased copulation duration when exposed to four or more rival males.
these results illustrate the difficulties in determining the mating system of a species, even one that is well known and an excellent laboratory species, with results being highly dependent on the conditions used to assay the behaviour, and the population used.
we make a distinction between pseudopolyandry, where a female remates after an ineffective first mating that is incapable of fertilising her eggs, and true polyandry, where a female remates even though she has received suitable sperm from a previous mating.
we find a low rate of true polyandry by females , with no difference between populations.
the rate of true polyandry is affected by temperature, but not starvation.
pseudopolyandry is three times as common as true polyandry, and most females showing pseudopolyandry mated at their first opportunity after their first failed mating.
in line with previous work, english flies responded to one or more rivals by increasing their copulation duration, a response previously thought to be driven by sperm competition.
this suggests that the response to rivals in d. subobscura is not related to sperm competition, because sperm competition is rare, and there is no correlation of response to rivals and mating system across the populations.
reports from england, spain and canada suggest d. subobscura is entirely monandrous, with no females remating.
we examine the willingness of female d. subobscura to remate in the laboratory in a range of conditions, using flies from both greece and england.
