however, this species lacks a platform for global gene expression profiling, so we designed a first generation high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform based on channel catfish est sequences.
in the spleen samples,  <dig> genes were significantly induced or repressed greater than 2-fold by lps treatment.
real-time rt-pcr was used to verify the microarray results for nine selected genes representing different expression levels.
the results from real-time rt-pcr were positively correlated  with the results from the microarray.
this research will help us to better understand recognition of lps by host cells and the lps-signalling pathway in fish.
