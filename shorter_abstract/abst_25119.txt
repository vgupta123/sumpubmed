long terminal repeat  retrotransposons are a widespread kind of transposable element present in eukaryotic genomes.
one new superfamily is a major subdivision of the pao superfamily which we propose to call dan, because it is restricted to the genome of the zebrafish danio rerio.
we confirm findings from previous studies that bel/pao elements do not occur in mammals.
compared to other transposable elements, little attention has been paid to elements belonging to the metazoan bel/pao subclass of ltr retrotransposons.
they are a major factor in genome evolution due to their ability to create large scale mutations and genome rearrangements.
the elements we found can be grouped into more than  <dig> families,  <dig> of which are new, previously unknown families.
in sum, our analysis identifies thousands of new bel/pao elements and provides new insights into their distribution, abundance, and evolution.
our analysis shows that bel/pao elements are the second-most abundant class of ltr retrotransposons in the genomes we study, more abundant than ty1/copia elements, and second only to ty3/gypsy elements.
the aim of this study was to describe all bel/pao elements in a set of  <dig> sequenced metazoan genomes, and to analyze their phylogenetic relationship.
we identified a total of  <dig>  bel/pao elements in  <dig> of our  <dig> study genomes.
we identified bel/pao elements in  <dig> genomes where such elements had not been found so far.
they occur in multiple phyla, including basal metazoan phyla, suggesting that bel/pao elements arose early in animal evolution.
bel/pao elements do not show any signs of recent horizontal gene transfer between distantly related species.
