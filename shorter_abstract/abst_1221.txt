driven by the increase in p. vivax cases and stronger need for vaccine and drug development, several p. vivax isolates genome sequencing projects are underway.
this novel sequencing method can be used as an essential tool for the genomic research of p. vivax in the near future.
we present a 539-snp marker data set for p. vivax that can identify different parasites from different geographic origins with high sensitivity.
we also identified exceptionally high levels of genetic variability in members of multigene families such as rbp, sera, vir, msp <dig> and ap <dig>  the de-novo assembly yielded a database composed of  <dig>  contigs with n <dig> lengths of  <dig> Â kb and revealed  <dig> novel predicted genes including  <dig> vir genes, suggesting a greater functional variation in p. vivax from this area.
currently in china, the trend of plasmodium vivax cases imported from southeast asia was increased especially in the china-myanmar border area.
the sequencing of the first p. vivax isolate from china-myanmar border area  generated  <dig> million paired-end reads.
our result contributes to a better understanding of p. vivax genetic variation, and provides a fundamental basis for the geographic differentiation of vivax malaria from china-myanmar border area using a direct sequencing approach without leukocyte depletion.
a percentage of  <dig>  of the quality-evaluated reads were aligned onto  <dig> % of the reference strain sal i genome in 62-fold coverage with an average of  <dig>  snps per kb.
however, little is known about the genetic variability in this area until now.
