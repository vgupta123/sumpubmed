we demonstrate the ability of jyde to distribute the load of genomic-scale fold recognition across multiple independent grid domains.
using our jyde system we have been able to annotate  <dig> % of the protein sequences within the human proteome in less than  <dig> hours, by harnessing over  <dig> cpus from  <dig> independent grid domains.
in this paper we describe and benchmark the jyde  system, which is a meta-scheduler designed to work above cluster schedulers, such as sun grid engine  or condor.
this study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out on demand high quality structural annotations for the proteomes of major eukaryotic organisms.
we show that our jyde system is able to scale to large numbers of intensive fold recognition jobs running across several independent computer clusters.
providing the highest quality structural models requires the most intensive profile-profile fold recognition methods running with the very latest available sequence databases and fold libraries.
we use the most recent profile-profile version of our mgenthreader software in order to annotate the latest version of the human proteome against the latest sequence and structure databases in as short a time as possible.
specifically, we have shown that it is now possible to provide complete regular updates of profile-profile based fold recognition models for entire eukaryotic proteomes, through the use of grid middleware such as jyde.
