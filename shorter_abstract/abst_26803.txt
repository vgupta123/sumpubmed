an k290y/r319w double mutant restoring the typical aromatic amino acids found in the binding cleft resulted in a 20 °c relative increase in the thermal stability.
the caskin <dig> sh <dig> domain for an nmr structural determination because its peptide-binding cleft appeared to deviate from the repertoire of aromatic enriched amino acids that typically bind polyproline-rich sequences.
the structure demonstrated that two non-canonical basic amino acids  in the binding cleft were accommodated well in the sh <dig> fold.
caskin <dig> is a neuronal signaling scaffolding protein comprised of multiple ankyrin repeats, two sam domains, and one sh <dig> domain.
this observation led us to additionally survey and describe other sh <dig> domains in the protein data bank that may have similarly lost their ability to promote protein-protein interactions.
