the outcome is a unique response that involves genes related to light, nutrient deficiency, abiotic stress, and defence responses.
differentially expressed genes were enriched in genes involved in nutrient deficiency , perception of light quality, and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses.

using microarrays, we analysed whole-genome expression changes in arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to intraspecific competition.
this study provides a comprehensive list of genes whose expression is affected by intraspecific competition in arabidopsis.
complex adaptive responses to such situation are poorly understood at the molecular level.
