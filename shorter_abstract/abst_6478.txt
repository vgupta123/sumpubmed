existing protocols for picogram-scale libraries require concomitant fragmentation of dna, pre-amplification, or long overnight steps.
we demonstrate the utility of this method by constructing a chip-seq library from  <dig> pg of chip dna that demonstrates equivalent genomic coverage of target regions to a library produced from a larger scale experiment.
this protocol yields conventional libraries with barcodes suitable for multiplexed sample analysis on the illumina platform.
however, techniques that enrich dna where regulatory activity takes place, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation , often yield less dna than optimal for sequencing library preparation.
high throughput sequencing is frequently used to discover the location of regulatory interactions on chromatin.
