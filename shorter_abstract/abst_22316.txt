in this manuscript, we show examples of its application to a large-scale model of signal transduction.
the cell collective is a web-based platform that enables laboratory scientists from across the globe to collaboratively build large-scale models of various biological processes, and simulate/analyze them in real time.
as such, the holistic study of biochemical pathways requires computer modeling.
the cell collective is a platform that allows the world-wide scientific community to create these models collectively.
despite decades of new discoveries in biomedical research, the overwhelming complexity of cells has been a significant barrier to a fundamental understanding of how cells work as a whole.
in addition, this platform allows scientists to simulate and analyze the models in real-time on the web, including the ability to simulate loss/gain of function and test what-if scenarios in real time.
