based on ig values and entropies of these  <dig> positions on the ha, the decision tree was applied to create a rule-based model and to identify rules for predicting antigenic variants of a given two ha sequences which are often a vaccine strain and a circulating strain.
nineteen positions with high ig and high genetic diversity are identified as antigenic critical positions on the ha proteins.
a position with high ig and entropy implied that this position is highly correlated to an antigenic drift.
in pandemic and epidemic forms, avian and human influenza viruses often cause significant damage to human society and economics.
gradually accumulated mutations on hemagglutinin  cause immunologically distinct circulating strains, which lead to the antigenic drift .
mapping the genetic evolution to the antigenic drift of influenza viruses is an emergent issue to public health and vaccine development
the information gains and the entropies of ha positions provide insight to the antigenic drift and co-evolution positions for influenza seasons.
we developed a method for identifying antigenic critical amino acid positions, rules, and co-mutated positions for antigenic variants.
most of these antigenic critical positions are located on five epitopes or on the surface based on the ha structure.
our method is able to identify critical positions, rules, and co-mutated positions on ha for predicting the antigenic variants.
we believe that our method is robust and is potential useful for studying influenza virus evolution and vaccine development.
the information gain  and the entropy are used to measure the score of an amino acid position on hemagglutinin  for discriminating between antigenic variants and similar viruses.
the "antigenic variants" often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic.
