our current research demonstrates for the first time that ifn-csp gene can be expressed at high levels in e. coli through codon and expression conditions optimization.
hbv-transgenic mice were used as in vivo model to evaluate the anti-hbv effect of the recombinant ifn-csp.
ifn-csp has significant inhibition effects on hbv-dna replication in hepg <dig> .
the aim of the present investigation was focused on how to produce high levels of recombinant ifn-csp and its in vivo anti-hepatitis b virus  activity.
the results showed that the e. coli expression system was very efficient to produce target protein.
the in vivo tissue distribution were assayed and compared with native ifn α2b.
a modified dna fragment encoding ifn-csp was synthesized according to escherichia coli  preferred codon usage and transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  for protein expression.
in our previous study, a novel liver-targeting fusion interferon  combining ifn α2b with plasmodium region i peptide was successfully constructed.

the purified recombinant ifn-csp showed liver-targeting potentiality and anti-hbv activity in vivo.
the antigenicity of the purified protein was characterized by western blot analysis.
the present study further supported the application of ifn-csp in liver-targeting anti-hbv medicines.
the induction conditions were systematically examined by combining one-factor experiments with an orthogonal test ).
