from an experimental point of view, both genetically encoded and chemically synthesised peptide libraries can be used to identify sequences recognized by a given antibody.
it can also find and report all peptide sequences of a specified length that can mimic the surface of a given protein and store them in a database.
we have developed a method able to find the surface region of a protein that can be effectively mimicked by a peptide, given the structure of the protein and the maximum number of side chains deemed to be required for recognition.
we believe that the meps server, available at , will be a useful tool for immunologists and structural and computational biologists.
the method is implemented as a publicly available server.
