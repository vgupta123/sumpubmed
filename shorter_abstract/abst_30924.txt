tests of several exemplary species from this in silico analysis of matk processing unexpectedly revealed that one of the two sites remain unedited in almost half of all species examined.
a small number of third-codon positions in the vicinity of editing sites are selectively constrained independent of the presence of the editing site, most likely because of interacting rna-binding proteins.
both matk editing sites were present in the common ancestor of all angiosperms and have been independently lost multiple times during angiosperm evolution.
rna editing in chloroplasts of angiosperms proceeds by c-to-u conversions at specific sites.
