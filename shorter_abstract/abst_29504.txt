the coepra contest provides four data sets, which are typical for biological regression problems .
thus, the initial set of more than  <dig>  features was reduced to about  <dig>  in the second stage, we used only the selected features from the preceding stage applying a milder l <dig> regularization, which generally yielded further improvement of prediction performance.
in order to build a prediction model a so called training data set of molecules with measured target properties is needed.
furthermore, the considered problems are often complex, such that it is not clear which molecular descriptors  may be suitable to establish a strong correlation with the target property.
machine learning methods are nowadays used for many biological prediction problems involving drugs, ligands or polypeptide segments of a protein.
the proposed two-step method showed good results on all four coepra regression tasks.
we applied the same two-step training procedure for all four regression tasks.
