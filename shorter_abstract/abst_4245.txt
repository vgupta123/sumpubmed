the detection of genomic copy number alterations  in cancer based on snp arrays requires methods that take into account tumour specific factors such as normal cell contamination and tumour heterogeneity.
we report the recall rates in terms of normal cell contamination levels and alteration characteristics: length, copy number and loh state, as well as the false discovery rate distribution for each copy number under different normal cell contamination levels.
assessed methods are in general better at detecting alterations with low copy number and under a little normal cell contamination levels.
we devised and implemented a comprehensive model to generate data that simulate tumoural samples genotyped using snp arrays.
all methods except gphmm, which failed to recognize the alteration pattern in the cell-line samples, provided similar results for the synthetic and cell-line sample sets.
the validity of the model is supported by the similarity of the results obtained with synthetic and real data.
based on these results and on the software implementation of the methods, we recommend gap for advanced users and gphmm for a fully driven analysis.
six recently published methods for cna and loss of heterozygosity  detection on tumour samples were assessed on this synthetic data and on a dilution series of a breast cancer cell-line: ascat, gap, genocna, gphmm, mixhmm and oncosnp.
to this aim, a comprehensive model that integrates the factors of normal cell contamination and intra-tumour heterogeneity and that can be translated to synthetic data on which to perform benchmarks is indispensable.
we propose such model and implement it in an r package called cnagen to synthetically generate a wide range of alterations under different normal cell contamination levels.
