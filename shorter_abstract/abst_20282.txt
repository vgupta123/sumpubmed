taking advantage of the house mouse sperm morphology, we analyzed the variational modularity of the sperm head by testing several hypotheses related to its structural and functional organization.

the results indicated that the house mouse sperm head is divided into three variational modules , which correspond to the main regions of the cytoskeletal mesh beneath the plasma membrane, i.e., the perinuclear theca.
although the rb fusions did not alter the main modularity pattern, they did affect the percentages of covariation between pairs of modules.
the structural heterogeneity found in the sperm head suggests an association between its inner composition, shape and specificity of function.
because chromosomal rearrangements can affect the genotype-phenotype map of individuals and thus modify the patterns of covariation between traits, we also evaluate the effect of robertsonian translocations on the modularity pattern of the sperm head.
the structural heterogeneity of the cytoskeleton is responsible for the modular organization of the sperm head shape, corroborating the role that this structure has in maintaining the cell shape.
the reduction in percentages of shape covariation between pairs of modules in rb sperms suggests that chromosomal rearrangements could induce changes in the genotype-phenotype map.
most of the covariation is concentrated between the ventral spur and the acrosomal and post-acrosomal modules.
while at the cellular level the modular organization of molecular interactions has been analyzed in detail, the phenotypic modularity  of cell shape remains unexplored.
nevertheless, how these variations affect sperm fertilization success is yet to be elucidated.
