many previous studies through simulations or experiments have shown that feedback loop  structures play an important role in controlling the network robustness without fully explaining how they do it.
this implies that a network state eventually sustains the attractor despite a perturbation subject to a non-source nfd node.
hence, there is a pressing need to more rigorously analyze the influence of fbl structures on network robustness.
taken together, these results will promote understanding of the effects of fbl on network robustness in a more rigorous manner.
based on those definitions, i first prove that every nfu node is eventually frozen in boolean dynamics.
thus, nfu nodes converge to a fixed value determined by the upstream source nodes.
biological networks keep their functions robust against perturbations.
inspired by this result, i further propose a perturbation-sustainable probability that indicates how likely a perturbation effect is to be sustained through propagations.
i show that genes with a high perturbation-sustainable probability are likely to be essential, disease, and drug-target genes in large human signaling networks.
in this paper, i propose a novel node classification notion based on the fbl structures involved.
more specifically, i classify a node as a no-fbl-in-upstream  or no-fbl-in-downstream  node if no feedback loop is involved with any upstream or downstream path of the node, respectively.

second, i prove that a network is robust against an arbitrary state perturbation subject to a non-source nfd node.
