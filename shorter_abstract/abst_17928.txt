the data show that these stressors impact algal growth rate, inducing early aging and profound changes in expression levels of the genes of interest.
most analyzed genes  were strongly down-regulated which may indicate a strategy to avoid unnecessary over-investment in their respective proteins.
in order to identify molecular stress-indicators for the ubiquitous diatom species skeletonema marinoi, we tested stress-related genes in different environmental conditions  using rt-qpcr.
by contrast, key genes were activated  which may allow the diatom species to better cope with adverse conditions.
these key dominant species may undergo dramatic changes due to global climate change.
