second, we identified a novel mrna splice variant, pitx2b <dig>  which uses the same 5' splice donor in intron  <dig> as pitx2b , but employs an alternative 3' splice acceptor, leading to an in-frame deletion of  <dig> base pairs relative to pitx2b <dig>  pitx2b <dig> mrna is expressed in both murine and human pituitary.
the data show that in a murine gonadotrope cell line and adult murine pituitary what was previously thought to be pitx2b <dig> is actually pitx2cβ, or perhaps pitx2b <dig>  pitx2b <dig> is expressed at lower levels than previously thought.
these proteins show similar dna binding and trans-activation functions as other pitx <dig> isoforms in vitro, though their conservation across species suggests that they may play distinct, as yet unidentified, roles in vivo.
first, we demonstrate that the pitx2c mrna generates two protein products, pitx2cα and pitx2cβ, via alternative translation initiation.
we have identified and characterized two novel isoforms of pitx <dig>  generated by alternative translation initiation  and alternative mrna splicing .
differences in the amino-termini of the proteins may confer functional differences in some contexts.
three major isoforms of pitx <dig> were previously reported to be produced through both alternative mrna splicing  and alternative promoter usage .
