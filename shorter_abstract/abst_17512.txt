dispersions were evaluated by dynamic light-scattering for zeta-average diameter  and zeta-potential  analysis; dialysis for determination of drug entrapment efficiency; plating and cfu counting for determination of cell viability of mycobacterium smegmatis or tuberculosis, minimal bactericidal concentration  and synergism index for dodab/drug combinations.
combination dodab/rif yielded mbcs of 2/ <dig> and 4/ <dig>  Î¼g/ml against mycobacterium smegmatis or mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively.
rif was incorporated in dodab bilayers at high percentiles in contrast to the leaky behavior of iso.
cationic bilayers based on the inexpensive synthetic lipid dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide  have been useful as carriers for drug delivery, immunoadjuvants for vaccines and active antimicrobial agents.
rif aggregates in water solution were solubilised by dodab bf.
synergism indexes equal to  <dig>  or  <dig> , indicated synergism against the former and independent action, against the latter species.
rifampicin  or isoniazid  interacted with dodab bilayer fragments  or large vesicles .
