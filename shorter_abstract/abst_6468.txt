we have developed dnptrapper, a shotgun sequence finishing tool, specifically designed to address the problems posed by the presence of repeated regions in the target sequence.
the program detects and visualizes single base differences between nearly identical repeat copies, and offers the overview and flexibility needed to rapidly resolve complex regions within a working session.
the use of a database allows large amounts of data to be stored and handled, and allows viewing of mammalian size genomes.
finishing is the most time consuming step in sequencing and current finishing tools are not designed with particular attention to the repeat problem.
the program is available under an open source license.
