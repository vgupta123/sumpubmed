however, the reversibility of cre-lox recombination, due to the incorporation of two cis-positioned lox sites, presents a major bottleneck in its application in gene stacking.
we developed a highly efficient gene stacking method by utilizing powerful recombinases such as cre-lox and flp-frt, for site-specific gene integrations, and nucleases for marker gene excisions.
finally, we show that heat-inducible i-scei is also suitable for marker excision, and therefore could serve as an important tool in streamlining this gene stacking platform.
practical approaches for multigene transformation and gene stacking are extremely important for engineering complex traits and adding new traits in transgenic crops.
transgene loci were analyzed by pcr, southern hybridization, and dna sequencing.
gene stacking into pre-determined genomic sites depends on mechanisms of targeted dna integration and recycling of selectable marker genes.
here, we describe a strategy of resolving this bottleneck through excision of one of the cis-positioned lox, embedded in the marker gene, by nuclease activity.
we generated cre-mediated site-specific integration locus in rice and showed excision of marker gene by i-scei at ~ <dig> % efficiency, seamlessly connecting genes in the locus.
a practical approach for gene stacking in plant cell was developed that allows targeted gene insertions through rounds of transformation, a method needed for introducing new traits into transgenic lines for their rapid deployment in the field.
targeted integrations into chromosomal breaks, created by nucleases, require large transformation efforts.
next, we showed zfn could be used for marker excision, and the locus can be targeted again by recombinases.
