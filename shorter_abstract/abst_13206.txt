the requirement for few novel biosynthetic steps may have assisted in the evolution of the betalain biosynthetic pathway in the caryophyllales, and facilitated multiple origins of the pathway in this order and in fungi.
in this article we show betalain production in species that normally produce anthocyanins, through a combination of genetic modification and substrate feeding.
the biolistic introduction of dna constructs for transient overexpression of two different dihydroxyphenylalanine  dioxygenases , and feeding of dod substrate , was sufficient to induce betalain production in cell cultures of solanum tuberosum  and petals of antirrhinum majus.
however, certain families within the order caryophyllales produce another class of pigments, the betalains, instead of anthocyanins.
the stably transformed 35s: amdod arabidopsis plants provide material to study, for the first time, the physiological effects of having both betalains and anthocyanins in the same plant tissues.
the fact that the introduction of dod along with a supply of its substrate  was sufficient to induce betacyanin production reveals the presence of a background enzyme, possibly a tyrosinase, that can convert l-dopa to cyclo-dopa  in at least some anthocyanin-producing plants.
thus, introduction of a dod and an enzyme capable of converting tyrosine to l-dopa should be sufficient to confer both betaxanthin and betacyanin production to anthocyanin-producing species.
multi-cell foci with yellow, orange and/or red colours occurred, with either a fungal dod  or a plant dod , and the yellow/orange foci showed green autofluorescence characteristic of betaxanthins.
hplc analysis of the transgenic seedlings fed l-dopa confirmed betaxanthin production.
hplc analysis showed both betaxanthins and betacyanins were produced.
