in particular, single-molecule circular consensus sequencing permits the sequencing of antibody repertoires at previously unattainable depths of coverage and accuracy.
we utilized circular consensus sequencing technology to provide baseline data of the expressed bovine igg repertoire that can be used for future studies important to livestock research.
next generation sequencing methods provide unique approaches to a number of immuno-based research areas including antibody discovery and engineering, disease surveillance, and host immune response to vaccines.
we hypothesize that network or cluster-based analyses of expressed antibody repertoires from controlled challenge experiments will help identify novel natural antigen binding solutions to specific pathogens of interest.
a bimodal distribution of unique cdr <dig> sequence lengths was observed, with common lengths of 5– <dig> and 21– <dig> amino acids.
network analyses revealed distinct patterns among the expressed igg antigen binding repertoires of the examined individuals.
centrally located cysteine residues in bovine cdr3s provide further evidence that disulfide bond formation is likely of structural importance.
we approached the bovine immunoglobulin g  repertoire with the objective of characterizing diversity of expressed igg transcripts.
we identified  <dig> extremely long cdr <dig> sequences  within igg transcripts.
the average number of cysteine residues in cdr3s increased with cdr <dig> length and we observed that cysteine residues were centrally located in cdr3s.
we generated  <dig>  high quality cdna sequences, each spanning the entire igg variable region from four bos taurus calves.
somatic mutation resulting in base insertions and deletions in cdr <dig> further diversifies the bovine antibody repertoire.
