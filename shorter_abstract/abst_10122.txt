by renormalizing the gcc data, we compared the interaction frequency of operon pairs in the same regulon with that of random operon pairs.
the results showed that arrangements of operons in the e. coli genome tend to minimize the spatial distance between operons in the same regulon.
this study revealed the organization features of escherichia coli genomic functional units in the 3d space and furthered our understanding of the link between the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes and biological function.
a similar global organization feature exists for genes in biological pathways of e. coli.
these results provided new insights into the organization principles of bacterial genomes and support the notion of transcription factory.
in bacterial genomes, the compactly encoded genes and operons are well organized, with genes in the same biological pathway or operons in the same regulon close to each other on the genome sequence.
however, the organization features of bacterial genomes in a three-dimensional space remain elusive.
the dna interaction data of escherichia coli, measured by the genome conformation capture  technique, have recently become available, which allowed us to investigate the spatial features of bacterial genome organization.

in addition, the linearly close genes have a higher probability of co-expression and their protein products tend to form protein–protein interactions.
