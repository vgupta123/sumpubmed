in model species, single-nucleotide polymorphisms  have been reported to impair or enhance mirna regulation as well as to alter mirna biogenesis.
to date, no studies into the effects of snps on mirna biogenesis and regulation in the common carp have been reported.
the analysis of the mirna-related snps and their effects provided insights into the effects of snps on mirna biogenesis and function.
in the common carp, mirna targets have not been investigated.
the common carp mirnas and their target genes reported here will help further our understanding of the role of mirnas in gene regulation.
the resource data generated in this study will help advance the study of mirna function and phenotype-associated mirna identification.
further, two snps in the 3â€™ untranslated regions of target genes were predicted to either disturb or create mirna-target interactions.
among them, nine snps had the potential to either increase or decrease the energy of the predicted secondary structures of the precursors.
using homology-based prediction combined with small rna sequencing, we have identified  <dig> common carp mature mirnas, including  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> common carp specific mirnas.
we identified  <dig> snps in the mirna precursors.
the conserved mirnas had significantly higher expression levels than the specific mirnas.
