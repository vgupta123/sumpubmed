interestingly, we found that a new alternative splicing product of the dgkη gene, dgkη <dig>  which lacks exon  <dig> encoding  <dig> amino acid residues, was expressed only in the testis.
dgkη <dig> was distributed in the oviductal epithelium of the ovary and the luminal epithelium of the uterus.
these results indicate that the expression patterns of the type ii dgk isoforms δ <dig>  η <dig>  η <dig> and κ differ from each other, suggesting that these dgk isoforms play specific roles in distinct compartments and developmental stages of the reproductive organs, especially in the processes of spermatogenesis and oocyte maturation.
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting confirmed that dgkδ <dig>  but not dgkδ <dig>  and dgkκ were expressed in the testis, ovary and uterus.
intriguingly, dgkη <dig> was strongly expressed in the secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids of the testis.
dgkκ was distributed in the primary and secondary spermatocyte of the testis.
in this study, we first identified the expression sites of type ii dgks in the mouse reproductive organs in detail.
moreover, we investigated the distribution of type ii dgks in the testis, ovary and uterus through in situ hybridization.
dgkδ <dig> was distributed in the primary spermatocytes of the testis and ovarian follicles.
however, these enzymes’ functions in the reproductive organs remain unknown.
