this method opens new opportunities in the investigation of biological mechanisms that include fast evolving genes, such as the evolution of lineage specific processes and traits responsible for species adaptation to their environment.
only heteroduplexes that disanneal at low stringency are used for constructing the resulting cdna library.
we demonstrate the efficiency of the issh method by generating a brain cdna library enriched in fast evolving transcripts of a non-model catfish species as well as a control, non-enriched library.
furthermore, most of the identified transcripts show higher sequence divergence between two closely related catfish species as compared to recognized fast evolving dna markers.
our results indicate that the enriched library contains effectively more fast evolving sequences than the control library.
the issh method offers a simple, inexpensive and efficient way to screen the transcriptome for isolating fast evolving genes.
yet, their identification and isolation are still laborious, particularly for non-model organisms.
experimental hybridization conditions are monitored in order to discard transcripts that do not find their homologous counterparts in the two species sets as well as transcripts that display a strong complementarity between the two species.
