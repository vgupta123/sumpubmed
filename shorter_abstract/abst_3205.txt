their pattern of diversification suggests that athila elements survive in arabidopsis by a combination of selfish replication and of amplification of highly diverged copies with coding potential.
many athila elements are non-autonomous but still conserve intact open reading frames which are under the effect of negative, purifying natural selection.
we show that recombination events among distantly related athila retrotransposons have led to the generation of new athila lineages.
the evolution of these mobile elements is far more complex than hitherto assumed.
