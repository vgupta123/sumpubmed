we sequenced  <dig>  est clones using a normalized cdna library made from pooled samples of the trophont, tomont, and theront life-cycle stages, and generated  <dig>  sequences .
the ciliate protozoan ichthyophthirius multifiliis  is an important parasite of freshwater fish that causes 'white spot disease' leading to significant losses.
to study gene expression involved in ich pathogenesis and virulence, our goal was to generate expressed sequence tags  for the development of a powerful microarray platform for the analysis of global gene expression in this species.
blastx searches produced  <dig>  significant  hits and further gene ontology  analysis annotated  <dig>  of these genes.
the ests were analyzed comparatively against the genomes of the related protozoa tetrahymena thermophila and p. falciparum, allowing putative identification of additional genes.
all the est sequences were deposited by dbest in genbank .
this set of ests represents a significant proportion of the ich transcriptome, and provides a material basis for the development of microarrays useful for gene expression studies concerning ich development, pathogenesis, and virulence.
clustering analysis of these ests allowed identification of  <dig>  unique sequences containing  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
these unique sequences represent over two million base pairs .
