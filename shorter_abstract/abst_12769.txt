here, we have applied a machine-learning approach previously successful for identifying molecular entities to a disease concept to determine if the underlying probabilistic model effectively generalizes to unrelated concepts with minimal manual intervention for model retraining.
significantly, addition of an extensive lexicon of malignancy mentions as a feature set for extraction had minimal impact in performance.
compared with a baseline system using string matching of text with a neoplasm term list, mtag performed with a much higher recall rate  and demonstrated the ability to learn new patterns.
furthermore, promise has been tempered by an inability to efficiently scale approaches in ways that minimize manual efforts and still perform with high accuracy.
together, these results suggest that the identification of disparate biomedical entity classes in free text may be achievable with high accuracy and only moderate additional effort for each new application domain.
mtag was tested with  <dig>  training and  <dig> evaluation documents pertaining to cancer genomics.
application of mtag to all medline abstracts yielded the identification of  <dig>  unique and  <dig> , <dig> overall mentions of malignancy.
the rapid proliferation of biomedical text makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to identify, synthesize, and utilize developed knowledge in their fields of interest.
previous efforts in biomedical text mining have focused primarily upon named entity recognition of well-defined molecular objects such as genes, but less work has been performed to identify disease-related objects and concepts.
the application uses the machine-learning technique conditional random fields with additional domain-specific features.
