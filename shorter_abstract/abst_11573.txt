recent phylogenomic analyses suggest that mnemiopsis may be the earliest branching metazoan lineage.
we use short rna sequencing and the assembled genome of the lobate ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi to show that this species appears to lack any recognizable micrornas, as well as the nuclear proteins drosha and pasha, which are critical to canonical microrna biogenesis.
alternatively, canonical microrna functionality may have been lost independently in the lineages leading to both mnemiopsis and the placozoan trichoplax, suggesting that microrna functionality was not critical until much later in metazoan evolution.
micrornas play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression and have been identified in every animal with a sequenced genome examined thus far, except for the placozoan trichoplax.
