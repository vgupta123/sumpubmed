these modules reflect shared developmental pathways, ossification timing, and observed ecological shape diversification in living species of felids.
here we investigate the modular organisation of the presacral vertebral column of modern cats  with pairwise comparisons of vertebral shape covariation  and evaluate our results against hypotheses of developmental and functional modularity.
we show here that patterns of shape integration reflect modular organisation of the vertebral column of felids.
we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to quantify vertebral shape and then assessed integration between pairs of vertebrae with phylogenetic two-block partial least square analysis .
this modularity may also have permitted vertebral partitions, specifically in the posterior vertebral column, to be more responsive to selection and achieve higher morphological disparity than other vertebral regions.
further, several lines of evidence suggest that the mammalian axial skeleton is a highly modular structure.
whereas this pattern corresponds with hypotheses of developmental and functional regionalisation in the axial skeleton, it does not simply reflect major vertebral regions.

previous studies have demonstrated that the clear morphological differences among vertebrae across the presacral column are accompanied by heterogeneous functional signals in vertebral shape.
these include its composition of serial units, a trade-off between high shape variance and strong conservation of vertebral count, and direct association of regions with anterior expression sites of hox genes.
