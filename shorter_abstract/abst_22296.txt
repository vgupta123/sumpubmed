sunflower seeds contain predominantly alpha-tocopherol , with maximum vitamin e effect but lower in vitro antioxidant action than other tocopherol forms such as gamma-tocopherol.
the objective of this research was to determine the genetic basis of unstable expression of high gamma-tocopherol content in sunflower seeds.
no sequence differences at the gamma-tmt gene were found associated to allelic unstability.
the trait is controlled by recessive alleles at a single locus tph <dig> underlying a gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase .
male sterile plants of nuclear male sterile line nmst <dig>  with stable high gamma-tocopherol content, were crossed with plants of line iast- <dig>  with stable high gamma-tocopherol content but derived from a population that exhibited unstable expression of the trait.
unstable expression of high gamma-tocopherol content is produced by the effect of modifying genes on tph2a allele at the gamma-tmt tph <dig> gene.
a genetic linkage map comprising  <dig> linkage groups  was constructed from this population using  <dig> ssr and  <dig> indel marker loci, including indel markers for tocopherol biosynthesis genes.
qtl analysis revealed a major qtl on lg  <dig> that corresponded to the gamma-tmt tph <dig> locus, which suggested that high gamma-tocopherol lines nmst <dig> and iast- <dig> possess different alleles at this locus.
our results suggested that modifying genes are mostly epistatically interacting gamma-tmt duplicated loci.
additionally, unstable expression of increased gamma-tocopherol content in the range from  <dig> to 85% has been reported.
f <dig> seeds showed continuous segregation for gamma-tocopherol content from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.
gamma-tocopherol content in f <dig> plants  segregated from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.
