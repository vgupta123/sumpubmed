this workflow provides new tools and datafile specifications that facilitate the identification of differences in abundance of reads assigned to taxa , enables the detection of reads of low-abundance bacteria , provides new concepts for filtering spurious matches, etc.
this open and extensible platform has been designed with the aim of enabling in-depth analysis of metagenomic samples and better understanding of the underlying biological processes.
illustrative examples are provided based on the study of two collections of metagenomes from faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity and their mothers.
the field of metagenomics, defined as the direct genetic analysis of uncultured samples of genomes contained within an environmental sample, is gaining increasing popularity.
