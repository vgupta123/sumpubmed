the map was built using the roslin 3000-rad rh panel  and contains  <dig> markers including  <dig> new loci in addition to  <dig> amplified fragment-length polymorphisms  and  <dig> markers previously published with the first generation rh map.
correcting the sequence assembly requires extensive additional mapping information to improve the reliability of the ordering of sequence scaffolds on chromosomes.
from the  <dig> loci unambiguously identified in the bovine sequence assembly,  <dig> mapped to different chromosomes in the bovgen rh map.
all the chromosome maps were aligned with the current 6× bovine assembly  and  <dig> loci were unambiguously located in the bovine sequence.
the order of loci on the rh map for bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differed substantially from the assembled bovine sequence.
this suggests that the bovine sequence assembly could be significantly improved by incorporating additional independent mapping information.
an rh map for the  <dig> bovine chromosomes is presented.
alignment of the bovgen rh map with other published rh and genetic maps showed higher consistency in marker order and chromosome assignment than with the current 6× sequence assembly.
in addition to differences in the order of loci, several cases were observed where the chromosomal assignment of loci differed between maps.
the publicly available bovine genomic sequence assembly with 6× coverage  is based on whole genome shotgun sequence data and limited mapping data however, it is recognised that this assembly is a draft that contains errors.
however, all mapping approaches are prone to errors either arising from technical deficiencies or lack of statistical support to distinguish between alternative orders of loci.
sequences of the mapped loci were aligned with published bovine genome maps to identify inconsistencies.
