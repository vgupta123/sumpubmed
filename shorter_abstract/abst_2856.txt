our results suggest that tetraspanin intra- and intermolecular interactions are mediated by conserved residues in adjacent, but distinct regions of tm <dig> and tm <dig>  a key structural element that defines tm1-tm <dig> interaction in tetraspanins is the specific packing of bulky residues against small residues.
proteins of the tetraspanin family contain four transmembrane domains  linked by two extracellular loops and a short intracellular loop, and have short intracellular n- and c-termini.
while structure and function analysis of the larger extracellular loop has been performed, the organization and role of transmembrane domains have not been systematically assessed.
mutations of a and d residues in both tm <dig> and tm <dig> , involved in intramolecular tm1-tm <dig> interaction, also strongly diminished intermolecular interaction, as assessed by cross-linking of cys <dig>
in tm <dig>  position a is occupied by conserved small residues , and position d has a conserved gly and two bulky aliphatic residues.
in tm <dig>  three a positions of the heptad repeat are filled by two leucines and a glutamate/glutamine residue, and two d positions are occupied by either phe/tyr or val/ile/leu residues.
mutations of conserved glycines in human cd <dig>  caused aggregation of mutant proteins inside the cell.
no heptad motif is apparent in tm <dig> sequences.
among  <dig> human tetraspanin proteins, the tm1- <dig> sequences display a distinct heptad repeat motif n. in tm <dig>  position a is occupied by structurally conserved bulky residues and position d contains highly conserved asn and gly residues.
the homodimeric interface of cd <dig> was mapped, by disulfide cross-linking of single-cysteine mutants, to the vicinity of residues leu <dig> and phe <dig> in tm <dig>  and gly <dig>  gly <dig> and ala <dig> in tm <dig> .
modeling of the tm1-tm <dig> interface in cd <dig>  using a novel algorithm, predicts tight packing of conserved bulky residues against conserved gly residues along the two helices.
