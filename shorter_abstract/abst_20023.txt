in order to identify biomarkers and potential regulators of the process of differentiation, a high quality microarray containing  <dig>  seventy base pair oligonucleotides was used to compare gene expression profiles of undifferentiated hesc lines and differentiating embryoid bodies.
previously identified "stemness" genes in undifferentiated hesc lines showed down modulation in differentiated cells while expression of several genes was induced as cells differentiated.
these results present a detailed characterization of a unique set of genes, which can be used to assess the hesc differentiation.
a hierarchical clustering analysis clearly depicted a distinct difference in gene expression profile among undifferentiated and differentiated hesc and confirmed that microarray analysis could readily distinguish them.
the identification of molecular pathways of differentiation of embryonic stem cells  is critical for the development of stem cell based medical therapies.
gene expression was validated by a variety of techniques including another large scale array, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, focused cdna microarrays, massively parallel signature sequencing  analysis and immunocytochemisty.
in addition, a subset of  <dig> genes showed overexpression of greater than â‰¥  <dig> folds in human embryoid bodies .
