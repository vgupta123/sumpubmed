binary method, eiip  method and filter methods.
under filter method two filter designs, and two approaches using these two designs have been tried.
alterations to the proven methods as done by the authors, improves performance of exon prediction algorithms.
also it has been proven that the discrete wavelet transform is an effective tool for de-noising which can be used with exon prediction algorithms.
the discrete wavelet transform has been used for de-noising of the exon plots.
the exon plot de-noised using discrete wavelet transform is also given.
results of exon prediction based on the methods mentioned above, which give values closest to the ones found in the ncbi database are given here.
this paper compares the most common digital signal processing methods of exon prediction in eukaryotes, and also proposes a technique for noise suppression in exon prediction.
here exon prediction has been done using the digital signal processing methods viz.
