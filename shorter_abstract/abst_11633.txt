our findings indicate that the zebra finch endocannabinoid system is particularly sensitive to exogenous agonist exposure during the critical period of song learning and provide insight into susceptible brain areas.
we found that late postnatal win treatment caused a long-term global disregulation of both levels of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonyl glycerol  and densities of cb <dig> immunostaining across brain regions, while repeated cannabinoid treatment in adults produced few long-term changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system.
one possibility is that developmental agonist exposure results in altered expression of elements of endocannabinoid signaling systems.
previously we have found that cannabinoid treatment of zebra finches during sensorimotor stages of vocal development alters song patterns produced in adulthood.
we are currently working to identify the nature of such physiological changes, and to understand how they contribute to altered vocal learning.
