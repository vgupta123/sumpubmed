cathi had strong antimicrobial activity against six tested pathogenic candida species, with ic <dig> ranging from  <dig> to 40 μg.ml− <dig>  cathi antimicrobial activity on candida species was candidacidal.
thionin-like peptide was submitted to antimicrobial activity assays against candida species for ic <dig> determination and synergism with fluconazole evaluation.
cathi was intracellularly localized in c. albicans and c. tropicalis, however localized in nuclei in c. tropicalis, suggesting a possible nuclear target.
moreover, cathi caused plasma membrane permeabilization in all yeasts tested and induces oxidative stresses only in candida tropicalis.
viability and plasma membrane permeabilization assays, induction of intracellular ros production analysis and cathi localization in yeast cells were also investigated.
the results reported herein may ultimately contribute to future efforts aiming to employ this plant-derived amp as a new therapeutic substance against yeasts.
cathi performed synergistically with fluconazole inhibiting all tested yeasts, reaching 100 % inhibition in c. parapsilosis.
