obtained from ct and/or mri scans be added to the slt feature vector for processing.
this preliminary research study has demonstrated that slt algorithms, properly used in a clinical setting, have the potential to address questions and criticisms associated with both recist and who scoring methods.
we also propose that tumor heterogeneity, shape, etc.
to address this problem, we have chosen to study patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma to learn whether statistical learning theory can improve the performance of radiologists using ct in predicting patient treatment response to therapy compared with the more traditional recist  standard.
predictions of survival after  <dig> months in  <dig> patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma using the support vector machine  technique improved 30% when using additional information compared to who  or recist measurements alone.
significant interest exists in establishing radiologic imaging as a valid biomarker for assessing the response of cancer to a variety of treatments.
the svm and lr techniques also demonstrated that one radiologist consistently outperformed another.
