we also identified genes and pathways involved in growth on simple carbon sources and in sapwood, o. piceae’s natural substrate.
like the pathogen, the saprophyte is able to tolerate terpenes, which are a major class of pine tree defense compounds; unlike the pathogen, it cannot utilize monoterpenes as a carbon source.
we sequenced its genome and analyzed its transcriptomes under a range of growth conditions.
we identified o. piceae genes involved in the biosynthesis of melanin, which causes wood discoloration and reduces the commercial value of wood products.
despite having similar ecological niches, o. piceae and g. clavigera showed no large-scale synteny.
a comparison with the genome and transcriptomes of the mountain pine beetle-associated pathogen grosmannia clavigera highlights differences between a pathogen that colonizes and kills living pine trees and a saprophyte that colonizes wood and the inner bark of dead trees.
this work makes available the second annotated genome of a softwood ophiostomatoid fungus, and suggests that o. piceae’s tolerance to terpenes may be due in part to these chemicals being removed from the cells by an abc transporter that is highly induced by terpenes.
