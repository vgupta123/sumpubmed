since our analyses cover species of all major chordate groups this work provides an extremely clear overall picture of how the uroplakin families and their partner proteins have evolved in parallel.
the recent availability of sequenced genomes from a broad array of chordates  has allowed us to systematically analyze the evolution of uroplakins: tetraspanins  and their respective partner proteins .
we report here:  the origin of uroplakins in the common ancestor of vertebrates,  the appearance of several residues that have statistically significantly positive dn/ds ratios in the duplicated paralogs of uroplakin genes, and  the existence of strong coevolutionary relationships between upk1a/1b tetraspanins and their respective upk2/upk3-related partner proteins.
moreover, we report the existence of three new upk2/ <dig> family members we named upk2b, 3c and 3d, which will help clarify the evolutionary relationships between fish, amphibian and mammalian uroplakins that may perform divergent functions specific to these different and physiologically distinct groups of vertebrates.
we also highlight several novel features of uroplakin evolution including the appearance of upk2b and 3d in fish and upk3c in the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals.
