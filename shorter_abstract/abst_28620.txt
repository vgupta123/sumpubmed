each sub-network is considered a set of features to separate patients into two groups using k-means algorithm.
survival times of the two groups are compared using log-rank test and kaplan-meier curves.
simulations using random sets of genes are carried out to determine the thresholds for log-rank test p-values for network selection.
using gene co-expression analysis, researchers were able to predict clusters of genes with consistent functions that are relevant to cancer development and prognosis.
our results not only confirmed previous findings including the importance of cell cycle and immune response in gbm, but also suggested important epigenetic events in gbm development and prognosis.
we applied a weighted gene co-expression network  analysis algorithm on glioblastoma multiforme  data obtained from the tcga project and predicted a set of gene co-expression networks which are related to gbm prognosis.
we identified  <dig> gene clusters associated with gbm prognosis using the eqcm algorithm.
using the eqcm algorithm, we identified  <dig>  sub-networks in the wgcn, out of which  <dig> sub-networks show p-values less than their corresponding thresholds.
