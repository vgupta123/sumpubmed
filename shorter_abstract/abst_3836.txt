to gain insight into the molecular diversity of antimicrobial peptides and proteins in the oyster crassostrea gigas, we characterized and compared the sequence polymorphism of the antimicrobial peptides , cg-defensins  and cg-proline rich peptide , and of the bactericidal permeability increasing protein, cg-bpi.
this study shows for the first time in a mollusc that antimicrobial peptides and proteins have been subject to distinct patterns of diversification and we evidence the existence of different evolutionary routes leading to such sequence variability.
in contrast, cg-bpi forms a single group and is encoded by a single gene copy.
in addition, the non synonymous to synonymous substitutions ratio by codon  revealed several negatively and positively selected sites for both amps, suggesting that directional selection pressures have shaped their sequence variations.
moreover, we identified for both amps several genetic mechanisms of diversification such as recombination, parallel mutations leading to phylogenetic homoplasy and indel events.
high diversification among the three antimicrobial effectors was evidenced by this polymorphism survey.
