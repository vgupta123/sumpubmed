these mutants, as well as a d41a grea mutant and a grea deletion, were tested for proficiency in recombination events.
some recent research suggests that the primary role of grea may not be to regulate gene expression, but rather, to promote the progression of replication forks which collide with rna polymerase, and which might otherwise collapse.
it follows that grea malfunction could have consequences affecting homologous recombination.
the elongation factor grea binds to rna polymerase and modulates transcriptional pausing.
