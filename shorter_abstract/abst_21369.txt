although nss is very efficient in shutting down genes of the host innate response, a number of possible antiviral factors were identified.
in this study we show the effects of sbv nss on the transcriptome of infected cells as well as the cellular response to wild type sbv.
however, the majority of the genes that were expressed during sbv infection are involved in restriction of viral replication and spread indicating that sbv does not completely manage to shutdown the host antiviral response.
although, as for other members of this family/genus, the non-structural protein nss has been shown to be an interferon antagonist, very little is known regarding the overall inhibitory effects and targets of orthobunyavirus nss proteins on host gene expression during infection.
schmallenberg virus  is a member of the orthobunyavirus genus  causing malformations and abortions in ruminants.
therefore, using rna-seq this study describes changes to the transcriptome of primary bovine cells following infection with schmallenberg virus  or with a mutant lacking the non-structural protein nss  providing a detailed comparison of the effect of nss expression on the host cell.

thus the data from this study can serve as a base for more detailed mechanistic studies of sbv and other orthobunyaviruses.
