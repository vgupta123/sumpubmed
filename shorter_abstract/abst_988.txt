observed parallels to horizontal gene transfer in bacteria facilitate the understanding of why ducks have been such an evolutionarily successful group of animals.
there are many sympatric and ecologically similar duck species, among which fertile hybrids occur relatively frequently in nature, yet these species remain distinct.
we demonstrate that hybridisation has led to sustained exchange of genetic material between duck species on an evolutionary time scale without disintegrating species boundaries.
in other bird groups with unusually high hybridisation rates.
based on the superspecies concept we here introduce the novel term "supra-population" to explain the persistence of snps identical by descent within the studied ducks despite their history as distinct species dating back millions of years.
there is large evolutionary potential in the ability to exchange genes among species and the resulting dramatic increase of effective population size to counter selective constraints.
this separation is complete when no fertile offspring is produced from inter-population matings, which is the basis of the biological species concept.
even though behavioural, genetic and ecological factors uphold species boundaries in ducks, we detect opposing forces allowing for viable interspecific hybrids, with long-term evolutionary implications.
the study of speciation and maintenance of species barriers is at the core of evolutionary biology.
by reviewing evidence from speciation theory, palaeogeography and palaeontology we propose a fundamentally new model of speciation to accommodate our genetic findings in dabbling ducks.
during speciation the genome of one population becomes separated from other populations of the same species, which may lead to genomic incompatibility with time.
