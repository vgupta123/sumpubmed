then, it has been suggested that cell stretching caused by milk accumulation after weaning might be the first stimulus that initiates the complete remodeling of the mammary gland.
subsequently, a geometrical model that predicted the percentage of radial strain applied to the elastic substrate was developed.
several reports have demonstrated the relevance of mechanical stress to induce adaptive responses in different cell types.
however, no previous report has demonstrated the impact of mechanical stress on mammary cell physiology.
we have designed and built a new device to analyze the biological consequences of applying mechanical stress to cells cultured on flexible silicone membranes.
in these cells, as previously observed in other tissue types, mechanical stress induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation and c-fos mrna and protein expression.
we believe that our results indicate the relevance of mechanical stress among the early post-lactation events that lead to mammary gland involution.
shortly after weaning, a complex multi-step process that leads to massive epithelial apoptosis is triggered by tissue local factors in the mouse mammary gland.
interestingly, these signaling pathways also participate in mammary gland involution.
these results were obtained using a new practical and affordable device specifically designed for such a purpose.
to address this issue, we have designed a new practical device that allowed us to evaluate the effects of radial stretching on mammary epithelial cells in culture.
here, we show for the first time, that mechanical strain is able to induce weaning-associated events in cultured mammary epithelial cells.
in addition, we found that mammary cell stretching triggered involution associated cellular events as leukemia inhibitory factor  expression induction, stat <dig> activation and akt phosphorylation inhibition.
