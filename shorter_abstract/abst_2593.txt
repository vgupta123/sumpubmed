our results confirmed that the copy number model is adequate only for high abundance tfs, while for low abundance tfs the association rate model is the only one that reproduces with high accuracy the results of the full system.
we propose a strategy to reduce the size of the system that adequately adapts important parameters to capture the behaviour of the full system.
we found two methods that scale the system accordingly: the copy number model and the association rate model.
the process by which tf molecules locate their target sites is a key component of transcriptional regulation.
we systematically compared the results produced by simulations of the subsystem with respect to the original system.
therefore it is essential to gain insight into the mechanisms by which tfs search for the target sites.
this enables correct simulations of a smaller sequence space  and, thus, provides independence from computationally intensive genome-wide simulations of the facilitated diffusion mechanism.
research in this area uses experimental and analytical approaches, but also stochastic simulations of the search process.
previous work based on stochastic simulations focussed only on short sequences, primarily for reasons of technical feasibility.
we investigated several methods that adequately adapt the parameters of stochastic simulations of the facilitated diffusion, when the full sequence space is reduced to smaller regions of interest.
