we use two feature selection algorithms to identify  <dig> features, out of a total of  <dig> physicochemical properties, presumably important to protein aggregation.
we suggest that the quaternary structure of protein aggregates, especially soluble oligomers, may allow the formation of new molecular recognition signals that guide aggregate targeting to specific cellular sites.
one interesting new finding is that aggregation prone peptide sequences have similar properties to signal peptide and signal anchor sequences.
protein aggregation is a significant problem in the biopharmaceutical industry  and is associated medically with over  <dig> human diseases.
although a number of computational models have been developed for predicting aggregation propensity and identifying aggregation-prone regions in proteins, little systematic research has been done to determine physicochemical properties relevant to aggregation and their relative importance to this important process.
both methods are compared favourably to other state-of-the-art algorithms in cross validation.
such studies may result in not only accurately predicting peptide aggregation propensities and identifying aggregation prone regions in proteins, but also aid in discovering additional underlying mechanisms governing this process.
two predictors  using selected features are built for predicting peptide aggregation propensity and identifying aggregation prone regions in proteins.
