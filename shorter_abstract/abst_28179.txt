partial inhibition of stimulated isc individually by bumetanide , and alkanoic acid  were additive and complete.
these results are consistent with a model of cl- secretion whereby cl- is taken up across the basolateral membrane by a na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter  and potentially another transporter, is secreted across the apical membrane via a cl- channel, likely cftr, and demonstrate the regulation of cl- secretion by protein kinase a and glucocorticoids.
the semicircular canal duct  epithelium has been shown to secrete cl- under β2-adrenergic stimulation.
stimulated isc was greater after chronic incubation  with the glucocorticoids dexamethasone , prednisolone , hydrocortisone , and corticosterone  and mineralocorticoid aldosterone .
native canals of cftr+/− mice showed a stimulation of isc from isoproterenol and forskolin+ibmx but not in the presence of both bumetanide and dioa, while canals from cftr−/− mice had no responses.
nonetheless, cftr−/− mice showed no difference from cftr+/− mice in their ability to balance .
in the current study, we sought to determine the ion transporters involved in cl- secretion and whether secretion is regulated by pka and glucocorticoids.
stimulated isc was also partially inhibited by cftrinh- <dig> , flufenamic acid  and diphenylamine- <dig> ′-dicarboxylic acid .
the pka activator n6-bnz-camp  also stimulated isc.
the vestibular system controls the ion composition of its luminal fluid through several epithelial cell transport mechanisms under hormonal regulation.
