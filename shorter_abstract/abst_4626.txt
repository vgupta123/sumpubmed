furthermore, treated mice display enriched histone h3k4me <dig> marks in regions of strong recombination , within very large genes and reduced marks in the pseudoautosomal region of x chromosome.
rt-qpcr was used to validate differentially expressed genes or differential peaks.
environmental factors such as pesticides can cause phenotypic changes in various organisms, including mammals.
genome-wide mapping of h3k4me <dig> marks distribution was done by chip-sequencing of testis tissue using illumina technologies.
using gene-chip and chip-seq analysis of h3k4me <dig> marks, we found that a broad range of cellular functions, including gtpase activity, mitochondrial function and steroid-hormone metabolism, are affected by atz.
we studied the effects of the widely used herbicide atrazine  on meiosis, a key step of gametogenesis, in male mice.
our data demonstrate that atrazine exposure interferes with normal meiosis, which affects spermatozoa production.
