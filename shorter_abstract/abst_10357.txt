volcanic and tectonic activities controlling the turnover of these habitats contribute to demographic instability that erodes genetic variation within and among colonies of these animals.
we examined dna sequences from one mitochondrial and three nuclear gene loci to assess genetic diversity in the siboglinid tubeworm, riftia pachyptila, a widely distributed constituent of vents along the east pacific rise and gal√°pagos rift.
compared to other vent species, dna sequence diversity is extremely low in r. pachyptila.
genetic differentiation  among populations increased with geographical distances, as expected under a linear stepping-stone model of dispersal.
total gene diversity declined with tectonic spreading rates.
though its dispersal abilities appear to be effective, the low diversity, particularly in southern hemisphere populations, is consistent with frequent local extinction and colonization events.
low levels of dna sequence diversity occurred at all four loci, allowing us to exclude the hypothesis that an idiosyncratic selective sweep eliminated mitochondrial diversity alone.
