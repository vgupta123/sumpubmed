searching the database for transcripts of genes homologous to those thought to be involved in the innate immune responses of vertebrates and other invertebrates yielded a set of nearly one hundred evolutionarily conserved sequences, representing all known pathways involved in these important functions.
the medicinal leech, hirudo medicinalis, is an important model system for the study of nervous system structure, function, development, regeneration and repair.
the sequences obtained for hirudo transcripts represent the first major database of genes expressed in this important model system.
comparison of translated open reading frames  with the other openly available leech datasets, the genome and transcriptome of helobdella robusta, shows an average identity at the amino acid level of 58% in matched sequences.
to begin to address this problem, we constructed whole embryo and adult central nervous system  est libraries and created a clustered sequence database of the hirudo transcriptome that is available to the scientific community.
a total of ~ <dig>  est clones from two directionally-cloned cdna libraries, one constructed from mrna derived from whole embryos at several developmental stages and the other from adult cns cords, were sequenced in one or both directions by three different groups: genoscope , the university of iowa sequencing facility and the doe joint genome institute.
it is a current, and potentially also future, source of medically useful molecular factors, such as anticoagulants and antibacterial peptides, which may have evolved as a result of its parasitizing large mammals, including humans.
it is also a unique species in being presently approved for use in medical procedures, such as clearing of pooled blood following certain surgical procedures.
interestingly, comparison with other available lophotrochozoans shows similar high levels of amino acid identity, where sequences match, for example, 64% with capitella capitata  and 56% with aplysia californica , as well as 58% with schistosoma mansoni .
