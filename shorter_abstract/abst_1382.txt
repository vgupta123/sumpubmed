bcj <dig> has high affinity and catalytic efficiency toward mandelonitrile.
this nitrilase is a mandelonitrile hydrolase that could efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to --mandelic acid, with a high enantiomeric excess of  <dig> %.
pessp is an efficient method for discovering an ideal mandelonitrile hydrolase.
this nitrilase has great advantages in the production of optically pure --mandelic acid because of its high activity and enantioselectivity, strong substrate tolerance, and having no unwanted byproduct.
a novel nitrilase  was discovered from burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig> through phylogeny-based enzymatic substrate specificity prediction .
bcj <dig> possessed the highest activity toward mandelonitrile and took mandelonitrile as the optimal substrate based on the analysis of substrate specificity.

an ideal nitrilase that can efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to optically pure --mandelic acid without the unwanted byproduct is needed.
the recombinant escherichia coli m15/bcj <dig> had a strong substrate tolerance and could completely hydrolyze mandelonitrile  with fewer amounts of wet cells  within  <dig> h.
bcj <dig> showed the highest identity of 71% compared with other nitrilases in the amino acid sequence.
no byproduct was observed in this hydrolysis process.
thus, bcj <dig> has great potential in the practical production of optically pure --mandelic acid in the industry.
however, unwanted byproduct, low enantioselectivity, and specific activity reduce its value in practical applications.
a nitrilase-mediated pathway has significant advantages in the production of optically pure --mandelic acid.
