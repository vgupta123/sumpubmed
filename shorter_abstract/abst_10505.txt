these organisms possess an extended array of secondary metabolites that impair cell lysis, presenting particular challenges when it comes to nucleic acid isolation.
cyanobacteria are gram-negative prokaryotes that synthesize chlorophyll a and carry out photosynthetic water oxidation.
therefore, we used the nhm <dig> strain of nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> to compare and improve existing phenol based chemistry and procedures for rna extraction.
we analyse different trizol based protocols, introduce procedural changes and describe an alternative rna extraction solution.
the validity and reproducibility of gene expression studies depend on the quality of extracted rna and the degree of genomic dna contamination.
