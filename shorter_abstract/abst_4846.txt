g protein coupled receptors  represent the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and the richest source of targets for the pharmaceutical industry.
the binding specificity of the nlp- β2ar-t4l complex has been determined by competitive assays.
although the activation of β2ar-t4l requires the insertion of the t <dig> lysozyme sequence and the yield of that active protein limited, our results conceptually prove that cell-free protein expression could be used as a fast approach to express these valuable and notoriously difficult-to-express proteins.
as a model we employed an engineered β2-adrenergic receptor in which the third intracellular loop has been replaced with t <dig> lysozyme .
our results demonstrate that β2ar-t4l synthesized in vitro depends on similar oxidative conditions as those required by an in vivo-expressed receptor.
here we report a detergent-free cell-free protein expression-based method to obtain pharmacologically active gpcrs in about  <dig> hours.
reasons for these difficulties include inefficient transport and insertion in the plasma membrane and cytotoxicity.
