the two homologous arms, which had an overlap of  <dig> bases with the ends of the vector fragments, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction.
traditionally, the construction of knockout  vectors requires an amplification step to obtain two homologous, large fragments of genomic dna.
gene targeting is a powerful method that can be used for examining the functions of genes.
our method is a fast, simple, and efficient technique for cloning, and has great potential for high-throughput construction of ko vectors.
restriction enzymes that cut at unique recognitions sites and numerous cloning steps are then carried out; this is often a time-consuming and frustrating process.
using this method, we constructed sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vectors, which were used to establish sirt <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line  and hdac <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line .
we have developed a one-step cloning method for the insertion of two arms into a ko vector using exonuclease iii.
