we propose that normally, the inactivation of tlk1b following replication arrest and genotoxic stress functions to allow the retention of 9-1- <dig> at the sites of damage or stalled forks.
these cells expressing tlk1b resistant to dna damage showed constitutive phosphorylation of rad <dig> s <dig> that occurred even in the presence of hydroxyurea , and this resulted in a delayed checkpoint recovery.
once tlk1b regains its kinase activity it phosphorylates rad <dig> at s <dig>  in this work we investigated the significance of this mechanism by overexpressing mutant tlk1b in which the inhibitory phosphorylation site was eliminated.
we found that phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> results in its dissociation from chromatin and redistribution to the cytoplasm.
this results in double stranded breaks formation with concomitant activation of atm and phosphorylation of h2ax.
one possible explanation was that premature phosphorylation of rad <dig> caused its dissociation from 9-1- <dig> at stalled replication forks, resulting in their collapse and prolonged activation of the s-phase checkpoint.
upon dna damage, chk <dig> phosphorylates tlk1b at s <dig> leading to its transient inhibition.

in cells expressing the mutant tlk1b treated with hu, rad <dig> association with hus <dig> and wrn was greatly reduced, suggesting again that its phosphorylation causes its premature release from stalled forks.
the tousled like kinase 1b  is critical for dna repair and survival of cells.
