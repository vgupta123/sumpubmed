the second step applies clustering using established algorithms in the field of graph theory, as well as two variations of spectral clustering.
these interaction networks represent a rich, yet noisy, source of data that could be used to extract meaningful information, such as protein complexes.
the clustered interactome networks are also cross-validated against the confirmed protein complexes present in the mips database.
moreover, our proposed weighting scheme outperforms other approaches of ppi graph weighting.
during the first step, by applying both novel and well established protein-protein interaction  weighting methods, weights are introduced to the original interactome graph based on the confidence level that a given interaction is a true-positive one.
the results of our experimental work demonstrate that interactome graph weighting methods clearly improve the clustering results of several clustering algorithms.
several interaction network weighting schemes have been proposed so far in the literature in order to eliminate the noise inherent in interactome data.
recent technological advances applied to biology such as yeast-two-hybrid, phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed map of protein interaction networks.
