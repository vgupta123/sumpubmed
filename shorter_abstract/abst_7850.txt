as expected, the tnfα-induced changes in the ac <dig> transcriptome resulted in corresponding changes in cognate mrna and protein levels in a similar manner, but with delayed kinetics.
furthermore, they shed new light on the regulation of the cardiomyocyte transcriptome in response to a proinflammatory signal and help to clarify the link between inflammation and cardiomyocyte function at the transcriptional level.
moreover, we observed distinct pol ii dynamics for up- and downregulated genes, with a rapid release of pol ii into productive elongation for tnfα-stimulated genes.
herein, we use this pipeline to characterize the transcriptome of an immortalized adult human ventricular cardiomyocyte cell line  in response to signaling by tumor necrosis factor alpha , which is controlled in part by nf-κb, a key transcriptional regulator of inflammation.
using grohmm, we identified ~ <dig>  coding and non-coding transcribed regions in ac <dig> cells, which includes a set of unique pol i and pol iii primary transcripts.
in addition, they show how α-amanitin can be used to reveal the pol i and pol iii transcriptome.
in addition, we observed that ac <dig> cells rapidly and dynamically reorganize their transcriptomes in response to tnfα stimulation in an nf-κb-dependent manner, switching from a basal state to a proinflammatory state affecting a spectrum of cardiac-associated protein-coding and non-coding genes.
