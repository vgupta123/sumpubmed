the examined other methods produce invalid p-values in many cases, while wame is shown to produce essentially valid p-values when a relatively small proportion of genes is regulated.
in a resampling-based simulation study, the p-values generated by wame are found to be substantially more correct than the alternatives when a relatively small proportion of the genes is regulated.
two public one-channel datasets are analysed and wame detects both unequal variances and correlations.
wame is compared to other common methods: fold-change ranking, ordinary linear model with t-tests, limma and weighted limma.
the p-value distributions are shown to differ greatly between the examined methods.
the current version of wame is, however, limited to experiments with paired design, e.g.
