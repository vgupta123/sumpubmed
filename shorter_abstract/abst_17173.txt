relevant cytokines in serum was evaluated after exposed to different dose of swainsonine.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of swainsonine about the immunotoxic effects on pregnant mice in vivo.
the peripheral th1/th <dig> was detected by ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate -stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of phase pregnant mice.
our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory of swainsonine disturbed the regular immunologic state of the pregnant mice.
gene expression of il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in pbmc was assessed by real-time pcr.
