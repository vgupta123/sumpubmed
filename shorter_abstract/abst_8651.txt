chdpscs were isolated from an incisor and a canine of a forty-seven year old female chimpanzee.
chimpanzee dental pulp stem/stromal cells  are very similar to human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells  as demonstrated by the expression pattern of cell surface markers and their multipotent differentiation capability.
teeth are easy to recover at necropsy and easy to preserve prior to the retrieval of dental pulp for stem/stromal cells isolation.
chdpscs also express stem cell  and osteogenic  markers, which is comparable to reported results of rhesus monkey bmscs , hbmscs and hdpscs.
therefore, the establishment of chdpscs would preserve and maximize the applications of such a unique and invaluable animal model, and could advance the understanding of cellular functions and differentiation control of adult stem cells in higher primates.
a homogenous population of chdpscs was established in early culture at a high proliferation rate and verified by the expression pattern of thirteen cell surface markers.
these results demonstrate that chdpscs can be efficiently isolated from post-mortem teeth of adult chimpanzees and are multipotent.
the chdpscs are multipotent and were capable of differentiating into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages under appropriate in vitro culture conditions.
due to the almost identical genome composition of humans and chimpanzees, there is an emergent need for defining the new role of chimpanzee modeling in comparative medicine.
although chdpscs vigorously proliferated during the initial phase and gradually decreased in subsequent passages, the telomere length indicated that telomerase activity was not significantly reduced.
