many bacterial species respond to stress by using alternative σ factors which, in complex with rna polymerase holoenzyme, recognize specific promoter determinants.
we demonstrate that cys residues in zas, as well as the cys residue on position  <dig>  are essential for anti-σe activity of nmb <dig>  as found for a minority of members of the zas family that are predicted to act in the cytoplasm and responding to oxidative stimuli.
together, our results demonstrate that meningococci express a functional transcriptionally autoregulated σe factor, the activity of which is controlled by a novel meningococcal anti-σ factor belonging to the zas family.
fine tuning expression of genes is a prerequisite for the strictly human pathogen neisseria meningitidis to survive hostile growth conditions and establish disease.
here we identified genes belonging to the σe regulon of meningococci.
the protein encoded by nmb <dig> is structurally related to anti-sigma domain  proteins and characterized by a zinc containing anti-σ factor  motif, a hall mark of a specific class of zn2+-binding asd proteins acting as anti-σ factors.
in addition we demonstrate that σe controls expression of methionine sulfoxide reductase .
