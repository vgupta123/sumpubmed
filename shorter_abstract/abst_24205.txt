human neural stem cells  have the potential to provide novel cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative conditions such as multiple sclerosis and parkinson's disease.
in vivo, stem cells reside in distinct microenvironments or niches that are responsible for the maintenance of stem cell populations.
laminin was found to increase hnsc numbers as measured by this neurosphere formation.
to measure hnsc growth, we established culture conditions using b27-supplemented medium that enable neurospheres to grow from human neural cells plated at clonal densities.
limiting dilution assays confirmed that neurospheres were derived from single cells at these densities.
therefore, this study investigated the effect of exogenous laminin on hnsc growth.
in agreement, apoptosis was reduced in dissociated neurospheres by laminin in an integrin Î²1-dependent manner.
