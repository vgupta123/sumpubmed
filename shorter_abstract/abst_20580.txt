macrophage migration inhibitory factor  is a cytokine that shares many activities with other pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary glomerulonephritis .
urinary excretion of mif  was measured both pre- and post-treatment with combined steroids and cyclophosphamide.
the highest pre-treatment urinary excretion of mif was observed in nr-pgn , which was significantly higher than other subgroups .
the treatment significantly reduced mif urinary excretion only in r-pgn .
mif urinary excretion appears to be a prognostic marker of therapy outcomes only in proliferative glomerulonephritis, in which lower urinary mif may be linked with good prognosis, whereas a higher mif urinary excretion value was a marker of unfavorable therapy outcomes.
after a 12-month follow-up, the patients were retrospectively divided into four subgroups: responders of proliferative gn , non-responders of proliferative gn , responders of non-proliferative gn  and non-responders of non-proliferative gn .
in non-responders, urinary mif measurements may help to reconsider the choice of the immunosuppressive regimen at early stages of the treatment and act as an impulse to search for new therapeutic strategies.
in nr-pgn, pre-  and post-treatment mean mif excretion  exceeded the calculated cut off value .
this study assesses the influence of immunosuppressive treatment on serum and urine mif in patients with proliferative  and non-proliferative  glomerulonephritis, and evaluates the potential of mif in predicting outcomes.
eighty-four patients  with primary gn were included.
the median pre-treatment urinary mif values were higher in pgn than in npgn .
