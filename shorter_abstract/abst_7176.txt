levels of 5-ht1a receptor were significantly lower in the foetal hippocampus in the cus group than in the control group, with no significant difference in the hypothalamus.
body weight but not brain weight was higher for control foetuses than those from the cus group.
levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine  were higher in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of foetuses in the cus group than in the controls, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid  levels were lower in the hippocampus in foetuses in the cus group than in the control group.
levels of 5-hiaa in the hypothalamus did not differ between foetuses in the cus group and in the control group.
the ratio of 5-hiaa to 5-ht was significantly lower for foetuses in the cus group than in the control group.
the levels of serotonin transporter  were lower in both the foetal hippocampus and foetal hypothalamus in the cus group than in the control group.
our data demonstrate that pre-gestational stress alters hpa axis activity in maternal rats and their foetuses, which is associated with functional changes in 5-ht activity , as well as the levels of the 5-ht1a receptor and sert in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of foetuses.
however, few studies have investigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis activity and the serotonergic system as a consequence of pregestational stress.
in the present study, we investigated the effect of pre-gestational stress on hpa axis activity in maternal rats and their foetuses and examined whether changes in hpa axis activity of maternal rats produced functional changes in the serotonergic system in the brain of foetuses.
many studies have found that stress before or during pregnancy is linked to an increased incidence of behavioural disorders in offspring.
we used the behavioural tests to assess the model of chronic unpredictable stress  in maternal rats.
