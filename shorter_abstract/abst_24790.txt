a fast clustering algorithm was implemented and real data analysis on glioma acgh data has shown that it converges to the optimal cluster rapidly and the computation time is proportional to the sample size.
the hmmc results for glioma data were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.
a number of unsupervised learning methods have been proposed for clustering acgh samples.
two of the major challenges for developing acgh sample clustering are the high spatial correlation between acgh markers and the low computing efficiency.
the hidden markov model  was used to model the spatial correlation between acgh markers.
simulation results showed that this hmm based clustering  method has a substantially lower error rate than nmf clustering.
the recent advancement in array cgh  research has significantly improved tumor identification using dna copy number data.
we have developed a fast clustering algorithm to identify tumor subtypes based on dna copy number aberrations.
a mixture hidden markov model based algorithm was developed to address these two challenges.
