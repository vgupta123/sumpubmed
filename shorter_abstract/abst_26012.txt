we develop an empirical bayesian method based on the beta-binomial distribution to model paired data from high-throughput sequencing experiments.
methods for analysing high-throughput sequencing data from such experiments are required to identify differential expression, both within paired samples and between pairs under different experimental conditions.
pairing of samples arises naturally in many genomic experiments; for example, gene expression in tumour and normal tissue from the same patients.
we examine the performance of this method on simulated and real data in a variety of scenarios.
in testing on real data from oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, we discover greater enrichment of previously identified head and neck squamous cell carcinoma associated gene sets than has previously been achieved through a generalised linear modelling approach, suggesting that similar gains in performance may be found in real data.
