tissues were sectioned in a cryostat and changes in cellular and tissue elements during repair were evaluated using classical dyes, immmuohistochemistry and phalloidin labeling.
we found that cellular events associated with wound healing in h. glaberrima correspond to those previously shown to occur during intestinal regeneration.
these include:  an increase in the number of spherule-containing cells,  remodeling of the extracellular matrix,  formation of spindle-like structures that signal dedifferentiation of muscle cells in the area flanking the lesion site and  intense cellular division occurring mainly in the coelomic epithelium after the first week of regeneration.
it has been reported that some mechanisms, namely extracellular matrix remodeling, appear to occur in most repair processes.
in addition, the temporal and spatial distribution of cell proliferation in the animals was assayed using brdu incorporation.
however, it remains unclear to what extent the process of organ regeneration, particularly in animals where loss and regeneration of complex structures is a programmed natural event, is similar to wound healing.
our data indicate that h. glaberrima employs analogous cellular mechanisms during wound healing and organ regeneration.
lesioned tissues included muscle, nerve, water canal and dermis.
