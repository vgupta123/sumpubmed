there are some two-way shifts in diversification where sister taxa have undergone shifts in opposite directions.
to investigate which major subtaxa experienced significant shifts in diversification, we assembled a family-level phylogeny of the hymenoptera using supertree methods.
within apocrita other positive shifts include the vespoidea , anthophila + sphecidae , bethylidae + chrysididae , dryinidae , and proctotrupidae .
the supertrees most supported by the underlying input trees are produced using matrix representation with compatibility  .
problematic phylogenetic issues in the hymenoptera are identified, relating especially to superfamily validity , and deeper apocritan relationships.
our results suggest that numerous phylogenetically distinctive radiations contribute to the richness of large clades.
our results should stimulate new functional studies on the causes of the diversification shifts we have identified.
ten significant shifts in diversification  are found common to both mrc supertrees.
four relatively species-poor families  have undergone negative shifts.
they also suggest that evolutionary events restricting the subsequent richness of large clades are common.
whilst relationships at the tips of the tree tend to be well supported, those along the backbone of the tree  are generally not.
