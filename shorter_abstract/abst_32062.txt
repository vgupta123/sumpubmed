the cryptic diversity found in this study indicated that the number of species is strongly underestimated under the current taxonomy.
ten distinct evolutionary lineages were recovered from the three recognized species, eight of which were recognized as species/putative species.
two synonyms of gracilis  should be given full species status, and the taxonomic status of another three potential species should be evaluated using extensive taxon sampling, comprehensive morphological, and morphometric approaches.
to provide insight into the systematics of this group, we estimated the first multi-locus phylogeny and conducted species delimitation, including taxon sampling throughout their distribution range.
we obtained two mitochondrial genes  and eight nuclear genes  from  <dig> specimens.
five of these putative species were found to be masquerading as the gracile shrew mole.
the divergence time estimation results indicated that climate change since the last miocene and the uplift of the himalayas may have resulted in the diversification and speciation of uropsilus.
consequently, the conservation status of uropsilus spp.
