pectate lyases can be used to remove pectin from ramie in a degumming process with reduced environmental pollution and energy consumption.
however, bacillus is not a suitable host for pectate lyases during the degumming process since most bacillus produce cellulases endogenously with a detrimental effect to the fiber.
the characterized recombinant pel168p can be used to remove pectin from ramie efficiently and the expression level of pel <dig> in p. pastoris was increased markedly by codon optimization.
the conventional degumming process of ramie with alkaline treatment at high temperature causes severe environmental pollution.
pichia pastoris, which does not express endogenous cellulases and has high secretion capability, will be an ideal host for the expression.
a  <dig>  fold increase of pel <dig> enzyme expression in p. pastoris was achieved by further codon optimization.
the recombinant protein pel <dig> in p. pastoris  showed two bands of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda on sds-page whereas the enzyme expressed in e. coli  was the same as predicted with a band of  <dig> kda.
no previous work was reported concerning the heterologous expression of pectate lyase pel <dig> in p. pastoris with an aim for industrial application in ramie bio-degumming.
the gene pel <dig> was expressed in p. pastoris in this study.
pectate lyase pel <dig> with an available protein structure can be heterologously expressed in p. pastoris.
after preincubation at 60°c for  <dig> min, pel168e completely lost its activity, whereas pel168p kept 26% of the residual activity.
k+, li+, ni2+ and sr2+ showed little or no inhibitory effect on pel168p activity, and ca2+ enhanced enzyme activity by 38%.
pel168p had a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg with a km of  <dig>  mg/ml and a vmax of  <dig>  μmol/min.
the optimum reaction temperature of the two pel168s was 50°c, and the optimum ph  <dig> .
