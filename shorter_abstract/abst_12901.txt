we adapted the quantitect whole transcriptome kit  to our purposes and designated the method as whole transcriptome amplification .
rna virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi <dig> dna polymerase cannot amplify rna nor small cdna fragments  obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral rna genomes.
the amplification factor varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  we also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral rna was mixed with bacterial dna.
amplifying viral rna by wta provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random rt-pcr.
phi <dig> polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified dna with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications.
wta successfully amplified cdna from a panel of rna viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes.
