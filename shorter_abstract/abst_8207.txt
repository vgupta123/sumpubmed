in this study we wished to investigate the possible involvement of this kinase in signalling peroxide stress and nitrogen deprivation.
quantitative rt-pcr experiments revealed that the pkn <dig> gene is induced in response to peroxide stress and to combined nitrogen starvation.
our results rather invalidate this hypothesis thereby suggesting that the function of pkn <dig> under nitrogen starvation is independent of its role in response to peroxide stress.
since metabolic changes may lead to oxidative stress, we investigated whether this is the case with nitrogen starvation.

transcriptomic analysis comparing a pkn22-insertion mutant and the wild type strain indicated that this kinase regulates genes involved in important cellular functions such as photosynthesis, carbon metabolism and iron acquisition.
we have decrypted the transcriptional regulation of the pkn <dig> gene, and analysed the whole set of genes under the control of this kinase in response to the two environmental changes often encountered by cyanobacteria in their natural habitat: oxidative stress and nitrogen deprivation.
furthermore, it has to cope with reactive oxygen species generated as byproducts of photosynthesis and respiration.
