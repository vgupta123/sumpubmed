current vaccine strains derive from stocks created many decades ago; however their genotypes, underlying mechanisms and relative degree of their attenuation are largely unknown.
using mouse virulence studies we confirm that map vaccine strains 316 f, ii and 2e have diverse but clearly attenuated survival and persistence characteristics compared with wild type strains.
using a pan genomic microarray we characterise the genomic variations in a panel of vaccine strains sourced from stocks spanning over 40 years of maintenance.
mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  whole cell vaccines have been widely used tools in the control of johne’s disease in animals despite being unable to provide complete protection.

we show individual differences suitable for diagnostic differentiation between vaccine and wild type genotypes and provide evidence for functionality of some of the deleted map-specific genes and their possible relation to attenuation.
