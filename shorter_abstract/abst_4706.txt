phylosort can be applied to quantify the number of genes that support different evolutionary hypotheses such as a taxonomic classification or endosymbiotic or horizontal gene transfer events.
phylosort is an open-source tool to sort phylogenetic trees by searching for user specified subtrees that contain a monophyletic group of interest defined by operational taxonomic units in a phylogenomic context.
plastid establishment precipitated extensive gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the nuclear genome of the 'host'.
in our application, we demonstrate that cyanobacteria account for  <dig> –6% of the protein-coding genes in the nuclear genome of chlamydomonas.
phylogenomic pipelines generate a large collection of phylogenetic trees that require manual inspection to answer questions about gene or genome evolution.
using phylosort, we identified  <dig> chlamydomonas genes of putative cyanobacterial origin, of which  <dig> had bootstrap support values ≥ 50% for the grouping of the algal and cyanobacterial homologs.
in the case of primary endosymbiosis, a heterotrophic protist engulfed a cyanobacterium, giving rise to the first photosynthetic eukaryote.
estimating the magnitude of this endosymbiotic gene transfer  and determining the functions of the prokaryotic genes remain controversial issues.
to facilitate this procedure, we developed phylosort to rapidly search large collection of trees for monophyletic relationships.
