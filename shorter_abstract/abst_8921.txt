inactivation of bikinin and its derivatives in planta involves sng <dig>  which constitutes a novel pathway for modification of xenobiotic compounds.
plant gsk-3/shaggy-like kinases are key players in brassinosteroid  signalling which impact on plant development and participate in response to wounding, pathogens and salt stress.
to dissect the structural elements crucial for inhibition of gsk-3/shaggy-like kinases by bikinin and to isolate more potent compounds we synthesised a number of related substances and tested their inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo using arabidopsis thaliana.
a pyridine ring with an amido succinic acid residue in position  <dig> and a halogen in position  <dig> were crucial for inhibitory activity.
in addition, we provide evidence that iodobikinin and bikinin are inactivated in planta by conjugation with glutamic acid or malic acid and that the latter process is catalysed by the malate transferase sng <dig>
here we report the development of bikinin derivatives with increased potency that can activate br signalling and mimic br action.
hplc analysis revealed that the methyl residue was rapidly cleaved off in planta liberating active iodobikinin.
bikinin was previously identified in a chemical genetics screen as an inhibitor targeting these kinases.
