micro-biological research relies on the use of model organisms that act as representatives of their species or subspecies, these are frequently well-characterized laboratory strains.
we develop the best total coverage  method for selecting one or more representative model organisms from a group of interest, given that rough genetic distances between the members of the group are known.
in both the simulated and biological examples the greedy-btc method outperformed random selection of model organisms, and for two biological examples it outperformed selection of model strains based on phylogenetic structure.
however, it has often become apparent that the model strain initially chosen does not represent important features of the species.
for micro-organisms, the diversity of their genomes is such that even the best possible choice of initial strain for sequencing may not assure that the genome obtained adequately represents the species.
software implementing a "greedy" version of the method can be used with large data sets, its effectiveness is tested using both constructed and biological data sets.
