when applied to the testing cohort, the classifier correctly predicted 90% of node-positive cases, and 80% of node-negative cases .
metastasis via pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer.
<dig> tumors matched for age and race, and evenly distributed between lymph node-positive and lymph node-negative cases, were selected as a training cohort.
we sought to identify a robust molecular signature that can accurately classify risk of lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients.
results indicate that the evaluation of the quantitative sparse-feature classifier proposed here in clinical trials may lead to significant improvement in the prediction of lymphatic metastases in endometrial cancer patients.
therefore, national guidelines for primary staging surgery include pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection for all patients whose tumor exceeds 2cm in diameter.
