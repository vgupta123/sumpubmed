wild caught seawater fish collected in gulf of salerno , especially in marine areas including mouths of streams, were contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains and that they might play an important role in the spread of antibiotic-resistance.
three antibiotic substances  were detected  in octopus vulgaris, sepia officinalis and thais haemastoma.
aim of the study is to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products.
in vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in octopus vulgaris, a resistance against  <dig> antibiotics was noted.
the main consequences of use and abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that has become a serious global problem.
environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is a public health concern: drugs administered to humans and animals are excreted with urine or faeces and attend the sewage treatment.
