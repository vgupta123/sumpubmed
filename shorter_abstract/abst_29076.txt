we present here a robust optimised method for high resolution immunofluorescence labelling of ffpe tissues, which involves the combination of antigen retrieval, indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
we demonstrate the utility of this method with examples of immunofluorescence labelling of human kidney, human breast and a tissue microarray of invasive human breast cancers.
investigating the expression of candidate genes in tissue samples usually involves either immunohistochemical labelling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  sections or immunofluorescence labelling of cryosections.
for the pathologist, it will enable them to utilise multiple antibodies on a single section to characterise particular cell populations or to test multiple biomarkers in limited samples and define with greater accuracy cellular heterogeneity in tissue samples.
consequently, there is a demand in the research community to be able to perform routine, high quality immunofluorescence labelling of ffpe tissues.
for the cell biologist, it will enable them to utilise the vast archive of pathology specimens to advance their in vitro data into in vivo samples, in particular archival material and tissue microarrays.
this approach has the potential to unlock a large in vivo database for immunofluorescence investigations and has the major advantages over immunohistochemistry in that it provides higher resolution imaging of antigen localization and the ability to label multiple antigens simultaneously.
