mycobacterium tuberculosis, an intracellular pathogen encounters redox stress throughout its life inside the host.
using yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified alpha -glucan branching enzyme  of m. tuberculosis as a interaction partner of whib <dig>  in vitro gst pull down assay confirmed the direct physical interaction between glgb and whib <dig>  both mass spectrometry data of tryptic digests and in vitro labeling of cysteine residues with 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene- <dig>  2'-disulfonic acid showed that in glgb, c <dig> and c <dig> are free but c <dig> and c <dig> form an intra-molecular disulfide bond.
we conclude that m. tuberculosis glgb has one intra-molecular disulfide bond which is formed between c <dig> and c <dig>  whib <dig>  a thioredoxin like protein interacts with glgb and transfers its electrons to the disulfide thus reduces the intra-molecular disulfide bond of glgb.
generally thioredoxins have many substrate proteins.
the current study aims to identify the substrate protein of m. tuberculosis whib <dig>
whib <dig> has a c37xxc <dig> motif thus a c40s mutation renders c <dig> to exist as a free thiol to form a hetero-disulfide bond with the cysteine residue of substrate protein.
finally, transfer of reducing equivalent from whib <dig> to glgb disulfide was confirmed by 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene- <dig>  2'-disulfonic acid trapping by the reduced disulfide of glgb.
