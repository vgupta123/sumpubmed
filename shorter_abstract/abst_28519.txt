conversely, the pld mutant appeared to invade hela cells approximately two-fold more efficiently as the wild type.
the pld gene is found on a genomic region of reduced %g + c, suggesting recent horizontal acquisition.
these data indicate that pld enhances bacterial adhesion and promotes host cell necrosis following invasion, and therefore, may be important in the disease pathogenesis of a. haemolyticum infections.
arcanobacterium haemolyticum is an emerging bacterial pathogen, causing pharyngitis and more invasive infections.
pld also promoted host cell adhesion, as a pld mutant had a  <dig> % reduction in its ability to adhere to hela cells as compared to the wild type.
as determined by viability assay, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of hela cells remained viable following invasion by the wild type or pld mutant, respectively, as compared to untreated hela cells.
transmission electron microscopy of hela cells inoculated with a. haemolyticum strains revealed that the pld mutant was contained within intracellular vacuoles, as compared to the wild type, which escaped the vacuole.
wild type-infected hela cells also displayed the hallmarks of necrosis.
this finding was attributable to a significant loss of host cell viability following secretion of pld from intracellular bacteria.
recombinant pld rearranged hela cell lipid rafts in a dose-dependent manner and this was inhibited by cholesterol sequestration.
this organism expresses an unusual phospholipase d , which we propose promotes bacterial pathogenesis through its action on host cell membranes.
similarly inoculated hela cells displayed no signs of apoptosis, as measured by induction of caspase 3/ <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> activities.
