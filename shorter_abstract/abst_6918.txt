synaptic dysfunction is a key event in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimerâ€™s disease  where synapse loss pathologically correlates with cognitive decline and dementia.
the novel compound, nmz, was shown to retain the gabaa potentiating actions of cmz in vitro and sedative activity in vivo.
therefore, to provide a successful disease-modifying compound and address synaptic dysfunction and memory loss in ad and mixed pathology dementia, we repurposed a clinically proven drug, cmz, with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties via addition of nitric oxide  and cgmp signaling property.
our findings show that nmz embodies a promising pharmacological approach targeting synaptic dysfunction and opens new avenues for neuroprotective intervention strategies in mixed pathology ad, neurodegeneration, and dementia.
importantly, nmz restored ltp in hippocampal slices from ad transgenic mice, whereas cmz was without effect.
