increasingly, similarity networks are being used for evolutionary analyses of molecular datasets.
in order to ease the use of similarity networks in the community of evolutionary biologists, we introduce a software program, egn, that runs under linux or macosx.
these networks are very useful, in particular for the analysis of gene sharing, lateral gene transfer and for the detection of distant homologs.
egn also implements statistics describing genetic diversity in these samples, for various user-defined thresholds of similarities.
rather than being genetic couriers involved in lateral gene transfer, borreliaâ€™s plasmids and their genes act as private genetic goods, that contribute to the creation of genetic diversity within their parasitic hosts.
egn automates the reconstruction of gene and genome networks from nucleic and proteic sequences.
in the interest of studying the complexity of evolutionary processes affecting microbial evolution, we applied egn to a dataset of  <dig>  proteic sequences from the three domains of life and from mobile elements.
