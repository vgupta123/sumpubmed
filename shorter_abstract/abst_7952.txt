this seems to be a promising result, and if confirmed the efficiency of a-nk cells in killing endometriosis lesions, maybe in the future we could use this approach as an alternative treatment for women with endometriosis.
in this sense, it has been strongly suggested that a fundamental part of immunologic system, the natural killer cells , are an important part of this process.
therefore, in this study, we evaluated the ability of adoptively transferred and endogenous nk cells to infiltrate endometriosis lesions.
our data show that exogenous a-nk cells injected via ip combined with endogenous a-nk cells seems to be the most efficient way for activated nk cells track and infiltrate endometriosis.
for the first time, it was shown that both endogenous as exogenous a-nk cells are able to track, migrate and infiltrate endometriosis lesion.

recent studies have shown that il-2-activated nk  cells are able to attack and destroy tumors in lungs and livers of mice, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these cells.
an increasing number of studies suggest that changes in immune reactivity may be primarily involved in the development of endometriosis development.
endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma at ectopic locations.
similarly to metastatic tumor cells, endometrial cells are able to adhere, infiltrate and proliferate at ectopic locations.
