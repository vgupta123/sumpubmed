in this orientation, we explore the cardiac aging mechanisms â€“ risk factor for multiple cardiovascular diseases - by capturing the micronome synergism and detecting longevity signatures in the form of communities .
also, mir-125a-5p/- <dig>  mir-200c/- <dig>  mir-106b/- <dig>  mir-363/-92b, mir-181b/-181d, mir-19a/-19b, let-7d/-7f, mir-18a/-18b, mir-128/-27b and mir-106a/-291a-3p pairs exhibited significant synergy and their association to aging and/or cardiovascular diseases is supported in many cases by a disease database and previous studies.
it can also promote the combinational multi-target microrna therapy of age-related cardiovascular diseases along the continuum from prevention to detection, diagnosis, treatment and outcome.
among various observations, we corroborate to the involvement of mir-34a  as proposed recently; yet we report that has no synergistic effect.
modularization of each weighted network produced modules, which in turn were further analyzed so as to define consensus modules across datasets that change substantially during lifespan.
the respective homologs mainly represent nadh dehydrogenases, atp synthases, cytochrome oxidases, ras gtpases and ribosomal proteins.
the integromics meta-analysis approach can serve as an efficient subvening signature tool for more-oriented better-designed experiments.
for this, we developed a meta-analysis scheme that integrates transcriptome expression data from multiple cardiac-specific independent studies in mouse and human along with proteome and micronome interaction data in the form of multiple independent weighted networks.
on the contrary, we suggest that mir- <dig> has not substantial impact on heart longevity as proposed recently.
