among vertebrates lens regeneration is most pronounced in newts, which have the ability to regenerate the entire lens throughout their lives.
frogs have limited lens regeneration capacity elicited from the cornea during pre-metamorphic stages.
we have found that starting at stage  <dig>  lens regeneration is possible for nearly two weeks.
similar studies in the zebra fish concluded that lens regeneration is not possible.
thus the axolotl iris provides a novel and more plastic strategy for lens regeneration.
regeneration occurs from the dorsal iris by transdifferentiation of the pigment epithelial cells.
regeneration occurs from the iris but, in contrast to the newt, regeneration can be elicited from either the dorsal or the ventral iris and, occasionally, even from both in the same eye.
here we present a detailed analysis during different stages of axolotl development, and we show that despite previous beliefs the axolotl does regenerate the lens, however, only during a limited time after hatching.
interestingly, the ventral iris never contributes to regeneration.
