the activity of the oct <dig> gene in vole, as well as in mouse, is confined only to pluripotent cells.
promoter and regulatory regions of the vole oct <dig> gene also display a high similarity to the corresponding regions of oct <dig> in other mammalian species, and are active during the transient transfection within luciferase reporter constructs into mouse p <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells and tg-2a embryonic stem cells.
it consists of five exons and a regulatory region including the minimal promoter, proximal and distal enhancers.
the mouse, human, and bovine oct <dig> orthologs display a high conservation of nucleotide sequence and genomic organization.
genomic organization of this gene and its intron-exon structure in vole are identical to those in all previously studied species: it comprises five exons and the regulatory region containing several conserved elements.
organization and exon-intron structure of vole oct <dig> gene are similar to the gene organization in other mammalian species.
oct <dig> is a pou-domain transcriptional factor which is essential for maintaining pluripotency in several mammalian species.
