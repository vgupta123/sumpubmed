we postulate that calreticulin be considered as a novel cardiac fetal gene.
calreticulin is temporarily expressed during heart development where it is required for proper myofibrillogenesis.
calreticulin is a ca2+ binding chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum which influences gene expression and cell adhesion.
cardiac development is strictly dependent upon the ability of cells to adhere to their substratum and to communicate with their neighbours.
we show here that the levels of n-cadherin are downregulated in calreticulin-deficient mouse embryonic hearts, which may lead to the disarray and wavy appearance of myofibrils in these mice, which we detected at all investigated stages of cardiac development.
interestingly, these major differences were only detected in the developing ventricles while the atria of both calreticulin phenotypes were similar in appearance at all developmental stages.
the levels of both vinculin and n-cadherin are induced by calreticulin expression, which play important roles in cell adhesiveness.
