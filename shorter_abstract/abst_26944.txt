the pmrp and differentially expressed pmrp sets all showed a functional skew toward signal transduction, transporters, wall remodeling/metabolism and membrane trafficking.
the plasma membrane  represents an important interface for cell–cell interaction, and pm proteins of pts are pioneers for mediating pt integrity and interaction with pistils.
in combination with the rice pollen transcriptome data, we revealed that in general, the protein expression of these pmrps disagreed with their mrna expression, with inconsistent mrna expression for 74% of differentially expressed pmrps.
the coordination of pollen tube  growth, guidance and timely growth arrest and rupture mediated by pt-pistil interaction is crucial for the pt to transport sperm cells into ovules for double fertilization.

using the efficient aqueous polymer two-phase system and alkali buffer treatment, we prepared high-purity pm from mature and germinated pollen of rice.
their genomic loci had strong chromosome bias.
this study identified genome-wide pollen pmrps, and provided insights into the membrane profile of receptor-like kinases and transporters important for pollen tube growth and interaction with pistils.
these pollen pmrps and their mrnas showed discordant expression.
this work provides resource and knowledge to further dissect mechanisms by which pollen or the pt controls pmrp abundance and monitors interactions and ion and metabolite exchanges with female cells in rice.
we found  <dig> receptor-like kinases  from  <dig> kinase subfamilies and  <dig> transporters involved in flux of diversified ions and metabolites.
