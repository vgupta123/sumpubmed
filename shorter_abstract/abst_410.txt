the dermaptera belongs to a group of winged insects of uncertain relationship within polyneoptera, which has expanded anal region and adds numerous anal veins in the hind wing.
it is suggested that the oldest dermaptera might possibly be traced back to the late triassic-early jurassic and they had divided into archidermaptera and  in the middle jurassic.
evolutional history and origin of dermaptera have been in contention, with dramatically different viewpoints by contemporary authors.
in this paper, we report two new fossil earwigs in a new family of bellodermatidae fam.
this new family, characterized by an unexpected combination of primitive and derived characters, is bridging the missing link between suborders of archidermaptera and eodermaptera.
phylogenetic analyses support the new family to be a new clade at the base of previously defined eodermaptera and to be a stem group of .
evolutional history and origin of dermaptera have been in contention.
nov. the fossils were collected from the jiulongshan formation  in inner mongolia, northeast china.
