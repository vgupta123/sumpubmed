our results indicated that all the pretreatment inhibitors tested in this study had a detrimental effect on both z. mobilis and s. cerevisiae, and vanillin had the most inhibitory effect followed by furfural and then hmf for both z. mobilis and s. cerevisiae.
saccharomyces cerevisiae lsm protein  mutants and lsm protein overexpression strains were also assayed for their inhibitor phenotypes.
s. cerevisiae lsm protein overexpression strains showed increased acetate and hmf resistance as compared to the wild-type, while the overexpression strains showed greater inhibition under vanillin stress conditions.
we also assayed growth phenotypes for s. cerevisiae lsm protein mutant and overexpression phenotypes.
in a previous study, we observed z. mobilis zm <dig> gene zmo <dig> showed higher expression under anaerobic, stationary phase compared to that of aerobic, stationary conditions.
the conserved nature of this global regulator offers the potential to apply insights from these fundamental studies for further industrial strain development.
we generated a z. mobilis hfq insertion mutant acrim <dig> in an acetate tolerant strain  background and investigated its role in model lignocellulosic pretreatment inhibitors including acetate, vanillin, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural .
we have also used genetics to show z. mobilis hfq and s. cerevisiae lsm proteins play important roles in resisting multiple, important industrially relevant inhibitors.
we have shown the utility of the pknock suicide plasmid for mutant construction in z. mobilis, and constructed a gateway compatible expression plasmid for use in z. mobilis for the first time.
lsm <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mutants showed reduced tolerance to acetate and other pretreatment inhibitors.
