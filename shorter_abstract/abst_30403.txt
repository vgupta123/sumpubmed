hence, when performing a rna-seq analysis, using the highest possible coverage of the genome is recommended for the purposes of classification.
because ngs technologies result in a nonlinear transformation of the actual expression distributions, their application can result in data that are less discriminative than would be the actual expression levels themselves, were they directly observable.
having high numbers of reads can mitigate the degradation in classification performance resulting from the effects of ngs technologies.
the effects of different factors are considered and ngs-based classification is compared to sage-based classification and classification directly on the raw expression data, which is represented by a very high-dimensional model previously developed for gene expression.
