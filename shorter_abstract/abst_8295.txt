these unigenes were assigned to the functional categories of "metabolism", "development", "cellular process", "diverse/miscellanenous functions", "regulation overview", "response to stimulus, stress", "signaling", "transport overview", "xenoprotein, transposable element" and "unknown".
metabolic profiling using 1h nmr spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism.
several genes were identified that had not been previously reported in the context of grape ripening namely genes involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms as well as in growth regulators; metabolism, epigenetic factors and signaling pathways.
the mrna expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through véraison and mature berries  and in two seasons  were compared using the affymetrix grapegen® genome array containing  <dig> probesets corresponding to  <dig> unique sequences.
quantitative rt-pcr validated microarrays results being carried out for eight selected genes and five developmental stages .
these results were integrated with transcriptional profiling obtained using genome array to provide new information regarding the network of events leading to grape ripening.
a common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to  <dig> unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways between years despite the irregular development of trincadeira grapes.
altogether the data obtained provides the most extensive survey obtained so far for gene expression and metabolites accumulated during grape ripening.
some of these genes were annotated as receptors, transcription factors, and kinases and constitute good candidates for functional analysis in order to establish a model for ripening control of a non-climacteric fruit.
grapes  are economically the most important fruit crop worldwide.
moreover, it highlighted information obtained in a poorly known variety exhibiting particular characteristics that may be cultivar specific or dependent upon climatic conditions.
ripening of trincadeira grapes was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data.
over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed  between at least two developmental stages.
