these markers were suitable for genetic studies as demonstrated in the full-sib family ‘holiday’ × ‘korona’ with the generation of a genetic linkage map consisting of  <dig>  phr snps evenly distributed across  <dig> chromosomes with an average density of approximately one marker per  <dig>  cm, thus exceeding our goal of one marker per cm.
this array enables genetic analyses including generation of high-density linkage maps, identification of quantitative trait loci for economically important traits, and genome-wide association studies, thus providing a basis for marker-assisted breeding in this high value crop.
strategies and filtering pipelines were developed to identify and incorporate markers of several types: di-allelic snps , multi-allelic snps , indels , and ploidy-reducing “haplosnps” .
the array’s high success rate is likely driven by the presence of naturally occurring variation in ploidy level within the nominally octoploid genome, and by effectiveness of the employed array design and ploidy-reducing strategies.
about  <dig> million sequence variants were identified in a  <dig> member, octoploid germplasm panel.
short-read sequences from one diploid and  <dig> octoploid accessions were aligned to the diploid fragaria vesca ‘hawaii 4’ reference genome to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  and indels for incorporation into a 90 k affymetrix® axiom® array.
we report the development and preliminary evaluation of this array.
the highest quality classes, polyhigh resolution , no minor homozygote , and off-target variant  comprised 25%, 38%, and 1% of array markers, respectively.
