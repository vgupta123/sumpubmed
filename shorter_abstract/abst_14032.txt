using a gene clustering strategy we determined intracellular pathway relationships within skeletal myotubes in response to an acute heat stress stimuli.
following heat shock, the transcriptome was analyzed by microarray in a temporal fashion to characterize the dynamic relationship of signaling pathways.
bioinformatics analyses exposed coordination of functionally-related gene sets, depicting mechanism-based responses to heat shock.
