success of such structural comparison methods depends crucially on the accurate identification and delineation of secondary structure elements.
we have developed a method palsse  that delineates secondary structure elements  from protein cα coordinates and specifically addresses the requirements of vector-based protein similarity searches.
consecutive elements may overlap, thus allowing residues located at the overlapping region to have more than one secondary structure type.
our results are in agreement with human judgment and dssp.
the program and results are available at .
in contrast to traditional secondary structure algorithms, which identify a secondary structure state for every residue in a protein chain, our program attributes residues to linear sses.
palsse is predictive in nature and can assign about 80% of the protein chain to sses as compared to 53% by dssp and 57% by p-sea.
the majority of residues in protein structures are involved in the formation of α-helices and β-strands.
our program identifies two types of secondary structures: helix and β-strand, typically those that can be well approximated by vectors.
these distinctive secondary structure patterns can be used to represent a protein for visual inspection and in vector-based protein structure comparison.
