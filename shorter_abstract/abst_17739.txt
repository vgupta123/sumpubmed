additional we discovered that the experimentally observed regulation of the phosphotransferase spo0b for wild-type b. subtilis may be playing an important role in the network which suggests that modelling of sporulation initiation may require additional experimental support.
the analysis of the model results and the comparison with experimental data indicate that the model is good at predicting inducible responses to sporulation signals.
however, the model is unable to reproduce experimentally observed accumulation of phosphorelay sporulation proteins in wild type b. subtilis.
this paper defines and analyses a mathematical model for the network regulating bacillus subtilis sporulation initiation, from sensing of sporulation signals down to the activation of the early genes under control of the master regulator spo0a.
this model also highlights that the phosphorelay sub-component, which relays the signals detected by the sensor kinases to the master regulator spo0a, is crucial in determining the response dynamics of the system.
bacterial spores are important contaminants in food, and the spore forming bacteria are often implicated in food safety and food quality considerations.
the process culminates in the formation of resting cells capable of resisting environmental extremes and remaining dormant for long periods of time, germinating when conditions promote further vegetative growth.
our model summarises and extends other published modelling studies, by allowing the user to execute sporulation initiation in a scenario where isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  is used as an artificial sporulation initiator as well as in modelling the induction of sporulation in wild-type cells.
