among other features, ete allows for the independent analysis of tree partitions, has support for the extended newick format, provides an integrated node annotation system and permits to link trees to external data such as multiple sequence alignments or numerical arrays.
ete provides a complete set of methods to manipulate tree data structures that extends current functionality in other bioinformatic toolkits of a more general purpose.
many bioinformatics analyses, ranging from gene clustering to phylogenetics, produce hierarchical trees as their main result.
here we present the environment for tree exploration , a python programming toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees.
a number of standalone programs are available that focus on tree visualization or that perform specific analyses on them.
ete is free software and can be downloaded from http://ete.cgenomics.org.
in addition, ete implements a number of built-in analytical tools, including phylogeny-based orthology prediction and cluster validation techniques.
