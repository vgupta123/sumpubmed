while no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as p27kip <dig> for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors.
we have also used immunohistochemistry techniques to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin e, p27kip <dig>  fhit, ki- <dig>  pcna, bax, bcl- <dig>  p <dig>  fas, fasl and htert in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and the adrenocortical carcinomas , adenomas , and hyperplasia  involved with cushing's syndrome.
this research has many potential applications; it might provide an alternative diagnostic tool and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in malignant transformation as well as information that is useful for treatment planning and cancer prevention.
it follows from a comprehensive statistical analysis that a number of antigens such as htert, pcna and ki- <dig> can be considered as cancer markers, while another set of antigens such as p27kip <dig> and fhit are possible markers for normal tissue.
it is evident that when all sorts of machine learning and statistically learning techniques are combined appropriately into one integrated intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power can be enhanced significantly.
these variants and algorithms we have developed, tend to detect microscopic pathological changes based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles.
we provided statistical evidence that higher expression levels of htert, pcna and ki- <dig> etc.
we also investigated whether higher expression levels of p27kip <dig> and fhit, etc., are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors.
