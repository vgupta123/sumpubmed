in the context of this effort we here report our characterisation of an expressed sequence tag  screen in the serpulid annelid, pomatoceros lamarckii.
these sequences are used to build phylogenetic trees to estimate relative branch lengths amongst different taxa and, by comparison to genomic data from other animals, patterns of gene retention and loss are deduced.
it is clear that the traditional molecular model systems for protostomes , which are restricted to the ecdysozoa, have undergone extensive gene loss during evolution.
since the drastic reorganisation of the phylogeny of the animal kingdom into three major clades of bilaterians; ecdysozoa, lophotrochozoa and deuterostomia, it became glaringly obvious that the selection of model systems with extensive molecular resources was heavily biased towards only two of these three clades, namely the ecdysozoa and deuterostomia.
the molecular phylogenetic trees including the p. lamarckii sequences extend early observations that polychaetes tend to have relatively short branches in such trees, and hence are useful taxa with which to reconstruct gene family evolution.
also, with the availability of lophotrochozoan data such as that of p. lamarckii, it is now possible to make much more accurate reconstructions of the gene complement of the ancestor of the bilaterians than was previously possible from comparisons of ecdysozoan and deuterostome genomes to non-bilaterian outgroups.
a distinct category of genes that includes those present in non-bilaterians and lophotrochozoans, but which are absent from ecdysozoans and deuterostomes, highlights the need for further lophotrochozoan data to gain a more complete understanding of the gene complement of the bilaterian ancestor.
