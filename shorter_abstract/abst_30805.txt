efficient similarity query processing method for large chemical databases is challenging since we need to balance running time efficiency and similarity search accuracy.
to bridge graph kernel function and similarity search in chemical databases, we applied a novel kernel-based similarity measurement, developed in our team, to measure similarity of graph represented chemicals.
we have applied our method, named g-hash, to large chemical databases.
moreover, the similarity measurement and the index structure is scalable to large chemical databases with smaller indexing size, and faster query processing time as compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods such as daylight fingerprints, c-tree and graphgrep.
our previous similarity search method, g-hash, provides a new way to perform similarity search in chemical databases.
experimental study validates the utility of g-hash in chemical databases.
in our method, we utilize a hash table to support new graph kernel function definition, efficient storage and fast search.
though successful in constructing accurate predictive and classification models, graph kernel functions can not be applied to large chemical compound database due to the high computational complexity and the difficulties in indexing similarity search for large databases.
our results show that the g-hash method achieves state-of-the-art performance for k-nearest neighbor  classification.
recently various graph kernel functions have been designed to capture the intrinsic similarity of graphs.
