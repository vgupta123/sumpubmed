two gene prediction programs which make use of comparative genomic analysis, twinscan and eugene, have recently been deployed on the arabidopsis genome.
several lines of evidence support the existence of novel genes and other transcribed units which have not yet been annotated in the arabidopsis genome.
we have verified the structure and expression of  <dig> genes that were not present within the most recent release of the arabidopsis genome annotation.
based upon this information derived from these efforts it is likely that the arabidopsis genome annotation continues to overlook several hundred protein coding genes.
we have investigated the accuracy of the twinscan and eugene gene prediction programs and found them to be reliable predictors of gene structure in arabidopsis.
a high throughput race pipeline was utilized in an attempt to verify the structure and expression of these novel genes.
