we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and a recently developed molecular subtyping approach termed crispr-mvlst that exploits the hypervariable nature of virulence genes and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  to subtype clinical s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg isolates.
we analyzed a broad set of  <dig> s. heidelberg and s. typhimurium isolates collected over a five-year period.
conversely, we show that subtyping by either crispr-mvlst or pfge independently provides a sufficient discriminatory power  for s. typhimurium.
additionally, using isolates from two s. typhimurium outbreaks, we demonstrate that crispr-mvlst provides excellent epidemiologic concordance.
for s. heidelberg, our data shows that combined typing by both crispr-mvlst and pfge provided a discriminatory power of  <dig> .
we identified  <dig> heidelberg sequence types  and  <dig> typhimurium sts  that were represented by  <dig> and  <dig> pfge pulsotypes, respectively, and determined the discriminatory power of each method.
importantly, crispr-mvlst was able to separate common pfge patterns such as jf6x <dig>  into distinct sts, thus providing significantly greater discriminatory power.
enterica serovars typhimurium  and heidelberg  are major causes of foodborne salmonellosis, accounting for a fifth of all annual salmonellosis cases in the united states.
