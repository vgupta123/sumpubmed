indeed, our finding that dispersal movements in the matrix are straighter than resource searching movements within habitat supports the prediction of simulation studies that adopting straight movements for dispersal reduces its costs in fragmented landscapes.
the perceptual range being lower than the distance between habitat patches in the study area, p. eunomia likely perceives these habitat networks as fragmented, and must locate suitable habitats while dispersing across the landscape matrix.
correlated random walk adequately described movement behaviour for 70% of the observed movement paths within habitat and in the matrix.
our results support the mounting evidence that dispersal in fragmented landscapes evolved towards the use of specific movement behaviour, different from explorative searching movements within habitat.
this leads to an increase or decrease of dispersal according to its cost relative to landscape structure.
here we quantified the movement behaviour of the bog fritillary butterfly  by  assessing perceptual range, the distance to which the habitat can be perceived, and  tracking and parameterizing movement behaviour within and outside habitat .
perceptual range was <  <dig> m.  movements were significantly straighter in the matrix than within the habitat.
as distance between suitable habitats increases, the ongoing process of habitat fragmentation is expected to generate strong selection pressures on movement behaviour.
dispersal between habitat patches is a key process in the functioning of populations.
such a constraint means that dispersal entails costs, and that selection pressure should favour behaviours that limit these costs.
