the methylation status of h <dig> imprinting control region  and h <dig> promoter was assessed, as well as the gene expression level of h <dig>  in individual blastocysts.
<dig>  superovulation clearly disrupted h <dig> gene expression in individual blastocysts.
our results suggest that h <dig> could be used as a sensor of the epigenetic disturbance of the utilized techniques.
in this study, we evaluated the impact of superovulation, in vitro fertilization  and embryo culture conditions on proper genomic imprinting and blastocyst development in single mouse embryos.
<dig>  the culture medium influences early embryo development with faster cleavage kinetics for culture in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium compared to m <dig> medium.
various clinical and experimental studies also suggest alterations of embryo development after art.
in the last few years, an increase in imprinting anomalies has been reported in children born from assisted reproductive technology .
<dig>  epigenetic alterations of the h <dig> icr and h <dig> pp are influenced by the fertilization method since methylation anomalies were observed only in the in vitro fertilized subgroup, however to different degrees according to the culture medium.
in parallel, we have evaluated embryo cleavage kinetics and recorded morphological data.
moreover, when embryos were cultured in vitro after either in vivo or in vitro fertilization, the percentage of blastocysts which expressed h <dig> was higher in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium compared to m <dig>
in this study, different experimental groups were established to obtain embryos from superovulated and non-superovulated females, either from in vivo or in vitro fertilized oocytes, themselves grown in vitro or not.
