uniquely, it systematically excludes potential artefacts emanating from pseudogenes, segmental duplications, and template switching, and outputs both ptes and canonical exon junction counts to facilitate comparative analyses.
with high sensitivity and specificity, user-adjustable filters that target known sources of false positives, and tailored output to facilitate comparison of transcript levels, ptesfinder will facilitate the discovery and analysis of these poorly understood transcripts.
ptesfinder also identifies between 13 % and  <dig>  % more structures, compared to publicly available methods recently used to identify human circular rnas.
these have been identified in a wide variety of tissues and cell types from many eukaryotes, and are now known to be mostly circular, cytoplasmic, and non-coding.
accurate identification of these transcripts can, however, be difficult due to artefacts from a wide variety of sources.
here, we present a computational method, ptesfinder, to identify these transcripts from high throughput rnaseq data.
