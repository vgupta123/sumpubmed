fourth, retention correlates with overall sequence conservation within the binding regions independent of c/ebpα and pparγ sequence patterns, indicating that other transcription factors work cooperatively with these two key transcription factors.
here we have mapped all binding sites of c/ebpα and pparγ in human sgbs adipocytes and compared these with the genome-wide profiles from mouse adipocytes to systematically investigate what biological features correlate with retention of sites in orthologous regions between mouse and human.
the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ  and ccaat/enhancer binding protein α  are key transcriptional regulators of adipocyte differentiation and function.
this study provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of what biological features impact on retention of binding sites between human and mouse.
we and others have previously shown that binding sites of these two transcription factors show a high degree of overlap and are associated with the majority of genes upregulated during differentiation of murine 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes.
specifically, we show that the binding of c/ebpα and pparγ in adipocytes have evolved in a highly interdependent manner, indicating a significant cooperativity between these two transcription factors.
