from this study, it can be concluded that cell culture pcv <dig> can replicate efficiently and produce pathology in the lungs of porcine foetuses inoculated at  <dig> days of foetal life.
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  has been described as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the pk- <dig> cell line.
nine foetuses from three sows were inoculated at  <dig> days of gestation: three with  <dig>  tcid <dig> of the pcv <dig> cell culture strain atcc-ccl <dig>  three with  <dig>  tcid <dig> of the pcv <dig> field strain  <dig> and three with cell culture medium .
microscopic lesions characterized by severe haemorrhages were observed in the lungs of two foetuses inoculated with ccl <dig>  high pcv <dig> titres  were found in the lungs of the ccl33-inoculated foetuses.
to our knowledge, nothing is known about the outcome of pcv <dig> infections in porcine foetuses.
pcv1-positive cells  were found in the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, thymus and tonsils.
several experimental infections with pcv <dig> failed to reproduce disease in pigs.
this was examined in the present study.
all other organs of the ccl33-inoculated foetuses and all the organs of the 3384-inoculated foetuses were negative  by virus titration.
