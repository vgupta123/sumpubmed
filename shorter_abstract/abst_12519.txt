then, we applied this framework to assess the impact of kies on the central carbon metabolism of escherichia coli in the context of 13c-iles, under different situations commonly encountered in laboratories.
these results demonstrate the necessity of investigating the impact of kies at the level of the entire system, contradict previous hypotheses that kies would have a strong effect on isotopic distributions and on flux determination, and strengthen the biological value of 13c-iles.
the global robustness of both the metabolic operation and isotopic patterns largely emerge from intrinsic properties of metabolic networks, such as the distribution of control across the network and bidirectional isotope exchange.
some enzymes are subject to kinetic isotope effects  which modulate reaction rates depending on the isotopic composition of their substrate.
results showed that the impact of kies strongly depends on the label input and on the variable considered but is significantly lower than expected intuitively from measurements on isolated enzymes.
kies may therefore affect both the propagation of isotopes through metabolic networks and their operation, and ultimately jeopardize the biological value of iles.
first, we developed a framework which integrates kies into kinetic and isotopic models of metabolism, thereby accounting for their system-wide effects on metabolite concentrations, metabolic fluxes, and isotopic patterns.
however, the actual impact of kies on metabolism has never been investigated at the system level.
the proposed modeling framework is generic and can be used to investigate the impact of all the isotopic tracers  on different isotopic datasets and metabolic systems.
isotope labeling experiments  are increasingly used to investigate the functioning of metabolic systems.
