there is no significant difference of the frequency of s. tigurinus detection by rt-pcr in the saliva and dental plaque samples in the two groups: in the control group,  <dig>  out of  <dig> individuals had s. tigurinus either in the saliva samples and/or in the plaque samples; and in the periodontitis group,  <dig>  out of  <dig> patients had s. tigurinus in the mouth samples, respectively .
in this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of s. tigurinus in the human oral microbial flora and analyzed its association with periodontal disease or health.
we developed a diagnostic highly sensitive and specific real-time taqman pcr assay for detection of s. tigurinus in clinical samples, based on the 16s rrna gene.
overall, s. tigurinus was detected in  <dig>  out of  <dig> patients.
although s. tigurinus was a frequently detected species of the human oral microbial flora, it was not associated with periodontal disease.
further investigations are required to determine whether s. tigurinus is a commensal or an opportunistic oral pathogen with a potential for development of invasive infections.
many bacteria causing systemic invasive infections originate from the oral cavity by entering the bloodstream.
we analyzed saliva samples and subgingival plaque samples of a periodontally healthy control group  and a periodontitis group .
recently, a novel pathogenic bacterium, streptococcus tigurinus, was identified as causative agent of infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis.
