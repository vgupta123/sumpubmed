in this study, the correlation between gene content, serotype, phenotype and virulence among  <dig> s. suis strains was studied using comparative genome hybridization .
clustering of cgh data divided s. suis isolates into two clusters, a and b. cluster a isolates could be discriminated from cluster b isolates based on the protein expression of extracellular factor .
s. suis is a heterogeneous species.
profiles of  <dig> putative virulence-associated genes of s. suis were determined among the  <dig> isolates.
divergence of s. suis isolates was further studied based on the presence of  <dig> regions of difference.
in conclusion, we show that cgh is a valuable method to study distribution of genes or gene clusters among isolates in detail, yielding information on genetic similarity, and virulence traits of s. suis isolates.
presence of all  <dig> genes was shown for cluster a isolates, whereas cluster b isolates lacked one or more putative virulence genes.
cluster b mainly contained serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates.
genetic similarity was observed between serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates that do not express muramidase released protein  and ef , suggesting these isolates originated from a common founder.
conservation of genes was evaluated by the definition of a core genome that contained 78% of all orfs in p1/ <dig>
