results showed that the proposed permutation strategy is more powerful and efficient with greatly reducing the computational complexity.
sample permutation and gene permutation, through simulation studies and a study on a real dataset.
we proposed a new and efficient permutation strategy based on snp randomization for determining significance in pathway analysis of gwas.
our findings indicate the improved performance of snp permutation and thus render pathway-based analysis of gwas more applicable and attractive.
the developed permutation strategy was evaluated and compared to two previously available methods, i.e.
