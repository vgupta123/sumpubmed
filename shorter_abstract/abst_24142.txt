model based genome-wide predictions are provided so that optimal promoter candidates can be experimentally evaluated, and refined models developed.
this work provides a baseline model that can evolve as new chlamydia trachomatis σ <dig> promoters are identified with assistance from the provided genome-wide predictions.
although it has been shown that transcriptional mechanisms are similar among various bacteria, it is quite possible that the differences between escherichia coli and chlamydia trachomatis are large enough to recommend an organism-specific modeling effort.
here we present an iterative stochastic model building procedure that combines such biophysical metrics as dna stability, curvature, twist and stress-induced dna duplex destabilization along with duration hidden markov model parameters to model chlamydia trachomatis σ <dig> promoters from  <dig> experimentally verified sequences.
initially, iterative duration hidden markov modeling of the training set sequences provides a scoring algorithm for chlamydia trachomatis rna polymerase σ66/dna binding.
in addition, most promoter models have been trained on data from escherichia coli.
the resulting model predicts the final training set with a high degree of accuracy and provides insights into the structure of the promoter region.
promoter identification is a first step in the quest to explain gene regulation in bacteria.
