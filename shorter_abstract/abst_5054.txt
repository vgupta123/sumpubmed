the estimate of amplification efficiency is based on the slope of the regression line when the cq is plotted against the logarithm of dilution.
we consider the analysis of dilution series constructed for the estimation of qpcr amplification efficiency.
as in the established literature we judge their relative merits both from the standard deviation of the slope of the calibration curve, and from the variance in cq for replicate fluorescence curves.
the polymerase chain reaction amplifies and quantifies small amounts of dna.
we propose an alternative where position is measured relative to a reference curve; position equates to the cycle shift which maximizes the correlation between the reference and the observed fluorescence sequence.
a key parameter of the reference curve is obtained by fixed-point convergence.
