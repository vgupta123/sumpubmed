seven major and three minor alleles of oshkt1; <dig> were identified, and their comparisons with the leaf na+ concentration showed that the aromatic allele conferred the highest exclusion and the japonica allele the least.
here we present data on  <dig> accessions from o. sativa and  <dig> accessions from o. glaberrima, many of which are identified as salt tolerant for the first time, showing moderate to high tolerance of high salinity.
the correlation of salinity-induced senescence  with whole-plant and leaf blade na+ concentrations was high across nearly all accessions, and was almost identical in both o. sativa and o. glaberrima.
significant variation in salinity tolerance exists within both cultivated oryza species, and this is the first report of significant tolerance in o. glaberrima.
cultivated rice species  are generally considered among the crop species most sensitive to salt stress.
little information is available on the diversity of mechanisms used by these species to cope with salt stress, and there is a strong need to identify varieties displaying additional physiological and/or genetic mechanisms to confer higher tolerance.
the association of leaf na+ concentrations with cultivar-groups was very weak, but association with the oshkt1; <dig> allele was generally strong.
however, there appears to be genetic variation for several mechanisms that affect leaf na+ concentration, and rare cases of accessions displaying different mechanisms also occur.
the majority of accessions display a strong quantitative relationship between tolerance and leaf blade na+ concentration, and thus the major tolerance mechanisms found in these species are those contributing to limiting sodium uptake and accumulation in active leaves.
a handful of lines are known to be tolerant, and a small number of these have been used extensively as donors in breeding programs.
these mechanisms show great promise for improving salt tolerance in rice over that available from current donors.
