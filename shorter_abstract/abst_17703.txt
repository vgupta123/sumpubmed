high titers of lentiviral vectors are required for the efficient transduction of a gene of interest.
we prepared lentiviral vectors expressing inwardly rectifying potassium channel , its dominant-negative form , and other k+ channels, using the ubiquitously active β-actin and neuron-specific synapsin i promoters.
the titer of lv-kir-dn was higher than that of lv-kir <dig> , suggesting a negative effect of induced k+ currents on viral titer.
the increase in titer correlated with the k+ currents generated by the channels expressed.
in the production of lentivirus expressing k+ channels, titers are increased by blocking k+ currents in the virus-producing cells.
channel blockade also increased the titers of the lentivirus expressing kv <dig>  and trek channels, but not herg.
this expression may affect the production of the lentiviral vector.

higher extracellular k+ concentrations increased the titer of lv-kir <dig>  about 9-fold.
