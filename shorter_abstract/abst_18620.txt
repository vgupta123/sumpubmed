we identified a gene encoding dgat <dig> in c. ellipsoidea and confirmed that it plays an important role in tag accumulation.
the  <dig>  bp open reading frame of this cdna, designated cedgat <dig>  encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids showing no more than 40% identity with dgat1s of higher plants.
the over-expression of cedgat <dig> under the nos promoter in wild-type arabidopsis thaliana and brassica napus var.
the net increase in the  <dig> -seed total lipid content was up to 25–50% in both transgenic arabidopsis and b. napus.
westar significantly increased the oil content by 8–37% and 12–18% and the average  <dig> -seed weight by 9–15% and 6–29%, respectively, but did not alter the fatty acid composition of the seed oil.
oil in the form of triacylglycerols  is quantitatively the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells.
this information is important for understanding lipid synthesis and accumulation in chlorella and for genetic engineering to enhance oil production in microalgae and oil plants.

chlorella, a unicellular eukaryotic green alga, has attracted much attention as a potential feedstock for renewable energy production.
transcript analysis showed that the expression level of cedgat <dig> markedly increased under nitrogen starvation, which led to significant triacylglycerol  accumulation.
upon expression of cedgat <dig>  the total fatty acid content in wild-type yeast  increased by 142%, significantly higher than that transformed with dgat1s from higher plants, including even the oil crop soybean.
diacylglycerol acyltransferase  is considered the rate-limiting enzyme for tag accumulation.
