fall transition was more disturbing for the more morning type and spring transition for the more evening type of persons.
the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of transition out of and into daylight saving time on the rest-activity cycles and sleep.
rest-activity cycles of nine healthy participants aged  <dig> to  <dig> years were measured around transitions out of and into daylight saving time on fall  <dig> and spring  <dig> respectively.
rest-activity cycles were measured using wrist-worn accelerometers.
