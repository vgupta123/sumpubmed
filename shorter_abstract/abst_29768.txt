we use a polyclonal antibody to identify essb and show that the protein fractionates with the plasma membrane of  s. aureus .
essb is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria and belongs to the cluster of orthologous groups of protein cog <dig> with no known function.
here, we characterize essb, one of the proteins encoded by the ess cluster.
production of truncated essb variants in wild-type  s. aureus  confers a dominant negative phenotype on esxa secretion.
by generating an internal deletion in  essb , we demonstrate that essb is required for secretion of esxa.
the data presented here support the notion that essb may oligomerize and interact with other membrane components to form the wxg100-specific translocon in  s. aureus .
