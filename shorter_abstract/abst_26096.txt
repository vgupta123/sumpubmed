the ability of the method to improve models was validated by comparing the mqap-selected structures to the native structures with the model quality evaluation program tm-score.
with a given target sequence and template structure, we construct a number of different alignments and corresponding models for the sequence.
in the area of protein structure prediction, recently a lot of effort has gone into the development of model quality assessment programs .
using the svm-based model selection, a significant increase in model quality is obtained .
in template-based protein structure prediction alignment is known to be a bottleneck limiting the overall model quality.
the quality of these models is scored with an mqap and used to choose the most promising model.
an svm-based selection scheme is suggested for combining mqap partial potentials, in order to optimize for improved model selection.
