in this study, we combined these  <dig> approaches by constructing a combinatorial gene expression cassette that comprises the hsv-tk gene and multiple copies of an amirna directed against the mrna encoding the adenoviral preterminal protein .
furthermore, the combinatorial expression cassette may constitute a safeguard to potentially control unintended replication of adenoviral vectors and to prevent immune responses provoked by them.
the reduction rate mediated by the combinatorial approach was higher compared to that achieved by either of the  <dig> approaches alone, and these obvious additive effects became most pronounced when the gcv concentration was low.
hsv-tk gene expression was controlled by the adenoviral e <dig> promoter, which is activated in the presence of the adenoviral e <dig> gene products .
human adenoviruses are a frequent threat to immunocompromised patients, and disseminated disease is associated with severe morbidity and mortality.
