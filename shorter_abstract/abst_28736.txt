we investigated the responses to multimodal stimuli consisting of an odour and a colour in the antennal lobe and mushroom body of the moth manduca sexta.
the mushroom body shows enhanced responses for multimodal stimuli consisting of a general flower odour and a blue colour.
the enhancement shows an inverse effectiveness where the responses to weaker multimodal stimuli are amplified more than those to stronger stimuli.
the magnitude of multimodal enhancement in the brain is believed to depend on the stimulus intensity and timing.
no such effect was seen for a bergamot odour.
insect multimodal processing show both the principle of inverse effectiveness and the existence of an optimal temporal window.
