phylogenetic relationships inferred by two likelihood methods were congruent and strongly supported , across the majority of nodes for multiple partitioning strategies and substitution models.
nuclear rather than mitochondrial genes have been preferred to reconstruct deep-level lepidopteran phylogenies, without seriously evaluating the potential of entire mitogenomes.
entire mitogenomes or higher-quality sequences could be obtained by increasing pyrosequencing read coverage or by additional sanger sequencing.
however, these data are restricted to ten of the forty-three recognised superfamilies, while it has been challenging to recover large numbers of mitogenomes due to the time and cost required for primer design and sequencing.
two gene regions, nad <dig> and 3’ end of nad <dig>  were most variable, whereas the cox <dig> and 5’ ends of rrnl were most conserved.
polymorphic sites were not homogeneously distributed across the gene.
bayes factor results showed that the most highly partitioned dataset is the preferred strategy among different partitioning schemes.
in the present study, we simultaneously obtained a large number of nymphalid butterfly mitogenomes to evaluate the utility of mitogenomic phylogenies by comparing reconstructions to the now quite well established phylogeny of nymphalidae.
mitogenomic phylogenies have revealed well-supported relationships for many eukaryote groups.
our mitogenomic phylogenies provide robust nodal support at a range of levels, demonstrating that mitogenomes are both accurate and efficient molecular markers for inferring butterfly phylogeny.
the most striking phylogenetic findings were that the subfamily danainae not libytheinae was sister of the remaining brush-footed butterflies and that, within limenitidini, the genus athyma was clearly polyphyletic.
