they can be clearly homologized across different ganglia and different specimens as well as across the three species.
the arthropod ventral nerve cord features a comparably low number of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons, occurring in segmentally repeated arrays.
stereotypic sets of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons are also present in myriapods, whereas in the investigated chelicerates segmental neuron clusters with higher and variable cell numbers have been reported.
this led to the suggestion that individually identifiable serotonin-immunoreactive neurons are an apomorphic feature of the mandibulata.
in all three investigated pycnogonids, the ventral walking leg ganglia contain different types of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons, the somata of which occurring mostly singly or in pairs within the ganglionic cortex.
based on these homologous neurons, we reconstruct for their last common ancestor  a minimal repertoire of at least seven identified serotonin-immunoreactive neurons per hemiganglion.
our results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of individually identifiable serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the pycnogonid ventral nerve cord.
this group of marine arthropods is nowadays most plausibly resolved as sister group to all other extant chelicerates, rendering its investigation crucial for a reliable reconstruction of arthropod nervous system evolution.
this notion awaits further substantiation from future studies.
by contrast, overall similarities between the pycnogonid and myriapod patterns may be indicative of single cell homologies in these two taxa.
the pronounced disparities between the segmental pattern in pycnogonids and the one of studied euchelicerates call for denser sampling within the latter taxon.
