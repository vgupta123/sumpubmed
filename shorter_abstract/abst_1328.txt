in the context of bayesian phylogenetics, the most common approach involves estimating the marginal likelihood, which is typically done by integrating the likelihood across model parameters, weighted by the prior.

in most of our empirical data analyses, the model selected using cross-validation was able to match that selected using marginal-likelihood estimation.
recent developments in bayesian phylogenetic models have increased the range of inferences that can be drawn from molecular sequence data.
the accuracy of cross-validation appears to improve with longer sequence data, particularly when distinguishing between relaxed-clock models.
we analysed simulated data and a range of viral and bacterial data sets using a cross-validation approach to compare a variety of molecular clock and demographic models.
this method can be readily implemented even when considering complex models where selecting an appropriate prior for all parameters may be difficult.
our results show that cross-validation can be effective in distinguishing between strict- and relaxed-clock models and in identifying demographic models that allow growth in population size over time.
accordingly, model selection has become an important component of phylogenetic analysis.
methods of model selection generally consider the likelihood of the data under the model in question.
cross-validation is a useful method for bayesian phylogenetic model selection.
