this study demonstrates that it is possible to predict virs, vairs, vbirs and plpirs from evolutionary information of protein sequence.
in order to provide service to the scientific community, we have developed web-server and standalone software vitapred .
we applied various classifiers of svm, bayesnet, naivebayes, complementnaivebayes, naivebayesmultinomial, randomforest and ibk etc., as machine learning techniques, using binary and position-specific scoring matrix  features of protein sequences.
finally, we selected best performing svm modules and obtained highest mcc of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for virs, vairs, vbirs, plpirs respectively, using pssm-based evolutionary information.
the performances were also evaluated on the balanced and different independent datasets.
in this study, first we compared protein-interacting residues of vitamins with other ligands using two sample logo .
