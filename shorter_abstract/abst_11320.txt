satisfactory resolution of the rhinoceros phylogeny may not be achievable without additional analyses of substantial amounts of nuclear dna.
the phylogenetic signal from individual genes is highly diffuse, with mixed topological support from different genes.
in combination with the previously published mitochondrial genomes of the white  and indian  rhinoceroses, this data set putatively enables reconstruction of the rhinoceros phylogeny.
we expect further examples of this to appear as next-generation, large-scale sequencing of complete mitochondrial genomes becomes commonplace in evolutionary studies.
the lack of resolution is suggestive of a hard polytomy at the base of crown-group rhinocerotidae, and this is supported by an investigation of the relative branch lengths.
