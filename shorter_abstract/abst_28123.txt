the amino acid residues which might affect cado activity were identified based on the crystal structures and sequence alignment of cados, including the residues close to the di-iron center , the protein surface , and those involved in two important hydrogen bonds  and in the oligopeptide whose conformation changed in the absence of the di-iron center .
some important amino acids, which exerted some effects on cado activity, were identified.
this study presents the report on the relationship between amino acid residues and enzyme activity of cados, and the information will provide a guide for enhancement of cado activity through protein engineering.
several enzyme variants exhibited greatly reduced activity, while the k
to identify the activity related key residues of cado is urgently required.
cat values of several mutants are more than two-fold higher than the wild type.
cat value below 1 min− <dig>  which would limit its application in biofuel production.
