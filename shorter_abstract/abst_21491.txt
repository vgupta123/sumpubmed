when cells are faced with a hypertonic environment a complex response is triggered.
to better understand the d. discoideum response to hyperosmotic conditions, we performed gene expression profiling using dna microarrays.
two main responses appear to be the down-regulation of the metabolic machinery and the up-regulation of the stress response system, including statc.
at least two signalling pathways are activated in dictyostelium cells subjected to hypertonicity.
the transcriptional profile of cells treated with  <dig> mm sorbitol during a 2-hour time course revealed a time-dependent induction or repression of  <dig> genes, more than 15% of the genes on the array, which peaked  <dig> to  <dig> minutes after the hyperosmotic shock.
further analysis of statc revealed that it is a key regulator of the transcriptional response to hyperosmotic shock.
it starts with signal sensing and transduction and leads to changes in cell shape, the cytoskeleton, transport processes, metabolism and gene expression.
statc is responsible for the transcriptional changes of one of them.
the differentially regulated genes were applied to cluster analysis and functional annotation using gene go terms.
