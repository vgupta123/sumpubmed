fluorescently-labelled n-acetyllactosamine  glycoside containing dansyl group was synthesized chemo-enzymatically as high-sensitivity acceptor substrate for st6gal <dig>  the acceptor substrate specificity of the enzyme was similar to that of rat liver st6gal <dig>  the fluorescent glycoside is useful as a substrate for a highly sensitive picomole assay of st6gal <dig>  asialoglycopolypeptide was regioselectively and quantitatively sialylated by catalytic reaction at the terminal gal residue to obtain α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide using st6gal <dig>  the α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide selectively inhibited hemagglutination induced by sambucus nigra  lectin, showing about 780-fold higher affinity than the control fetuin.
the purified st6gal <dig> was characterized and its n-glycan patterns were found to be approximately paucimannosidic type by hplc mapping method.
flag-tagged recombinant st6gal <dig> was expressed efficiently and purified by precipitation with ammonium sulphate followed by affinity chromatography on an anti-flag m <dig> column, generating  <dig>  mg purified fusion protein from only  <dig> silkworm larvae, with a recovery yield of 64%.
the sialylated glycoprotein is a valuable tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of biological and physiological events, such as cell-cell recognition and viral entry during infection.
the recombinant st6gal <dig> from a silkworm expression system is useful for the sialylation of asialoglycopeptide.
the st6gal <dig> was expressed in fifth instar silkworm larval hemolymph using recombinant both cysteine protease- and chitinase-deficient bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  bacmid.
asialoglycopolypeptide and γ-polyglutamic acid did not affect sna lectin-mediated hemagglutination.
we tested the inhibitory effect of the synthesized α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide on hemagglutination by sambucus nigra  lectin.
sialic acid is a deoxy uronic acid with a skeleton of nine carbons which is mostly found on cell surface in animals.
this sialic acid on cell surface performs various biological functions by acting as a receptor for microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones; by masking receptors; and by regulating the immune system.
