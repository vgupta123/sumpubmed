the ggm is much sparser than the correlation network, shows a modular structure with respect to metabolite classes, and is stable to the choice of samples in the data set.
previous studies in this area mainly focused on pearson correlation coefficients, which however are generally incapable of distinguishing between direct and indirect metabolic interactions.
on the example of human fatty acid metabolism, we demonstrate for the first time that high partial correlation coefficients generally correspond to known metabolic reactions.
in summary, we demonstrate strong signatures of intracellular pathways in blood serum data, and provide a valuable tool for the unbiased reconstruction of metabolic reactions from large-scale metabolomics data sets.
ggms are based on partial correlation coefficients, that is pairwise pearson correlation coefficients conditioned against the correlation with all other metabolites.
our method detects many known reactions along with possibly novel pathway interactions, representing candidates for further experimental examination.
in our new approach we propose the application of a gaussian graphical model , an undirected probabilistic graphical model estimating the conditional dependence between variables.
we first demonstrate the general validity of the method and its advantages over regular correlation networks with computer-simulated reaction systems.
