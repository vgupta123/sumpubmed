these findings indicate that the igg-bound platelet-induced conversion of monocytes to regulatory cells might provide a novel strategy for controlling inflammation.
co-culturing of platelets and monocytes in the presence of anti-integrin igg and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide augmented il- <dig> production via a direct interaction between platelets and monocytes.
monocytes and macrophages produce interleukin - <dig>  an immunoregulatory cytokine and a potent therapeutic tool for immune disorders.
we show that platelets, when they are opsonized with igg, can convert human peripheral blood circulating monocytes to il-10-producing regulatory monocytes in vitro and also in a murine in vivo model.
augmentation of il- <dig> production with a concomitant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages in vitro is attained by doubly stimulating the cells with a toll-like receptor ligand and immunoglobulin g immune complexes, a response known as that of regulatory  macrophages.
however, it has not been explored sufficiently how such a regulatory response could be exploited for anti-inflammation.
