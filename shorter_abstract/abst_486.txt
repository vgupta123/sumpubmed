in an analysis of  <dig> patients seen at our genetics center, we observed that the linear models of the log ratios are advantageous over the mixed models of the absolute intensities.
comparative genomic hybridization microarrays for the detection of constitutional chromosomal aberrations is the application of microarray technology coming fastest into routine clinical application.
when using a two-channel microarray of genomic dna probes for array cgh, the basic setup consists in hybridizing a patient against a normal reference sample.
two major disadvantages of this setup are  the use of half of the resources to measure a  reference sample and  the possibility that deviating signals are caused by benign copy number variation in the "normal" reference instead of a patient aberration.
they lower the detection limit of mosaicisms and improve the assignment of copy number variation for genetic association studies.
the loop design and the performance of the statistical analysis contribute to the quick adoption of array cgh as a routine diagnostic tool.
instead, we apply an experimental loop design that compares three patients in three hybridizations.
