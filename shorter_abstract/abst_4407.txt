cyp enzymes catalyze oxidative transformation leading to activation or inactivation of many endogenous and exogenous chemicals, with consequences for normal physiology and disease processes.
the results provide a foundation for the use of zebrafish as a model in toxicological, pharmacological and chemical disease research.
there are  <dig> genes in cyp families  <dig> to  <dig>  most of which are direct orthologs of human cyps that are involved in endogenous functions including synthesis or inactivation of regulatory molecules.
many cyps potentially have roles in developmental specification, and many chemicals that cause developmental abnormalities are substrates for cyps.
here we identify and annotate the full suite of cyp genes in zebrafish, compare these to the human cyp gene complement, and determine the expression of cyp genes during normal development.
the high degree of sequence similarity suggests conservation of enzyme activities for these cyps, confirmed in reports for some steroidogenic enzymes , and the cyp <dig> retinoic acid hydroxylases.
there are orthologous relationships for some cyp <dig> s and some cyp <dig> s between zebrafish and human.
transcript profiling by microarray and quantitative pcr revealed that the majority of zebrafish cyp genes are expressed in embryos, with waves of expression of different sets of genes over the course of development.
zebrafish have a total of  <dig> cyp genes, distributed among  <dig> gene families found also in mammals.
complexity is much greater in gene families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which include cyps prominent in metabolism of drugs and pollutants, as well as of endogenous substrates.
