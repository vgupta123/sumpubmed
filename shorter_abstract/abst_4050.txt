we report that starvation of drosophila larvae lacking the bcl- <dig> gene, buffy, decreases survival rate by more than twofold relative to wild-type larvae.
we demonstrate that unusually high basal tor signaling, indicated by more phosphorylated s6k, was detected in the buffy mutant and that removal of a genomic copy of s6k, but not inactivation of tor by rapamycin, reverted the precocious autophagy phenotype.
instead, tor inactivation also required loss of a positive nutrient signal to trigger autophagy and loss of both was sufficient to activate autophagy in the buffy mutant even in the presence of enforced phosphoinositide 3-kinase  signaling.
the buffy null mutant reacted to starvation with the expected responses such as inhibition of target of rapamycin  signaling, autophagy initiation and mobilization of stored lipids.
these observations, together with the inability of buffy mutant larvae to adapt to nutrient restriction, indicate altered energy metabolism in the absence of buffy.
this study demonstrates that buffy is required for adaptation to both starvation and nutrient restriction.
b cell lymphoma  <dig>  proteins are the central regulators of apoptosis.
prior to starvation, the fed buffy mutant stored less lipid and glycogen, had high lactate levels and maintained a reduced pool of cellular atp.
however, the autophagic response to starvation initiated faster in larvae lacking buffy and was inhibited by ectopic buffy.
all animals in their natural habitats are faced with periods of reduced nutrient availability.
the two bcl- <dig> genes in drosophila modulate the response to stress-induced cell death, but not developmental cell death.
