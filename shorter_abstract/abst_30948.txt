this study used in silico approaches for structural binding analyses of dehp and its five indicated major metabolites with pr.
dehp is metabolized to a primary metabolite mono-phthalate  in the body, which is further metabolized to four major secondary metabolites, monophthalate , monophthalate , monophthalate  and monophthalate .
protein data bank was searched to retrieve the crystal structure of human pr .
dehp is used as a plasticizer in medical devices and many commercial and household items.
the high binding affinity of dehp and its five major metabolites with pr as well as a high rate of overlap between pr interacting residues among dehp and its metabolites and the native ligand, net, suggested their disrupting potential in normal pr signaling, resulting in adverse reproductive effects.
progesterone receptor  signaling is involved in important reproductive functions and is a potential target for endocrine disrupting activities of dehp and its metabolites.

di-phthalate  is a common endocrine disrupting compound  present in the environment as a result of industrial activity and leaching from polyvinyl products.
dehp and its metabolites are associated with developmental abnormalities and reproductive dysfunction within the human population.
