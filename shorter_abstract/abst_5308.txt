in primates, infection is an important force driving gene evolution, and this is reflected in the importance of infectious disease in human morbidity today.
we show that five beta-defensin genes that do not show copy number variation in humans show evidence of positive selection in catarrhine primates, and identify specific codons that have been under selective pressure.
some, but not all, beta-defensin genes show positive selection in catarrhine primates.
there is suggestive evidence of different selective pressures on these genes in humans, but the nature of the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ between populations.
for defb <dig>  we show that extensive diversity, including a four-state amino acid polymorphism , is present in hunter-gatherer populations, both african and non-african, but not found in samples from agricultural populations.
here we examine evolution of beta-defensins in catarrhine primates and variation within different human populations.
the beta-defensins are key components of the innate immune system, with antimicrobial and cell signalling roles, but also reproductive functions.
