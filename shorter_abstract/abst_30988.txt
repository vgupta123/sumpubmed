high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus is one of the most important features in anhui provincial hospital, and high-level rifampicin resistance in s. aureus is associated with multiple mutations of rpob gene.
the aims of this study were to analyze 1) the level of rifampicin resistance in s. aureus and its correlation with mutations in the rpob gene, and 2) the molecular characterization of rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates.
all mutations were found to be present in cluster i of the rpob gene.
rifampicin resistance in s. aureus was closely associated with mutations in the rpob gene.
out of  <dig> high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates, three molecular types were found, namely, st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> , st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> , and st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> .
the low-level resistant isolates were found to have only one mutation, while the high-level resistant isolates had at least two or more mutations.
the most common multiple mutations were 481his/asn+466leu/ser.
the other multiple mutations found were 481his/asn+477ala/asp , and 481his/asn+466leu/ser+477ala/asp .
four amino acid substitutions were found in the  <dig> isolates, which were 481his/asn , 466leu/ser , 477ala/asp  and 486ser/leu  respectively.
in recent years, the percentage of rifampicin-resistant s. aureus has increased rapidly in china.
<dig> rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates were collected for this study.
the prevalence of high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus in anhui may be associated with the spread of the st239-mrsa iii-spa t <dig> clone.
of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were high-level rifampicin resistant  while the remaining  <dig> isolates  had a low-level resistance to rifampicin .
