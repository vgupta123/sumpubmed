to explore these responses and make comparisons, we generated a prion disease in the laboratory rat by successive passage beginning with mouse rml prions.
we describe the accumulation of rat prions, associated pathology and the transcriptional impact throughout the disease course.
at the level of individual transcripts, however, variability exists between mice and rats and many genes deregulated by prion infection in mice are not affected in rats.
comparative transcriptional profiling between laboratory mice and rats suggests that similar molecular and cellular processes are unfolding in response to prion infection.
our findings detail the molecular responses to prion disease in the rat and highlight the usefulness of comparative approaches to understanding neurodegeneration and prion diseases in particular.
while the molecular responses to prion infection have been extensively characterized in the laboratory mouse, little is known in other rodents.
