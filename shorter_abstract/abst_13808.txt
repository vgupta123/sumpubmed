when labelhash is running in parallel, motifs can typically be matched against the entire pdb on the order of minutes.
the labelhash algorithm is available through a web server and as a suite of standalone programs at http://labelhash.kavrakilab.org.
the output of the labelhash algorithm can be further analyzed with chimera through a plugin that we developed for this purpose.
the algorithm is able to identify functional homologs beyond the twilight zone of sequence identity and even beyond fold similarity.
we present labelhash, a novel algorithm for matching substructural motifs to large collections of protein structures.
the general applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated with three different case studies.
the three case studies presented in this paper illustrate the versatility of the algorithm.
labelhash runs very efficiently in parallel; matching a motif against all proteins in the 95% sequence identity filtered non-redundant protein data bank typically takes no more than a few minutes.
in the first phase the proteins are preprocessed in a fashion that allows for instant lookup of partial matches to any motif.
in the second phase, partial matches for a given motif are expanded to complete matches.
first, we show that we can accurately identify members of the enolase superfamily with a single motif.
