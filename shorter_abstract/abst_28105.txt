our results not only demonstrated the immunogenicity of gfp in immunocompetent mice, but determined the optimized conditions for gfp-based in vivo stem cells tracking, that can potentially be extrapolated to human biomedical research.
green fluorescent protein  is a useful biomarker, widely used in biomedical research to track stem cells after transplantation and/or to assess therapeutic transgene expression.
dystrophin immunostaining showed that the engraftment of wild type myoblasts was much more effective than that of the gfp-labeled counterparts in the mdx mice, further confirming an antigen role of gfp in this process.
the results suggested an apparent underlying host immunorejection in the mdx mice.
the main aim of this study was to use animal models to evaluate potential impact of gfp on the cell engraftment and to optimize tracking strategies prior to transplantation.
by using a fluorescent imaging  system, we investigated the dynamic cell behavior of gfp-transduced myoblasts in tibialis anterior  muscles of immunocompetent mdx mice and immuno-compromised nude mice over a period of threeÂ months.
we also compared the in vivo cell behavior differences between myoblasts from virally gfp-transduced and gfp transgenic mice.
