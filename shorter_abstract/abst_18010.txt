the rosaceae encompass a large number of economically-important diploid and polyploid fruit and ornamental species in many different genera.
our results indicate a clear pattern of synteny, with most markers of each chromosome of one of these species mapping to one or two chromosomes of the other.
the diploid genomes of prunus  and fragaria  were compared through the mapping of  <dig> anchor markers –  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphisms ,  <dig> indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms  derived from expressed sequence tags  and two simple-sequence repeats  – on the reference maps of both genera.
the basic chromosome numbers of these genera are x =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and all have compact and relatively similar genome sizes.
a large number of rearrangements , most of which produced by inversions  and the rest  by translocations or fission/fusion events could also be inferred.
these markers provided good coverage of the prunus  and fragaria  genomes, with maximum gaps and average densities of  <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm/marker in prunus and  <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm/marker in fragaria.
