surprisingly, the impact of this error on binding affinity prediction is yet to be systematically analysed across diverse protein-ligand complexes.
against commonly-held views, we have found that pose generation error has generally a small impact on the accuracy of binding affinity prediction.
binding affinity prediction is often carried out on the docked pose of a known binder rather than its co-crystallised pose.
our results suggest than pose generation error is in general far less damaging for binding affinity prediction than it is currently believed.
pose generation error is usually quantified as the difference between the geometry of the pose generated by the docking software and that of the same molecule co-crystallised with the considered protein.
this is also true for large pose generation errors and it is not only observed with machine-learning scoring functions, but also with classical scoring functions such as autodock vina.
as a result, test set performance after this error-correcting procedure is much closer to that of predicting the binding affinity in the absence of pose generation error .

we evaluated several strategies, obtaining better results for those using a single docked pose per ligand than those using multiple docked poses per ligand.
furthermore, we propose a procedure to correct a substantial part of this error which consists of calibrating the scoring functions with re-docked, rather than co-crystallised, poses.
