we designed feed-forward  and bi-fan  motif predictors for e. coli using multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks .
the motif predictors were trained using a large dataset of gene expression data; the collection of motifs was extracted from the e. coli trn.
as a result, the motif predictors assigned new transcription factors for these mdr proteins, turning them into high-quality candidates to be experimentally tested.
the motif predictors presented herein can be used to identify novel regulatory interactions by using microarray data.
thus, by combining network structural information with transcriptome data, ff and bf predictors were able to classify with a high precision of 83% and 96%, respectively, and with a high recall of 86% and 97%, respectively.
these results were found when motifs were represented using different types of correlations together, i.e., pearson, spearman, kendall, and partial correlation.
furthermore, it shows that correlations of expression data can be used to discriminate between elements that are arranged in structural motifs and those in random sets of transcripts.
in escherichia coli, which is the organism with the largest wet-lab validated trn, its set of interactions involves only ~50% of the repertoire of transcription factors currently known, and ~25% of its genes.
of those, only a small proportion describes the regulation of processes that are clinically relevant, such as drug resistance mechanisms.
