the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare transcriptional alterations induced by various steroid receptor agonists in primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons from mouse brain.
to stimulate gene expression we treated neuronal and astroglial cultures with dexamethasone , aldosterone , progesterone , 5α-dihydrotestosterone  and β-estradiol  for 4 h. neurons were found to exhibit higher levels of expression of mineralocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor  <dig> than astrocytes.
this is an in vitro study.
we utilized whole-genome microarrays  and quantitative pcr analyses to measure mrna abundance levels.
the obtained results indicate that glial cells might be the primary targets of transcriptional action of steroids in the central nervous system.
however, higher mrna level of glucocorticoid receptor mrna was observed in astrocytes.
substantial changes in gene expression driven by the glucocorticoid receptor imply an important role for the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis in the hormone-dependent regulation of brain physiology.
functional classification of the regulated genes indicated their putative involvement in multiple aspects of cell metabolism  and the inflammatory response .
these receptors can act as transcription factors and regulate gene expression.
progesterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol did not change gene expression in astrocytes.
we found no significant changes in gene expression in neurons.
hence, the model may not accurately reflect all the effects of steroids on gene expression in neurons in vivo.
