to understand the molecular basis of placental development during late gestation in chinese indigenous and western breeds with different placental efficiency, female placental samples were collected from six pregnant erhualian gilts at gestation day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  and from six pregnant large white gilts at gestation day  <dig>  and day  <dig> .
these findings help to elucidate the genetic control of placental efficiency and improve the understanding of placental development.
twelve pooled samples were hybridized to the porcine affymetrix genechip.
significant differential expression of five genes in the vegf pathway was also detected between the breeds.
together with its rapid growth during late gestation, the large white pig breed shows a significant increase in placental size and weight, but this does not occur in the highly prolific chinese pig breeds.
real-time rt-pcr confirmed the differential expression of eight selected genes.
a search of chromosomal location revealed that  <dig> differentially expressed genes located to qtl regions related to reproduction.
three of the six genes  showed monoallelic expression in the porcine placenta.
placental efficiency is strongly associated with litter size, fetal weight and prenatal mortality.
differential expression of six candidate imprinted genes was also confirmed.
our study detected many genes that showed differential expression between placentas of two divergent breed of pigs, and confirmed the imprinting of three genes.
