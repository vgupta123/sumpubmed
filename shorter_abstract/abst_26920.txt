burst  analysis of the mlrt data suggested aquatic serotype o: <dig> - <dig>  isolates to be the ancestral strains from which, clinical o: <dig> - <dig>  strains might have originated by host adaptation and genetic change.
the mean genetic diversity  of the strains by mlee and mlrt was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
mlee revealed greater genetic diversity among strains of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a and clustered strains in four groups, while mlrt grouped the strains into two groups.
mlee  was more discriminatory and clustered y. enterocolitica biovar 1a strains into four groups, while mlrt  identified two distinct groups.
burst analysis of mlrt data nevertheless provided newer insights into the probable evolution of clinical strains from aquatic strains.
genetic relationships among  <dig> strains of y. enterocolitica biovar 1a isolated from clinical and non-clinical sources were discerned by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  and multilocus restriction typing  using six loci each.
