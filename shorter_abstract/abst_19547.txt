the observed range of signaling outputs to tgf-β ligand in different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.
with the help of a parameter screen we identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to time-varying ligand concentrations .
we find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the response type.
the family of tgf-β ligands is large and its members are involved in many different signaling processes.
these signaling processes strongly differ in type with tgf-β ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses.
the architecture of the tgf-β pathway enables the observed signaling plasticity.
a number of different models have been proposed to reconcile these different behaviours.
