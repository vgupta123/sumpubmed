the suggested dose regimen was  <dig> mg/kg/ <dig> h bw.
a more desirable dose regimen against h. parasuis was provided for ceq using in china district.
the very first ceq pk/pd cutoff provide fundamental data for ceq breakpoint determination.
a total of  <dig> h. parasuis strains were isolated from diseased pigs in china.
an in vitro dynamic pk/pd infection model was used to investigate the antimicrobial effect of ceq against h. parasuis strain of serotype  <dig>  the target values of ceq for 3-log10-unit and 4-log10-unit decreases effects were the percent time that ceq concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration  of  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations  of ceq against these isolates were determined.
according to monte carlo simulation, the pk/pd cutoff for ceq against h. parasuis was  <dig>  mg/l.

the value of pk/pd surrogate marker t% > mic is of great utility in ceq clinical usage.
however, few studies have investigated the pk/pd characteristics and pk/pd cutoff of this drug against h. parasuis.
