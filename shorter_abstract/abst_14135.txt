prader-willi syndrome  is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, childhood obesity, dysmorphic features, hypogonadism, mental retardation, and behavioral problems.
analysis of the 15q11-q <dig> region by pfge also revealed a polymorphic region between bp <dig> and bp <dig>  whdc1l <dig> is a novel gene with similarity to mouse whdc <dig>  and human jmy protein .
in terms of copy number variation and gene organization, this is one of the most polymorphic regions of the human genome, and perhaps the single most polymorphic region of this type.
taking advantage of the human genome sequence, we have performed extensive sequence analysis and molecular studies for the pws candidate region.
golga8e belongs to the golgin subfamily of coiled-coil proteins associated with the golgi apparatus.
expression analysis of cultured human cells and brain tissues from pws patients indicates that cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> are biallelically expressed.
we have characterized transcripts for the first time for two ucsc genome browser predicted protein-coding genes, golga8e  and whdc1l <dig>  and have further characterized two previously reported genes, cyf1p <dig> and nipa2; all four genes are in the region close to the proximal/centromeric deletion breakpoint .
although pws is most often caused by a paternal interstitial deletion of a 6-mb region of chromosome 15q11-q <dig>  the identity of the exact protein coding or noncoding rnas whose deficiency produces the pws phenotype is uncertain.
six out of  <dig> golgin subfamily proteins in the human genome have been mapped in the chromosome 15q11-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions.
there are also reports describing a pws-like phenotype in a subset of patients with full mutations in the fmr <dig>  gene.
we have presented an updated version of a sequence-based physical map for a complex chromosomal region, and we raise the possibility of polymorphism in the genomic orientation of the bp <dig> to bp <dig> region.
the identification of two new proteins golga8e and whdc1l <dig> encoded by genes in the 15q11-q <dig> region may extend our understanding of the molecular basis of pws.
