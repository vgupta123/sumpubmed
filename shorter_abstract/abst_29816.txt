the genetic control of floral organ specification is currently being investigated by various approaches, both experimentally and through modeling.
a simulation study is carried out to predict the effects of a new type of mutation that has so far not been made in arabidopsis, but that could be used as a severe test of the validity of the model.
we propose an ordinary differential equation  model that describes the gene expression dynamics of a gene regulatory network that controls floral organ formation in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana.
the unknown parameters are estimated from  experimental expression data.
moreover, the functional loss of any dimer leads to one or more phenotypic alterations.
the model is validated by simulation studies of known mutant plants.
