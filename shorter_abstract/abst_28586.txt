this two-step procedure may introduce bias and inaccuracy and lead us to miss biologically important genes.
regularization methods with l <dig> and lp penalty have been extensively studied in survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data.
the accelerated failure time  model is a linear regression model and a useful alternative to the cox model for survival analysis.
in current microarray analysis, what people really do is select a couple of thousands  of genes using univariate analysis or statistical tests, and then apply the lasso-type penalty to further reduce the number of disease associated genes.
most genomic data have ultra-high dimensions with more than  <dig>  genes .
our proposed methods can simultaneously identify survival associated prognostic factors and predict survival outcomes with ultra-high dimensional genomic data.
we have demonstrated the performance of our methods with both simulation and real data.
our proposed variable selection method is based on the kernel matrix and dual problem with a much smaller n × n matrix.
in this paper, we propose a nonlinear kernel based aft model and an efficient variable selection method with adaptive kernel ridge regression.
however, when the sample size n ≪ m , directly identifying a small subset of genes from ultra-high  dimensional data is time-consuming and not computationally efficient.
