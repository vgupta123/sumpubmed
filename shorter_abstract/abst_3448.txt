a simulation study was used to examine the effect of alignment accuracy of dna sequences on evolutionary distance estimation.
this general result was independent of substitution model, sequence length, and insertion and deletion size and rate.
evolutionary distances are a critical measure in comparative genomics and molecular evolutionary biology.
beyond this threshold, the alignment procedure artificially inflates the apparent sequence identity, skewing distance estimates, and creating alignments that are essentially indistinguishable from random data.
under the studied conditions, distance estimation was relatively unaffected by alignment error  as long as 50% or more of the sites were identical among the sequences .
inaccurate alignments are expected to have large effects on analyses dependent on site specificity, but analyses that depend on evolutionary distance may be somewhat robust to alignment error as long as fewer than half of the sites have diverged.
examination of the estimated sequence identity may yield some guidance as to the accuracy of the alignment.
