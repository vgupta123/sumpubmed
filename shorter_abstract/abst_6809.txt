mycobacterium avium includes the subspecies avium, silvaticum, paratuberculosis and hominissuis, and m. avium subspecies has been isolated from various environments all over the world including from biofilms in water distribution systems.
the aim of this study was to examine isolates of m. avium subsp.
in order to determine the best screening method, a panel of  <dig> isolates of m. avium subsp.
colony morphology and hsp <dig> sequvar were also determined.
the ability to form biofilm did not correlate with the rflp-type, hsp <dig> sequevar, colony morphology or the presence of gene sequences related to gpl synthesis.
hominissuis of different origin for biofilm formation and to look for correlations between biofilm formation and rflp-types, and to standardise the method to test for biofilm formation.
subsequently,  <dig> additional isolates from humans, swine and birds were tested for biofilm formation.
the isolates were tested for the presence of selected genes involved in the synthesis of glycopeptidolipids  in the cell wall of m. avium, which is believed to be important for biofilm formation.
the observed differences in biofilm forming abilities between porcine and human isolates raises questions regarding the importance of biofilm formation for infectious potential.
there was a significant higher frequency of porcine isolates forming biofilm compared to human isolates.
