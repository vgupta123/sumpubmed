this requires users to have significant expertise in these software and command line scripting experience on unix platforms, besides possessing the basic expertise on methodologies and techniques for genome assembly.
these difficulties often delay the complete genome assembly projects.
besides to be a web tool for genome assembly, simba is a complete genome assemblies project management system, which can be useful for managing of several projects in laboratories.

simba workflow was divided in three modules:  projects: allows a general vision of genome sequencing projects, in addition to data quality analysis and data format conversions;  assemblies: allows de novo assemblies with the software mira, minia, newbler and spades, also assembly quality validations using quast software; and  curation: presents methods to finishing assemblies through tools for scaffolding contigs and close gaps.
in order to overcome this, we developed simba , a freely available web tool that integrates several component tools for assembling and finishing bacterial genomes.
simba guides the users to execute assembly process through simple and interactive pages.
we also presented a case study that validated the efficacy of simba to manage bacterial assemblies projects sequenced using ion torrent pgm.
