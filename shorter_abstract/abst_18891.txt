the purified molecule is toxic for the adults of the rice weevils at concentrations down to 100 μg per g of food, but this does not apply to the others insects tested, including the coleopteran tribolium castaneum and the sf <dig> insect cultured cells.
neither the worm caenorhabditis elegans nor the bacteria e. coli were found to be sensitive to this saponin, but growth of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was inhibited at concentrations higher than 100 μg per ml.
because of the increasingly concern of consumers and public policy about problems for environment and for public health due to chemical pesticides, the search for molecules more safe is currently of great importance.
it was observed that medicago truncatula seed flour displayed a strong toxic activity towards the adults of the rice weevil sitophilus oryzae , a major pest of stored cereals.
particularly, plants are able to fight the pathogens as insects, bacteria or fungi; so that plants could represent a valuable source of new molecules.
