however, its productivity is challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal diseases, insects, drought, salinity, and cold.
we assembled information from the various databases for individual tfs, including annotations and details of their developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns.
there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs specifically expressed at the dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, and vegetative stages, respectively.
we identified  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs, based on information about their developmental- and tissue-specific expression patterns obtained from publicly available gene expression databases.
based on this information, we identified  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig> wheat tfs, respectively.
we constructed a comprehensive database of wheat tfs, designated as wheattfdb .
the  <dig> wheat tfs and their annotations are summarized in our database, wheattfdb.
these data will be useful identifying target tfs involved in the stress response at a particular stage of development.
transcription factors  regulate gene expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages in plants and animals, and they can be identified and classified into families according to their structural and specialized dna-binding domains .
in total,  <dig> putative tfs were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags, and then classified into  <dig> families by using hmm searches against hidden markov model  profiles.
transcription factors are important regulatory components of the genome, and are the main targets for engineering stress tolerance.
in this study,  <dig> tfs represented approximately  <dig> % of all genes in the wheat genome, a smaller proportion than those reported for other cereals in planttfdb v <dig>   and plntfdb .
approximately  <dig> %  of all genes in the wheat genome were identified as tfs, and were clustered into  <dig> tf families.
