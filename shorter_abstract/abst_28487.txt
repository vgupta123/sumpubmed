this information will enhance molecular breeding in c. pepo and will assist the gene cloning underlying the studied qtls, helping to reveal the genetic basis of the studied processes in squash.
in total,  <dig> consistent qtls for vine, flowering and fruit quality traits were detected on the basis of a multiple-environment analysis, distributed in  <dig> independent positions in  <dig> lgs, and each qtl explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
a qtl analysis was performed using phenotypic data obtained from the ril population from three environments.
recently, transcriptome and simple sequence repeat - and single nucleotide polymorphism -based medium density maps have been reported, however further genomic tools are needed for efficient molecular breeding in the species.
here we report the first snp saturated map in the species, anchored to the physical map.
several thousands of snp markers were identified and genotyped, followed by the construction of a high-density linkage map based on  <dig>  snps  covering  <dig> .6 cm of the whole genome, which is a great improvement with respect to previous maps.
eight major qtls, which could explain greater than 20% of the phenotypic variation were detected and the underlying candidate genes identified.
we report the genotyping-by-sequencing analysis of a ril population developed from the inter subspecific cross zucchini x scallop .
additionally, several consistent qtls related to early flowering, fruit shape and length, and rind and flesh color are reported as well as candidate genes for them.
