the results identify tss for  <dig>  antisense transcripts, most with sequences complementary to either the 5'- or 3'-region of a sense mrna, and confirm the presence of transcripts from all three crispr loci, the rnase p and 7s rnas, all trnas and rrnas and  <dig> predicted snornas.
the procedure used is designed to identify tss but, assuming that the number of cdna reads correlates with transcript abundance, the results also provide a semi-quantitative documentation of the differences in t. kodakarensis genome expression under different growth conditions and confirm previous observations of substrate-dependent specific gene expression.
the results identify > <dig>  tss, including almost all of the primary sites of transcription initiation upstream of annotated genes, plus many secondary sites, sites within genes and sites resulting in antisense transcripts.
sequencing cdna libraries, generated from rna isolated from cells under different growth and metabolic conditions has identified > <dig>  sites of transcription initiation, established a genome-wide map of transcripts, and consensus sequences for transcription initiation and post-transcription regulatory elements.
many previously unanticipated small rnas have been identified, some with relative low gc contents  and sequences that do not fold readily into base-paired secondary structures, contrary to the classical expectations for non-coding rnas in a hyperthermophile.
two putative riboswitch rnas were present in growing but not in stationary phase cells.
rna sequencing has, however, revealed surprisingly complex transcriptomes and here we report the transcripts present in the model hyperthermophilic archaeon, thermococcusÂ kodakarensis, under different physiological conditions.
