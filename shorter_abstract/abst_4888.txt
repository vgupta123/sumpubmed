the development of software tools that analyze microarray data in the context of genetic knowledgebases is being pursued by multiple research groups using different methods.
we present the results from a preliminary study of the distribution one would expect for analyzing sets of genes extracted from drosophila, s. cerevisiae, wormbase, and gramene databases using the gene ontology database.
permutation-based simulations may be necessary to determine the confidence in results of such analyses.
a common problem for many of these tools is how to correct for multiple statistical testing since simple corrections are overly conservative and more sophisticated corrections are currently impractical.
