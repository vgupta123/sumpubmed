in addition to idiopathic disease, ad is also associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, which causes a familial form of ad .
alzheimer's disease  is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects a large and growing number of elderly individuals.
immunohistochemistry in brain showed that the human app transgene was expressed in neurons, but not in glial cells.
northern blots showed that the human app transgene, driven by the ubiquitin-c promoter, is expressed significantly more in brain, kidney and lung compared to heart and liver.
app <dig> and app <dig> rats expressed  <dig> - and 3-times more app mrna, respectively, than did wild-type rats.
the unexpected similarity in the tissue-specific expression patterns of endogenous rat app and transgenic human app mrnas suggests regulatory elements within the cdna sequence of app.
fischer  <dig> rats expressing human app driven by the ubiquitin-c promoter were generated via lentiviral vector infection of fischer  <dig> zygotes.
the app <dig> rat line expresses high levels of human app and could be a useful model for ad.
tissue-specific expression in the two transgenic rat lines and in wild-type rats contradicts our current understanding of app gene regulation.
determination of the elements that are responsible for tissue-specific expression of app may enable new treatment options for ad.
