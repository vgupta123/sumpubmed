virb6- <dig> has an unusual highly repetitive structure and can have a molecular weight greater than  <dig> .
this is particularly evident in the virb <dig> and virb <dig> which are postulated to encode the secretion channel and proteins exposed on the bacterial surface.
our study reveals evidence of gene duplication and considerable diversity of t4ss components in strains infecting different animals.
anaplasma phagocytophilum is an intracellular organism in the order rickettsiales that infects diverse animal species and is causing an emerging disease in humans, dogs and horses.
an intriguing question is how the strains of a. phagocytophilum differ and what different genome loci are involved in cell tropisms and/or virulence.
for many of the virs, phylogenetic trees position a. phagocytophilum strains infecting ruminants in the u.s. and europe distant from strains infecting humans and dogs in the u.s.
the diversity in virb <dig> is in the sequence of each of the  <dig> copies in the single locus and the presence of varying numbers of repetitive units in virb6- <dig> and virb6- <dig>  these data suggest that the t4ss should be investigated further for a potential role in strain virulence of a. phagocytophilum.
different strains have very different cell tropisms and virulence.
we determined the structure of the t4ss in  <dig> strains from the u.s. and europe and revised the sequence of the repetitive virb <dig> locus of the human hz strain.
the diversity in virb <dig> is in both the total number of copies, which varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in the herein characterized strains, and in the sequence of each copy.
