to provide an investigation of the roles of edges in ppi networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in ppi networks.
we proved that the weak tie effect exists in the ppi network and demonstrated that the density is insufficient to characterize the topological structure of protein complexes.
furthermore, the experimental results on the yeast ppi network show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
the analysis of detected modules by the present algorithm suggests that most of these modules have well biological significance in context of complexes, suggesting that the roles of edges are critical in discovering protein complexes.
studying protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the structure-functionality relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction  data.
thus, there is a critical need to investigate the possibility of discovering protein complexes using the topological information hidden in edges.
by this notion, the detection of the protein complexes is transformed into a classic all-clique problem.
we further demonstrate that there is a negative relation between the weak tie strength and the topological similarity.
by using the bridges, a reliable virtual network is constructed, in which each maximal clique corresponds to the core of a complex.
