the pb14-3- <dig> of paracoccidioides brasiliensis seems to play an important role in the paracoccidioides-host interaction.
14-3- <dig> proteins comprise a family of eukaryotic multifunctional proteins involved in several cellular processes.
the influence of pb14-3- <dig> in s. cerevisiae ergosterol pathway was also evaluated and our results showed that pb14-3- <dig> up-regulates genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis.
ergosterol biosynthesis which makes it an interest as a therapeutic target.
our data showed that pb14-3- <dig> was able to partially complement bmh1p and bmh2p proteins in s. cerevisiae; however, we suggest that pb14-3- <dig> has a differential role as an adhesin.
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is an etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, which is a systemic mycosis that is endemic in latin america.

when we evaluated the adhesion profile of s. cerevisiae transformants, pb14-3- <dig> acted as an adhesin in s. cerevisiae; however, bmh1p did not show this function.
the functional analysis of pb14-3- <dig> was performed in s. cerevisiae, and it was found that pb14-3- <dig> partially complemented s. cerevisiae proteins bmh1p and bmh2p, which are recognized as two yeast 14-3- <dig> homologues.
therefore, the aim of this work was to perform a functional analysis of pb14-3- <dig> using saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model.
in the initial steps of the infection, paracoccidioides spp.
in addition, pb-14-3- <dig> may be involved in paracoccidioides spp.
