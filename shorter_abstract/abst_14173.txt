it requires as input a tab-delimited format file containing primer sequence information, a fasta format file containing the reference genome sequence, and paired fastq files containing sequence reads.
rover is applied to mps data in bam format and, therefore, relies on sequence reads being mapped to a reference genome.
in this paper, we describe an improvement to rover, called undr rover , which accepts mps data in fastq format, avoiding the need for a computationally expensive mapping stage.
the undr rover algorithm achieves the same stringent variant calling as its predecessor with a significant runtime performance improvement.
in one indicative sequencing experiment, undr rover  required 8-fold less sequential computation time than the rover pipeline and 13-fold less sequential computation time than a variant calling pipeline based on the popular gatk tool.
undr rover is implemented in python and runs on all popular posix-like operating systems .
undr rover provides the same rapid and accurate genetic variant calling as its predecessor with greatly reduced computational costs.
the primer-intervening sequence of each read is compared against the reference sequence from the same location and variants are identified using the same algorithm as rover.
primer sequences at the 5â€² end of reads associate read-pairs with their targeted amplicon and, thus, their expected corresponding coordinates in the reference genome.
