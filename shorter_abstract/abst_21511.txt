the dna polymerase iii β subunit  acts as a sliding clamp on dna, promoting the binding and processivity of many dna-acting proteins, and here we report the crystal structure of d. radiodurans β-clamp  at  <dig>  Å resolution.
the structure, which was obtained from blue crystals, shows a typical ring-shaped bacterial β-clamp formed of two monomers, each with three domains of identical topology, but with no visible dna in electron density.
a visualisation of the electrostatic surface potential reveals a highly negatively charged outer surface while the inner surface and the dimer forming interface have a more even charge distribution.
we hypothesise that this charge distribution may facilitate efficient movement on encircled dna and help ensure efficient dna metabolism in d. radiodurans upon exposure to high doses of ionizing irradiation or desiccation.
