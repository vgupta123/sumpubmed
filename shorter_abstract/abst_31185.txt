faced with the choice of foraging in a competitive environment, rats preferred foraging for the desirable object, indicating the rats’ ability for decision-making.
to date, there are no appropriate animal models for studying whether mimetic desire is at play in guiding the decision-making process.
in this study, we used an animal model  to investigate a novel food-foraging paradigm for decision-making, with or without a mimetic desire paradigm.
none of these three antagonists affected the food-foraging preference for palatable food.
these results highlight the concept that mimetic desire exerts a powerful influence on food-foraging decision-making in rats and, further, illustrate the various roles of the glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems in mediating these processes.
furthermore, the neuropharmacological bases of decision-making processes are not well understood.
mimetic desire refers to a subject’s preference for objects already possessed by another subject.

notably, treatment with the non-competitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist mk- <dig>  but not with the dopamine d <dig> or d <dig> receptor antagonists, sch <dig> and haloperidol, respectively, suppressed the food foraging preference when there was a competing resident rat in the cage.
