the functional repertoire of long noncoding rna  has been characterized in several model organisms, demonstrating that lncrna plays important roles in fundamental biological processes.
gene expression and genome location analysis indicated that lncrnas might play important roles in high fecundity and virulence adaptation in n. lugens.
n. lugens lncrnas had shorter transcripts than protein-coding genes due to the lower exon number though their exons and introns were longer.
a computational pipeline was developed to identify lncrna genes in the rice brown planthopper, nilaparvata lugens, a destructive rice pest causing huge yield losses.
the identified n. lugens lncrnas had low sequence similarities with other known lncrnas.
only  <dig> % of n. lugens lncrnas had multiple alternatively spliced isoforms.
we observed biases in the genome location of n. lugens lncrnas.
the structural features of n. lugens lncrnas are similar to mammalian counterparts.
coexpression and function analysis suggeste that n. lugens lncrnas might have important functions in high fecundity and virulence adaptability.
this study provided the first catalog of lncrna genes in rice brown planthopper.
strand specific rt-pcr were used to determine the transcription orientation of lncrnas.
in total,  <dig>  lncrna transcripts corresponding to  <dig>  loci were detected from  <dig> whole transcriptomes  datasets, including samples from high fecundity , low fecundity , i87i and c89i populations, in addition mudgo and tn <dig> virulence strains.
however, their structural features were similar with mammalian counterparts.

in total, 19- <dig> lncrnas were specifically-expressed in the samples of hfp, lfp, mudgo, tn <dig>  i87i and c89i populations.
