among these unigenes we found several gene families that have been implicated in insecticide resistance in other species.
using these tools we identified candidate gene families for insecticide resistance and reveal aspects of wcr population history in light of the species’ recent range expansion.
here we produce and analyze a transcriptome assembly for wcr.
the wcr transcriptome assembly presented here contains approximately  <dig>  unigenes, many of which have high similarity to other insect species.
improved genetic and genomic resources are crucial tools for understanding population history and the genetic basis of trait evolution.
we also perform whole genome population resequencing, and combine these resources to better understand the evolutionary history of wcr.
we used these snps to scan for outliers among the candidate genes, and to understand how population processes have shaped genetic variation in this species.
this study highlights the utility of transcriptomic and genomic resources as foundational tools for dealing with highly adaptive pest species.
in addition, this species has a history of evolving traits that allow it to escape various control options.
