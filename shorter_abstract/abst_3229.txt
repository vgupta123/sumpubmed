donkeys were sampled in four premises  where donkeys were gather for shipment to abattoirs in other mexican states.
multivariate analysis showed that seropositivity to t. gondii was associated with the gathering premises .
we sought to determine the presence of antibodies against t. gondii in  <dig> domestic donkeys  for slaughter in durango, mexico using the modified agglutination test .
antibodies to t. gondii were found in  <dig>  of  <dig> donkeys, with mat titers of 1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  and 1: <dig> in  <dig>  seropositive donkeys were found in three  of the four gathering premises studied.
the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was comparable among donkeys regardless their age, sex or health status.
seropositivity to t. gondii was found in donkeys between  <dig> to 12Â years old.
this is the first report of t. gondii infection in donkeys in mexico.
results indicate that consumption of undercooked or raw meat from t. gondii-infected donkeys is potentially a source of t. gondii infection for humans.
seroprevalence in donkeys varied from 0% to  <dig> % among gathering premises.
