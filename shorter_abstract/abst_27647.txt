phylogenetic analysis shows the absence of tlrs  <dig> and  <dig> in chicken to be the result of gene loss.
the notable exception to the tendency of gene loss in tlr evolution is found in chicken tlrs  <dig> and  <dig>  each of which underwent gene duplication about  <dig> and  <dig> mya, respectively.
comparative phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate tlr genes provides insight into their patterns and processes of gene evolution, with examples of both gene gain and gene loss.
this study takes advantage of the recently sequenced chicken genome to determine the complete chicken tlr repertoire and place it in context of vertebrate genomic evolution.
the chicken tlr repertoire consists of ten genes.
phylogenetic analyses show that six of these genes have orthologs in mammals and fish, while one is only shared by fish and three appear to be unique to birds.
toll-like receptors  perform a vital role in disease resistance through their recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns .
recent advances in genomics allow comparison of tlr genes within and between many species.
in addition, these comparisons clarify the nomenclature of tlr genes in vertebrates.
