here we report the full characterization of a recently described multidrug resistant bacterium, microbacterium yannicii, isolated from a cf patient who previously underwent lung transplantation.
full length 16s rrna gene sequence showed  <dig> % similarity with microbacterium yannicii g72t type strain, which was previously isolated from arabidopsis thaliana.
in silico dna-dna hybridization analysis between our microbacterium yannicii ps01isolate in comparison with microbacterium testaceum stlb <dig> and microbacterium laevaniformans or <dig> genomes revealed very weak relationship with only 28% and 25% genome coverage, respectively.

although significance of isolating this bacterium remains uncertain in terms of clinical evolution, this bacterium could be considered as an opportunistic human pathogen as previously reported for other species in this genus, especially in immunocompromised patients.
our strain, as compared to the type strain, was resistant to erythromycin because of the presence of a new erm  <dig> gene encoding a 23s rrna n-6-methyltransferase in its genome which was not detected in the reference strain.
