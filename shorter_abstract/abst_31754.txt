by using rnai transgene-induced gene silencing coupled to spatio/temporal assessment, we have unraveled an important role for the drosophila dopamine 1-like receptor, dop1r <dig>  in development.
we show that dop1r <dig> knockdown leads to pre-adult lethality.
previous studies in drosophila have shown that untimely activation of genes that are essential to metamorphosis results in growth defects, developmental delay and death.
in addition to rnai-induced effects, treatment of larvae with the high affinity d1-like receptor antagonist flupenthixol, also results in developmental arrest, and in morphological defects comparable to those seen in dop1r <dig> rnai flies.
the list of identified negative regulators that play such a role in drosophila development continues to expand.
to examine the basis for pupal lethality in dop1r <dig> rnai flies, we carried out transcriptome analysis.
insect metamorphosis relies on temporal and spatial cues that are precisely controlled.
premature release of this inhibition is not tolerated by the developing fly.
