we genotyped dwarf males and female shoots with the aim of describing the genetic diversity and structure of the populations.
dwarf males were most related to their host shoot, then their colony  and then the rest of the population, which suggests restricted spore dispersal.
dwarf males occur in a wide range of unrelated organisms but the evolutionary advantages of this condition are poorly understood.
however, a few dwarf males in each population appeared to originate from other colonies and sometimes even other populations.
genetic diversity of dwarf males was generally high but showed no tendency to be consistently higher or lower than female genetic diversity within the four populations.
although most dwarf males have local origin, sporadic dispersal events occur.
the ability of the dwarf males to establish in high numbers in mature colonies facilitates gene flow between populations as well as increases the potential to accumulate genetic diversity within populations.
such differences must have profound effects on the population dynamics and genetic structures.
the dwarf male sexual system results in differences in the mode of dispersal and establishment as well as the life span between males and females.
we have studied four populations of the nannandrous moss homalothecium lutescens in southern sweden.
nannandry is a sexual system where males  are much smaller than the conspecific females.
