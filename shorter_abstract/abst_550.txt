a glycosyl transferase, serine threonine kinase, and nb-arc domain containing transcripts were among those differentially expressed between the two cultivars.
two high throughput next-generation sequencing techniques were used to increase the genomic resources available for buffalograss.
original illumina reads were also mapped to the high quality assembly to estimate expression levels of buffalograss transcripts.
‘378’ and ‘prestige’ cdna libraries were subjected to high throughput sequencing on the illumina ga and roche  <dig> titanium flx sequencing platforms.
while several buffalograss cultivars have been developed through buffalograss breeding, the timeframe for new cultivar development is long and is limited by a lack of useful genetic resources.
total rna was extracted and purified from leaf samples of two buffalograss cultivars.
there were a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes between the two buffalograss cultivars.
additionally,  <dig> differentially expressed sequences were identified which may contribute to performance or morphological differences between ‘prestige’ and ‘378’ buffalograss cultivars.
in total,  <dig>  high quality transcripts were assembled, significantly expanding the limited genetic resources available for buffalograss genetic studies.
these genes have been previously implicated in defense response pathways and may in part explain some of the performance differences between ‘prestige’ and ‘378’.
the  <dig> platform  produced  <dig> , <dig> reads and the illumina platform  generated approximately  <dig> million reads.
to date, this is the first high throughput sequencing experiment conducted on buffalograss.
