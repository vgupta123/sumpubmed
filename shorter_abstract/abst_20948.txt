we show the utility of alignment-free sequence clustering for high throughput sequencing analysis despite its limitations.
many problems in computational biology require alignment-free sequence comparisons.
we study several centroid based algorithms for clustering sequences based on word counts.
study of their performance shows that using k-means algorithm with or without the data whitening is efficient from the computational point of view.
