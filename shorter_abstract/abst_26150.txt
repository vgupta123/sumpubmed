the present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of c. difficile in seasoned hamburger and examine the sources of c. difficile dispersal in hamburger processing plants.
a total of  <dig> samples including hamburger ingredients, the final product, processing equipment and food contact surfaces were collected from seven hamburger processing plants to evaluate the routes of dispersal of c. difficile.
the samples were assessed for the occurrence of c. difficile using culture and polymerase chain reaction  methods.
toxigenic c. difficile were detected from 2/ <dig>  hamburger processing plants, in   <dig> % of beef meat samples,   <dig> % of swabs taken from the environment and   <dig> % of hamburger samples after both molding and freezing.
c. difficile was not found in  <dig> non-meat ingredients including  <dig> defrosted onions,  <dig> textured soy proteins and  <dig> seasonings.
this genotype was isolated from raw meat, environmental samples and hamburger after both forming and freezing in one processing plant, suggesting raw beef meat as a possible major source of contamination.
hyper-virulent strains of ribotype were not found in this study however, occurrence of other toxicgenic strains indicate the public health significance of contamination of this product.
