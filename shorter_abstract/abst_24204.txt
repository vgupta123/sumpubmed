our results show that it is possible to obtain informative, high-quality data from exome analysis of whole genome amplified nbs with the important caveat that different data generation and analysis methods can affect variant detection accuracy, and the concordance of variant calls in whole-genome amplified and non-amplified exomes.
deidentified newborn screening bloodspot samples  represent a valuable potential resource for genomic research if impediments to whole exome sequencing of nbs deoxyribonucleic acid , including the small amount of genomic dna in nbs material, can be overcome.
in this study, we compared the recovery of variant calls from exome sequences of amplified nbs genomic dna to variant calls from exome sequencing of non-amplified nbs dna from the same individuals.
