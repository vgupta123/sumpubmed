gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus pal <dig> is an endophytic diazotrophic bacterium that lives in association with sugarcane plants.
we annotated  <dig>  coding sequences which reveal several characteristics related to the endophytic lifestyle such as nitrogen fixation, plant growth promotion, sugar metabolism, transport systems, synthesis of auxin and the occurrence of bacteriocins.
it has important biotechnological features such as nitrogen fixation, plant growth promotion, sugar metabolism pathways, secretion of organic acids, synthesis of auxin and the occurrence of bacteriocins.
gene clusters for gum-like polysaccharide biosynthesis, tad pilus, quorum sensing, for modulation of plant growth by indole acetic acid and mechanisms involved in tolerance to acidic conditions were identified and may be related to the sugarcane endophytic and plant-growth promoting traits of g. diazotrophicus.
an accessory component of at least  <dig> genes distributed in genome islands was identified, and was most likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
