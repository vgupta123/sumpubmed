sequence analysis showed that both normalisation and subtraction processes were successful and that the initial tissue complexity was maintained in the final libraries.
at least one agenae sequence is present in  <dig> contigs  and in  <dig> of the deeper-than-one-contigs .
it is thus necessary to improve our knowledge of the major physiological functions and their interactions.
domestic animal breeding and product quality improvement require the control of reproduction, nutrition, health and welfare in these animals.
this would be greatly enhanced by the availability of expressed gene sequences in the databases and by cdna arrays allowing the transcriptome analysis of any function.
the objective within the agenae french program was to initiate a high-throughput cdna sequencing program of a 38-tissue normalised library and generate a diverse microarray for transcriptome analysis in pig species.
it contributes to the expressed sequence tags pig data, and offers a valuable tool for transcriptome analysis.
in the present work, a pig multi-tissue cdna library was constructed and a 9k cdna microarray designed.
a 9k nylon cdna microarray was produced and is available through crb-gadie.
