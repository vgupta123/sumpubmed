deinococcus radiodurans accumulates high levels of manganese ions, and this is believed to be correlated with the radiation resistance ability of this microorganism.
the null mutant of mnte was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to manganese ions, and the growth of the mnte mutant was delayed in manganese-supplemented media.
furthermore, there was a substantial increase in the in vivo concentration of manganese ions.
the data also provide additional evidence for the involvement of intracellular manganese ions in the radiation resistance of d. radiodurans.
our results indicated that dr <dig> is indeed a mnte homologue and is indispensable for maintaining manganese homeostasis in d. radiodurans.
in this study, we identified the manganese efflux protein  in d. radiodurans.
however, the maintenance of manganese ion homeostasis in d. radiodurans remains to be investigated.
