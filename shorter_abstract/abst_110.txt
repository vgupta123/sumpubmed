the objective of this study was to determine whether hepatic gene expression of these proposed biomarkers is associated with growth performance in nursery pigs.
hepatic gene expression of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr can be useful biomarkers for monitoring growth performance in nursery pigs.
from these pigs, a subset of liver tissue samples  was used for gene expression analysis of the proposed biomarkers.
herd information and growth parameters were collected for  <dig> piglets from  <dig> commercial farms in southern ontario.
multivariable linear regression methods were used to determine whether genetic expression of the proposed biomarkers was associated with growth performance in the nursery.
modelling the herd information and individual piglet traits in relation to growth performance revealed that the weight at weaning and the age at weaning are significantly associated with nursery performance.
the proteins igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  ghr, crp, saa, hp, ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> have been proposed as potential biomarkers for monitoring growth in livestock.
the age and weight at which pigs are weaned is an important determinant for nursery performance.
similarly, 9-week body weight was significantly associated with hepatic expression of igfbp- <dig> and ghr expression , and tended to be associated with hepatic expression of igf- <dig> .
average daily gain  was significantly associated with hepatic igfbp- <dig> and ghr expression in the liver , and tended to be associated with hepatic igf- <dig> expression .
