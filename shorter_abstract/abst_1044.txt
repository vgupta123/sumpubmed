to date, identification of latent carriers has been challenging, since there are no serological assays capable of detecting seropositive elephants.
eehv infection is detected by pcr in samples from both clinically ill and asymptomatic elephants with an active infection, whereas latent carriers can be distinguished exclusively via serological assays.
this study shows that the developed elisa is suitable to detect antibodies specific to eehv.
monitoring three asian elephant herds from european zoos revealed that the serostatus of elephants within a herd varied from non-detectable to high titers.
results confirm that eehv prevalence among asian elephants  is high.
elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus  poses a large threat to breeding programs of captive asian elephants by causing fatal haemorrhagic disease.
it allows study of eehv seroprevalence in asian elephants.
the antibody titers showed typical herpes-like rise-and-fall patterns in time which occur in all seropositive animals in the herd more or less simultaneously.
here we describe a novel elisa that specifically detects eehv antibodies circulating in asian elephant plasma/serum.
