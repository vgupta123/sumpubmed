the entry vector for gene overexpression, pentr.cmv.on was constructed to contain cmv promoter with a multiple cloning site flanked by loxp sites allowing for subsequent cre/lox recombination.
the growing need for functional studies of genes has set the stage for the development of versatile tools for genetic manipulations.
aiming to provide tools for high throughput analysis of gene functions, we have developed a modified short hairpin rna  and gene expression system based on gateway technology.
as proof of principle we demonstrate the functionality and efficiency of this system by testing expression of several cdna and shrna sequences in a number of cell lines.
our system is a valuable addition to already existing library of gateway based vectors and can be an essential tool for many aspects of gene functional studies.
the system contains a series of entry and destination vectors that enables easy transfer of shrna or cdna into lentiviral expression systems with a variety of selection or marker genes .
our shrna entry vector pentr.hu <dig> hh <dig> containing two tandem human shrna expression promoters, h <dig> and u <dig>  was capable of co-expressing two shrna sequences simultaneously.
