for the french epidemic, the pattern of second differences in the birth cohorts confirmed the beginning of the decrease from  <dig>  just after the implementation of the meat and bone meal  ban for all ruminants .
apc models were recently used to model the french epidemic assuming that the time trend for bse was mainly due to a cohort effect in relation to the control measures that may have modified the bse exposure of cohorts over time.
we used data from the exhaustive surveillance carried out in france and italy between  <dig> and  <dig>  and comparatively described the trend of the epidemic in both countries.
the apc analysis proved to be highly suitable for the study of the trend in bse epidemics and was helpful in understanding the effects of management and control of the disease.
at the end, the shape and irregularities of the trends were discussed in light of the main control measures adopted to control the disease.
we also reanalysed the french epidemic and performed a simultaneous analysis of italian data using more appropriate birth cohort categories for comparison.
the age-period-cohort  analysis is routinely used for time trend analysis of cancer incidence or mortality rates, but in veterinary epidemiology, there are still only a few examples of this application.
we used a categorical apc analysis which did not require any functional form for the effect of the variables, and examined second differences to estimate the variation of the bse trend.
additionally, such an approach may help in the implementation of changes in bse regulations.
