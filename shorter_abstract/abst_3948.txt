to identify genes and mirnas involved in drought-stress responses in tobacco, we performed both mrna and small rna sequencing on tobacco leaf samples from the following three treatments: untreated-control , drought stress , and re-watering .
our results establish an empirical foundation that should prove valuable for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms through which tobacco, and plants more generally, respond to drought stress at multiple molecular genetic levels.
drought stress is one of the most severe problem limited agricultural productivity worldwide.
however, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the responses of tobacco leaves to drought stress and water status are not well understood.
further analysis revealed  <dig> overlapping degs between the dl vs. cl and wl vs. dl comparisons, and, strikingly, all of these genes exhibited opposing expression trends between these two comparisons, strongly suggesting that these overlapping degs are somehow involved in the responses of tobacco leaves to drought stress.
this study provides a global view of the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional responses of tobacco under drought stress and re-watering conditions.
in addition, small rna sequencing revealed  <dig> known micrornas  from  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirna candidates in tobacco.
analysis to identify negative correlations between the differentially expressed mirnas  and degs revealed  <dig> mrna-mirna interactions between cl and dl plants, and  <dig> mrna-mirna interactions between dl and wl plants.
we also found that five known mirna families  showed differential regulation under drought conditions.
we also found  <dig> and  <dig> transcription factors  among the degs in, respectively, the dl vs. cl and the wl vs. dl comparisons.
