the best accuracy, when using the six following genes --il12b, cd <dig>  socs <dig>  irgm <dig>  plin <dig> and lgals3bp-- was obtained by tree augmented na√Øve bayes and nearest neighbour .
the data mining protocol reduced the number of probe sets from  <dig>  to  <dig>  then from  <dig> to  <dig> and finally from  <dig> to  <dig>  the performances of a set of supervised classification models were compared.
a data mining protocol was applied to microarray data for murine cell lines treated with various inflammatory stimuli.
the selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in many gene expression studies.
consequently, researchers in the field try to identify the smallest set of genes that provide good sample classification.
the learning and validation data sets consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> samples, respectively.
support vector machines  and nearest neighbour  gave the worst performances, but the remaining models correctly classified all the  <dig> samples.
these data mining models, using data for the genes il12b, cd <dig> and socs <dig>  were validated with a human data set consisting of  <dig> samples.
the robustness of the data mining protocol was confirmed by the accuracy for a human data set, when using only the following three genes: il12b, cd <dig> and socs <dig>  in summary, we analysed the longitudinal pattern of expression in dendritic cells stimulated with activating agents with the aim of identifying signatures that would predict or explain the dentritic cell response to an inflammatory agent.
we investigated the genome-wide expression of the inflammatory phenotype in dendritic cells.
dendritic cells are a complex group of cells that play a critical role in vertebrate immunity.
the genes selected by the data mining protocol proposed were shown to be informative for discriminating between inflammatory and steady-state phenotypes in dendritic cells.
