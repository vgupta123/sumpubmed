ltr_insert identifies  <dig> full-length ltr elements, annotates  <dig> copies related with them, and discovers at least  <dig> novel ltr families in the whole-genome comparative map of two cultivated rice subspecies.
because of relatively high evolutionary speed, active transposition of ltr elements in the host genomes provides rich information on their short-term history.
the present research is designed to investigate important evolutionary events in the origin of asian cultivated rice through the comparison of ltr elements.
we have developed ltr_insert, a new method for ltr elements discovery in two closely related genomes.
from the full-length ltr elements, we estimate that a significant proportion of the rice genome has experienced inter-subspecies nonreciprocal recombination  in as recent as  <dig>  years.
in addition, ltr elements confirm that the genome of o. sativa ssp.
as more and more genomes, especially those of closely related organisms, have been sequenced, it is possible to perform global comparative study of their ltr retrotransposons to reveal events in the history.
our method has a distinctive feature that it is capable of judging whether an insertion occurs prior or posterior to the divergence of genomes.
a new ltr retrotransposon identification method integrating both comparative genomics and ab initio algorithm is introduced and applied to asian cultivated rice genomes.
they are considered to be one of the major forces underlying plant genome evolution.
large-scale samplings further support that more than 15% of the rice genome has been involved in such recombination.
at whole-genome level, this work confirms that recent isnr is an important factor that molds modern cultivated rice genome.
