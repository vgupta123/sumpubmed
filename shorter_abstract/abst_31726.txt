significant decrease of antithrombin levels was observed in both groups  after 15 days of treatment.
from the results obtained in our study, it is not possible to infer that hypercortisolism can increase the thromboembolic risk, despite the decreased anticoagulant factors .
an increase of platelet aggregation was observed in dogs receiving immunosuppressive doses of prednisone .
it is known that hypercortisolism can stimulate thrombi formation by increasing coagulation factors and decreasing fibrinolysis.
however it is not known how prednisone administration affects hemostasis in dogs and if it is dose dependent.
the aim of this study, therefore, was to demonstrate the effects of prednisone administration on dogs’ hemostatic profile.
