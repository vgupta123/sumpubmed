model checking has been recently introduced as an integrated framework for extracting information of the phylogenetic trees using temporal logics as a querying language, an extension of modal logics that imposes restrictions of a boolean formula along a path of events.
the phylogenetic tree is considered a transition system modeling the evolution as a sequence of genomic mutations , while this kind of logics are suitable for traversing it in a strict and exhaustive way.
we have shown that probabilistic model checking is a competitive framework for describing and analyzing quantitative properties over phylogenetic trees.
for instance, we obtain the likelihood of a tree topology according to a mutation model.

in addition, we have adapted the software for optimizing the computation of maximum likelihoods.
as case of study, we analyze several phylogenies in order to obtain the maximum likelihood with the model checking tool prism.
in this paper, we repair the limitations of the previous framework for including and handling quantitative information such as explicit time or probability.
besides, the existence of model checking tools hides the underlying technology, omitting the extension, upgrade, debugging and maintenance of a software tool to the biologists.
