the probes are compared to the input sequences, after a normalisation step; the results are used to partition the input sequences into homogeneous groups of proteins.
the results are essentially coherent with the biology.
here we present a novel approach, which is based on random sampling of sub-sequences  out of a set of input sequences.
whole-genome sequencing projects are rapidly producing an enormous number of new sequences.
the second one contains all proteins from swiss-prot release  <dig> with at least one src homology  <dig>  domain â€“ a classical example for proteins with modular architecture.
the first one contains the sequences of prokaryotic lyases that could be arranged as a multiple sequence alignment.
