trka activation by nerve growth factor  increases the proteolytic processing of p75ntr mediated by adam <dig>  reelin induces the sheeding of apoer <dig> ectodomain depending on metalloproteinase activity.
the apoer <dig> ligand reelin regulated the proteolytic processing of its own receptor but not of p75ntr.

finally, in primary cortical neurons, which express both apoer <dig> and trkb, we found that the proteolysis of apoer <dig> was also regulated by brain-derived growth factor .
our results highlight a novel relationship between neurotrophins and the reelin-apoer <dig> system, suggesting that these two pathways might be linked to regulate brain development, neuronal survival, and some pathological conditions.
we found that trka activation by ngf in pc <dig> cells induced apoer <dig> processing, which was dependent on trka activation and metalloproteinases.
