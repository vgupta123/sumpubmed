members of the eukaryote/archaea specific erf <dig> and erf <dig> protein families have central roles in translation termination.
we propose that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea possessed dom34p-mediated no-go decay .
phylogenetic trees of the protein families allow us to reconstruct the evolution of mrna surveillance mechanisms mediated by these proteins in eukaryotes and archaea.
at an early stage in eukaryotic evolution, eef1a was duplicated, giving rise to erf <dig>  which was recruited for translation termination, interacting with erf <dig>  erf <dig> evolved nonsense-mediated decay  activity either before or after it was again duplicated, giving rise to hbs1p, which we propose was recruited to assist edom34p in eukaryotic ngd.
finally, a third duplication within ascomycete yeast gave rise to ski7p, which may have become specialised for a subset of existing hbs1p functions in non-stop decay .
ski7p appears to be restricted to a subset of saccharomyces species.
we suggest ski7p-mediated nsd may be a specialised mechanism for counteracting the effects of increased stop codon read-through caused by prion-domain  mediated erf <dig> precipitation.
we have examined the evolution of erf <dig> and erf <dig> families using sequence similarity searching, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.
alignments show that dom34p does not possess the characteristic class- <dig> rf minidomains ggq, niks and yxcxxxf, in line with recent crystallographic analysis of dom34p.
