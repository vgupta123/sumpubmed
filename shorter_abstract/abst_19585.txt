in 10-fold cross validation tests, iupforest-l can achieve an area of  <dig> % under the receiver operating characteristic  curve.
machine learning techniques, including neural networks and support vector machines have been widely used in such predictions.
iupforest-l is based on the moreau-broto auto-correlation function of amino acid indices  and other physicochemical features of the primary sequences.
the random forest model based on the auto-correlation functions of the aais within a protein fragment and other physicochemical features could effectively detect long disordered regions in proteins.
a new algorithm, iupforest-l, for predicting long disordered regions using the random forest learning model is proposed in this paper.
compared with existing disorder predictors, iupforest-l has high prediction accuracy and is efficient for predicting long disordered regions in large-scale proteomes.
prediction of disordered regions in protein sequences is important for understanding protein function and in high-throughput determination of protein structures.
a new predictor, iupforest-l, was developed to batch predict long disordered regions in proteins, and the server can be accessed from
