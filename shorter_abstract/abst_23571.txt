the measured gv in the chosen x-ray settings showed on average a good correlation  to the measured bmd with dexa.
correlation between the two x-ray settings was very good .
it is important that the same x-ray settings are chosen for each patient for follow-up studies.
results indicate that measuring absolute changes in bone mineral density might be possible using digital radiography.

in human medicine, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry  is the gold standard for quantitative evaluation of bone mineral density, whereas in veterinary medicine conventional radiography is used for follow-up studies.
therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation of bone mineral density  measured by dexa with grey scale values  measured in digital x-ray images  ex vivo.

not all significant differences between rois detectable with dexa can be displayed in the x-ray images because of the lower sensitivity of the radiographs.
however, direct comparison of grey scale values of the periprosthetic femur in one individual patient during the follow-up period, in order to predict bone remodelling processes, should be possible, but with a lesser sensitivity than with dexa.
recently, a method has been described using digital x-ray images for quantitative assessment of grey scale values of bone contrast.
aseptic loosening due to bone remodelling processes after total hip replacement is one common cause for revision surgery.
