gene ontology  data provides a novel way to measure the functional relationship between gene products.
however, biologists are more interested in the relationship between gene products than in the scores linking the go terms.
researchers interested in analysing the expression patterns of functionally related genes usually hope to improve the accuracy of their results beyond the boundaries of currently available experimental data.
in this study, we evaluated five functional similarity methods using both protein-protein interaction  and expression data of s. cerevisiae.
many approaches have been reported for calculating the similarities between two go terms, known as semantic similarities.
