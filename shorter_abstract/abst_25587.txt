the in vivo transfer of naked plasmid dna into organs such as muscles is commonly used to assess the expression of prophylactic or therapeutic genes in animal disease models.
interestingly, the mar elements were found to promote plasmid genomic integration but to oppose silencing effects in vivo, thereby mediating long-term expression.
in this study, we devised vectors allowing a tight regulation of transgene expression in mice from such non-viral vectors using a doxycycline-controlled network of activator and repressor proteins.
kinetic studies showed that the induction of transgene expression was only transient, unless epigenetic regulatory elements termed matrix attachment regions, or mar, were inserted upstream of the regulated promoters.
