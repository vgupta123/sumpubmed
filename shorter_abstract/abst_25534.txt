pectate lyases  play an important role in the infection process of plant pathogens and also have a commercial significance in industrial applications.
most of the pels were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, while a few recombinant proteins were insoluble.
the two different methods and comparison presented here would be highly valuable in obtaining an ideal enzyme for the downstream experiments, and supply an useful alternative to purify some insoluble recombinant proteins.
the expressed products were purified using affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography.
pcpel <dig> was constructed by pet system and pmal system, and both constructs were used to express the pcpel <dig> in escherichia coli bl <dig>  plyss.
the purity, specific activity and pathogenicity of the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system were higher than the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pet system.
purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at  <dig> k, and initial crystals were grown.
we cloned a new pectate lyase gene  from phytophthora capsici.
