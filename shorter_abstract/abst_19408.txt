however, this growth factor is very unstable and shows rapid degradation in aqueous solution.
we also analyzed the influence of this binding on the stability of fgf <dig> in aqueous solution over a period of  <dig> h. while the amount of untreated fgf <dig> is reduced drastically over this period of time, atp-binding reduces the degradation considerably.
here we determined the dissociation constant of atp on fgf <dig> by equilibrium microdialysis  and analyzed the impact of this binding on secondary structure by cd-spectroscopy.
atp-binding to fgf <dig> significantly changed the secondary structure of this growth factor with a shift to random coil structure elements.
fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  a well-characterized heparin-binding growth factor, is involved in many biological processes like embryogenesis, cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
beside the well-known stabilization of fgf <dig> by heparin or heparan sulphate, the recently discovered binding to atp also shows a stabilizing and protective effect on this growth factor.
