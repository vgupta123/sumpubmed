as a consequence, a burst in ethylene production speeding up ripening occurs.
only glv ctg <dig> expression could not be rescued by exogenous auxin.
to elucidate this interaction at the transition from maturation to ripening and the accompanying switch from system- <dig> to system- <dig> ethylene biosynthesis, fruits of melting flesh and stony hard genotypes, the latter unable to produce system- <dig> ethylene because of insufficient amount of auxin at ripening, were treated with auxin, ethylene and with 1-methylcyclopropene , known to block ethylene receptors.
1-mcp treatment of peach fruit is ineffective in delaying ripening because it stimulates an increase in free auxin.
in melting flesh peaches, auxin is necessary for system- <dig> ethylene synthesis and a cross-talk between ethylene and auxin occurs during the ripening process.
a melting flesh and a stony hard genotype, differing for their ability to synthetize auxin and ethylene amounts at ripening, were used to study the fine temporal regulation and auxin responsiveness of genes involved in the process.
transcriptional waves showed a tight interdependence between auxin and ethylene actions with the former possibly enhanced by the glv ctg <dig>  the expression of genes involved in the regulation of ripening, among which are several transcription factors, was similar in the two genotypes or could be rescued by auxin application in the stony hard.
the nature and transcriptional response of ctg <dig> led to discover a rise in free auxin in 1-mcp treated fruit.
unexpectedly, 1-mcp induced genes also up-regulated by ripening, ethylene and auxin, as ctg <dig>  similar to golven  peptides, and repressed genes also down-regulated by ripening, ethylene and auxin, as ctg <dig>  a calcineurin b-like protein.
the effects of the treatments on the different genotypes were monitored by hormone quantifications and transcription profiling.
