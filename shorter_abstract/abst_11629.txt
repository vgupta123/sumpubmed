by considering their functions, fourteen candidate genes were determined to be likely involved in high-elevation adaptation, including two cyp genes, usp- <dig>  and several others.
we have evidence for both convergent and divergent evolution between endothermic and poikilothemic species, but additional research across a wide range of organisms will be necessary to comprehend the complexity of high-elevation adaptation.
in this context, we sequenced transcriptomes of a pair of closely related anuran species, rana chensinensis and r. kukunoris, which inhabit respective low- and high-elevation habitats.
previous studies have mainly focused on endothermic organisms, while poikilothermic species may have evolved different mechanisms to cope with high-elevation environments.
understanding how organisms adapt to high-elevation environments at a genome scale provides novel insights into the process of adaptive evolution.
we identified a set of candidate genes that may have promoted adaptation of r. kukunoris to its high-elevation environment.
detailed molecular, physiological, and phenotypic studies are required to better understand the roles of these genes in improving the performance of r. kukunoris in a high-elevation environment.
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts for each species were obtained by de novo assembly.
by comparing the two transcriptomes, we identified candidate genes that may be involved in high-elevation adaption in poikilothermic species.
by comparing the orthologous transcripts, we identified  <dig> protein-coding genes that have likely experienced strong positive selection .
in addition,  <dig> genes that may bear a signature of positive selection  were also recognized.
