we isolated a mutant strain of dictyostelium discoideum following restriction enzyme-mediated integration  mutagenesis in which reda was disrupted.
cpr gene-disruption experiments have demonstrated that absence of this enzyme causes developmental defects both in mouse and insect.
reda transcripts are present during growth and early development but then decline, reaching undetectable levels after the mound stage.
this mutant develops only to the mound stage and accumulates a bright yellow pigment.
nadph-cytochrome-p <dig> oxidoreductase  is a ubiquitous enzyme that belongs to a family of diflavin oxidoreductases and is required for activity of the microsomal cytochrome-p <dig> monooxygenase system.
the mound-arrest phenotype is cell-autonomous suggesting that the defect occurs within the cells rather than in intercellular signaling.
the developmental arrest due to disruption of reda implicates cpr in the metabolism of compounds that control cell differentiation.
annotation of the sequenced genome of d. discoideum revealed the presence of three genes  that encode putative members of the diflavin oxidoreductase protein family.
