whole genome sequencing of pcr ribotype  <dig> strain  <dig>  isolated from a diarrheic piglet, showed that tn <dig> was not present in this strain.
nine other strains, also tetracycline resistant human isolates, contained half of the transposon, suggesting multiple insertion steps yielding the full tn <dig>  other pcr ribotypes  were all negative for the presence of the transposon.
previously, the genome of the pcr ribotype  <dig> strain m <dig>  a human isolate, was described to contain a unique insert of  <dig> kilobases.
although the element contained several potential antibiotic resistance genes, it did not yield a readily distinguishable phenotype.
although no transfer of the element could be shown, we hypothesize that the element could serve as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes for other bacteria.
further research is needed to investigate the transfer capabilities of the element and to substantiate the possible role of tn <dig> as a source of antibiotic resistance genes for other gut pathogens.
analysis of this insert revealed over  <dig> open reading frames, encoding proteins originating from transposons, phages and plasmids.
in the past decade, the number of c. difficile patients has increased dramatically, coinciding with the emergence of two pcr ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  pcr ribotype  <dig> is also frequently found during c. difficile outbreaks in pigfarms.
multi locus variable tandem repeat analysis revealed genetic relatedness among transposon containing isolates.
clostridium difficile is the main cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
to test the prevalence of tn <dig>  a collection of  <dig> clostridium difficile pcr ribotype  <dig> isolates from human  and porcine  origin was tested for the presence of this element by pcr.
