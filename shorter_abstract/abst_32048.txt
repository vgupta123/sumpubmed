searching for members of characterized ncrna families containing pseudoknots is an important component of genome-scale ncrna annotation.
the source codes are available at http://www.cse.msu.edu/~chengy/knotsearch.
when pseudoknot structures are vital to the functions of the ncrnas, these sequences may not be true members.
the experimental results show that our work competes favorably with other pseudoknot search methods.
however, the state-of-the-art known ncrna search is based on context-free grammar , which cannot effectively model pseudoknots.
we test our tool on a contiguous 22-mb region of the maize genome.
it provides a complementary pseudoknot search tool to infernal.
our sub-structure based tool can conduct genome-scale pseudoknot-containing ncrna search effectively and efficiently.
