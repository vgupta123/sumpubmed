therefore, in this study, we determined the levels of prostaglandin e <dig> , cytokines, chemokines, and matrix components in ivds from chondrodystrophic  and non-chondrodystrophic  dogs with and without clinical signs of ivd disease, and correlated these to degeneration grade , or herniation type .
a better understanding is needed in order to develop biological therapies that address both pain and degeneration in ivd disease.
future studies are needed to investigate if inhibition of pge <dig> levels in degenerated ivds provides effective analgesia and exerts a protective role in the process of ivd degeneration and the development of ivd disease.
only limited studies have studied the cytokine and chemokine profiles in ivd degeneration in dogs, and mainly focused on gene expression.
cox- <dig> expression in the np and annulus fibrosus , and proliferation of fibroblasts and numbers of macrophages in the af significantly increased with increased degeneration grade.
gag content did not significantly change with degeneration grade or herniation type.
in addition, we investigated cyclooxygenase  <dig>  expression and signs of inflammation in histological ivd samples of cd and ncd dogs.
pge <dig> levels were significantly higher in the nucleus pulposus  of degenerated ivds compared with non-degenerated ivds, and in herniated ivds from ncd dogs compared with non-herniated ivds of ncd dogs.
although macrophages invaded the af as degeneration progressed, the production of inflammatory mediators seemed most pronounced in degenerated np tissue.
cox- <dig> expression in the np and af and reactive changes in the af increased with advancing degeneration stages.
intervertebral disc  disease is a common spinal disorder in dogs and degeneration and inflammation are significant components of the pathological cascade.
