comparison of libraries showed that wolbachia infection significantly regulated  <dig> mirnas in females and  <dig> mirnas in males, with an overall suppression of mirnas in wolbachia-infected libraries.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that are involved in many biological processes such as development, reproduction and host-pathogen interactions.
by integrating the mrna data originated from the same samples, the target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas were predicted.
then, go and pathway analyses were performed for the target genes.
an analysis of target genes showed that wolbachia-responsive mirnas regulated genes with function in sphingolipid metabolism, lysosome function, apoptosis and lipid transporting in both sexes, as well as reproduction in females.
comparisons of the mirna and mrna data can help to identify mirnas and mirna target genes involving in wolbachia-host interactions.
small rna libraries of infected and uninfected t. urticae for both sexes  were constructed.
although mirna was observed to involve in wolbachia-host interactions in the other insect systems, its roles have not been fully deciphered in the two-spotted spider mite.
a comparison of the mirna and mrna data predicted that the differentially expressed mirnas negatively regulated  <dig> mrnas in females and  <dig> mrnas in males.
