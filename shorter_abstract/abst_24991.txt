detection in some genomes, but not others, may reveal sorting system components by comparison of the phylogenetic profile of the class of sorting signal to that of various protein families.
by a simple heuristic for screening phylogenetic profiles in the absence of pre-formed protein families, we discovered that a homolog of the membrane protein epsh  occurs in a species when pep-cterm domains are found.
the phylogenetic profile for this dna sequence exactly matches that of three proteins: a sigma-54-interacting response regulator , a transmembrane histidine kinase , and a tpr protein .
this possible recognition or processing site is followed by a predicted transmembrane helix and a cluster rich in basic amino acids.
all bacteria with pep-cterm have both an outer membrane and exopolysaccharide  production genes.
in the proteobacteria, most of these upstream regions share a dna sequence, a probable cis-regulatory site that contains a sigma- <dig> binding motif.
most pep-cterm proteins are encoded by single-gene operons preceded by large intergenic regions.
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pep-cterm and epsh form a protein export sorting system, analogous to the lpxtg/sortase system of gram-positive bacteria, and correlated to eps expression.
it tends to occur multiple times in a genome if it occurs at all, with a median count of eight instances; verrucomicrobium spinosum has sixty-five.
