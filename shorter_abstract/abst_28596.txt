although there has been considerable progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy, the roles of protein phosphorylation in the process of dormancy regulation in woody plants remain unclear.
extraction of the phosphorylation motif using motif-x indicated that proline-directed kinases are a major kinase group involved in protein phosphorylation in dormant poplar tissues.
this study provides evidence about the significance of protein phosphorylation during dormancy, and will be useful for similar studies on other woody plants.
we used mass spectrometry combined with tio <dig> phosphopeptide-enrichment strategies to investigate the phosphoproteome of dormant terminal buds  in poplar .
further functional classifications showed that most of these phosphoproteins were involved in binding and catalytic activity.
