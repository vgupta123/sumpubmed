the gene coding for lsa <dig> is present in pathogenic strains belonging to the l. interrogans species but was not found in the saprophytic l. biflexa serovar patoc strain patoc  <dig>  loss of gene expression occurs upon culture attenuation of pathogenic strains.
moreover, anti-lsa <dig> serum labeled liver and kidney tissues of human fatal cases of leptospirosis.
environmental factors such as osmolarity and temperature affect lsa <dig> expression at the transcriptional level.
adherence to host tissues is mediated by surface-exposed proteins expressed by the microorganisms during infection.
attachment of lsa <dig> to laminin, collagen iv, and plasma fibronectin was specific and dose dependent.
whole-genome sequencing analysis of l. interrogans allowed identification of a repertoire of putative leptospiral surface proteins.
laminin oxidation by sodium metaperiodate reduced the protein-laminin interaction in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that laminin sugar moieties are crucial for this interaction.
the mechanisms by which pathogenic leptospires invade and colonize the host remain poorly understood since few virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease have been identified.
compatible with its role in adhesion, the protein was shown to be surface-exposed by indirect immunofluorescence.
