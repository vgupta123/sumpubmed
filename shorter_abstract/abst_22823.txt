our results demonstrated the differences of two detection tools and integration of multiple algorithms can enhance the detection of sheep genomic structure variations.
in addition, there were  <dig> cnvrs overlapped in our new dataset and other published ruminant cnv studies.
therefore, cnvs are increasingly recognized as an important and abundant source of genetic variation and phenotypic diversity.
in recent years, genome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered single-nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with complex traits such as diseases and quantitative phenotypes.
a total of  <dig> cnv regions  were identified, including  <dig> losses,  <dig> gains, and six with both events , which cover  <dig> â€‰mb of the sheep genomic sequence and correspond to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence.
in this study, we firstly constructed a sheep cnv map based on the ovine snp <dig> array.
analyses of cnvs in the genomes of three sheep breeds were performed using the ovine snp <dig> beadchip array.
furthermore, our findings would be of help for understanding the sheep genome and provide preliminary foundation for carrying out the cnvs association studies with economically important phenotypes of sheep in the future.
these variations account for a small proportion of heritability.
with the development of high throughput techniques, abundant submicroscopic structural variations have been found in organisms, of which the main variations are copy number variations .
