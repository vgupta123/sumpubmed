results from the analysis of these bee-associated sequences have ramifications for other environments represented by few sequences in the public databases or few bacterial isolates.
we explored the stability of classification of honey bee gut microbiota sequences by the rdp-nbc utilizing three publically available ribosomal rna sequence databases as training sets: arb-silva, greengenes and rdp.
we found that the inclusion of previously published, high-quality, full-length sequences from 16s rrna clone libraries improved the precision in classification of novel bee-associated sequences.
