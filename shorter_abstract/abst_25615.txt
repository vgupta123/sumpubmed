the fastest of the insect jumpers, the froghopper, uses a catapult-like elastic mechanism to achieve their jumping prowess in which energy, generated by the slow contraction of muscles, is released suddenly to power rapid and synchronous movements of the hind legs.
muscle contractions bend the chitinous cuticle with little deformation and therefore, store the energy needed for jumping, while the resilin rapidly returns its stored energy and thus restores the body to its original shape after a jump and allows repeated jumping.
this allows them to release large amounts of energy in a very short time to jump at very high speeds.
no other structures in the thorax or hind legs show this blue fluorescence and it is not found in larvae which do not jump.
they are built of chitinous cuticle and the rubber-like protein, resilin, which fluoresces bright blue when illuminated with ultra-violet light.
the composite structure therefore, combines the stiffness of the chitinous cuticle with the elasticity of resilin.
stimulating one trochanteral depressor muscle in a pattern that simulates its normal action, results in a distortion and forward movement of the posterior part of a pleural arch by  <dig> μm, but in natural jumping, the movement is at least  <dig> μm.
the hind coxae of the froghopper are linked to the hinges of the ipsilateral hind wings by pleural arches, complex bow-shaped internal skeletal structures.
the stiffer cuticular parts of the pleural arches could, however, easily meet all the energy storage needs.
the ventral and posterior end of this fluorescent region forms the thoracic part of the pivot with a hind coxa.
many insects jump by storing and releasing energy in elastic structures within their bodies.
