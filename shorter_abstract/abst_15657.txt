from these enzyme levels and the known regulatory network structure, we determined the probability for a given transcription factor to cause the coordinated expression changes.
the most probable transcription factors to regulate the different degrees of respiration were gcr1p, cat8p, the rtg-proteins and the hap-complex.
we address this question by linking the functional degree of respiration to transcriptional regulation via enzyme abundances.
during growth on the partly and fully respired substrates galactose and pyruvate, several tca cycle and respiratory chain enzymes were significantly up-regulated.
based on 13c flux analysis, we found that the respiratory contribution to cellular energy production was largely absent on glucose and mannose, intermediate on galactose and highest on pyruvate.
specifically, we investigated aerobic batch cultures with the differently repressive carbon sources glucose, mannose, galactose and pyruvate.
while many key regulators are known for these extreme cases, we focus here on regulators that are relevant at intermediate levels of respiration.
depending on the carbon source, saccharomyces cerevisiae displays various degrees of respiration.
for the latter three ones we confirmed their importance for respiration by quantifying the degree of respiration and biomass yields in the corresponding deletion strains.
