bacillus anthracis secretes several virulence factors targeting different host organs and cell types during inhalational anthrax infection.
our results indicate that the pxo1-containing strain induces higher pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses during the first  <dig> hours of interaction with bacterium, evident in the upregulation of several genes relevant to nf-κb, phosphatases, prostaglandins, and tnf-α, along with decreases in expression levels of genes for mitochondrial components.
the bacterial expression of a key virulence factor, lethal toxin  is closely tied to another factor, edema toxin .
here we report the transcriptional and apoptotic responses of the macrophage-like phagocytic cell line thp- <dig> exposed to b. anthracis sterne  spores, and b. anthracis Δ sterne  spores.
the suppression of apoptosis by the toxigenic anthrax strain is consistent with the notion that apoptosis itself may represent a protective host cell response.
these cells are resistant to letx-induced cytolysis, a phenotype seen in macrophages from several mouse strains which are sensitive to toxigenic anthrax infection.
