even though studies have repeatedly identified domestic dogs as a risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, our understanding of campylobacter ecology in this reservoir is limited.
to expand our understanding of campylobacter ecology in dogs, a collection of fecal samples from  <dig> healthy and  <dig> diarrheic pet dogs were examined for the presence and levels of  <dig> campylobacter species using quantitative pcr.
with several of the detected campylobacter species known or emerging pathogens, these results are relevant to both ecological and public health discussions.
it was found that 58% of healthy dogs and 97% of diarrheic dogs shed detectable levels of campylobacter spp., with c. coli, c. concisus, c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. helveticus, c. jejuni, c. lari, c. mucosalis, c. showae, c. sputorum and c. upsaliensis levels significantly higher in the diarrheic population.
levels of individual campylobacter species detected ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> organisms per gram of feces.
this study demonstrates that domestic dogs can carry a wide range of campylobacter species naturally and that there is a notable increase in species richness detectable in the diarrheic population.
in addition, many individual samples contained multiple species of campylobacter, with healthy dogs carrying from 0- <dig> detectable species while diarrheic dogs carried from 0- <dig> detectable species.
these findings represent the largest number of campylobacter species specifically tested for in animals and is the first report to determine quantifiable levels of campylobacter being shed from dogs.
