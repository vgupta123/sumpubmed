furthermore, our model shows that cr's effects on health maintenance are negatively correlated to the temperature drop observed in endothermic animals, and is positively correlated to animals' body masses.
our model reveals how animals will alter their energy budget when food availability is low, and offers better understanding of the tradeoffs between growth and somatic maintenance; therefore shedding new light on aging research from an energetic viewpoint.
several attempts have been made to understand the underlying mechanisms from the viewpoint of energy tradeoffs in organisms' life histories.
by suppressing animals' caloric energy supply and biomass synthesis, cr alters animals' energy allocation strategies and channels additional energy to those maintenance mechanisms, therefore enhancing their performance.
caloric restriction  has been shown to keep organisms in a relatively youthful and healthy state compared to ad libitum fed counterparts, as well as to extend the lifespan of a diverse set of organisms.
our model corroborates the observation that cr's effects on health maintenance are positively correlated with the degree and duration of cr.
