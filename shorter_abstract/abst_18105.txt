further, we present in stateprofiler a new greedy em algorithm for fast and optimal model selection.
the parsimonious approach of our greedy algorithm allows us to detect the genuine dynamic variation in the key features as and when they appear in time course data.
to ensure precision and rigor, we propose a parametric modeling framework stateprofiler based on finite mixtures of skew t-normal distributions that are robust against non-gaussian features caused by asymmetry and outliers in data.
gradual or sudden transitions among different states as exhibited by cell populations in a biological sample under particular conditions or stimuli can be detected and profiled by flow cytometric time course data.
we applied stateprofiler to identify the temporal features of yeast cell cycle progression based on knockout of s-phase triggering cyclins clb <dig> and clb <dig>  and then compared the s-phase delay phenotypes due to differential regulation of the two cyclins.
often such temporal profiles contain features due to transient states that present unique modeling challenges.
this allows precise profiling of unusually shaped distributions and less well-separated features that may appear due to cellular heterogeneity even within clonal populations.
we also used stateprofiler to construct the temporal profile of clonal divergence underlying lineage selection in mammalian hematopoietic progenitor cells.
these could range from asymmetric non-gaussian distributions to outliers and tail subpopulations, which need to be modeled with precision and rigor.
