flies lack trks but have ror and ror-related proteins called nrks playing a neurotrophic role.
the finding of p75ntr in several protostomes suggests that death domain tnfr superfamily proteins appeared early in evolution.
neurotrophins and their trk and p75ntr receptors play an important role in the nervous system.
drosophila spz <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> orthologues as well as two new groups of spz proteins  are also found in the daphnia genome.
only one tnfr representative, the drosophila wengen, has been found in protostomes.
in protostomes, a "neurotrophin superfamily" includes spzs and neurotrophins which respectively form two paralogous families.
trks and trkl proteins also form closely related paralogous families within the protostomian rtks, whereby trkls are absent in deuterostomes.
the daphnia genome encodes a neurotrophin, p75ntr and trk orthologue together with trkl, ror, and nrk-rtks.
drosophila has neurotrophin homologues called sp√§tzles , some of which were recently renamed neurotrophins, but direct proof that these are deuterostome neurotrophin orthologues is lacking.
mollusks have so far the most similar proteins to trks  but the exact phylogenetic relationship of mollusk trks to each other and to vertebrate trks is unknown.
p75ntr belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor  superfamily.
in protostomes, homologues to either neurotrophin, trk or p75ntr are reported but their phylogenetic relationship to deuterostome neurotrophin signaling components is unclear.
