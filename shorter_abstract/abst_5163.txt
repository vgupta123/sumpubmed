the extensive aggregation and local coalescence of the microfibrils are likely to have parallels in other grass and cereal species and to influence the accessibility of cellulose to degradative enzymes during conversion to liquid biofuels
small-angle neutron scattering provided evidence of extensive aggregation by hydrogen bonding through the hydrophilic edges of the sheets of chains.
bamboo microfibrils have features found in both primary-wall and secondary-wall cellulose, but are crystallographically coalescent to a greater extent than is common in celluloses from other plants.
the wide-angle scattering data also showed that the microfibrils had a relatively large intersheet d-spacing and small monoclinic angle, features normally considered characteristic of primary-wall cellulose.
it is not clear if cellulose microfibrils from grasses and cereals differ in structure from those of other plants.
the structures of the highly oriented cellulose microfibrils in the cell walls of the internodes of the bamboo pseudosasa amabilis are reported.
however in the other direction, perpendicular to the sheets of chains, the mean, disorder-corrected scherrer dimension from wide-angle x-ray scattering was  <dig> Â nm.
