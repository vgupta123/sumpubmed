reliable, accurate and sensitive spirometric tests of airway function in resting horses would assist with the diagnosis of limitations to breathing and facilitate investigations of the effects of various treatments on breathing capacity.
the aim of the current study was to characterise absolute and relative indices of respiratory function in healthy horses during eupnoea  and carbon dioxide -induced hyperpnoea  using a modified mask pneumotrachographic technique well suited to equine practice, and to evaluate the reliability of this technique over three consecutive days.
the technique provided absolute measures of respiratory function  consistent with previous studies and there was no significant effect of day on any measure of respiratory function.
variability of measurements was decreased during hyperpnea caused by rebreathing co <dig>  but a number of relative flow-time variables demonstrated good agreement during eupnoeic respiration.
the use of relative flow-time variables provided reproducible  results, suggesting the technique may be of use for repeated measures studies in horses during tidal breathing or rebreathing.
coefficients of variation, intra-class correlations, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals across all days of testing were established for each parameter.
the evaluation of respiratory function in horses is challenging and suitable procedures are not widely available to equine practitioners.
the technique was well tolerated by horses and study findings suggest the technique is suitable for evaluation of respiratory function in horses.
