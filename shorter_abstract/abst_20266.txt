fungal cbm1-containing proteins were implicated in cellulose degradation whereas in oomycetes, the cellulose binding elicitor lectin , a well-characterized cbm1-protein from phytophthora parasitica, was implicated in cell wall integrity, adhesion to cellulosic substrates and induction of plant immunity.
in fungi, more than 70% of cbm1-containing proteins correspond to enzymatic proteins in which cbm <dig> is associated with a catalytic unit involved in cellulose degradation.
oomycetes are fungal-like microorganisms evolutionary distinct from true fungi, belonging to the stramenopile lineage and comprising major plant pathogens.
both oomycetes and fungi express proteins able to interact with cellulose, a major component of plant and oomycete cell walls, through the presence of carbohydrate-binding module belonging to the family  <dig> .
we show that while cbm1s from fungi and oomycetes are similar, they team up with different protein domains, either in proteins implicated in the degradation of plant cell wall components in the case of fungi or in proteins involved in adhesion to polysaccharidic substrates in the case of oomycetes.
a cbm1-pan/apple association 3d structural modeling was built allowing the identification of amino acid residues interacting with cellulose and suggesting the putative interaction of the pan/apple domain with another type of glucan.
this work highlighted the unique role and evolution of cbm <dig> proteins in oomycete among the stramenopile lineage.
distinct stramenopile genomes like diatoms and brown algae are devoid of cbm <dig> coding genes.
in oomycetes more than 90% of proteins are similar to cbel in which cbm <dig> is associated with a non-catalytic pan/apple domain, known to interact with specific carbohydrates or proteins.
