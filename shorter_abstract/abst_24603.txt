these findings support a functional scheme whereby regulation of wnt signaling is achieved by cooperative functions of multiple mediators.
here we report that ror <dig> also positively modulates wnt3a-activated canonical signaling in a lung carcinoma, h <dig> cell line.
the functions of ror <dig> in mediating the non-canonical wnt signaling have been well established.
the role of ror <dig> in canonical wnt signaling is not fully understood.
this activity of ror <dig> is dependent on cooperative interactions with fzd <dig> but not fzd <dig>  in addition, ror2-mediated enhancement of canonical signaling requires the extracellular crd, but not the intracellular prd domain of ror <dig>  we further provide evidence that the positive effect of ror <dig> on canonical wnt signaling is inhibited by dkk <dig> and krm <dig> suggesting that ror <dig> enhances an lrp-dependent stf response.
the current study demonstrates the function of ror <dig> in modulating canonical wnt signaling.
