a key aspect of this technique is its ability to identify correlations amongst heterogeneous data such as gene ontology annotations, gene expression data and genome location of genes.
for example, when searching for enrichment in go terms, genes can be annotated with multiple go terms and should be propagated to the more general terms in the gene ontology.
additionally, current methods mainly ignore the structure of the data which causes results redundancy.
the results obtained demonstrate the gain in terms of pertinence , space requirements  and efficiency .
algorithms and compact representations of target sets are provided for the generation and the evaluation of the pertinent target sets.
we propose a formal representation of gene sets based on the theory of partially ordered sets , and give a formal definition of target set pertinence.
the formalism and the pertinence definition can be directly used by most of the methods and tools currently available for feature enrichment analysis.
