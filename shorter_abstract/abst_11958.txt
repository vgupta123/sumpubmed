in the absence of genome sequences, transcriptome assemblies are important for defence gene discovery in lodgepole pine and jack pine, as demonstrated here for the terpenoid pathway genes.
the mountain pine beetle  epidemic has affected lodgepole pine  across an area of more than  <dig> million hectares of pine forests in western canada, and is a threat to the boreal jack pine  forest.
the genes responsible for terpene biosynthesis in jack pine and lodgepole pine were previously unknown.
we report the generation and quality assessment of assembled transcriptome resources for lodgepole pine and jack pine using sanger, roche  <dig>  and illumina sequencing technologies.
we cloned and functionally characterized, via expression of recombinant proteins in e. coli, nine different jack pine and eight different lodgepole pine mono-tpss.
the newly identified lodgepole pine and jack pine mono-tpss include -α-pinene synthases, -α-pinene synthases, -β-pinene synthases, -3-carene synthases, and -β-phellandrene synthases from each of the two species.
the product profiles of the functionally annotated mono-tpss described here can account for the major monoterpene metabolites identified in lodgepole pine and jack pine.
