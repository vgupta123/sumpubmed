lps administration produces changes in serum proteins associated with lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory response, protein binding/transport, cell adhesion, venous thrombosis, cardiac contractility and blood coagulation.
these results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of endotoxemia and the beneficial effect of choline administration in this clinical situation.
the administration of choline is associated with changes in proteins which can be related with its beneficial effect in this clinical situation.
choline treatment attenuated actin alpha cardiac muscle- <dig> overexpression after lps.
in the lps group, there were significant increases in serum levels of ragulator complex protein  and galectin-3-binding protein , but transcription factor maff and corticosteroid binding globulin were down regulated .
calves in c and lps + c groups received choline chloride .
as compared with the lps group, in lps + c group, fibrinogen gamma-b-chain and antithrombin were up-regulated, while hemopexin and histone h <dig> were down-regulated.
serum samples were collected before and after the treatments.
this study aimed to investigate the possible serum protein changes after endotoxin administration in healthy and choline-treated calves using proteomics.
after lps administration,  <dig> proteins increased, and  <dig> proteins decreased within 48 h as compared to controls.
