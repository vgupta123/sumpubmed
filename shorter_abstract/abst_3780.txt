among the four investigated deg analysis methods, sensitivity and specificity of edger was relatively high.
our results highlighted the need for combined use of more sensitive deg analysis methods and high-throughput validation of identified degs in future rna-seq experiments.
moreover, we sequenced rna-pools and compared their results with sequencing corresponding individual rna samples.
we documented the pooling bias and that the degs identified in pooled samples suffered low positive predictive values.

massively parallel cdna sequencing  experiments are gradually superseding microarrays in quantitative gene expression profiling.
however, many biologists are uncertain about the choice of differentially expressed gene  analysis methods and the validity of cost-saving sample pooling strategies for their rna-seq experiments.
hence, we performed experimental validation of degs identified by cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and two-stage poisson model  in a rna-seq experiment involving mice amygdalae micro-punches, using high-throughput qpcr on independent biological replicate samples.
