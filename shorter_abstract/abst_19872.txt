we also showed that atra inhibited th <dig> and promoted inducible regulatory t-cell differentiation, whereas it did not induce an obvious effect on th <dig> differentiation in vitro.
we investigated the effects of atra in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation.
we found that atra treatment attenuated airway inflammation and decreased mrna levels of th2- and th17-related transcription factors.
serum vitamin a concentrations are significantly lower in asthmatic subjects than in healthy control subjects.
airway inflammation is mainly mediated by t helper  <dig> cells  that characteristically produce interleukin - <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  epidemiological studies have revealed an inverse association between the dietary intake of vitamin a and the occurrence of asthma.
however, its role in th2-mediated airway inflammation remains unclear.
the data showed that airway inflammation coincided with levels of th2- and th17-related cytokines.
administration of atra dramatically attenuated airway inflammation by inhibiting th <dig> and th <dig> differentiation and/or functions.
atra may have potential therapeutic effects for airway inflammation in asthmatic patients.
it has been reported that all-trans retinoic acid , a potent derivative of vitamin a, regulates immune responses.
