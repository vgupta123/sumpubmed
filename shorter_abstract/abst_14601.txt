we discovered an unprecedented burst of differential expression of cell cycle related genes at one particular point during transition to flowering.
this analysis revealed a developmental time point between  <dig> and 12 days after germination where flc expression had decreased but lfy expression had not yet increased, which was characterized by a peak in the number of differentially expressed genes.
the dynamics of the expression of the main flowering regulators was consistent with previous reports: notably, the expression of flowering locus c  decreased over the course of the time series while expression of leafy  increased.
despite extensive studies of specific genes that regulate this process, the global changes in transcript expression profiles at the point when a vegetative meristem transitions into an inflorescence have not been reported.
gene ontology  enrichment analysis of these genes identified an overrepresentation of genes related to the cell cycle.

floral transition is a critical event in the life cycle of a flowering plant as it determines its reproductive success.
we analyzed gene expression during arabidopsis thaliana meristem development under long day conditions from day  <dig> to  <dig> after germination in one-day increments.
