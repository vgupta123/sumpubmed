a novel approach for quantifying in situ hybridization patterns  across the cerebral wall was developed that allowed the hierarchical clustering of genes into putative co-regulated groups.
in these neurons  <dig> genes were expressed ≥ 3-fold, and  <dig> genes ≤ 3-fold, compared to the reference population of neuronal precursors.
to identify genes selectively expressed by the eomes +  lineage of excitatory cortical neurons, gfp-expressing cells from tg gsat embryos were isolated to > 99% purity and profiled.
cortical neurons display dynamic patterns of gene expression during the coincident processes of differentiation and migration through the developing cerebrum.
forty four candidate genes were identified that show spatial expression with intermediate precursor cells,  <dig> candidate genes show spatial expression with multipolar neurons, while the remaining  <dig> genes achieved peak expression in the developing cortical plate.
this analysis of differentiating excitatory neurons revealed the expression patterns of  <dig> transcription factors, many chemotropic signaling molecules , and unexpected evidence for non-canonical neurotransmitter signaling and changes in mechanisms of glucose metabolism.
we report the identification, validation and spatial grouping of genes selectively expressed within the eomes + cortical excitatory neuron lineage during early cortical development.
of the up-regulated genes,  <dig> were represented at the genepaint in situ hybridization database and  <dig>  were validated as having spatial expression patterns consistent with the lineage of differentiating excitatory neurons.
