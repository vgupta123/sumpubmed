we developed an assay based on imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent reporter cells that overcomes the challenges inherent in studying lag phase.
the observed exponential increase in enzymes for the specific carbon source followed by an abrupt switch to production of general growth genes is a solution of an optimal control model, known as bang-bang control.
we distinguish between lag <dig> phase- in which there is no biomass growth, and lag <dig> phase- in which there is biomass growth but no cell division.
however, lag phase has important implications for bacterial infections and food safety.
lag phase is a period of time with no growth that occurs when stationary phase bacteria are transferred to a fresh medium.
we find that in lag <dig> phase, most promoters are not active, except for the enzymes that utilize the specific carbon source in the medium.
when cells enter lag <dig> and begin to grow in size, they switch to a full growth program of promoter activity including ribosomal and metabolic genes.
as a consequence, it has not been studied as thoroughly as other bacterial growth phases.
the present approach contributes to the understanding of lag phase, the least studied of bacterial growth phases.
