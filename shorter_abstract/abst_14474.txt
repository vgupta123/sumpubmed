the change in troponin t , a pivotal protein in the assembly of skeletal muscles sarcomeres and a modulator of calcium driven muscle contraction, during flatfish metamophosis is studied.
flatfish metamorphosis is a thyroid hormone  driven process which leads to a dramatic change from a symmetrical larva to an asymmetrical juvenile.
prior to and after metamorphosis no change in the dorso-ventral symmetry or temporal-spatial expression pattern of tnt genes and muscle fibre organization occurred in halibut musculature.
in the present study five cdnas for halibut tnt genes were cloned; three were splice variants arising from a single fast tnt  gene; a fourth encoded a novel teleost specific ftnt-like cdna  expressed exclusively in slow muscle and the fifth encoded the teleost specific stnt <dig>  ths modified the expression of halibut ftnt isoforms which changed from predominantly basic to acidic isoforms during natural and t <dig> induced metamorphosis.
in contrast, expression of red muscle specific genes, aftnt and stnt <dig>  did not change during natural metamorphosis or after t <dig> treatment.
