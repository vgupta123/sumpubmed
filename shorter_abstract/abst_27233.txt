phylogenomics analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a clear distinction between the clinical and environmental isolates.
we have performed a comparative genomics analysis of clinical and environmental strains of v. parahaemolyticus.
our analyses could facilitate understanding of the phylogenetic diversity and niche adaptation of this bacterium.
a new gene cluster belonging to the biofilm associated proteins of v. parahaemolyticus was found in clincial strains.
genome sequences of a few clinical isolates of v. parahaemolyticus are currently available, but the genome dynamics across the species and virulence potential of environmental strains on a genome-scale have not been described before.
here we present genome sequences of four v. parahaemolyticus clinical strains from stool samples of patients and five environmental strains in hong kong.
a few environmental strains were found harboring virulence genes and prophage elements, indicating their virulence potential.
a database for v. parahaemolyticus  was constructed here as a platform to access and analyze genome sequences and annotations of the bacterium.
a unique biphenyl degradation pathway was also reported.
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a gram-negative halophilic bacterium.
