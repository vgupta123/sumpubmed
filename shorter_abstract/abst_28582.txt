moreover, in whole blood the half-life of dmf was dramatically reduced as compared to serum.
the concentrations of mmf and mef in serum and whole blood decreased with increasing time.
additional experiments with purified blood cell fractions resuspended in phosphate buffered saline  revealed that at concentrations present in whole blood monocytes/lymphocytes, but not granulocytes and erythrocytes, effectively hydrolyzed dmf to mmf.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the hydrolysis of dmf to mmf and the stability of mmf, dmf and mef at in vitro conditions representing different body compartments.
these data explain the observation that after oral fae intake mmf and mef, but not dmf, can be readily detected in the circulation of human healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients.
together, these in vitro data indicate that hydrolysis of dmf to mmf rapidly occurs at ph  <dig>  resembling that within the small intestines, but not at ph  <dig> resembling the ph in the stomach.
these data indicate that the majority of the fae in the circulation are metabolized by one or more types of blood cells.
psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can be successfully treated with a mixture of fumaric acid esters  formulated as enteric-coated tablets for oral use.
