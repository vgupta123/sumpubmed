the approach described here is based on a modular out-of-core strategy that uses secondary storage to avoid reaching memory limits during the identification of high-scoring segment pairs  between the sequences under comparison.
the tests demonstrated that our solution is capable of generating high quality results with a linear-time response and controlled memory consumption, being comparable or faster than the current state-of-the-art methods.
software engineering concepts were applied to avoid intermediate result re-calculation, to minimise the performance impact of input/output  operations and to modularise the process, thus enhancing application flexibility and extendibility.
our computationally-efficient approach allows tasks such as the massive comparison of complete genomes, evolutionary event detection, the identification of conserved synteny blocks and inter-genome distance calculations to be performed more effectively.
we have developed c libraries for pairwise sequence comparison within diverse architectures, ranging from commodity systems to high performance and cloud computing environments.
we have addressed the problem of pairwise and all-versus-all comparison of large sequences in general, greatly increasing the limits on input data size.
