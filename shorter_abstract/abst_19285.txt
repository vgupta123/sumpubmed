the m-like protein, also known as szp, is expressed on the surface of streptococcus equi subsp.
we employed a random 12-peptide phage display library for screening of immunodominant mimics of the szp, which were recognized by an anti-szp specific monoclonal antibody .
previous studies demonstrated that szp is similar to m protein of group a streptococcus in the structure and characteristics of antiphagocytosis.
the m protein is an adhesin that can bind to the host cells, however it is not known whether the szp of s. zooepidemicus also functions as an adhesin.
furthermore, the adherence of s. zooepidemicus to hep- <dig> cells was inhibited by anti-rszp antibodies in a dose-dependent manner.
the gene encoding szp was expressed in e. coli, and the purified recombinant szp  was recognized by rabbit anti-s. zooepidemicus antibodies using immunoblot.
collectively, our findings suggest that the motif xslsrx may represent an immunodominant mimic epitope of the szp of s. zooepidemicus strain atcc  <dig>  and that the same epitope may be used to mediate szp binding to hep- <dig> cells.
the motif xslsrx was highly conserved among six of the ten clones.
