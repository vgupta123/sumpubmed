mutations in col4a <dig> derived from the vascular component were sufficient to cause defects in vascular development and the bgb.
mutation in basement membrane components results in an abnormal alveolar phenotype; however, the specific role of type iv collagen in regulating alveologenesis remains unknown.
lastly, we revealed that addition of type iv collagen protein induced myofibroblast proliferation and migration in monolayer culture and increased the formation of mesenchymal–epithelial septal-like structures in co-culture.
we have performed a microarray expression analysis in late chick lung development and found that col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> were among the most significantly upregulated genes during the formation of the avian bgb.
type iv collagen is the main component of the basement membrane that gives strength to the blood–gas barrier .

our study showed that type iv collagen and, therefore the basement membrane, play fundamental roles in coordinating alveolar morphogenesis.
in addition to its role in the formation of epithelium and vasculature, type iv collagen appears to be key for alveolar myofibroblast development by inducing their proliferation, differentiation and migration throughout the developing septum.
we also show that col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutants displayed disrupted myofibroblast proliferation, differentiation and migration.
