in addition to the high level expression that can render antigen presenting cells tolerogenic, there may be a role for lower level expression and activity of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> in response to tlr signalling during an immune response to bacterial infection.
ligation of lilrb <dig> throughout in vitro culture of dendritic cells led to an upregulation of the co-stimulatory protein cd <dig>  alterations in the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> by lilrb4-ligated macrophages were also observed.
our results indicate that the inhibitory effects of lilrb <dig> do not result from a failure to upregulate co-stimulatory proteins.
we studied the effects of lilrb <dig> ligation on antigen presenting cell phenotype, and the expression of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> on salmonella-infected antigen presenting cells.
infection with salmonella typhimurium or tlr stimulation with salmonella components led to an upregulation of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig>
high-level expression of the receptors lilrb <dig>  and lilrb <dig>  is a feature of tolerogenic antigen presenting cells and has been observed in cancer and transplant situations.
leukocyte ig-like receptors  are a family of innate immune receptors with immunomodulatory functions.
