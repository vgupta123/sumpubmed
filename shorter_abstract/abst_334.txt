its unique structure appears to be due to the cumulative effect of multiple key amino acid changes in its sequence during evolution, leading to perturbation of stable dimer and tetramer formation.
fluorescence anisotropy studies demonstrated that ssbba bound ssdna with high affinity comparable to other prokaryotic ssbs.
ssbba retained its ability to bind ssdna with very high affinity, comparable to ssb proteins which are tetrameric.
fret analysis of oligo <dig> binding suggested that ssbba forms a tetrameric assembly upon ssdna binding.
in the absence of dna, at concentrations ≤ <dig> μg/ml, ssbba did not form a stable tetramer and appeared to resemble bacteriophage t <dig> gene  <dig> protein.
ssb works in concert with a variety of dna metabolizing enzymes such as dna polymerase.
unlike other prokaryotic ssb proteins, ssbba from bacillus anthracis appeared to be monomeric at concentrations ≤ <dig> μg/ml as determined by se-hplc.
single-stranded dna binding proteins  are essential for dna replication, repair, and recombination in all organisms.
the structural features of ssbba could promote facile assembly and disassembly of the protein-dna complex required in processes such as dna replication.
