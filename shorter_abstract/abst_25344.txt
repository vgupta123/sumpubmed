although fibin displays all features of a secretory protein, it is mostly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when heterologously expressed.
fibin was initially discovered as a secreted signal molecule essential for pectoral fin bud initiation in zebrafish.
fibin is expressed in cerebellum, skeletal muscle and many other embryonic and adult mouse tissues suggesting not only a role during embryonic development but also in adult functions.
a  <dig> -kbp genomic sequence fragment upstream of the coding sequence is sufficient to drive and regulate fibin expression through stimulation by glucocorticoids, activators of the protein kinase c signalling pathways and manganese ions.
however, proper secretion presumably requires an unknown covalently-linked or associated co-factor.
currently, there is little information about the molecular architecture and biological relevance of fibin in humans and other mammals.
fibin is an evolutionarily conserved protein, carries a cleavable signal peptide  and is glycosylated at asn <dig>  the two conserved cysteines participate in intermolecular disulfide bond and multimer formation.
