in order to develop a comparative genomics platform focused in fungal pcwdes and provide a resource for evolutionary studies, fungal pcwde database  is constructed .
in order to archive fungal pcwdes,  <dig> sequence profiles were constructed and searched on  <dig> genomes of fungi, oomycetes, plants and animals.
evolutionary analysis of pgs in  <dig> selected genomes revealed that gene duplication and loss events were mainly driven by taxonomic divergence and partly contributed by those events in species-level, especially in plant pathogens.
plant cell wall-degrading enzymes  play significant roles throughout the fungal life including acquisition of nutrients and decomposition of plant cell walls.
the fpdb would provide a fungi-specialized genomics platform, a resource for evolutionary studies of pcwde gene families and extended analysis option by implementing favorite, which is a data exchange and analysis hub built in comparative fungal genomics platform .
genes known to be involved in fungal pathogenicity, including polygalacturonase  and pectin lyase, were enriched in plant pathogens.
furthermore, crop pathogens had more pcwdes than those of rot fungi, implying that the pcwdes analysed in this study are more needed for invading plant hosts than wood-decaying processes.
a total of  <dig>  putative genes encoding pcwdes were predicted, showing differential distribution by their life styles, host ranges and taxonomy.
