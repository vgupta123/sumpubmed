we analyzed gene expression with microarrays in baboon aortas, and found that members of the hox gene family exhibited spatial expression differences.
western blot analysis from  <dig> human aortas demonstrated significantly higher hoxa <dig> protein levels in thoracic compared to abdominal tissues .
our results demonstrated spatial variation in expression of hoxa <dig> in human aortas that persisted into adulthood and that downregulation of hoxa <dig> expression was associated with aaas, an important aortic disease of the ageing population.
hoxa <dig> was chosen for further study, since it had decreased expression in the abdominal compared to the thoracic aorta.
allograft studies exchanging thoracic and abdominal segments showed that regional susceptibility is maintained regardless of location, suggesting substantial roles for embryological origin, tissue composition and site-specific gene expression.
the hoxa <dig> transcript levels were significantly decreased in human abdominal aortic aneurysms  compared to age-matched non-aneurysmal controls .
