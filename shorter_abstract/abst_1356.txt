intriguingly, the dna-binding specificity of p <dig> family members was highly conserved even for evolutionarily distant species.
additionally, dna recognition was only weakly affected by cpg methylation.
in this study, the molecular basis of the functional divergence of related transcription factors was investigated.
despite structural differences in the oligomerisation domain, the dissociation constants of the tetramers was in the low nanomolar range for all family members, indicating that the strength of tetramerisation was evolutionarily conserved.
members of the p <dig> family, which play key roles in cell-cycle control and development, share conserved dna binding and oligomerisation domains but exhibit distinct functions.
hence, additional specificity factors must exist, which allowed the acquisition of novel functions during evolution while preserving original roles.
we characterised the dna-binding specificity and oligomerisation properties of human p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  as well as p <dig> from other organisms using novel biophysical approaches.
however, small differences in the oligomerisation properties were observed, which may play a regulatory role.
transcription factors activate their target genes by binding to specific response elements.
