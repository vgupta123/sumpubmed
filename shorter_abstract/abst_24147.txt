extending previous in silico heuristics for the analysis of gene co-evolution, we analyzed the function of genes clustering with dnae and polc.
bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of dna replication encode two dna polymerases iii, dnae and polc, rather than a single one.
it is also connected to the energy-saving enzyme necessary for rna degradation, polynucleotide phosphorylase.
in contrast, polc co-evolves with rna degradation enzymes that are present only in the a+t-rich firmicutes clade, suggesting at least two origins for the degradosome.
in contrast polc co-evolves with a set of rna degradation enzymes that does not derive from the degradosome identified in gamma-proteobacteria.
this suggests that at least two independent rna degradation pathways existed in the progenote community at the end of the rna genome world.
dnae co-evolves with the ribosome, the transcription machinery, the core of intermediary metabolism enzymes.
dnae co-evolves with the core functions of bacterial life.
