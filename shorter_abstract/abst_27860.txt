this study identifies slpa as a two-domain protein in which the order of the functional domains is reversed compared to other characterized lactobacillus s-layer proteins, and emphasizes the diversity of potential cell wall receptors despite similar carbohydrate binding sequence motifs in lactobacillus s-layer proteins.
this protein is completely unrelated in sequence to the previously characterized s-layer proteins of lactobacillus acidophilus group.
by producing a set of c-terminally truncated recombinant slpa  proteins the cell wall binding region was mapped to the n-terminal part of slpa, where the first  <dig> amino acids of mature slpa alone were sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  the binding of full length rslpa to the cell walls was not affected by the treatment of the walls with 5% trichloroacetic acid , indicating that cell wall structures other than teichoic acids are involved, a feature not shared by the lactobacillus acidophilus group s-layer proteins characterized so far.
conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were identified in the positively charged n-terminal regions of six lactobacillus brevis s-layer proteins.
in this work, the self-assembly and cell wall binding domains of slpa were characterized.
the c-terminal self-assembly domain encompassed residues 179â€“ <dig> of mature slpa, as demonstrated by the ability of n-terminally truncated recombinant slpa to form a periodic structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length slpa.
