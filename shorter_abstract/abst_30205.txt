however, very little is known about the structure and extent of the heritable epigenetic variation and its influence on local adaptation in natural populations.
the structure and extent of the heritable methylation-based epigenetic variation were assessed within and among natural populations of triticum turgidum ssp.
in order to ensure the assessment of heritable epigenetic variation, all accessions were grown under common garden conditions for two generations.
we used methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism  and transposon methylation display  techniques, to assess the methylation status of random genomic ccgg sites and ccgg sites flanking transposable elements , respectively.

the genetic structure and differentiation of wild emmer wheat suggests that genetic diversity is eco-geographically structured.
our data indicate that methylation-based epigenetic diversity might be eco-geographically structured and might be partly determined by climatic and edaphic factors.
in all accessions, the difference in methylation levels of ccgg sites, including ccgg sites that flanked tes, were not statistically significant and relatively high, ranging between  <dig> and 76 %.
in this study, we have observed population-unique heritable methylation patterns in emmer wheat accessions originating from five geographically isolated regions.
