through a comparative analysis on a variety of datasets, a more comprehensive view of the underlying mechanism or structure can be obtained.
we find that the use of the probe set matching table for comparative analysis provided by affymetrix produces better results than matching by unigene or locuslink identifiers but still remains inadequate.
as a generic method for improving comparability, we select a subset of probes with overlapping sequence segments in the two array types and recalculate expression values based only on the selected probes.
however, as we discover in this work, continual changes in genomic sequence annotations and probe design criteria make it difficult to compare gene expression data even from different generations of the same microarray platform.
with a careful filtering of the probes based on their sequence overlaps, data from different generations of microarrays can be combined more effectively.
we first describe the extent of discordance between the results derived from two generations of affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, as revealed in cluster analysis and in identification of differentially expressed genes.
rescaling of expression values for each gene across samples and data filtering by expression values enhance comparability but only for few specific analyses.
compatibility between high-density oligonucleotide arrays is significantly affected by probe-level sequence information.
we show that this filtering of probes significantly improves the comparability while retaining a sufficient number of probe sets for further analysis.
