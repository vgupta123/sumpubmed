metabolite 'structures' harvested from publicly accessible databases were converted into a common format to generate a comprehensive archive in mzeddb.
this report describes an annotation strategy that will allow searching based on all potential ionisation products predicted to form during electrospray ionisation .
we demonstrate that data matrices representing populations of ionisation products generated from different biological matrices contain a large proportion  of molecular isotopes, salt adducts and neutral loss fragments.
in reality the annotation process is confounded by the fact that many ionisation products will be not only molecular isotopes but also salt/solvent adducts and neutral loss fragments of original metabolites.
correlation analysis of esi-ms data features confirmed the predicted relationships of m/z signals.
'rules' were derived from chemical information that allowed mzeddb to generate a list of adducts and neutral loss fragments putatively able to form for each structure and calculate, on the fly, the exact molecular weight of every potential ionisation product to provide targets for annotation searches based on accurate mass.
we conclude that although ultra-high accurate mass instruments provide major insight into the chemical diversity of biological extracts, the facile annotation of a large proportion of signals is not possible by simple, automated query of current databases using computed molecular formulae.
parameterising mzeddb to take into account predicted ionisation behaviour and the biological source of any sample improves greatly both the frequency and accuracy of potential annotation 'hits' in esi-ms data.
