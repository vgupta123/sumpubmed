five traits including plant height , branch number , biomass yield per plant , harvest index  and seed yield per plant , were phenotyped in four environments.
the results from this association mapping study can contribute to a better understanding of natural variations of hi, and facilitate marker-based breeding for hi.
model comparisons revealed that the a–d test  could perfectly balance false positives and statistical power for hi and associated traits.
harvest index , the ratio of grain yield to total biomass, is considered as a measure of biological success in partitioning assimilated photosynthate to the harvestable product.
our results showed that hi is a complex polygenic phenomenon that is strongly influenced by both environmental and genotype factors.
the implications of these results are that hi can be increased by decreasing ph or reducing inefficient transport from pods to seeds in rapeseed.
these nine snps explained  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in hi.
