comparing related structures and viewing the structures in the context of sequence alignments are important tasks in protein structure-function research.
while many programs exist for individual aspects of such work, there is a need for interactive visualization tools that:  provide a deep integration of sequence and structure, far beyond mapping where a sequence region falls in the structure and vice versa;  facilitate changing data of one type based on the other ;  can be used with a researcher's own data, including arbitrary sequence alignments and annotations, closely or distantly related sets of proteins, etc.
another tool constructs structure-based sequence alignments from superpositions of two or more proteins.
a novel method is provided to superimpose structures in the absence of a pre-existing sequence alignment.
the method uses both sequence and secondary structure, and can match even structures with very low sequence identity.
ucsf chimera is free for non-commercial use and is available for microsoft windows, apple mac os x, linux, and other platforms from .
chimera includes complete documentation and is intended for use by a wide range of scientists, not just those in the computational disciplines.
the tools described here apply to many problems involving comparison and analysis of protein structures and their sequences.
