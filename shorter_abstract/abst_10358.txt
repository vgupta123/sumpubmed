we previously reported that an eb <dig> deletion mutant that retains both of these interactions but does not directly associate with microtubules  spontaneously formed perinuclear aggregates when expressed in cos- <dig> cells.
in the present study live imaging indicated that eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates underwent dynamic microtubule-dependent changes in morphology and appeared to be internally cohesive.
furthermore, evidence for p150glued degradation was found in the insoluble fraction of eb1-Δn2-gfp transfected cultures.
eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates were phase-dense structures that displayed microtubule-dependent accumulation around the centrosome, were immunoreactive for both the 20s subunit of the proteasome and ubiquitin, and induced the collapse of the vimentin cytoskeleton.
this supports the idea that the trapping and degradation of co-aggregated proteins might contribute to human pathologies characterised by aggresome formation.
