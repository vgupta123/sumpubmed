members of tribe anthemideae evolved functional variants of the polymerase iii promoter in which a residing c-box element differs from the canonical angiosperm motif by as much as 30%.
in plants, the 5 s rrna genes usually occur as separate tandems  or, less commonly, linked to 35 s rdna units .
the linked genes dominate 5 s rdna expression while the separate tandems do not seem to be expressed.
we studied the homogeneity and expression of 5 s genes in several species from family asteraceae known to contain linked 35 s-5 s units.
fish revealed the close association of 35 s-5 s arrays with nucleolar periphery indicating that transcription of 5 s genes may occur in this territory.
we show that the unusual linked arrangement of 5 s genes, occurring in several plant species, is fully compatible with their expression and functionality.
fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to reveal the sub-nuclear positions of rdna arrays.
two species contained major l-type and minor s-type units .
