in addition to  <dig> inactive variants with amino acid changes within the previously known, strictly conserved wwdyg motif of n-oligosaccharyltransferases,  <dig> inactivating mutations mapped to a flexible loop in close vicinity of the amide nitrogen atom of the acceptor asparagine as revealed in the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme c. lari pglb.
this study provides novel structure-function relationships for the periplasmic domain of the campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and describes procedures for generating and screening oligosaccharyltransferase mutant libraries in an engineered e. coli system.
protein glycosylation is of fundamental importance in many biological systems.
a particularly promising application for protein glycosylation in recombinant bacteria is the production of potent conjugate vaccines where polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria are covalently bound to immunogenic carrier proteins.
we investigated which amino acids of the periplasmic domain of pglb are crucial for the glycosylation reaction using a newly established 96-well screening system enabling the relative quantification of glycoproteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
in addition, we investigated functional requirements in the so-called miv motif of bacterial n-oligosaccharyltransferases.
the discovery of n-glycosylation in bacteria and the functional expression of the n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enabled the production of engineered glycoproteins and the study of the underlying molecular mechanisms.
amino acid residues i <dig> and v <dig>  which had been postulated to interact with the acceptor peptide, were subjected to cassette saturation mutagenesis.
a random mutant library was generated by error-prone pcr and screened for inactivating amino acid substitutions.
with the exception of i571c only hydrophobic residues were found in active variants.
