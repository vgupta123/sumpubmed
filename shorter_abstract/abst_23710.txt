caps <dig> proteins were mostly recovered in soluble fractions, but some were present in membrane fractions, except for caps2c and 2f, both of which lack the ph domain, suggesting that the ph domain is important for membrane association.
in contrast to caps2a and 2b, caps2c showed slightly decreased bdnf-releasing activity, which is likely due to the c-terminal truncation of the ph domain in caps2c.
in the brain, all isoforms showed predominant expression patterns in the cerebellum.
in the developing cerebellum, caps2b showed an up-regulated expression pattern, whereas the other isoforms exhibited transiently peaked expression patterns.
these results demonstrate that the splicing variations correlate with their expression patterns and intracellular distribution, and affect bdnf release; however, whether or not the short forms possess activities other than bdnf release, for example as natural dominant-negative isoforms, remains to be determined.
in this study, we defined  <dig> exons in the mouse caps <dig> gene and identified six alternative splicing variants, caps2a-f. caps2a is an isoform lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode part of the munc13-1-homologous domain .
on the other hand, a mouse counterpart of caps2Î”exon <dig> was not detected in the mouse tissues tested.
