together, this indicates that circulating anti-neutrophil autoreactive b cells are present in anca+ vasculitis patients, and they are capable of producing antibodies in response to cpg stimulation.
circulating anca autoreactive b cells are present in patients with anca+ vasculitis.
as bacterial dna is known to induce b cell proliferation and antibody production via tlr- <dig> stimulation, we have explored the possibility that unmethylated cpg oligodeoxynucleotide, as found in bacterial and viral dna, may play a role in stimulating circulating autoreactive b cells to produce anca in patients with vasculitis.
the production of anca from these cells in response to unmethylated cpg stimulation lead us to propose that stimulation of these cells by immunostimulatory dna sequences such as cpg oligodeoxynucleotide during infection may provide a link between infection and anca associated vasculitis.
we have confirmed that unmethylated cpg oligonucleotide is a potent stimulator of antibody production by pbmc in vitro.
furthermore, we were able to detect circulating mpo-reactive b cells by elispot assay from the peripheral blood of  <dig> mpo+ anca vasculitis patients.
of note, cpg also induced the production of the relevant autoantibodies in patients with other types of autoimmune diseases.
this phenomenon may also apply to other antibody mediated autoimmune diseases.
the depletion of circulating b cells with monoclonal antibody therapy can induce remission, and this observation suggests a pathogenic role for b cells in this disease.
the stimulation of pbmc with cpg oligonucleutides resulted in the production of similar amounts of igg in both anca+ patients and normal controls.
in spite of this, pr <dig> anca+ patients synthesised significantly higher amount of igg anca than normal controls.
