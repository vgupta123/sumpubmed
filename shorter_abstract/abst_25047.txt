proteins containing a domain from this family can be found in most bacteroides species and, in large numbers, in all human gut microbiome samples.
the main difference between the two is that the two domains in the bvu_ <dig> protein are connected by a short linker, as opposed to a longer insertion made of  <dig> helices placed linearly along with a strand that is added to the c-terminal domain in the bf <dig> protein.
the structures of c-terminal domains of both proteins, corresponding to the pf <dig>  domain in bvu_ <dig> protein and an unclassified domain in the bf <dig> protein, show significant structural similarity to bacterial pore-forming toxins.
the same helix also points to the groove between the n- and c-terminal domains that are loosely held together by hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions.
in particular the n-terminal domain could be involved in adhesive interactions, the c-terminal domain and the inter-domain groove in lipid or carbohydrate interactions.
a helix in this domain is in an analogous position to a loop connecting the second and third strands in the toxin structures, where this loop is implicated to play a role in the toxin insertion into the host cell membrane.
n-terminal domains of bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins from bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides fragilis respectively are members of the pfam family pf <dig> .
the n-terminal domain in both proteins, corresponding to the pf <dig>  domain is a β–sandwich with pre-albumin-like fold, found in many proteins belonging to the transthyretin clan of pfam.
crystal structures of both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins, solved at the jcsg center, show strikingly similar three-dimensional structures.
