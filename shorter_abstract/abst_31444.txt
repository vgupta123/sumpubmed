a major reason for this difficulty is that a single gene is involved in multiple pathways.
our method ranked truly relevant pathways significantly higher than existing pathway analysis tools in experiments with two data sets.
contexttrap will be a useful tool for the pathway based analysis of gene expression data since the user can specify the context of the biological experiment in a set of keywords.
we realized this concept as an algorithm by introducing context score and impact score and then combining the two into a single score.
the primary goal of pathway analysis using transcriptome data is to find significantly perturbed pathways.
however, pathway analysis is not always successful in identifying pathways that are truly relevant to the context under study.
this complex relationship often makes the pathway analysis very difficult.
while we need much more powerful pathway analysis methods, a readily available alternative way is to incorporate the literature information.
in this study, we propose a novel approach for prioritizing pathways by combining results from both pathway analysis tools and literature information.
however, if there are few or no articles reported, then we should rely on the results from the pathway analysis tools, which is termed as significance in this paper.
