the dbi and acl of total lipids did not change during low-temperature treatment.
using esi-ms/ms-based lipidomic analysis, we compared the glycerolipidome of chilling -treated rice with that of freezing -treated arabidopsis, both immediately after these low-temperature treatments and after a subsequent recovery culture period.
marked phospholipid degradation occurred during the recovery culture period of non-lethal chilling treated rice, but did not occur in non-lethal freezing treated arabidopsis.
the ability to synthesize glycerolipids containing a larger head group may correlate with low-temperature tolerance.
however, little is known about the differences in glycerolipid response to low temperatures between chilling-sensitive and freezing-tolerant plants.
a higher dbi and a lower acl could make the membranes of arabidopsis more fluid at low temperatures.
the low-temperature-induced increase of pa may play a dual role in plant responses to low temperatures: as a lipid signal that initiates tolerance responses, and as a structural molecule that, on extensive in large accumulation, could damage the integrity of membranes.
glycerolipids with larger head groups were synthesized more in arabidopsis than in rice at sub-lethal low-temperatures.
levels of phosphatidic acid  and phosphatidylinositol  rose in both plants after low-temperature treatment.
arabidopsis is a 16: <dig> plant that harbours both eukaryotic and prokaryotic-type lipid synthesis pathways, while rice is an 18: <dig> plant that harbours only the eukaryotic lipid synthesis pathway.
glycerolipids are the principal constituent of cellular membranes; remodelling of glycerolipids plays important roles in temperature adaptation in plants.
temperate plants can endure freezing stress, but even chilling at above-zero temperatures can induce death in tropical species.
