whole blood samples were collected from  <dig> clinically healthy dogs .
to evaluate the efficiency of platelet-rich plasma preparations by means of a double centrifugation tube method to obtain platelet-rich canine plasma at a concentration at least  <dig> times higher than the baseline value and a concentration of white blood cells not exceeding twice the reference range.
platelet concentration and white blood cell count were determined in all samples.
platelet concentration at least  <dig> times higher than the baseline value and a white blood cell count not exceeding twice the reference range were obtained respectively in  <dig> cases out of  <dig>  and  <dig> cases out of  <dig> .
this double centrifugation tube method is a relatively simple and inexpensive method for obtaining platelet-rich canine plasma, potentially available for therapeutic use to improve the healing process.
blood was processed by a double centrifugation tube method to obtain platelet concentrates, which were then analyzed by a flow cytometry haematology system for haemogram.
