a westward coastal route to italy through greece could have led to gene flow along the northern mediterranean.
we found correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance.
also pca analysis shows that the breeds are well differentiated, with good correspondence to geographical locations, thus confirming the correlation between geographical and genetic distances.
our data point out that the use of snp markers to analyze a wider breed sample could help in understanding the recent evolutionary history of domestic goats.
the mantel test showed a strongly significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance.
this suggests that migration history of the species played a pivotal role in the present-day structure of the breeds and a scenario in which coastal routes were easier for migrating in comparison with inland routes.
also, pca analysis revealed that breeds are grouped according to geographical origin, with the exception of the greek skopelos breed.
