among these  <dig> cnvrs,  <dig> were specific to the high fertility group, while  <dig> cnvrs were specific to the low fertility group which overlap with  <dig> qtls of various reproductive traits.
the identified  <dig> cnvrs encompassed  <dig> genes, among them  <dig> were specific to the low fertility group, seven to the high fertility group, while three were found in regions that were present in both groups but with opposite gain/loss status.
a functional analysis of several databases revealed that the genes found in cnvrs from the low fertility group have been significantly enriched in members of the innate immune system, toll-like receptor and rig-i-like receptor signaling and fatty acid oxidation pathways.
we have demonstrated that our analysis pipeline could identify putative cnv markers of fertility, especially in case of low fertility boars.
animals from these two diverse phenotypes were genotyped with the porcine snp60k chip and compared by several approaches in order to prove the feasibility of our cnv analysis and to identify putative markers of fertility.
the fertility indicator was the calculated direct boar effect on litter size  that was obtained as a by-product of the national genetic evaluation for litter size .
in this study we applied the extreme groups/selective genotyping approach for identifying copy number variations in high and low fertility breeding boars.
the two groups of animals had dbe values at the upper  and lower  end of the distribution from a population of more than  <dig>  boars.
we have identified  <dig> cnvrs covering  <dig>  mb or ~ <dig> % of the porcine genome.
