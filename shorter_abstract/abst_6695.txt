so far, curated benchmark data exists only for peptide identification algorithms but no data that represents a ground truth for the evaluation of feature detection, alignment and filtering algorithms.
we present lc-mssim, a simulation software for lc-esi-ms experiments.
our software also offers the possibility to add contaminants, to change the background noise level and includes a model for the detectability of peptides in mass spectra.
the software creates an lc-ms data set using a predictor for the retention time of the peptides and a model for peak shapes and elution profiles of the mass spectral peaks.
lc-mssim generates simulated lc-ms data sets and incorporates models for peak shapes and contaminations.
it reads a list of proteins from a fasta file and digests the protein mixture using a user-defined enzyme.
algorithm developers can match the results of feature detection and alignment algorithms against the simulated ion lists and meaningful error rates can be computed.
the data resulting from an lc-ms experiment is huge, highly complex and noisy.
in a quantitative label-free mass spectrometry experiment, crucial steps are the detection of peptide features in the mass spectra and the alignment of samples by correcting for shifts in retention time.
mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography  is commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samples in large scale studies.
