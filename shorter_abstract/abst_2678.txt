seven of the eight barley mirna genes characterized in this study contain introns with their respective transcripts undergoing developmentally specific processing events prior to the dicing out of pre-mirna species from their pri-mirna precursors.
in spite of barley being a cereal of great economic importance, very little data is available concerning its mirna biogenesis.
in the present paper, we examine the biogenesis of selected barley mirnas and the developmental regulation of their pri-mirna processing to learn more about mirna maturation in barely.
two of the studied mirnas originate from one mir168a-5p/168a-3p gene.
we suggest that mir <dig>  located within the 3â€² utr of a protein-coding gene and described as a functional mirna in wheat, may represent a sirna generated from a mariner-like transposable element.
micrornas  regulate gene expression via mrna cleavage or translation inhibition.
however, no barley pri-mirna and mir gene structures have been shown experimentally.
mir397b-3p was detected in barley as a most probable functional mirna, in contrast to rice where it has been identified as a complementary partner mirna*.
in the case of mir168a-5p/168a-3p, we found the generation of stable, mature molecules from both pre-mirna arms, confirming evolutionary conservation of the stability of both species, as shown in rice and maize.
