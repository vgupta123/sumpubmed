the distribution and conservation of these five genes as well as their regulation of expression and the physico-chemical properties of the encoded proteins underline the likely great bandwidth of small protein functions in bacteria and makes them attractive candidates for functional studies.
photosynthetic cyanobacteria provide a paradigm for small protein functions due to extensive work on the photosynthetic apparatus that led to the functional characterization of  <dig> small proteins of less than  <dig> amino acids.
from these transcriptional units,  <dig> are shared between the two strains,  <dig> are shared with the higher plant arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> with e. coli.
upon activation of expression via the cu2+.responsive pete promoter or from the native promoters, all five proteins were detected in western blot experiments.
despite their versatile functions in multimeric protein complexes, in the modification of enzymatic activities, intercellular communication or regulatory processes, proteins shorter than  <dig> amino acids  are a systematically underestimated class of gene products in bacteria.
in analogy, previously unstudied small orfs with similar degrees of conservation might encode small proteins of high relevance also in other functional contexts.
