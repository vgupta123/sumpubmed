in silico functional analysis of the dems at ptds  <dig> and  <dig> indicated that the major functions of these enu-induced dems were associated with dna damage, dna repair, apoptosis and other processes related to carcinogenesis.
the mirna expression profiles were assessed in the mouse livers in a time-course design.
principal component analysis of the mirna expression profiles showed that mirna expression at post-treatment days   <dig> and  <dig> were different from those at the other time points and the control.
our results showed that many mirnas changed their expression to respond the exposure of the genotoxic carcinogen enu and the number and magnitude of the changes were highest at ptds  <dig> to  <dig>  thus, one to two weeks after the exposure is the best time for mirna expression sampling.
to explore the possible time-course changes of mirna expression induced by a carcinogen, we treated mice with one dose of  <dig> mg/kg n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea , a model genotoxic carcinogen, and vehicle control.
however, there is little information as to if or when expression changes of mirnas occur in normal tissues after carcinogen exposure.
