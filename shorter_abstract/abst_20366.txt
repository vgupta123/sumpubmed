the induction of pcv2-specific na and ifn-Î³-scs, and cd4+ cells by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine is the important protective immune response leading to reduction of the pcv <dig> viremia and control of the pcv <dig> infection.
lymphocyte subset analysis indicated that the numbers of cd3+ and cd4+ cells increased in vaccinated animals but the numbers of cd4+ cells decreased transiently in non-vaccinated animals.
the observation of a delayed type hypersensitivity response in only the vaccinated animals also supports a cd4+ cell-associated protective cellular immune response induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine.
to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of protective humoral and cellular immunity induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine and its effect on reduction of pcv <dig> viremia by vaccination.
the objective of the present study was to elucidate the humoral and cellular immune response mechanisms by which a reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine reduces the pcv <dig> viremia.
