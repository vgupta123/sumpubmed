here, a meta-analysis of drought related qtls in the bala Ã— azucena mapping population compiles data from  <dig> experiments and  <dig> independent screens providing  <dig>  individual qtls separated into  <dig> trait categories; drought avoidance, plant height, plant biomass, leaf morphology and root traits.
formal meta-analysis on chromosome  <dig>  where clusters of qtls for all trait categories appear close, established that the sd <dig> semi-dwarfing gene coincided with a plant height meta-qtl, that the drought avoidance meta-qtl was not likely to be associated with this gene, and that this meta-qtl was not pleiotropic with close meta-qtls for leaf morphology and root traits.
on chromosome  <dig>  evidence suggests that a drought avoidance meta-qtl was pleiotropic with leaf morphology and plant biomass meta-qtls, but not with meta-qtls for root traits and plant height  <dig> cm lower down.
it also provides relatively small target regions for the identification of positional candidate genes.
meta-analysis of qtls combines the results of several qtl detection studies and provides narrow confidence intervals for meta-qtls, permitting easier positional candidate gene identification.
a heat map of the overlapping  <dig> lod confidence intervals provides an overview of the distribution of qtls.
the confidence intervals for meta-qtls obtained ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  cm, which is approximately  <dig> genes in rice.
the heat map graphically illustrates the genetic complexity of drought related traits in rice.
