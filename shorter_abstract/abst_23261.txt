our modified lentiviral vector system resulted in tight and reversible knockdown of target gene expression in unsorted cell populations.
expression of shrnas from engineered human u <dig>  promoters containing a single tetracycline operator  sequence between the proximal sequence element  and the tata box, or an improved second-generation tet-responsive promoter element  placed upstream of the promoter was tight and reversible as judged using quantitative protein measurements.
we also established and tested a novel hu <dig> promoter system in which the distal sequence element  of the hu <dig> promoter was replaced with a second-generation tre.
tightly regulated target gene knockdown was observed with vectors containing either a single to sequence or a second-generation tre using carefully controlled transduction conditions.
in this system, positive regulation of shrna production is mediated by novel tet-dependent transactivators bearing transactivation domains derived from the human sp <dig> transcription factor.
we expect these vectors to ultimately find applications for tight and reversible rnai in mammalian cells in vivo.
with a view toward optimizing tet-regulated shrna expression in mammalian cells, we compared the capacity of a variety of hybrid pol iii promoters to express short shrnas in target cells following lentivirus-mediated delivery of shrna-encoding cassettes.
rna interference -mediated by the expression of short hairpin rnas  has emerged as a powerful experimental tool for reverse genetic studies in mammalian cells.
however, the usefulness of these approaches is often times limited, caused by inefficient delivery and/or expression of shrna-encoding sequences in target cells and/or poor design of shrnas sequences.
rnai-mediated knockdown of gene expression in target cells, controlled by a modified tet-repressor  in the presence of doxycycline  was robust.
