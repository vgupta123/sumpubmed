studying mitosis requires a system in which the dramatic movements of chromosomes and spindle microtubules can be visualized.
this approach will allow us to effectively probe mitotic defects from protein knockdowns by combining genomic information from other organisms with the tractable morphology of ptk cells.
knockdown of p-mcak by rnai caused defects in chromosome congression and defective spindle organization.
ptk cells, due to their flat morphology and their small number of large chromosomes, allow microscopic visualizations to be readily performed.
by performing rnai in ptk cells, we can explore the function of many proteins important for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation.
although it is difficult to transfect dna into ptk cells , we have transfected a fluorescent sirna at nearly 100% efficiency.
because it is laborious to isolate full-length clones, we explored using rt-pcr with degenerate primers to yield cdna fragments from ptk cells from which to design sirnas.
we isolated a cdna fragment of the mitotic kinesin eg <dig> from ptk cells.
a conserved  <dig> bp sirna was used for rnai in both hela and ptk cells in which eg <dig> knockdown resulted in an increased mitotic index and cells with monopolar spindles.
