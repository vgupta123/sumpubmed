based on observations of accelerated amino acid changes and frequent exchanges of the p <dig> domain, we propose that positive selection and subsequent frequent domain shuffling are two important mechanisms for generating new genotypes of hev-a.
our computer simulation demonstrated a significant excess of amino acid replacements in the vp <dig> region implying its possible role in adaptive evolution.
despite the importance of these epidemics, several aspects of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics, including viral nucleotide variations within and between different outbreaks, rates of change in immune-related structural regions vs. non-structural regions, and forces driving the evolution of ev <dig>  are still not clear.
in addition to simple recombinations, exchanges of the p <dig> domain between different species/genotypes of human enterovirus species -a were repeatedly observed.
between different epidemic seasons, we observed high viral diversity in the epidemic peaks followed by severe reductions in diversity.
viruses sampled in successive epidemic seasons were not sister to each other, indicating that the annual outbreaks of ev <dig> were due to genetically distinct lineages.
the phylogenies derived from different genomic segments revealed different relationships, indicating frequent sequence recombinations as previously noted.
