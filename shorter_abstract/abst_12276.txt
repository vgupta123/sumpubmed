internal standards such as reference genes are used to normalise mrna levels between different samples for an exact comparison of mrna transcription level.
the range of expression stability in the genes analysed was : actb/rpl <dig>  tbp, hprt, hmbs, ywhaz, sdha, b2m and gapdh.
expression stability varies greatly between genes.
based on both expression stability and expression level, our data suggest that actb and rpl <dig> are good reference genes for high abundant transcripts while tpb and hprt <dig> are good reference genes for low abundant transcripts in expression studies across different pig tissues.
real-time quantitative pcr  is a method for rapid and reliable quantification of mrna transcription.
selection of high quality reference genes is of crucial importance for the interpretation of data generated by real-time qpcr.
in this study nine commonly used reference genes were investigated in  <dig> different pig tissues using real-time qpcr with sybr green.
the stability of these reference genes in different pig tissues was investigated using the genorm application.
