in the hermaphrodite of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the first germ cells differentiate as sperm.
dead box proteins have been shown to be involved in the control of gene expression at different steps such as transcription and pre-mrna processing.
the function of some of these genes is germline specific while others also act in somatic tissues.
although it interacts genetically with genes of the germline sex determination machinery its primary function appears to be in oocyte differentiation rather than sex determination.
here we focus on the role of mel- <dig> in the hermaphrodite germ line.
the c. elegans gene mel- <dig> encodes a dead box protein that is required maternally for early embryogenesis and zygotically for postembryonic development.
we show that the caenorhabditis elegans gene mel- <dig>  encodes a dead box protein that is related to the mammalian ddx20/gemin3/dp <dig> genes.
this process requires the activity of a genetic regulatory network that includes among others the fem, fog and mog genes.
later the germ line switches to the production of oocytes.
the germ line of mutants shows variable defects in oogenesis.
in the germ line, it is required for proper oogenesis.
