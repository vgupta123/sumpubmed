comparative analyses using predicted proteomes from other prasinophytes reveal proteins likely related to scale formation and ancestral photosynthesis.
however, ccmp <dig>  polar micromonas ccmp <dig> and prasinophytes from other classes retain the entire pg pathway, like moss and glaucophyte algae.
our studies also indicate that peptidoglycan  biosynthesis enzymes have been lost in multiple independent events in select prasinophytes and plants.
our studies provide robust genomic resources for emerging model algae, advancing knowledge of marine phytoplankton and plant evolution.
surprisingly, multiple vascular plants also have the pg pathway, except the penicillin-binding protein, and share a unique bi-domain protein potentially associated with the pathway.
pg biosynthesis genes from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont that became the plastid, have been selectively retained in multiple plants and algae, implying a biological function.
