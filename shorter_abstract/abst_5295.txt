the comparison indicates that both approaches had good performance in modeling the gene regulatory networks.
in this paper, two important computational approaches for modeling gene regulatory networks, probabilistic boolean network methods and dynamic bayesian network methods, are compared using a biological time-series dataset from the drosophila interaction database to construct a drosophila gene network.
several computational approaches are available for modeling gene regulatory networks with different datasets.
in all tested cases, dbn identified more gene interactions and gave better recall than pbn.
the regulation of gene expression is achieved through gene regulatory networks  in which collections of genes interact with one another and other substances in a cell.
