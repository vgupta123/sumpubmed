here we present a new approach, fast-find , that uses a relational database to support rapid indexed searches for arbitrary combinations of patterns defined either by sequence or composition.
fast-find is easy to implement, takes less than a second to search the entire drosophila genome sequence for arbitrary patterns adjacent to sites of alternative polyadenylation, and is sufficiently fast to allow sensitivity analysis on the patterns.
we have applied this approach to identify transcripts that contain combinations of sequence motifs for rna-binding proteins that may regulate alternative polyadenylation.
fast-find provides an efficient way to identify transcripts that are potentially regulated via alternative polyadenylation.
