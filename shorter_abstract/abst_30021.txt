ps alone did not affect spine densities, but had a negative effect on the ratio of mushroom spines.
we show that rats exposed to ps and/or cms display changes in the morphology and number of basal spines on pyramidal neurons in the mpfc.
the observed changes may represent a morphological basis of ps- and cms-related disturbances, and future studies in the field should not only consider total spine densities, but also separate between different spine types.
cms had a negative effect on spine densities, particularly on spines of the mushroom type, which are considered to form stronger and more stable synapses than other spine types.
in addition, ps seemed to make rats less responsive to some of the negative effects of cms, which supports the notion that ps represents a predictive adaptive response.
