columnaris disease caused by flavobacterium columnare is a serious problem in aquaculture, annually causing large economic losses around the world.
our study with reproducible methodology and comparable results establishes a robust framework for the discrimination and phylogenetic analysis of f. columnare isolates, which will help to improve our understanding about geographic distribution and epidemiology of columnaris disease.
partial sequencing of six housekeeping genes  revealed eight sequence types and a moderate level of genetic diversity .
phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated protein-encoding gene sequence data  formed two lineages, which could be further divided into five clusters.
all analysed f. columnare strains appeared to have a genetic origin distinct from that of another important fish pathogen form the genus flavobacterium, f. psychrophilum.
we investigated the population structure and spatiotemporal changes in the genetic diversity of f. columnare population in finland by using a multilocus sequence typing  and analysis  based on dna sequence variation within six housekeeping genes.
the results suggest that finnish f. columnare strains have an epidemic population structure followed by clonal expansion of successful genotypes.
despite considerable research, the molecular epidemiology of f. columnare remains poorly understood.
a total of  <dig> strains of f. columnare were collected from eight different areas located across the country between  <dig> and  <dig>
