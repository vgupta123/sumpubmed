bayesian networks analysis was performed separately for either experimental model, with cross-system validation of the highest-ranking features.
we demonstrate conservation of two eigensystems, reflecting inflammation and/or apoptosis  and neuronal synaptic activity , between the stroke and seizures.
in this way, we correctly re-discovered the role of ap <dig> in the regulation of apoptosis, and the involvement of creb and egr in the regulation of synaptic activity-related genes.
our data also suggest that numerous enhancers of neuronal-specific genes are important for their responsiveness to the synaptic activity.
eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and neuronal synaptic activity, exerted by different transcription factors, on gene expression in rat brain.
we applied svd to time-series gene expression datasets from the rat experimental models of stroke and seizures.
it is often desirable to separate effects of different regulators on gene expression, or to identify effects of the same regulator across several systems.
we identified a novel antagonistic effect of the motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein satb <dig> on ap1-driven transcriptional activation, suggesting a link between chromatin loop structure and gene activation by ap <dig>  the effects of motifs binding satb <dig> and creb on gene expression in brain conform to the assumption of the linear response model of gene regulation.
we analyzed cis-regulation of gene expression in the subspaces of the conserved eigensystems.
