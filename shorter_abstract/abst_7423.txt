this conclusion lends further support from the observations of strong correlations between intergenic levels of diversity and diversity at synonymous as well as non-synonymous sites.
our results also demonstrate differences between the two domestic breeds and red jungle fowl, where the domestic breeds show a stronger relationship between intergenic diversity levels and diversity at synonymous and non-synonymous sites.
we found that recombination rate had the largest effect on local levels of nucleotide diversity.
the fact that divergence  and recombination rate were negatively correlated argues against a mutagenic role of recombination.
overall, our results are consistent with a selection model, in which regions within a short distance from loci under selection show reduced polymorphism levels.
understanding which factors shape levels of genetic diversity within genomes forms a central question in evolutionary genomics and is of importance for the possibility to infer episodes of adaptive evolution from signs of reduced diversity.
we used whole-genome re-sequencing data from domestic chicken  and its wild ancestor  to study the relationship between genetic diversity and several genomic parameters.
this finding, together with overall lower diversity levels in domesticates compared to red jungle fowl, seem attributable to artificial selection during domestication.
there is an on-going debate on the relative role of mutation and selection in governing diversity levels.
moreover, recombination might itself be mutagenic and thereby assert a direct effect on diversity levels.
