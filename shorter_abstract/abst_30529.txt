produced as scfv-fc in mammalian cells, these antibodies were further characterized and analysed for specificity and applicability in different tuberculosis antigen detection assays.
it was found that the conformation of  <dig> b, depending on sample treatment, influenced antigen detection.
the antigen  <dig> complex comprises a set of major secreted proteins of m. tuberculosis, which are potential biomarkers for diagnostic.
whereas detection of m. tuberculosis cell extracts and culture filtrates was only possible in direct elisa and immunoblot assays.
in this work, the first human single chain fragment variable  antibodies specific for the tuberculosis biomarker  <dig> b were selected by phage display from na√Øve antibody gene libraries .
recombinant antibodies, selected by phage display, may be applicable for  <dig> b detection in various assays.
using  <dig> b as a biomarker, the antigen conformation influenced by sample treatment is important.
sandwich detection of recombinant  <dig> b was successful in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay , lateral flow immunoassay and immunoblot.
