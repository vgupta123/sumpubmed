sds play an important role in genome plasticity by creating new genes and modeling genome structure.
segmental duplications  are blocks of genomic sequence of 1- <dig> kb that map to different loci in a genome and share a sequence identity > 90%.
we demonstrate that recent sds  are a relevant component of the grapevine genome .
we detected mitochondrial and plastid dna and genes  in segmentally duplicated regions of the nuclear genome.
further we showed that several duplicated genes take part in the biosynthesis of compounds involved in plant response to environmental stress.
in particular, the nine highest copy number genes have a copy in either or both organelle genomes.
this study represents a step forward in the full characterization of duplicated genes important for grapevine cultural needs and human health.
these data show the great influence of sds and organelle dna transfers in modeling the vitis vinifera nuclear dna structure as well as the impact of sds in contributing to the adaptive capacity of grapevine and the nutritional content of grape products through genome variation.
in this regard, we performed a genome-wide analysis of high-identity sds on the sequenced grapevine  genome .
although data is plentiful for mammals, not much was known about the representation of sds in plant genomes.
