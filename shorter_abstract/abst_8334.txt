microarrays provided expression profiles of  <dig> accessions in the metabolic pathway during three berry developmental stages in sauvignon blanc, whereas an optimised hplc analysis provided the concentrations of individual carotenoids.
similarly, orthologues of genes leading to the formation of strigolactone involved in shoot branching inhibition were identified: ccd <dig>  ccd <dig> and max <dig>  moreover, the isoforms typically have different expression patterns, confirming the complex regulation of the pathway.
of particular interest is the expression pattern of the three vvnceds: our results support previous findings that vvnced <dig> is likely the isoform linked to aba content in berries.
this provides evidence of the functioning of the lutein epoxide cycle and the respective genes in grapevine.
nine of the genes occur as single copies whereas the rest of the carotenoid metabolic genes have more than one paralogue.
comparative genomics was used to identify  <dig> genes putatively involved in carotenoid biosynthesis/catabolism in grapevine.
this work extends the previous reports of carotenoid gene expression and photosynthetic pigment analysis by providing an up-to-date pathway analysis and an important framework for the analysis of carotenoid metabolic pathways in grapevine.
the carotenoid metabolic pathway is well characterised, and the genes and enzymes have been studied in a number of plants.
this study represents an important reference study for further characterisation of carotenoid biosynthesis and catabolism in grapevine.
in plants the cleavage of carotenoids leads to the formation of the phytohormones abscisic acid and strigolactone, and c13-norisoprenoids involved in the characteristic flavour and aroma compounds in flowers and fruits and are of specific importance in the varietal character of grapes and wine.
