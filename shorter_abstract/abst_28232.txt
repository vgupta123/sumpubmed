in zebrafish, no genome duplication event after speciation was observed, suggesting that, compared to zebrafish, common carp had undergone an additional genome duplication event.
after assembling the  <dig> contigs and the published common carp sequences together, we obtained  <dig>  contigs and identified genes using homology searches and an ab initio method.
common carp  is thought to have undergone one extra round of genome duplication compared to zebrafish.
transcriptome analysis has been used to study the existence and timing of genome duplication in species for which genome sequences are incomplete.
we identified one round of genome duplication in common carp and estimated that it had occurred  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya.
the assembled contigs helped us to estimate the time of the fourth-round of genome duplication in common carp.
we identified  <dig>  orthologous pairs between common carp and zebrafish and found  <dig>  paralogous pairs within the common carp.
an estimation of the synonymous substitution rate in the orthologous pairs indicated that common carp and zebrafish diverged  <dig> million years ago .
we annotated the common carp contigs with gene ontology terms and kegg pathways.
large-scale transcriptome data for the common carp genome should help reveal the timing of the additional duplication event.
we have sequenced the transcriptome of common carp using  <dig> pyrosequencing.
compared with zebrafish gene annotations, we found that a set of biological processes and pathways were enriched in common carp.
