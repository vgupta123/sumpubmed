this system is composed of three successive partners: hybrid histidine-aspartate kinases , histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins , and response regulators .
we found that all b-type rrs are able to interact with hpt predominant partners  of hk <dig>  which is putatively involved in the osmosensing pathway.
on the whole, the five b-type rrs of interest could be third protagonists putatively involved in the osmosensing signaling pathway in populus.
based on the interaction studies between identified b-type rr and hpt proteins, and the co-expression analysis of transcripts of these potential partners in poplar organs, our results favor the model that rr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are able to interact with the main partners of hk <dig>  hpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and this hpt/rr interaction occurs within the nucleus.
in plants, the multistep phosphorelay signaling pathway mediates responses to environmental factors and plant hormones.
while interactions studies between partners belonging to the multistep phosphorelay system are mainly focused on protagonists involved in cytokinin or ethylene pathways, very few reports are available concerning partners of osmotic stress signaling pathway.
to assess hpt/b-type rr interactions and consequently determine potential third partners in the osmosensing multistep phosphorelay system, we performed global yeast two-hybrid  assays in combination with bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assays in plant cells.
hpt/rr interactions displayed a nuclear localization, while the nuclear and cytosolic localization of hpt and nuclear localization of rr proteins were validated.
although the nuclear localization of hpt/rr interaction was expected, this work constitutes the first evidence of such an interaction in plants.
among the third partners, b-type rr family members are the final output elements of the pathway; they act as transcription factors and clearly play a pivotal role in the early response to cytokinin in arabidopsis.
in populus, we identified eight b-type rr proteins, rr12- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the dorskamp genotype.
furthermore, the pertinence of this partnership is reinforced by highlighting a co-expression of b-type rr transcripts and the other partners  belonging to a potential osmosensing pathway.
