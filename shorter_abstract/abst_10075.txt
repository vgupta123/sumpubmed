we used a common microarray platform to measure gene expression in seven closely related species in the drosophila melanogaster subgroup, accounting for confounding effects of sequence divergence.
we consider the possibility that local regulation of expression in gene clusters may drive the connection between adaptive sequence and coordinated gene expression evolution.
this finding points to a tie between adaptive sequence evolution and evolution of the transcriptome.
for the co-expression clusters identified within this species, we find an under-representation of genes displaying a signature of recurrent adaptive amino acid evolution consistent with previous findings.
our results demonstrate that co-evolution of expression in gene clusters is relatively common among species in the d. melanogaster subgroup.
clusters where expression evolution of each gene is not independent of their neighbors are important units for understanding transcriptome evolution.
to summarize the correlation structure among genes in a chromosomal region, we analyzed the fraction of variation along the first principal component of the correlation matrix.
our analysis shows that relatively few of these clusters are near heterochromatin regions and that these clusters tend to be over-dispersed relative to the rest of the genome.
we also analyzed the pattern of co-expression among neighboring genes within a single drosophila species: d. simulans.
this organization of transcriptomes suggests that coordinated evolution of gene expression for clustered genes may also be common.
we analyzed the correlation for blocks of consecutive genes to assess patterns of correlation that may be manifest at different scales of coordinated expression.
