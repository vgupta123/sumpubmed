we also identify changes occurring during phenotypic transitions that affect other properties of phenotypic strain-variants, such as resistance to the impact of environmental stress.
saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from natural settings form structured biofilm colonies that are equipped with intricate protective mechanisms.
here, we show that domestication can be reversed when a domesticated strain is challenged by various adverse conditions; the resulting feral strain restores its ability to form structured biofilm colonies.
we specify the genetic determinants that are likely involved in the formation of a structured biofilm colonies.
the resulting domesticated strains switch off certain protective mechanisms and form smooth colonies that resemble those of common laboratory strains.
we provide detailed analysis of transcriptomic and phenotypic modulations of three related s. cerevisiae strains that arose by phenotypic switching under diverse environmental conditions.
phenotypic, microscopic and transcriptomic analyses show that phenotypic transition is a complex process that affects various aspects of feral strain physiology; it leads to a phenotype that resembles the original wild strain in some aspects and the domesticated derivative in others.
in addition to flo <dig>  these determinants include genes that affect the cell wall and membrane composition.
finally, we identify the importance of histone deacetylase hda1p in strain resistance to stresses.
