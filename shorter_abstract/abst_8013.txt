we report novel data on the organization of the br gene loci, including a novel putative br gene, and we present a model for the organization of chromatin bundles in the br <dig> puff based on genic and intergenic in situ hybridizations.
tentans is approximately 200 mb in size, and has a low gc content  and a low repeat fraction  compared to other dipteran species.
tentans and d. melanogaster, and we provide enhanced insight into the organization and expression of the br genes.
tentans is a sister clade to mosquitoes, with a split 150– <dig> million years ago.
our data strengthen the generality of the br genes as a unique model system and provide essential background for in-depth studies of the biogenesis of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes.
tentans and characterize its gene expression machineries and genomic architecture of the br genes.
tentans gene expression machineries, we identified potential orthologus sequences to more than  <dig> drosophila melanogaster  proteins involved in the expression of protein-coding genes.
we show that the molecular machineries operating in gene expression are largely conserved between ch.
