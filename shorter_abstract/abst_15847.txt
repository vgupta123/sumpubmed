we used the wafergen smartchip platform to perform highly parallelized pcr based target enrichment for a set of known cancer genes in a well characterized set of cancer cell lines from the nci <dig> panel.
the need for well validated, high quality enrichment platforms to complement the bench-top next generation sequencing devices is high.
we provide proof of a high mutation rediscovery rate and have included technical replicates to enable snp calling validation demonstrating the high reproducibility of our enrichment platform.
here we present our custom developed quantitative pcr based target enrichment platform.
