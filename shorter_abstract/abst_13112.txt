2r-wgd had a fundamental impact on the cell-cycle machinery, redefined molecular building blocks of the neuronal synapse, and was formative for vertebrate brains.
2r-wgd set the stage for the emergence of key vertebrate functional novelties .
two rounds of wgd  occurred at the base of vertebrates, giving rise to an enormous wave of genetic novelty, but a systematic analysis of functional consequences of this event has not yet been performed.
the 2r event left an indelible imprint on vertebrate signalling and the cell cycle.
we show that 2r-wgd affected an overwhelming majority  of signalling genes, in particular developmental pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases, wnt and transforming growth factor-Î² ligands, g protein-coupled receptors and the apoptosis pathway.
we show that 2r-wgd preferentially retained genes are associated with higher organismal complexity , while genes associated with basic cellular functions  tended to be excluded.
whole genome duplication  is a special case of gene duplication, observed rarely in animals, whereby all genes duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation.
