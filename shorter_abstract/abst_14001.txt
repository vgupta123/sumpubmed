although the deposition of histone variants onto chromatin has been implicated in many important biological processes, such as transcription and replication, the mechanisms of how they are deposited on target sites are still obscure.
by analyzing genomic sequences of nucleosomes bearing different histone variants from human, including h2a.z, h <dig>  and both , we found that genomic sequence contributes in part to determining target sites for different histone variants.
there exists a dna-related mechanism regulating the deposition of different histone variants onto chromatin and biological outcomes thereof.
this histone core has many variants that are different from each other by their biochemical compositions as well as biological functions.
moreover, dinucleotides ca/tg are remarkably important in distinguishing target sites of h2a.z-only nucleosomes with those of h <dig> -containing  nucleosomes.
this provides additional insights into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of many important cellular processes.
nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, is formed by wrapping nearly 147bp of dna around an octamer of histone proteins.
