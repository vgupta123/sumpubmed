at the national veterinary services laboratories the bactec mgit  <dig> and  <dig> solid media formulations were compared with the bactec 460Â tb system on  <dig>  veterinary diagnostic specimens submitted for mycobacterium bovis culture.
the bactec 12b media isolated significantly more m. bovis  than mgit  <dig> media .
m. bovis was isolated from  <dig> % of the samples and atypical mycobacteria from  <dig> % of the samples.
mycobactosel lj failed to isolate m. bovis from primary culture.
an in-house 7h <dig> media supplemented with calf sera, hemolyzed blood, malachite green and pyruvate recovered more m. bovis  with the least amount of contamination of any other solid media evaluated.
however, contamination rates were much higher for the mgit media, 17-24%, compared to 7% for bactec, suggesting that contamination was a major cause of mgit reduced sensitivity.
decontamination methods may have to be optimized and or mgit media may have to be altered to reduce contamination in veterinary samples.
time to signal positive was  <dig>  weeks  for the mgit, and  <dig>  weeks  for the bactec, both earlier than any solid media.
despite these issues, the mgit  <dig> system is still favored over the use of solid media due to decreased time to recovery and the potential for higher sensitivity.
