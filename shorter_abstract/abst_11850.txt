to investigate the differential sensitivities in male and female mice, we profiled the hepatic transcriptomic responses 4 days following exposure to various amounts of tcdd  in adult male and female c57bl/6kuo mice.
<dig> , <dig> –tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dixion  is the most potent of the dioxin congeners, capable of causing a wide range of toxic effects across numerous animal models.
minimal overlap was observed in the differences between tcdd-sensitive or tcdd-resistant models.
although it is now clear that most tcdd-induced toxic outcomes are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , the mechanism of differential responses to tcdd exposure between sexes remains largely unknown.

several key findings were revealed by our study.
previous studies have demonstrated that males and females of the same species can display divergent sensitivity phenotypes to tcdd toxicities.
4) a subset of genes demonstrated sex-dependent tcdd-induced transcriptional changes, including fmo <dig> and nr1i <dig>  which were significantly induced in livers of male mice only.
further work is necessary to better understand the roles of those genes altered by tcdd in a sex-dependent manner, and their association with changes to sex hormones and receptors.
in addition, complex interactions between the aryl hydrocarbon and sex hormone receptors may affect the observable differences in sensitivity phenotypes between the sexes.
sex-dependent sensitivities to tcdd exposure are associated with a set of sex-specific tcdd-responsive genes.
in addition, a meta-analysis was performed to contrast transcriptomic profiles of various organisms and tissues following exposure to equitoxic doses of tcdd.
