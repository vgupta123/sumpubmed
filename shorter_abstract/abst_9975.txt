csom scores showed similar patterns with a significant difference between within-group changes at d <dig> and d <dig> , and significantly more successes at d <dig> .
there were significant differences between the groups for change in load score at d <dig>  and d <dig> .
in addition to objective accelerometry measures, owners completed clinical metrology instruments  on d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  cbpi subscales , csom and load scores were evaluated within and between groups for change over time.
load scores significantly improved in the nv- <dig> group  but not in the placebo group.
cbpi ps and pi scores significantly improved in the nv- <dig> group  but not in the placebo group.
this pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel caninised anti-ngf antibody  for the treatment of djd pain in dogs.
these pilot data demonstrate a positive analgesic effect of anti-ngf antibody in dogs suffering from chronic pain.
activity in the nv- <dig> group increased over the study period compared to placebo  and the difference between the groups for change in activity over the time period 9am-5pm  was significant .
in a randomized, parallel group, stratified, double masked, placebo controlled, proof of principle clinical pilot study design,  <dig> dogs with djd received nv- <dig>  or placebo on day  <dig> .
antibodies against nerve growth factor  are analgesic in rodent models and in humans with djd.
