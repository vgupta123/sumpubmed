we propose that ncu-g <dig> is a dual-function protein capable of functioning as a transcription factor as well as a nuclear receptor co-activator.
electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed specific binding of ncu-g <dig> to an oligonucleotide representing the footprint  <dig> element of the human cellular retinol-binding protein  <dig> gene promoter.
ncu-g <dig> was found to be a highly conserved nuclear protein rich in proline with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda.
analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed no known transcription activation domains or dna binding regions, however, four nuclear receptor boxes , and four sh3-interaction motives in addition to numerous potential phosphorylation sites were found.
two nuclear export signals were identified, but no nuclear localization signal.
