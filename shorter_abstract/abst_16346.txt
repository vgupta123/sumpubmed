plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine  <dig>  has been reported to promote cell expansion and differentiation in the elongation zone of roots.
gene enrichment analysis revealed that psy1-responsive genes are involved in responses to stimuli, metabolic processes and biosynthetic processes.
the significant enrichment terms of psy1-responsive genes were higher in psy1r mutant plants compared to in wild type plants.
psy1-responsive genes are involved in cellular functions and stimuli responses suggesting a crosstalk between developmental cues and environmental stimuli.
promoter analysis of the differentially expressed genes identified a light regulatory motif in some of these.
differentially expressed genes were identified in a wild type plant line and in a psy1r receptor mutant line of arabidopsis thaliana after treatment with psy <dig>  seventy-seven genes were found to be responsive to the psy <dig> peptide in wild type plants while  <dig> genes were responsive in the receptor mutant plants.
two parallel responses to psy <dig> were identified, differing in their dependency on the psy1r receptor.
possibly, two parallel responses to psy <dig> exist.
psy <dig> action is dependent on a receptor psy1r that triggers a signaling cascade leading to cell elongation.
however little is known about cellular functions and the components involved in psy1-based signaling cascade.

a motif involved in light regulation was identified in the promoter region of the differentially expressed genes.
