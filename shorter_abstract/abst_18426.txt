artificial protein farnesylation impaired the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  this could be prevented by farnesyl transferase inhibition.
indeed, the translation products of ras genes are cytosolic proteins that become secondarily associated with membranes through a series of post-translational modifications initiated by a caax motif present at the c terminus of ras proteins.
these data highlight the fact that the artificial prenylation of proteins provides a novel system for controlling the function of a transactivating factor.
the use of integrating viral vectors in gene therapy clinical trials has pointed out the problem of the deleterous effect of the integration of the ectopic gene to the cellular genome and the safety of this strategy.
