in the u.s., stec o104:h <dig> caused an outbreak associated with milk in  <dig>  however, there is little known on the evolutionary origins of stec o <dig> strains, and how genotypic diversity contributes to pathogenic potential of various o <dig> h-antigen serotypes isolated from different ecological niches and/or geographical regions.
two stec o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig>  strains were shot-gun sequenced, and the genomes were closed.
examining various o <dig> genome sequences, we found that two “complete” left and right end portions of the locus of enterocyte effacement  pathogenicity island were present in  <dig> o <dig> strains; however, the central portion of lee was missing, where the eae gene is located.
in o104:h <dig> strains, the missing central portion of the lee locus was replaced by a pathogenicity island carrying the aida  gene and antibiotic resistance genes commonly carried on plasmids.
the presence of plasmids carrying virulence-associated genes may play a role in the pathogenic potential of o <dig> strains.
a hypothesis on strain evolution and pathogenic potential of various h-serotypes of e. coli o <dig> strains is proposed.
enteroaggregative e. coli-specific virulence genes and european outbreak o104:h4-specific stx2-encoding escherichia p <dig> or escherichia tl-2011c bacteriophages were missing in some of the o104:h <dig> genome sequences available from public databases.
various h-serotypes of the shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  o <dig>  including h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h¯, have been associated with sporadic cases of illness and have caused food-borne outbreaks globally.
