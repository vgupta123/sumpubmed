as a stand-alone tool, megan provides an alternative to web portals for scientists that have concerns about uploading their unpublished data to a website.
the focus of this paper is to report on new features of megan that allow the functional analysis of multiple metagenomes  based on the seed hierarchy and kegg pathways.
in  <dig>  the program megan  was released, as a standalone interactive tool for analyzing the taxonomic content of a single metagenome dataset.
while metagenomics provides information on the gene content, metatranscriptomics aims at understanding gene expression patterns in microbial communities.
we have compared our results with the mg-rast service for different datasets.
the program has subsequently been extended to support comparative analyses of multiple datasets.
the megan program now allows the interactive analysis and comparison of the taxonomical and functional content of multiple datasets.
