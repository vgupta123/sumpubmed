the reduction in flavanols reactive to p-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde as -catechin equivalents and total skin proanthocyanidins is an important result for the white winemaking process.
this study aimed to investigate the effect of sunlight reduction on the accumulation of polyphenolic and aromatic compounds.
in addition, the higher level of aromatic compounds in shaded grapes at harvest is an important contribution to the development of different wine styles.
this study was conducted in a commercial vineyard containing v. vinifera l. cv grillo.
opaque polypropylene boxes  and high-density polyethylene  net bags  were applied at fruit set.
white wine quality, especially in warm climates, is affected by sunlight and heat stress.
