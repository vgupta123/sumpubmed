importantly, replacement heifers are commonly sourced from large farms like this to smallholder farmers, which poses risk of spread of bacteria to other herds.
the within-herd seroprevalence in cattle  was 48Â % , using an indirect elisa, while the rose bengal test  yielded lower prevalence .
this study aimed at investigating a dairy herd experiencing abortions in order to establish within-herd seroprevalence to brucella spp., identify, characterize brucella strains by multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats analysis  and investigate possible spillover to other species.
brucellosis is a disease of worldwide public health and economic importance.
successful control is based on knowledge of epidemiology and strains present in an area.
high within-herd prevalence, isolation of the pathogen and abortion confirm that b. abortus is circulating in this herd with cattle as reservoir hosts.
the origin of the tanzanian genotypes remain elusive, although they seem to be related to genotypes found in europe, turkey and china but not related to b. abortus biovar  <dig> reference strain or genotypes from kenya.
a low seroprevalence in sheep and goats suggests a spillover of b. abortus from cattle to small ruminants in the herd.
real time pcr , bruce-ladder and classical biotyping classified the isolates as b. abortus biovar  <dig>  mlva-vntr revealed two different but closely related genotypes.
these genotypes were not related to b. abortus biovar  <dig> reference strain tulya originally isolated from a human patient in uganda in  <dig>  unlike the genotypes isolated and characterized recently in kenya.
this is the first isolation and characterization of b. abortus biovar  <dig> from a dairy cow with abortion in tanzania.
b. abortus is a significant zoonotic risk and animal health problem in this production system, therefore further studies on humans is recommended.
