the short oligonucleotide microarray was used to compare the faecal flora from healthy individuals and a patient suffering from ulcerative colitis  during the active and remission states.
differences were identified in the bacterial profiles between healthy individuals and a uc patient.
the purpose of this study was to develop a microarray technique based on 16s ribosomal gene sequences for rapidly monitoring the microbial population of the gi tract.
our approach allows the rapid discrimination of bacteria inhabiting the human gi tract, at taxonomic levels ranging from species to the superkingdom bacteria.
an independent pcr-based control was used to normalise different hybridisation results, and to make comparisons between different samples, greatly improving the detection of changes in the gut bacterial population.
short oligonucleotides consistently gave higher specificity.
in this study we demonstrate the design, testing and application of a highly sensitive, short oligonucleotide community microarray.
optimal dna amplification and labelling, hybridisation and washing conditions were determined using a probe with an increasing number of nucleotide mismatches, identifying the minimum number of nucleotides needed to distinguish between perfect and mismatch probes.
