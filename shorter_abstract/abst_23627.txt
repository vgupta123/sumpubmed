seqrate is the first sequence-based method for protein folding type classification and its accuracy of fold rate prediction is improved over previous sequence-based methods.
here we developed a method, seqrate, to predict both protein folding kinetic type  and real-value folding rate using sequence length, amino acid composition, contact order, contact number, and secondary structure information predicted from only protein sequence with support vector machines.
we systematically studied the contributions of individual features to folding rate prediction.
most previous methods of predicting protein folding rate require the tertiary structure of a protein as an input.
both the web server and software of predicting folding rate are publicly available at  http://casp.rnet.missouri.edu/fold_rate/index.html.
the pearson correlation coefficient and the mean absolute difference between predicted and experimental folding rates  in the base- <dig> logarithmic scale are  <dig>  and  <dig>  for two-state protein folders, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for three-state protein folders.
its performance can be further enhanced with additional information, such as structure-based geometric contacts, as inputs.
