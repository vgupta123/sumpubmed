correlation analysis between go categories and sequence motifs suggests motif-specific constraints acting on gene function.
eukaryotic promoters are regions containing various sequence motifs necessary to control gene transcription.
unlike other strs, nearly half of the trinucleotide repeats found in promoters partly or entirely overlapped with cpg islands, indicating potential association with nucleosome positions.
as sequence motifs can be key factors in maintaining complex promoter architectures, one effective approach to further understand the evolution of promoter regions in vertebrates is to compare the abundance and distribution patterns of sequence motifs in these regions between divergent species.
moreover, the chicken promoters are abundant with sequence motifs such as poly-a, poly-g and g-quadruplexes, especially in the core region, that are otherwise rare in the genome.
most of sequence motifs showed strong functional enrichment for particular gene ontology  categories, indicating roles in regulation of transcription and gene expression, as well as immune response and cognition.
in terms of the str motif frequencies, chicken promoter regions were more similar to other avian and mammalian promoters than these were to the entire chicken genome.
chicken promoter regions share some, but not all, of the structural features observed in mammalian promoters.
more than 10% of chicken genes contained short tandem repeat  in the region 2Â kb upstream of promoters, but the total number of strs observed in chicken is approximately half of that detected in human promoters.
the findings presented here provide empirical evidence suggesting that the frequencies and locations of str motifs have been conserved through promoter evolution in a lineage-specific manner.
much evidence has emerged showing that structural and/or contextual changes in regulatory elements can critically affect cis-regulatory activity.
