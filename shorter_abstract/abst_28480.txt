single nucleotide polymorphism microarray  data, a proxy for genome composition, contains patterns in allele order and proportion.
closer inspection reveals that these prioritised genomic regions do not correspond to simple runs of homozygosity but rather compositionally complex regions that are shared by many individuals of a given population.
a high resolution ce ‘sliding window’ scan across the human genome, organised at the population level, revealed genes known to be under evolutionary pressure.
ce analysis of other mammals results in segregation by breed or species, and is sensitive to admixture and past effective population size.
ce allows one to clearly visualise the evolution of individual genomes and populations through a formal, mathematically-rigorous information space.
unlike fst, ce analyses do not require ab initio population comparisons and are amenable to the hemizygous x chromosome.
these patterns can be quantified by compression efficiency .
