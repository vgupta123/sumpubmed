male albino guinea pigs were exposed to white noise for  <dig> h or  <dig> consecutive days  and the hearing impairments and light microscopic change of blb were evaluated with auditory brainstem responses  and the cochlear sensory epithelia surface preparation, respectively.
noise exposure  is a severe modern health hazard that induces hearing impairment.

ne induced significant hearing impairment and ne 2d contributed to significant outer hair cell  loss that is most severe in the first row of outer hair cells.
all these findings suggest that both decrease of claudin- <dig> and occludin and increased blb permeability are involved in the pathologic process of noise-induced hearing impairment; however, the causal relationship and underlying mechanisms should be further investigated.
furthermore, the loosen tj and an obvious leakage of lanthanum nitrate particles beneath the basal lamina were revealed with tem.
however, the noise-induced ultrastructural changes of blood-labyrinth barrier  and the potential involvements of tight junction proteins  remain inconclusive.
the cochlear ultrastructure and blb permeability after ne 2d were revealed with transmission electron microscope  and lanthanum nitrate-tracing techniques, respectively.
the potential alterations of tjps claudin- <dig> and occludin were quantified with immunohistochemistry and western blot.
