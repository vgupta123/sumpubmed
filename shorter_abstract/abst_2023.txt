although a weak effect, the latter might be consistent with a past history of block duplication.
numerous observers, however, highlighted instances in which a ligand was linked to one of its cognate receptors, with some authors suggesting that this may be a general and/or functionally important pattern, possibly associated with recombination modification between epistatically interacting loci.
successful duplication of some ligands, we hypothesise, is more likely if the cognate receptor is duplicated at the same time, so ensuring appropriate titres of the two products.
prior to the sequencing of the human genome it was typically assumed that, tandem duplication aside, gene order is for the most part random.
however, in the human genome there are approximately twice as many co-occurrences of ligand and receptor on the same human chromosome as expected by chance.
while there is an excess of ligands and their receptors on the same human chromosome, this cannot be accounted for by classical models of non-random gene order, as the linkage of ligands/receptors is no closer than expected by chance.
alternative hypotheses for non-random gene order are hence worth considering.
