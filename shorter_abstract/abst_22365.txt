the main functionality of hichip includes:  read quality checking;  read mapping and filtering;  peak calling and peak consistency analysis; and  result visualization.
hichip is a comprehensive analysis pipeline that can be configured to analyze chip-seq data derived from varying antibodies and experiment designs.
chip-seq data analysis involves multiple steps from read mapping and peak calling to data integration and interpretation.
it remains challenging and time-consuming to process large amounts of chip-seq data derived from different antibodies or experimental designs using the same approach.
we have developed a highly integrative pipeline, termed hichip for systematic analysis of chip-seq data.
using public chip-seq data we demonstrate that hichip is a fast and reliable pipeline for processing large amounts of chip-seq data.
chromatin immunoprecipitation  followed by next-generation sequencing  has been widely used to identify genomic loci of transcription factor  binding and histone modifications.
