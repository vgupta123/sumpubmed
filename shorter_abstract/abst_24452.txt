gene ontology analysis of the predicted and validated targets of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas indicated enrichment of functional pathways involved in cell metabolism, cell cycle, cell signaling, and cell differentiation.
with data from  <dig>  million reads comprising  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp from  <dig> centenarian and  <dig> control individuals, we discovered a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> unknown mirnas ranging several orders of magnitude in expression levels, a typical characteristics of saturated mirna-sequencing.
a cross sectional expression analysis of the differentially expressed mirnas in b-cells from ashkenazi jewish individuals between the 50th and 100th years of age indicated that expression levels of mir-363* declined significantly with age.
we employed massively parallel sequencing technology to identify mirnas expressed in b-cells from ashkenazi jewish centenarians, i.e., those living to a hundred and a human model of exceptional longevity, and younger controls without a family history of longevity.
micrornas  are small, non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression and play a critical role in development, homeostasis, and disease.
