here we examine early land plant evolution using complete plastome sequences including two previously unexamined and phylogenetically critical lineages.
we present the plastome sequences of equisetum arvense, a horsetail, and of isoetes flaccida, a heterosporous lycophyte.
despite considerable progress in our understanding of land plant phylogeny, several nodes in the green tree of life remain poorly resolved.
resolution among the four monilophyte lineages remained moderate, although nucleotide analyses suggested that p. nudum and e. arvense form a clade sister to a. evecta + leptosporangiate ferns.
results from phylogenetic analyses of nucleotides were consistent with the distribution of plastome gene rearrangements and with analysis of sequence gaps resulting from insertions and deletions .
phylogenetic analysis of aligned nucleotides from  <dig> plastome genes from  <dig> taxa supported monophyly for the following clades: embryophytes , lycophytes, monilophytes , and seed plants.
results from this study demonstrate resolution among the four monilophytes lineages, albeit with moderate support; we posit a clade consisting of equisetaceae and psilotaceae that is sister to the "true ferns," including marattiaceae.
furthermore, the bulk of currently available data come from only a subset of major land plant clades.
to better understand the evolution of land plants and their plastomes, we examined aligned nucleotide sequences, indels, gene and nucleotide composition, inversions, and gene order at the boundaries of the inverted repeats.
