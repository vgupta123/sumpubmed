extracting drug-disease correlations is crucial in unveiling disease mechanisms, as well as discovering new indications of available drugs, or drug repositioning.
we first map all the disease genes and drug genes to a combined protein interaction network.
we also filter possible false positive drug-disease correlations by p-value.

the overlapping between our predicted correlations with those reported in comparative toxicogenomics database  and literatures, and their enriched kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways demonstrate our approach can not only effectively identify new drug indications, but also provide new insight into drug-disease discovery.
we present a new method to predict the associations between drugs and diseases.
finally, we validate the top- <dig> drug-disease associations related to six drugs in the predicted results.
our method is based on a module distance, which is originally proposed to calculate distances between modules in incomplete human interactome.
then based on the module distance, we calculate the distances between drug gene sets and disease gene sets, and take the distances as the relationships of drug-disease pairs.
