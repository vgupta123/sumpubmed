this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ppo activation and enzymatic catalysis of po.
our molecular docking and mutagenesis studies revealed a new substrate-binding site with glu <dig> as the catalytic residue responsible for the deprotonation of mono- and di-phenolic substrates.
our results revealed a novel substrate-binding site with glu <dig> identified as the key catalytic residue for po enzymatic activities.
herein, we report the crystal structure of ppo <dig> from a. gambiae at  <dig>  Å resolution.
the mechanisms of ppo activation and po catalysis have been elusive.
ppo <dig> forms a homodimer with each subunit displaying a classical type iii di-copper active center.
po is initially synthesized by hemocytes and released into hemolymph as inactive prophenoloxidase , which is activated by a serine protease cascade upon recognition of foreign invaders.
mutation of glu <dig> severely impaired both the monophenol hydroxylase and diphenoloxidase activities of agppo <dig>  our data suggested that the newly identified substrate-binding pocket is the actual site for catalysis, and ppo activation could be achieved without withdrawing the conserved phenylalanine residue that was previously deemed as the substrate ‘placeholder’.
our data offered a new model for ppo activation at the molecular level, which differs from the canonical mechanism that demands withdrawing a blocking phenylalanine residue from the previously deemed substrate-binding site.
in mosquitos such as anopheles gambiae, melanotic encapsulation is a resistance mechanism against certain parasites that cause malaria and filariasis.
