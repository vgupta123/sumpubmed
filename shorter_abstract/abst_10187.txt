cancer genomics projects are producing ever-increasing amounts of rich and diverse data from patient samples.
cascade represents a simple yet intuitive interface for data visualization that is both scalable and customizable.
the main webpage of cascade provides a primary view of user data which is overlaid onto known biological pathways that are either predefined or added by users.
the cascade viewer allows multiple data types  to be simultaneously displayed, allowing a simplified view of the data in a way that is tuneable based on user specified parameters.
the ability to easily visualize this data in an integrated an intuitive way is currently limited by the current software available.
here we present cascade, a novel web based tool for the intuitive 3d visualization of rna-seq data from cancer genomics experiments.
