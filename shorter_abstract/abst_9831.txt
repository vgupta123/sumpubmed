we have developed signature, a web-based resource that simplifies gene expression signature analysis by providing software, data, and protocols to perform the analysis successfully.
this resource uses bayesian methods for processing gene expression data coupled with a curated database of gene expression signatures, all carried out within a genepattern web interface for easy use and access.
signature is available for public use at http://genepattern.genome.duke.edu/signature/.
however, to use this approach requires computational methods that are difficult to implement and apply, and thus there is a critical need for intelligent software tools that can reduce the technical burden of the analysis.
the biological phenotype of a cell, such as a characteristic visual image or behavior, reflects activities derived from the expression of collections of genes.
