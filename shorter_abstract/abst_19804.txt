in many studies up to now, the assumption has been that if two phylogenetic trees differ, it is because reassortment has caused them to be different.
the algorithms rest on the idea of significance of difference between phylogenetic trees or phylogenetic tree sets, and subtree pruning and regrafting operations, which mimic the effect of reassortment on tree topologies.
owing to their importance in public health and their infectious ability, it is essential to identify reassortant influenza strains in order to understand the evolution of this virus and describe reassortment pathways that may be biased towards particular viral segments.
owing to computational demands of comparing tree topologies, further development in this area is necessary to allow their application to larger datasets.
while phylogenetic incongruence may be caused by real differences in evolutionary history, it can also be the result of phylogenetic error.
reassortant strains are often not immediately recognised by the adaptive immune system of the hosts and hence may be the source of pandemic outbreaks.
therefore, we wish to develop a method for distinguishing between topological inconsistency that is due to confounding effects and topological inconsistency that is due to reassortment.
the first method is based on a maximum likelihood  framework  and the second implements a bayesian approach  for reassortment detection.
we test both methods on a simulated dataset and on a small collection of real viral data isolated in hong kong in  <dig>
the current work describes the implementation of two approaches for robustly identifying reassortment events.
we focus on reassortment events that are found by both methods.
the algorithms developed here can effectively identify reassortment events in small viral datasets and can be applied not only to influenza but also to other segmented viruses.
