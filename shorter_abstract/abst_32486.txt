here, we describe a new method "tmpro" to predict tm helices with high accuracy.
the features are extracted from sequence information by applying the framework used for latent semantic analysis of text documents and are input to neural networks that learn the distinction between tm and non-tm segments.
tmpro uses very few free parameters in modeling tm segments as opposed to the very large number of free parameters used in state-of-the-art membrane prediction methods, yet achieves very high segment accuracies.
further, they are often restricted to the generally accepted topology "cytoplasmic-transmembrane-extracellular" and cannot adapt to membrane proteins that do not conform to this topology.
tmpro predictions in membrane proteins with unusual or disputed tm structure  are discussed.
thus, there is a need for methods that can better predict tm helices even in novel topologies and families.
the greatest impact of tmpro is therefore expected in the prediction of tm segments in proteins with novel topologies.
further, the paper introduces a novel method of extracting features from protein sequence, namely that of latent semantic analysis model.
in benchmark analysis tmpro achieves 95% segment f-score corresponding to 50% reduction in error rate compared to the best methods not requiring an evolutionary profile of a protein to be known.
recent crystal structures of channel proteins have revealed novel architectures showing that the above topology may not be as universal as previously believed.
the success of this approach in the current context suggests that it can find potential applications in other sequence-based analysis problems.
current best methods use hundreds or even thousands of free parameters in their models which are tuned to fit the little data available for training.
the model uses only  <dig> free parameters.
