while the vast majority of these snps are singletons, roughly  <dig>  non-synonymous and  <dig>  synonymous snps were found in multiple individuals.
gpcrs also represent the single largest class of drug targets and associated pharmacogenetic effects are modulated, in part, by polymorphisms.
recently, non-human primate models have been developed focusing on naturally-occurring, functionally-parallel polymorphisms in candidate genes.
snp frequencies in macaques follow a similar pattern of divergence from humans and new polymorphisms in primates have been identified that may parallel those seen in humans, helping to establish better non-human primate models of disease.
as expected, regions showing the least evolutionary constraint show greater rates of polymorphism and greater numbers of higher frequency polymorphisms.
in all three populations, polymorphism and divergence is highly concentrated in n-terminal and c-terminal domains and the third intracellular loop region of gpcrs, regions critical to ligand-binding and signaling.
g-protein coupled receptors  play an inordinately large role in human health.
