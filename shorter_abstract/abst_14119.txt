most differences between both populations were observed on the x chromosome, though this might be partly due to false positives.
in total, we found  <dig> candidate genes:  <dig> in the european population and  <dig> in the african one, with only three genes shared between both populations.
more candidate genes have been found in the european population.
we performed a genome scan in drosophila melanogaster to find signatures of balancing selection in a derived  and an ancestral  population.

furthermore, some of the top genes we identified are involved in innate immunity.
functionally, we find an overrepresentation of genes involved in neuronal development and circadian rhythm.
they are involved in several different functions.
our results revealed evidence of genes under balancing selection in european and african populations.
we screened a total of  <dig> genomes searching for regions of high genetic diversity and an excess of snps with intermediate frequency.
however, only very few systematic studies have been carried out to detect genes under balancing selection.
in the history of population genetics balancing selection has been considered as an important evolutionary force, yet until today little is known about its abundance and its effect on patterns of genetic diversity.
