biocyc databases are an important resource for information on biological pathways and genomic data.
as functional annotations are improved, scalable methods are needed for curators to manage annotations without detailed knowledge of the specific design of the biocyc database.
this tool builds on existing software to improve and simplify annotation data imports of user provided data into biocyc databases.
the functionality of cyctools is demonstrated by transferring go term annotations from maizecyc to matching proteins in corncyc, both maize metabolic pathway databases available at maizegdb, and by creating strain specific databases for metabolic engineering.
we have developed cyctools, a software tool which allows curators to maintain functional annotations in a model organism database.
additionally, cyctools automatically resolves synonyms and alternate identifiers contained within the database into the appropriate internal identifiers.
