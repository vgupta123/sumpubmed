fifty one primer pairs  were successfully cross transferred to the related species at various levels.
of these,  <dig>  primer pairs were experimentally validated and used to investigate the genetic diversity among the  <dig> accessions of different camellia spp.
the identification and validation of  <dig> new ugms markers will not only help in intra and inter specific genetic diversity assessment but also be enriching limited microsatellite markers resource in tea.
further, test for iam and smm models for the ugms loci showed excess heterozygosity and did not show any bottleneck operating in the tea population.
since,  <dig> of these ugms markers correspond to the arabidopsis protein sequence data with known functions will offer the opportunity to investigate the consequences of ssr polymorphism on gene functions.
unigene derived microsatellite  markers identified from publicly available sequence database have the advantage of assaying variation in the expressed component of the genome with unique identity and position.
polymorphism information content  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig> .
considering the multiple advantages of ugms markers,  <dig>  unigenes were predicted from  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  of tea .
ugms markers identified and characterized in this study provided insight about the abundance and distribution of ssr in the expressed genome of c. sinensis.
ninety six primer pairs could be designed form  <dig> % of ssr containing unigenes.
among the dinucleotide repeats, n.n were most abundant .
despite great advances in genomic technology observed in several crop species, the availability of molecular tools such as microsatellite markers has been limited in tea .
ssr abundance was one in every  <dig>  kb of est sequences.
the average heterozygosity expected  and observed  obtained was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, thereby suggesting highly heterogeneous nature of tea.
the development of microsatellite markers will have a major impact on genetic analysis, gene mapping and marker assisted breeding.
