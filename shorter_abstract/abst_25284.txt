population-based bacterial genetics using repeated dna loci is an efficient approach to study the biodiversity and phylogeographical structure of human pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis.
a total of  <dig> dnas from mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from tuberculosis patients residing in turkey  were genotyped by spoligotyping, a high-throughput genotyping method based on the polymorphism of the direct repeat locus.
further investigations to assess its frequency within all regions of turkey and its phylogeographical origin and phylogenetic position within the global m. tuberculosis phylogenetic tree will shed new light on its endemicity in asia minor.
no population-based polymorphism data were yet available for m. tuberculosis in turkey, at the crossroads of eurasia.
we described a new phylogeographically-specific clone of m. tuberculosis, designated lam7-tur.
out of  <dig> clinical isolates harboring st <dig> which were further genotyped by is <dig> and by miru-vntr typing, a typical 2-copy is6110-rflp pattern and a "215125113322" miru-vntr pattern were observed among  <dig> clinical isolates.
