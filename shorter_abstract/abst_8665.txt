here, we hypothesize that both apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  function at the gut interface to import glucose and fructose from the gut lumen.
in this study, using a de novo approach, we identified  <dig> sugar porter  family transporters in the a. pisum genome.
when expressed in a saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transporter deletion mutant , only apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  transport glucose and fructose resulting in functional rescue of the yeast mutant.
to access the available carbon, aphids hydrolyze sucrose in the gut lumen and transport its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose.
here, using the latest release of the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum, genome we provide an updated gene annotation and expression profile of putative sugar transporters.
further analysis, using quantitative pcr identifies  <dig> transporters, a. pisum sugar transporter  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as highly expressed and/or enriched in gut tissue.
finally, gut expressed sugar transporters are functionally expressed in yeast and screened for glucose and fructose transport activity.
here we characterize apst <dig>  a  <dig> amino acid protein, with  <dig> predicted transmembrane regions, as a facilitative glucose/fructose transporter.
finally, phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that apst <dig>  and related, as yet uncharacterized insect transporters are phylogenetically closely related to human glut  class i facilitative glucose/fructose transporters.
although sugar transport plays a critical role in aphid nutrition, the molecular basis of sugar transport in aphids, and more generally across all insects, remains poorly characterized.
the gut enhanced expression of apst <dig>  and the transport specificity of its product is consistent with apst <dig> functioning as a gut glucose/fructose transporter.
