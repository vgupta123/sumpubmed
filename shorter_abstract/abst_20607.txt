albumin with by colorimetric, creatine kinase , aspartate aminotransferase , lactate dehydrogenase  were determined on an automatic analyser using the enzymatic method.
blood samples were collected under anesthesia from the left ventricles of the heart using the cardiac puncture method for ima measurement.
the results revealed that increased serum ima may be related to myocardial stress after sah.
histopathological examinations were performed on the heart and lung tissues.
total injury scores of heart and lung tissue, also myocytolysis at day  <dig> were significantly higher than control group , day  <dig>  and day  <dig> .
cardiac complications are often developed after subarachnoid hemorrhage  and may cause sudden death of the patient.

a positive correlation between ima - myocytolysis , and between ima â€“ heart tissue total injury score  was found.
the aim of this study is to evaluate serum ima by using the albumin cobalt binding  test in the first, second, and seventh days of experimental sah in rats.
ima using by acb test was detected with spectrophotometer.
serum ima  in seventh day of sah were higher compared to the control group.
these were classified as control group, 1st, 2nd and 7th day sah groups.
