the phylogenetic relationships of galliform birds, especially the turkeys, grouse, chickens, quails, and pheasants, have been studied intensively, likely because of their close association with humans.
despite extensive studies, convergent morphological evolution and rapid radiation have resulted in conflicting hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships.
most of the internal branches were relatively short and the terminal branches long suggesting an ancient, rapid radiation.
the traditional hypothesis of monophyletic lineages of pheasants, partridges, peafowls and tragopans was not supported in this study.
the megapodiidae formed the sister group to all other galliforms, followed in sequence by the cracidae, odontophoridae and numididae.
the genus arborophila was the sister group of the remaining taxa followed by polyplectron.
we analyzed the complete mitochondrial  genomes from  <dig> galliform species, including  <dig> new mt genomes and  <dig> published mt genomes, and obtained a single, robust tree.
mitogenomic analyses recovered robust phylogenetic relationships and suggested that the galliformes formed a model group for the study of morphological and behavioral evolution.
many internal nodes have remained ambiguous.
