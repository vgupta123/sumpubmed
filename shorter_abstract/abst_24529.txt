the methods were: discriminant analysis by partial least squares , logistic regression , decision tree , na√Øve bayes  and k nearest neighbours .
in the present study, we applied acc pre-processing to sets of known allergens, developing alignment-independent models for allergen recognition based on the main chemical properties of amino acid sequences.
allertop is the first alignment-free server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the main physicochemical properties of proteins.
allergy is a form of hypersensitivity to normally innocuous substances, such as dust, pollen, foods or drugs.
the amino acids in the protein sequences were described by three z-descriptors  and by auto- and cross-covariance  transformation were converted into uniform vectors.
allertop also predicts the most probable route of exposure.
there are two types of bioinformatics-based allergen prediction.
five machine learning methods for classification were applied in the study to derive models for allergen prediction.
in comparison to other servers for allergen prediction, allertop outperforms them with 94% sensitivity.
the first approach follows fao/who codex alimentarius guidelines and searches for sequence similarity.
the second approach is based on identifying conserved allergenicity-related linear motifs.
allergens are small antigens that commonly provoke an ige antibody response.
