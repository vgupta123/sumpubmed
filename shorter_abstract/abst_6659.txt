compared to cmap, dmap shows an increase of  <dig> folds in the number of chemicals and  <dig>  fold in the number of atc codes.
dmap compiles a total of  <dig>  chemical-to-protein effect relationships.
for kolmogorov-smirnov scoring based method, with dmap, we were able to retrieve several drug indications which could not be retrieved using cmap.
reliable measurements of how drug affect disease-related proteins are critical to ongoing drug development in the genome medicine era.
databases such as the cmap have been developed recently to help with systematic drug repositioning.
to validate the feasibility of applying new dmap for systematic drug repositioning, we compared the performance of dmap and the well-known cmap database on two popular computational techniques: drug-drug-similarity-based method with leave-one-out validation and kolmogorov-smirnov scoring based method.
we demonstrated that dmap can help drug development professionals assess drug-to-protein relationship data and improve chances of success for systematic drug repositioning efforts.
to overcome the limitation of connectivity maps on data coverage, we constructed a comprehensive in silico drug-protein connectivity map called dmap, which contains directed drug-to-protein effects and effect scores.
