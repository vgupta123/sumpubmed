the following analytes, interleukin  <dig> , matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> , and vascular endothelial growth factor a  were monitored using q-plex, a customized multiplex elisa system from quansys biosciences, and individual target commercial elisa kits.
based on these encouraging preliminary data, we believe that the q-plex technology is a viable platform that can be exploited as an efficient, highly accurate tool to quantitate multiplex panels of diagnostic proteins in biologic specimens.
here, we tested the performance of a new, multiplex protein array platform to quantitate three bladder cancer-associated proteins in urine samples.
the q-plex assay achieved an overall diagnostic sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> , and the individual target elisa assays achieved an overall sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> .
the ability to accurately measure multiple proteins simultaneously in a single assay has the potential to markedly improve the efficiency of a myriad of clinical assays.
