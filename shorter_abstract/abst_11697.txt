this cancer genome database contains  <dig> profiles from commonly used cancer cell lines representing  <dig> different tissue types.
we have created a user-friendly java application to facilitate sophisticated visualization and analysis such as cross-tumor and cross-platform comparisons.
this publicly available resource, the system for integrative genomic microarray analysis  of cancer genomes, can be accessed at .
the prevalence of high resolution profiling of genomes has created a need for the integrative analysis of information generated from multiple methodologies and platforms.
in this study we have developed an application for the visualization and analysis of data from high resolution array cgh platforms that can be adapted for analysis of multiple types of high throughput genomic datasets.
however, tools for direct mining and analysis of array cgh data are limited.
to demonstrate the utility of this software, we assembled array cgh data representing affymetrix snp chip, stanford cdna arrays and whole genome tiling path array platforms for cross comparison.
although the majority of data in the public domain are gene expression profiles, and expression analysis software are available, the increase of array cgh studies has enabled integration of high throughput genomic and gene expression datasets.
