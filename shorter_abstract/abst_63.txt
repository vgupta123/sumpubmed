the footprint discovery method proposed here shows excellent results with e. coli and can readily be extended to predict cis-acting regulatory signals and propose testable hypotheses in bacterial genomes for which nothing is known about regulation.
a systematic evaluation of optimal parameters for a footprint discovery strategy can bring a sizeable improvement to the predictions.
we evaluate the performances of a footprint discovery approach based on the detection of over-represented spaced motifs.
we evaluated footprint discovery in  <dig> escherichia coli k <dig> genes with annotated sites, under  <dig> different combinations of parameters .
we further report a detailed analysis of  <dig> bacterial orthologs of the lexa repressor.
the detection of conserved motifs in promoters of orthologous genes  has become a common strategy to predict cis-acting regulatory elements.
distinct motifs are detected at various taxonomical levels, including the  <dig> previously characterized taxon-specific motifs.
in addition, we highlight a significantly stronger conservation of half-motifs in actinobacteria, relative to firmicutes, suggesting an intermediate state in specificity switching between the two gram-positive phyla, and thereby revealing the on-going evolution of lexa auto-regulation.
