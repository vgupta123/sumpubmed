putative disulfide bonds thus obtained are finally combined in a globally consistent pattern to yield the overall disulfide bonding topology of the molecule.
this formulation considers only those regions of the search space where the correct solution resides with a high likelihood.
we present an algorithmic approach to this problem that can, with high computational efficiency, analyze multiple ions types  and deal with complex bonding topologies, such as inter/intra bonding involving more than two peptides.
unfortunately, this can adversely impact the quality of results.
additionally, each bond is associated with a confidence score, which aids in interpretation and assimilation of the results.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithmic work that can consider multiple ion types in this problem setting while simultaneously ensuring polynomial time complexity and high accuracy of results.
