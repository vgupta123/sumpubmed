by applying a sfp detection method to two mammalian breeds for the first time, we detected transition and transversion single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as insertions/deletions which can be used to rapidly develop markers for genetic mapping and association analysis in species where high density genotyping platforms are otherwise unavailable.
this method is an attractive bioinformatics tool for uncovering breed-by-probe interactions, for rapidly identifying expressed snps, for investigating potential functional correlations between gene expression and breed polymorphisms, and is robust enough to be used on any affymetrix gene expression platform.
additionally probes were randomly selected for sequencing to determine an unbiased confirmation rate.
