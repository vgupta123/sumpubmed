to analyze the dynamics and diversity of coding and non-coding transcripts during development, both polyadenylated mrna and ribosomal rna-depleted total rna were harvested across six developmental stages and subjected to high throughput sequencing.
decay of a subset of maternal mrnas and new transcription define the maternal-to-zygotic transition, but the full complement of polyadenylated and deadenylated coding and non-coding transcripts has not yet been assessed in xenopus embryos.
many maternal genes show peak expression in the oocyte and include genes which are known to be the key regulators of events like oocyte maturation and fertilization.
of all the transcripts that increase in abundance between early blastula and larval stages, about 30% of the embryonic genes are induced by fourfold or more by the late blastula stage and another 35% by late gastrulation.
using a gene model validation and discovery pipeline, we identified novel transcripts and putative long non-coding rnas .
