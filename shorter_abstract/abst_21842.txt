however, none of the splice variants were capable of restoring resistance of rad51d-deficient cell lines to mitomycin c. rt-pcr expression analysis revealed that rad51dΔ <dig>  and rad51dΔ <dig> transcripts display tissue specific expression patterns with rad51dΔ <dig> being detected in each tissue except ovary and rad51dΔ <dig> not detected in mammary gland and testis.
the rad <dig> paralogs  are essential for this process in vertebrates, and the rad51d paralog is unique in that it participates in both hr repair and telomere maintenance.
rad51d splice variants have been reported in mouse and human tissues, supportive of a role for alternative splicing in hr regulation.
these results suggest rad51d alternative splice variants potentially modulate mechanisms of hr by sequestering either rad51c or xrcc <dig>
yeast-2-hybrid analysis was used to determine that the mus musculus rad51d splice variant product rad51dΔ7b  was capable of interacting with both rad51c and xrcc <dig> and that rad51d+int <dig> interacted with xrcc <dig>  in addition, the linker region  of rad51d was identified as a region that potentially mediates binding with xrcc <dig>  cellular localization, detected by egfp fusion proteins, demonstrated that each of the splice variant products tested was distributed throughout the cell similar to the full-length protein.
the present study evaluated the interaction of the rad51d splice isoform products with rad51c and xrcc <dig> and their expression patterns.
