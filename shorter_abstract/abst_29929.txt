after  <dig> wk of treatment, there was an improved fecal score and fewer days of diarrhea  in the dogs given synbiotic, which coincided with a presumed contagious outbreak shared by all dogs in the study.
alterations in the fecal microbiome were observed with a significant rise in lactobacillaceae in the synbiotic group  after  <dig> wk of treatment.
fecal ph and fecal short chain fatty acid  concentrations were measured and tag-encoded flx 16s rdna amplicon pyrosequencing  and quantitative real-time pcr were performed at baseline  and after  <dig> weeks of treatment with a total treatment time of  <dig> weeks.
use of this synbiotic results in an increase in presumed beneficial bacterial flora of the host colon which was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of diarrhea in training sled dogs.
a positive correlation was found between lactobacillaceae and overall butyrate concentration  in all dogs.
fecal scores for all dogs were assessed at baseline and every day for  <dig> wk after initiation of treatment.
the objective of this study was to examine alterations in fecal quality, short-chain fatty acids , and the fecal microbiome in two groups of training sled dogs fed a synbiotic or microcrystalline cellulose placebo.
