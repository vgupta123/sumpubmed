transcript enumeration methods such as sage, mpss, and sequencing-by-synthesis est "digital northern", are important high-throughput techniques for digital gene expression measurement.
simcluster is designed in accordance with a well-established mathematical framework for compositional data analysis, which provides principled procedures for dealing with the simplex space, and is thus applicable in a number of contexts, including enumeration-based gene expression data.
as other counting or voting processes, these measurements constitute compositional data exhibiting properties particular to the simplex space where the summation of the components is constrained.
here we present a software tool, simcluster, designed to perform clustering analysis for data on the simplex space.
