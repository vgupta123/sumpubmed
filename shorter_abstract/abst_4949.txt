the ability to rapidly map millions of oligonucleotide fragments to a reference genome is crucial to many high throughput genomic technologies.
we propose an intuitive and efficient algorithm, titled extreme mapping of oligonucleotide , to rapidly map millions of oligonucleotide fragments to a genome of any length.
in addition to the speed advantage, we found the probe mapping of xman to substantially improve the final analysis results in both a spike-in experiment on encode tiling arrays and an estrogen receptor chip-chip experiment on whole human genome tiling arrays.
xman can map the  <dig> million 25-mer probes on the affymetrix whole human genome tiling arrays to the entire genome in less than  <dig> cpu hours.
