the cdv genotype consisted of mlv-associated genotypes such as america- <dig> and rockborn-like strains, which were characterized by long terminal branches and no distinct geographical patterns among lineages.
in contrast, wild-type isolates clustered into lineages with a spatiotemporal structure and short terminal branches.
for example, a ladder-like backbone is a hallmark of directional selection, and cladogenesis at long terminal branches indicates the emergence of a surviving lineage.
after excluding the mlv strains and potential recombinant strains, alignments of  <dig> of  <dig> previous cdv strains were further used to analyze phylodynamic characteristics, and evidence of selection, and co-evolution.
despite the widespread use of vaccines, the prevalence of the cd virus  has increased at an alarming rate in recent years.

codon  <dig> was identified as a multi-epistatic interacting in the h protein.
the sequence variation signature was shaped by both geographic diversity and host tropism.
