this calls for procedures to automatically generate species-specific gene finders and to re-train them as the quantity and quality of reliable gene annotation grows.
this means that over time it will be hard to keep supplying customised gene finders for each genome.
the performance of each individual gene predictor on each individual genome is comparable to the best of the manually optimised species-specific gene finders.
it is shown that species-specific gene finders are superior to gene finders trained on other species.
acyclic discrete phase type distributions are well suited to model sequence length distributions.
the state structure of the each hmm is generated dynamically from an array of sub-models to include only gene features represented in the training set.
we apply a hidden markov model  that implements explicit length distribution modelling for all gene structure blocks using acyclic discrete phase type distributions.
