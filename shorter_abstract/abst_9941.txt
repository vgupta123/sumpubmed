this report describes the physical map of the sr2-carrying region on the short arm of chromosome 3b of cv hope and compares the hope haplotype with non-sr <dig> wheat cv chinese spring.
the adult plant stem rust resistance gene sr <dig> was introgressed into hexaploid wheat cultivar  marquis from tetraploid emmer wheat cv yaroslav, to generate stem rust resistant cv hope in the 1920s.
sr <dig> was located to a region of 867 kb on chromosome 3b in hope, which corresponded to a region of 567 kb in chinese spring.
physical mapping and sequence comparison showed major haplotype divergence at the sr <dig> locus between hope and chinese spring.
haplotype analysis of a limited number of wheat genotypes of interest showed that all wheat genotypes carrying sr <dig> possessed the glp cluster; while, of those lacking sr <dig>  some, including marquis, possessed the cluster, while some lacked it.
the hope sr <dig> region carried  <dig> putative genes but only  <dig> were annotated in the comparable region of chinese spring.
the two haplotypes differed by extensive dna sequence polymorphisms between flanking markers as well as by a major insertion/deletion event including ten germin-like protein  genes in hope that were absent in chinese spring.

candidate genes within the sr <dig> region of hope are being evaluated for the ability to confer stem rust resistance.
