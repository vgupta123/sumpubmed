cdna sequencing for allelic variants of three of the six loci identified polymorphisms leading to variable length poly glutamine  stretch in a transcription factor annotated as an angustifolia c-terminus binding protein  and premature stop codons in a kanadi transcription factor as well as a protein kinase.
here, multiyear and multienvironment evaluation of cell wall phenotypes was conducted in an interspecific p. trichocarpa x p. deltoides pseudo-backcross mapping pedigree and two partially overlapping populations of unrelated p. trichocarpa genotypes using pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry, saccharification, and/ or traditional wet chemistry.
six candidate loci exhibiting significant associations with phenotypes were identified within qtl intervals.
five qtls ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb were mapped on linkage group xiv for lignin content, syringyl to guaiacyl  ratio, 5- and 6-carbon sugars using the mapping pedigree.
these associations were reproducible across multiple environments, two independent genotyping platforms, and different plant growth stages.
results from protoplast transient expression assays suggested that each of the polymorphisms conferred allelic differences in the activation of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin pathway marker genes.
this proof of concept in a perennial organism opens up opportunities for discovery of novel genetic determinants of economically important but complex traits in plants.
both populations were genotyped using the 34 k populus infinium snp array and whole-genome resequencing of one of the populations facilitated marker-saturation of candidate intervals for gene identification.
as a fine-mapping approach, chromosome-wide association mapping targeting a qtl hot-spot on linkage group xiv was performed in the two p. trichocarpa populations.
