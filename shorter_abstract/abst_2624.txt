interestingly, p. vulgaris plastome had higher evolutionary rates of change on both genomic and gene levels than g. max, which could be the consequence of pressure from both mutation and natural selection.
the p. vulgaris plastome is a rapidly evolving genome.
legume chloroplast genomes are widely diversified in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and evolutionary rates.
it has gene content similar to that of other legume plastomes, but contains two pseudogenes, rpl <dig> and rps <dig>  a distinct inversion occurred at the junction points of trnh-gug/rpl <dig> and rps19/rps <dig>  as in adzuki bean  <cit> .
the plastome of p. vulgaris is a  <dig>  bp circular molecule.
genomic comparative analysis indicated that inversions generally occur in legume plastomes and the magnitude and localization of insertions/deletions  also vary.
the analysis of repeat sequences demonstrated that patterns and sequences of tandem repeats had an important impact on sequence diversification between legume plastomes and tandem repeats did not belong to dispersed repeats.
in contrast to what we know about their great diversity or economic importance, our knowledge at the genomic level of chloroplast genomes  for these crops is limited.
