we describe the reni family of sumo-like domain proteins  with the unique feature of typically containing two carboxy-terminal sumo-like domains.
we suggest that the sumo stable fusion proteins of the reni family, which we introduce in this work, might mimic sumo and share its interaction motifs .
recent findings point at the importance of sumo-mediated histone nad-dependent deacetylase  recruitment in transcriptional regulation.
here, we present the exciting possibility that sumo domain proteins, similarly to ubiquitin modifiers, have also evolved in a second line â€“ namely as multi-domain proteins that are non-covalently attached to their target proteins.
but the specific molecular effects of sumo modification on many target proteins remain to be elucidated.
till now, sumo-like proteins have been studied exclusively in the context of their covalent conjugation to target proteins.
different proteins of the novel family are known to interact directly with histone nad-dependent deacetylases , structural maintenance of chromosomes  proteins, and transcription factors.
transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins and in the recruitment of hdac-activity.
