the results of this study clearly supports that scoloplos armiger represents a species complex and not a cosmopolitan species.
armiger is  <dig>  bp long and contains  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> of the  <dig> expected trnas, and the large ribosomal subunit .
sibling s. armiger-like species have been revealed by recent studies using rapds and aflp genetic data.
we find at least two s. armiger-like species within the pacific region and three different s. armiger-like species in the north atlantic.
we sequenced a ~ <dig> kb fragment of the scoloplos cf.
phylogenetic analysis of the cox3-trnq-nad <dig> data set recovered five different clades of scoloplos cf.
the fragment of the mitochondrial genome of scoloplos cf.
the sequenced cox3-trnq-nad <dig> fragment proved to be very useful in phylogenetic analyses of scoloplos cf.
polychaetes assigned as scoloplos armiger  show a cosmopolitan distribution and have been encountered in all zoogeographic regions.
armiger mitochondrial genome and developed primers for variable regions including the 3' end of the cox <dig> gene, trnq, and most of nad <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis of this 528-nucleotide fragment was carried out for s. armiger-like individuals from the eastern north atlantic as well as pacific regions.
due to its larger sampling scale this study goes beyond previous analyses which used rapd and aflp markers.
the aim of this study is to test the cosmopolitan status, as well as to clarify the systematics of this species complex in the eastern north atlantic, while using a few specimens from the pacific ocean for comparision.
