immunohistochemical analysis revealed a striated expression pattern of pr <dig> and pr <dig> in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in bladder smooth muscle.
we deduced the sequences and genomic organisation of the different murine pr72/b" isoforms: three genes encode nine isoforms, five of which are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine pp2a subunits.
we have integrated these results in a more consistent nomenclature of both human and murine pr72/b" genes and their transcripts/proteins.
our results provide a platform for the future generation of pr72/b" knockout mice.
in contrast to pr55/b and pr61/b', the pr72/b" family seems evolutionary more divergent, as only two of the murine genes have a human orthologue.
the subcellular localisation and cell cycle regulatory ability of several pr72/b" isoforms were determined, demonstrating differences as well as similarities.
using northern blotting, we examined the tissue-specific and developmental expression of these subunits.
protein phosphatase 2a  is a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase displaying vital functions in growth and development through its role in various signalling pathways.
the importance of the b-type subunits for pp2a regulation cannot be overestimated as they determine holoenzyme localisation, activity and substrate specificity.
