the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions , the rate of synonymous substitutions , and their ratio  appear to be significantly higher in alternatively spliced coding regions compared to constitutive regions.
another way of looking at alternative splicing is to consider sequence evolution of constitutive and alternative regions of protein-coding genes.
indeed, it turns out that constitutive and alternative regions evolve in different ways.
these results provide evidence of weaker purifying selection and/or stronger positive selection in alternative regions and thus one more confirmation of accelerated evolution in alternative regions.
this study corroborates the theory that alternative splicing serves as a testing ground for molecular evolution.
when n-terminal, internal and c-terminal alternatives are analysed separately, c-terminal alternatives appear to make the main contribution to the observed difference.
