bob and lesion score corresponded well in intestinal mucosa and ogalt but not in intestinal lnn.
at necropsy, about one year after inoculation , pathomorphological findings and bacterial organ burden  were scored.
a defined animal model for this phase of the infection can help to investigate host-map interactions in apparently healthy animals and identify surrogate markers for disease progress and might also serve as challenge model for vaccines.

a defined experimental infection model for the clinically non-apparent phase of paratuberculosis was established in goats as suitable basis for future studies.
map infection manifested in 26/ <dig> inoculated animals irrespective of age at inoculation and dose.
positive animals subdivided in those with high and low overall bob.
clinical signs, faecal shedding as well as map-specific antibody, ifn-γ and il- <dig> responses were used for in vivo monitoring.
clinical signs developed in three goats.
paratuberculosis caused by mycobacterium avium subsp.
intestinal findings resembled paucibacillary lesions in  <dig> and multibacillary in  <dig> goats.
