moreover, atp hydrolysis and ca2+ uptake in a medium supported by k-oxalate showed that starting at  <dig>  mm, <dig> -dcb was able to uncouple the ratio of hydrolysis/ca2+ transported.
the effect of this compound on the integrity of the sr membrane loaded with ca2+ remained unaffected.
therefore, we aimed to study the effect of  <dig> -dcb on the ca2+-atpase from sarcoplasmic reticulum , a critical regulator of intracellular ca2+ concentration.
<dig> -dichlorobenzene  is a benzene-derived molecule with two cl atoms that is commonly utilized in the synthesis of pesticides.
concentrations of  <dig> – <dig>  mm of  <dig> -dcb were able to stimulate the hydrolytic activity of serca in a medium-containing ca2+-ionophore.
the temperature-dependent decreased levels of phosphoenzyme by  <dig> -dcb could be due to the acceleration of the dephosphorylation mechanism – e2p · ca <dig> state to e <dig> and pi, which explains the uncoupling of the atp hydrolysis from the ca2+ transport.

at higher concentrations ,  <dig> -dcb inhibited the atp hydrolysis to ~80 %.
