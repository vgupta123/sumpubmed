these results indicate that tassivb-d plays an important role in the formation of transient starch granules in wheat, which in turn impact the efficiency of photosynthesis.
among these, three missense mutations and one nonsense mutation were predicted to have severe impacts on protein function.
photosynthesis was affected accordingly; the maximum quantum yield and yield of psii were significantly reduced in the nonsense mutant at the heading stage.
altered expression of tassivb-d affected granule number per chloroplast; compared with wild type, the number of chloroplasts containing 0– <dig> granules was significantly increased, while the number containing 3– <dig> granules was decreased.
starch synthesis iv  is one of the important starch synthase isoforms, but its impact on wheat starch synthesis has not yet been reported due to the lack of mutant lines.
the mutagenized population created in this study allows the efficient identification of novel alleles of target genes and could be used as a resource for wheat functional genomics.
transient starch provides carbon and energy for plant growth, and its synthesis is regulated by the joint action of a series of enzymes.
using the tilling approach, we identified  <dig> mutations in the wheat gene tassivb-d, with a mutation density of 1/ <dig> kb.
