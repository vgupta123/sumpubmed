therefore, btpc is thought to accelerate the metabolic flow for the synthesis of storage substances during pollen maturation.
both llbtpc and atbtpc expression initiated after the last mitosis before pollen germination.
both llbtpc and atbtpc expression patterns are similar to the patterns of the appearance of storage organelles during pollen development in lily and arabidopsis, respectively.
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  is a critical enzyme catalyzing the Î²-carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate  to oxaloacetate, a tricarboxylic acid  cycle intermediate.
by the large-scale purification of ubiquitin -related proteins from lily anther, two types of pepcs, bacterial-type pepc  and plant-type pepc , were identified in our study as candidate ub-related proteins.
in late bicellular pollen of lily, llbtpc forms a hetero-octameric class- <dig> pepc complex with llptpc to express pepc activity.
our results suggest that an llbtpc:ub-llptpc:llptpc complex is formed in the vc cytoplasm during late pollen development.
lily ptpc  and monoubiquitinated llptpc  remained at constant levels during pollen development.
until now, there has been no information about the properties of the pepcs expressed in male reproductive tissues of higher plants.
our study provides the first characterization of btpc in pollen, the male gametophyte of higher plants.
