soluble sugars  and free polyamines  were quantified by hplc, proline photometrically.
the metabolite data indicate different metabolic adaptation strategies between the species.
leaf freezing tolerance of  <dig> thellungiella accessions was assessed with an electrolyte leakage assay before and after 14 days of cold acclimation at 4°c.
after cold acclimation, some thellungiella accessions were more freezing tolerant than any arabidopsis accessions.

only spermine content was higher in nonacclimated thellungiella plants, but decreased during acclimation and was negatively correlated with freezing tolerance.
however, arabidopsis accessions show large natural variation in their freezing tolerance and here the tolerance ranges of collections of accessions in the two species were compared.
