the currently accepted model suggests that tgf-β/sma/mab pathway signaling in the c. elegans hypodermis is both necessary and sufficient to control body length.
we further extend the current model and show that the tgf-β/sma/mab pathway can function in multiple tissues to regulate body and organ length.
overall, our results support a model in which the tgf-β/sma/mab signaling pathway can act in multiple tissues, activating one or more downstream secreted signals that act non cell-autonomously to regulate overall body length in c. elegans.
regulation of organ and body size is a fundamental biological phenomenon, requiring tight coordination between multiple tissues to ensure accurate proportional growth.
in c. elegans, a tgf-β pathway is the major regulator of body size and also plays a role in the development of the male tail, and is thus referred to as the tgf-β/sma/mab  pathway.

here we show that tgf-β/sma/mab signaling is required for the normal growth of the pharynx.
specifically, we find that pharyngeal expression of the smad protein sma- <dig> partially rescues both pharynx length and body length of sma- <dig> mutants.
