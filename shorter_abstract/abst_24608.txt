however, experimental identification of ppis is a laborious and error-prone process, and current methods of ppi prediction tend to be highly conservative or require large amounts of functional data that may not be available for newly-sequenced organisms.
in this study we demonstrate a random-forest based technique, ents, for the computational prediction of protein-protein interactions based only on primary sequence data.
the large-scale identification of physical protein-protein interactions  is an important step toward understanding how biological networks evolve and generate emergent phenotypes.
we show that the predicted interactions yield informative groupings of p. trichocarpa metabolic pathways, literature-supported associations among human disease states, and theory-supported insight into the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes in paleopolyploid plants.
we also find that the predicted interactions are biologically meaningful, as indicated by similarity in functional annotations and enrichment of co-expressed genes in public microarray datasets.
we present the first predicted interactome for the forest tree populus trichocarpa in addition to the predicted interactomes for saccharomyces cerevisiae, homo sapiens, mus musculus, and arabidopsis thaliana.
