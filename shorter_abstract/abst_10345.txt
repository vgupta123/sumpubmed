we developed scoring methods to assess each probe set for specificity, splice isoform coverage, and robustness against transcript degradation.
for both test cases, we identified genes that were nominally detected by multiple probe sets, and we found that the probe set chosen by our method showed stronger concordance.
interpretation of gene expression microarrays requires a mapping from probe set to gene.
on many affymetrix gene expression microarrays, a given gene may be detected by multiple probe sets, which may deliver inconsistent or even contradictory measurements.
