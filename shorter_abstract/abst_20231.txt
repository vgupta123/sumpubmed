some of these degs were evaluated further by comparing the transcriptomes of genotypes grown under full n. the deg transcripts showed higher expression in tolerant genotypes could be used for transgenic over-expression in sensitive genotypes of sorghum and related crops for increased tolerance to n-stress, which results in increased nitrogen use efficiency for sustainable agriculture.
in this study we compared the transcriptomes of root tissues from seven sorghum genotypes having differential response to low-n stress.
illumina rna-sequencing detected several common differentially expressed genes  between four low-n tolerant sorghum genotypes  and three sensitive genotypes .
sorghum is an important cereal crop, which requires large quantities of nitrogen fertilizer for achieving commercial yields.
higher abundance of sec <dig> cytosolic factor family protein transcript in tolerant genotypes could lead to increased membrane stability and tolerance to n-stress.
in sensitive genotypes, n-stress increased the abundance of deg transcripts associated with stress responses including oxidative stress and stimuli were abundant.
comparison of transcriptomes between n-stress tolerant and sensitive genotypes revealed several common deg transcripts.
in tolerant genotypes, higher abundance of transcripts related to high affinity nitrate transporters  and lysine histidine transporter  <dig> , may suggest an improved uptake efficiency of inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen.
the tolerant genotypes adapt to n deficiency by producing greater root mass for efficient uptake of nutrients.
identification of the genes responsible for low-n tolerance in sorghum will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of low-n tolerance, and also facilitate the genetic improvement of sorghum through marker-assisted selection or gene transformation.
