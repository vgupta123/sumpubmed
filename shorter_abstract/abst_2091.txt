we demonstrate the performance of breseq on simulated escherichia coli genomes with deletions generating unique breakpoint sequences, new insertions of mobile genetic elements, and deletions mediated by mobile elements.
we have implemented an algorithm for identifying structural variation from dna resequencing data as part of the breseq computational pipeline for predicting mutations in haploid microbial genomes.
most current software programs for predicting structural variation from short-read dna resequencing data are intended primarily for use on human genomes.
then, we reanalyze data from an e. coli k- <dig> mutation accumulation evolution experiment in which structural variation was not previously identified.
in all cases, we find that breseq is able to reliably predict structural variation with modest read-depth coverage of the reference genome .
using breseq to predict structural variation should be useful for studies of microbial epidemiology, experimental evolution, synthetic biology, and genetics when a reference genome for a closely related strain is available.
they typically disregard information in reads mapping to repeat sequences, and significant post-processing and manual examination of their output is often required to rule out false-positive predictions and precisely describe mutational events.
our method evaluates the support for new sequence junctions present in a clonal sample from split-read alignments to a reference genome, including matches to repeat sequences.
then, it uses a statistical model of read coverage evenness to accept or reject these predictions.
finally, breseq combines predictions of new junctions and deleted chromosomal regions to output biologically relevant descriptions of mutations and their effects on genes.
transposon insertions and large-scale chromosomal changes detected by breseq account for ~25% of spontaneous mutations in this strain.
