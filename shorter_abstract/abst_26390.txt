mollusks represent the largest lophotrochozoan phylum and exhibit highly diverse body plans.
in mollusks, pax2/5/ <dig> is only expressed in derivatives of the ectoderm and hence an ancestral role in molluscan ectoderm differentiation is inferred.
pax2/5/8-expressing cells are present in regions where the future sensory cells such as the polyplacophoran esthetes are situated and hence pax2/5/ <dig> expression probably predates sensory cell development during ontogeny.
expression domains include esthetes and the ampullary system in polyplacophorans as well as the eyes of cephalopods.
in addition, pax2/5/ <dig> is expressed in multimodal sensory systems in mollusks such as the esthetes and the ampullary system of polyplacophorans as well as the eyes of cephalopods.
our results, along with those on otx- and hox-gene expression, demonstrate that the cephalopod condition is similar to that in mouse and fruit fly, with otx being expressed in the anterior-most brain region  and a pax2/5/ <dig> expression domain separating the otx-domain from a hox-gene expressing posterior brain region.
thus, pax2/5/ <dig> appears to have been recruited independently into regionalization of non-homologous complex brains of organisms as different as squid, fruit fly, and mouse.
in contrast, pax2/5/ <dig> is expressed among others in brain lobes along the trajectory of the esophagus that divides the cephalopod brain.
previous studies have demonstrated that transcription factors such as pax genes play important roles during their development.
pax2/5/ <dig> is expressed in regions where sensory cells develop subsequently during ontogenesis.
