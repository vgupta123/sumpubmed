these data demonstrate that elevated bmi resulted in reduced asc proliferation, and potentially compromised osteogenic capacity in vitro; thus bmi is an important criterion to consider in selecting asc donors for clinical applications.
adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ, as it affects a number of physiological functions, and contains adipose tissue-derived stem cells .
it was hypothesized that overweight bmi-ascs would be more compromised in early adipogenic and osteogenic potential, and ability to form colonies in vitro.
ascs can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, and as such are applicable to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing cancer and co-morbidities that are part of the metabolic syndrome.

yet the question of whether asc functionality is affected by the donorâ€™s body mass index  still exists.
ascs were isolated from patients having different bmis , within the ranges of  <dig> - <dig> .
alizarin red staining and rt-pcr for alkaline phosphatase demonstrated that elevated bmi resulted in compromised asc mineralization of extracellular matrix and decreased alkaline phosphatase mrna expression.
