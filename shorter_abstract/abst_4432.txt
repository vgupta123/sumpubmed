here, we document a case of biological adjustment to chronic human disturbance in a colonial seabird, the king penguin , breeding on remote and protected islands of the southern ocean.
from a research perspective, identifying the effects of human disturbance caused by research-related activities is crucial in order to understand and account for potential biases and derive appropriate conclusions from the data.
a central question for ecologists is the extent to which anthropogenic disturbances  might impact wildlife and affect the systems under study.
alternately, whether penguins have actually habituated to anthropogenic disturbances over time or whether human presence has driven the directional selection of human-tolerant phenotypes, remains an open question with profound ecological and conservation implications, and emphasizes the need for more knowledge on the effects of human disturbance on long-term studied populations.
using heart rate  as a measure of the stress response, we show that, in a colony with areas exposed to the continuous presence of humans  for over 50â€‰years, penguins have adjusted to human disturbance and habituated to certain, but not all, types of stressors.
when compared to birds breeding in relatively undisturbed areas, birds in areas of high chronic human disturbance were found to exhibit attenuated hr responses to acute anthropogenic stressors of low-intensity  to which they had been subjected intensely over the years.
