we have developed a modular bioinformatics pipeline to improve genome sequence assemblies, which can handle various types of data.
bioinformatics tools developed in this work can be used to improve genome sequence assemblies in other species.
finally, a consensus gene annotation was projected on the new assembly from two pre-existing annotations.
gbs markers were used to anchor scaffolds to pseudo-molecules with a new bioinformatics approach that avoids the tedious step of marker ordering during genetic map construction.
the pipeline was used to improve the draft genome sequence of musa acuminata.
the release of the musa acuminata reference genome version  <dig> provides a platform for detailed analysis of banana genome variation, function and evolution.

furthermore, a genome map was constructed and used to assemble scaffolds into super scaffolds.
long insert size paired-end reads identified scaffold junctions and fusions missed by automated assembly methods.
the pipeline comprises several semi-automated tools.
