hence, it is evident that these conserved mirnas are of ancient origin and indicate essential functions that have been preserved over long evolutionary time scales.
based on a combined experimental-computational approach, we report on the identification of  <dig> novel mirnas and their putative targets in the moss physcomitrella patens.
eight mirnas were detected with different expression in protonema and gametophore tissue.
thus, the analysis of an early-branching species provides a window into the early evolution of fundamental regulatory processes in plants.
as a result of our study, the number of known mirnas in physcomitrella has been raised to  <dig>  functional assignments to mrnas targeted by these mirnas revealed a bias towards genes that are involved in regulation, cell wall biosynthesis and defense.
