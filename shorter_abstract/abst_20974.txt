conversely, wild cotton species harbor extensive genetic diversity of prospective utility to improve many beneficial agronomic traits, fiber characteristics, and resistance to disease and drought.
overall  <dig>  snps from the five different species have been screened and shown to produce acceptable genotyping assays.
using transcriptome sequencing we have developed the first gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for wild cotton species g. tomentosum, g. mustelinum, g. armourianum and g. longicalyx.
3â€“ <dig>  a total of  <dig>  non-redundant snp markers were developed from the five wild species which can be utilized for interspecific germplasm introgression into cultivated g. hirsutum and are directly associated with genes.
introgression of traits from wild species can provide a natural way to incorporate advantageous traits through breeding to generate higher-producing cotton cultivars and more sustainable production systems.
this large set of  <dig>  snps relative to cultivated g. hirsutum will allow for the first high-density mapping of genes from five wild species that affect traits of interest, including beneficial agronomic and fiber characteristics.
crop production is comprised primarily of g. hirsutum l., an allotetraploid.
over  <dig> of the g. barbadense markers have been validated by whole-genome radiation hybrid mapping.
