laserscanning recently has become a powerful and common method for plant parameterization and plant growth observation on nearly every scale range.
in this report, we introduce a technique for automated classification of point clouds of plants and present the applicability for plant parameterization.
local geometric point features describe class characteristics, which were used to distinguish among different plant organs.
wheat ears were separated with an accuracy of 96% from other plant organs.
• automatic classification of plant organs using geometrical surface information
furthermore the impact of the data resolution was evaluated considering point to point distances between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm with respect to the classification accuracy.
highly reliable classification results of about 96% for the separation of grapevine and wheat organs have been obtained.
the proposed method was successfully transferred to 3d-laserscans of wheat plants for yield estimation.
the primary objective of this research has been to establish a reliable and fast technique for high throughput phenotyping using differentiation, segmentation and classification of single plants by a fully automated system.
its reliability, flexibility and its high order of automation make this method well suited for the demands of high throughput phenotyping.

subsequently, the ear volume was calculated and correlated to the ear weight, the kernel weights and the number of kernels.
however, 3d measurements with high accuracy, spatial resolution and speed result in a multitude of points that require processing and analysis.
• transfer of analysis methods for low resolution point clouds to close-up laser measurements of plants
a surface feature histogram based approach from the field of robotics was adapted to close-up laserscans of plants.
