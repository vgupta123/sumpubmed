thanks to this flexibility, new criteria can be easily added for future expansion.
moreover, rather than progressively discarding variants taking one criterion at a time, the prioritization is achieved by a global positive selection process that considers all transcript isoforms, thus producing reliable results.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
currently, up to  <dig> user-selectable criteria are available, including a wide range of gene and variant features.
queryor is easy to use and its intuitive interface allows to handle different kinds of inheritance as well as features related to sharing variants in different patients.
whole genome and exome sequencing are contributing to the extraordinary progress in the study of human genetic variants.
