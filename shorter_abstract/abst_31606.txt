reduced cb efflux also occurred with sehas k48e or k48f mutants, in which alteration of k <dig> within membrane domain  <dig> causes decreased activity and ha product size.
an earlier study testing many synthetic lipids found that the best activating lipid for sehas is tetraoleoyl cardiolipin  and that, in contrast, tetramyristoyl cardiolipin  is an inactivating lipid .
cb efflux was eliminated or greatly reduced when purified sehas was first treated under conditions that inhibit enzyme activity: heating, oxidization or cysteine modification with n-ethylmaleimide.
consistent with the effects of these cl species on sehas activity, cb efflux was more than 2-fold greater in liposomes made with to-cl compared to tm-cl.
since the mechanism by which ha is translocated across membranes is still unresolved, we assessed the presence of an intraprotein pore within has by adding purified streptococcus equisimilis has  to liposomes preloaded with the fluorophore cascade blue .
the results indicate the presence of an intraprotein pore in has and support a model in which ha is translocated to the exterior by has itself.
the above results used liposomes containing bovine cardiolipin .
