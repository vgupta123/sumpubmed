the erosion of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes, plays an important role in cellular and organismal senescence, signalling the onset of age-related disease due to accumulation of unrepaired somatic damage.
we thus found no significant relationship between change in telomere length and age.
we show that telomeres in this long-lived bird are very well maintained, as theoretically expected, with an average loss rate of only  <dig> base pairs per year among adults.
our results add further support for a link between longevity and telomere maintenance, and highlight the complexities of telomere dynamics in natural populations.
for the first time, we demonstrate a faster telomere attrition rate in females compared to males.
using extensive longitudinal data from a long-term study of a natural population of barnacle geese branta leucopsis, we investigated individual rates of telomere length changes over two years in  <dig> birds between  <dig> and  <dig> years of age, covering almost 80% of the speciesâ€™ lifespan.
we found no correlation between telomere loss rate and adult survival or change in body mass.
species with low investment in early reproduction are thus expected to be able to evolve more efficient maintenance and repair mechanisms, allowing for a longer potential life span .
