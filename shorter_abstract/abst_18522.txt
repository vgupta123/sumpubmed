although prl- <dig> was categorized as a tyrosine phosphatase, its cellular substrates remain largely unknown.
our results revealed a direct interaction between prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig> and characterized y <dig> of integrin β <dig> as a bona fide substrate of prl- <dig>  which is negatively regulated by integrin α <dig>
we demonstrated that prl- <dig> interacts with integrin β <dig> in cancer cells.
recombinant prl- <dig> associates with the intracellular domain of integrin β <dig> in vitro.
with site-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies against residues in the intracellular domain of integrin β <dig>  tyrosine- <dig>  but not tyrosine- <dig>  is shown to be dephosphorylated by prl- <dig> in a catalytic activity-dependant manner.
