the knockdown of robo <dig> abrogated the chemotactic response of endothelial cells to serum but enhanced a chemokinetic response to slit <dig>  while robo <dig> knockdown cells do not display chemotactic response to serum or vegf.
this study identifies specific components of the robo signaling apparatus that work together to guide directional migration of endothelial cells.
in this study, we have investigated gene knockdown analysis of endothelial robos, in particular roundabout  <dig> , the predominant robo in endothelial cells using small interfering rna technology in vitro.
zebrafish robo <dig> rescues both rho gtpase homeostasis and serum reduced chemotaxis in robo <dig> knockdown cells.
robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells unexpectedly show up regulation of rho gtpases.
in addition, this study mechanistically implicates irsp <dig> in the signaling nexus between activated cdc <dig> and mena, both of which have previously been shown to be involved with robo <dig> signaling in endothelial cells.
roundabouts are axon guidance molecules that have recently been identified to play a role in vascular guidance as well.
