however, most previous studies were carried out in a qualitative level, and there are also some inconsistencies between them.
in the present work, to improve interface residue recognition, we built a novel quantitative residue protein-protein interface propensity index  and gained a comprehensive picture of protein-protein interface through analyzing protein-protein interfaces on our comprehensive protein-protein interfaces dataset .
protein-protein interface holds important information of protein-protein interactions which play key roles in most biological processes.
in the past few years, a lot of efforts have been made to improve interface residue recognition by characterizing protein-protein interfaces and extracting relevant features.
furthermore, in order to assess the effect of qipi in improving the protein-protein interface prediction, we developed an interface residue recognition method spr  based on the qipi.
through a comprehensive quantitative analysis of protein-protein interface, we constructed a novel quantitative protein-protein interface propensity index , which could be easily applied to improve the interface residue recognition and helpful in understanding the protein-protein interface.
the evaluation results proved that our novel qipi is able to improve the interface residue recognition.
