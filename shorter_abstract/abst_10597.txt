in the polyploid, most homoeologous genes were expressed at equal levels, though a subset had an expression bias of at and dt copies.
the direction of gene expression bias was conserved in natural and recent polyploids of cotton.
conserved expression bias in polyploid petals may have resulted from cis-acting modifications that occurred prior to polyploidization.

recent research using dna microarrays and rnaseq data have described a cacophony of complex expression patterns during development of cotton fibers, petals, and leaves.
compared to previous studies, a surprising level of expression homeostasis was observed in the expression patterns of polyploid genomes.
some duplicated genes were intriguing exceptions to general trends.
we described three phases in the evolution of cotton genomes that contribute to gene expression in the polyploid nucleus.
because of its highly canalized development, petal tissue has been used as a model tissue for gene expression in cotton.
homoeologous gene expression levels were quantified in diploid and tetraploid flower petals of gossypium using the gossypium raimondii genome sequence as a reference.
conservation of direction of bias and additional comparisons between the diploids and tetraploids suggested different regulation mechanisms of gene expression.
mechanisms of gene regulation for these and other genes in the cotton genome warrants further investigation.
