fasimu can work with free  or commercial solvers .
flux-balance analysis based on linear optimization is widely used to compute metabolic fluxes in large metabolic networks and gains increasingly importance in network curation and structural analysis.
thus, a computational tool flexible enough to realize a wide variety of fba algorithms and able to handle batch series of flux-balance optimizations is of great benefit.
we present fasimu, a command line oriented software for the computation of flux distributions using a variety of the most common fba algorithms, including the first available implementation of  weighted flux minimization,  fitness maximization for partially inhibited enzymes, and  of the concentration-based thermodynamic feasibility constraint.
a new plugin  for bina allows to conveniently visualize calculated flux distributions.
we present a flux-balance optimization program whose main merits are the implementation of thermodynamics as a constraint, batch series of computations, free availability of sources, choice on various external solvers, and the flexibility on metabolic objectives and constraints.
