our results suggest that the rna editing process responds to temperature alterations via two distinct molecular mechanisms: through intrinsic thermo-sensitivity of the rna structures that direct editing, and due to temperature sensitive expression or stability of the rna editing enzyme.
previous reports suggest that rna editing is responsive to environmental inputs in the form of temperature alterations.
using the poikilotherm drosophila, we show that acute temperature alterations within a normal physiological range result in substantial changes in rna editing levels.
environmental cues, in this case temperature, rapidly reprogram the drosophila transcriptome through rna editing, presumably resulting in altered proteomic ratios of edited and unedited proteins.
adenosine-to-inosine rna editing is a highly conserved process that post-transcriptionally modifies mrna, generating proteomic diversity, particularly within the nervous system of metazoans.
lastly, we show that engineered structural variants of the most temperature-sensitive editing site, in a sodium channel transcript, perturb thermal responsiveness in rna editing profile for a particular rna structure.
