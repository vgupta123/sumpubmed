the rt-lamp method with hnb was used to effectively detect astrovirus in reclaimed water samples.
however, the lamp products could be identified as different colors with the naked eye following staining with hydroxynaphthol blue dye .
the aim of this paper was to develop a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  method for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive detection of astrovirus.
the detection limit of lamp using in vitro rna transcripts was  <dig> × <dig> copies·μl- <dig>  which is as sensitive as the presently used pcr assays.
the rt-lamp method can be simply applied for the specific detection of astrovirus and has the potential to be utilized in the field as a screening test.
the lamp technique described in this study is a cheap, sensitive, specific and rapid method for the detection of astrovirus.
