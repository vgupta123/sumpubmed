whole-genome resequencing of ssl508- <dig>  jin5- <dig> and d <dig> was performed to identify the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for this introgression because of the low density of available single sequence repeat markers.
based on expression data and annotation, we identified  <dig> potential candidate genes that may participate in pm resistance afforded by pm <dig> , including two tandemly arrayed genes encoding receptor protein kinases, two transcription factors, two genes encoding remorin proteins, one gene encoding a p-type atpase and one gene encoding a 70 kda heat shock protein.
the transcriptome data also revealed a complex regulatory network for pm <dig> -mediated pm resistance that may involve multiple signal regulators and transducers, cell wall modifications and the salicylic acid signaling pathway.
powdery mildew  is one of the most severe fungal diseases of cucurbits, but the molecular mechanisms underlying pm resistance in cucumber remain elusive.
