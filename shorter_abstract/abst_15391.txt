future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.
in this study, transcriptome data were derived from two arabidopsis ecotypes, ws and col- <dig>  under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing.
this work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving.
comparing the gene expression profiles of ws and col- <dig> in different tilted growth conditions identified  <dig> candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing.
skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures.
the underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear.
this study identified  <dig> genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior.
the genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave , while others skew insignificantly but still wave .
roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface.
these  <dig> genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.
