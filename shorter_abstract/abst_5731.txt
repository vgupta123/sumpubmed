we have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that ec is indeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool.
in this paper we present a novel algorithm, called error corrector , for correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads.

we have developed a novel error correction algorithm called ec and compared it with four other state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.
the error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the erroneous bases of the reads.
to introduce errors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with some probabilities.
real reads that we have employed in our performance evaluation are illumina-generated short reads of various lengths.
six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken from sequence and read archive  at ncbi.
in highly parallel next-generation sequencing  techniques millions to billions of short reads are produced from a genomic sequence in a single run.
the simulated reads are obtained by picking substrings from random positions of reference genomes.
we plan to investigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this research paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.
