in the second case, cohort analysis of multiple patients is carried out to derive overall molecular signatures for the cohort.
our procedure is convenient for analyzing dna copy number in two general situations:  when using data from multiple sources and  when using cohort analysis of multiple patients suffering from the same type of cancer.
to locate such regions, we propose a circular binary segmentation procedure, which is based on a sequence of nested hypothesis tests, each using the bayesian information criterion.
in the framework, the multiple sequences from various sources are integrated into a single sequence, and then the proposed segmentation procedure is applied to this sequence to detect aberrant regions.
the proposed segmentation procedure is then applied to the standardized profiles one at a time to detect aberrant regions.
variation in dna copy number, due to gains and losses of chromosome segments, is common.
a first step for analyzing dna copy number data is to identify amplified or deleted regions in individuals.
in the first case, data from multiple sources such as different platforms, labs, or preprocessing methods are used to study variation in copy number in the same individual.

for this case, we provide another simple statistical framework in which data across multiple profiles is standardized before segmentation.
in this case, we provide a simple statistical framework to derive a consensus molecular signature.
