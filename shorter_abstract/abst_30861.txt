in this work, we have characterized the wheat bac  clones containing spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> sequences, which belong to the subtelomeric repeats of the b/g genomes of wheats and aegilops species from the section sitopsis.
additionally, four of the predicted 2050o <dig> genes showed significant homology to four putative orthologous rice genes in the distal part of rice chromosome 3s and confirm the synteny to wheat 4bl.
our research provides new insights into the microcollinearity in the terminal regions of wheat chromosomes 4bl and rice chromosome 3s.
dna transposons are predominant, making up  <dig> % of the entire bac clone, whereas retroelements account for  <dig> % of the clone length.
the full-length cacta transposon caspar covers  <dig>  <dig> bp, encoding a transposase and ctg- <dig> proteins, and this transposon accounts for 40% of the dna transposons.
the in situ hybridization data for 2050o <dig> derived subclones in combination with the blast search against wheat mapped ests  suggest that clone 2050o <dig> is located in the terminal bin 4bl- <dig> .
it has been demonstrated for the first time that spelt <dig> sequences were involved in the evolution of terminal regions of common wheat chromosomes.
nine positive clones were isolated; of them, clone 2050o <dig> was localized mainly to the distal parts of wheat chromosomes by in situ hybridization.
it is composed of 33% transposable elements ,  <dig> % spelt <dig>  and five non-te-related genes.
the bac library from triticum aestivum cv.
satellite dna sequences from the subtelomeric regions of diploid wheat progenitor can be used for selecting the bac clones from the corresponding regions of hexaploid wheat chromosomes.
the distribution of the other clones indicated the presence of different types of repetitive sequences in bacs.
telomeric and subtelomeric regions are essential for genome stability and regular chromosome replication.
