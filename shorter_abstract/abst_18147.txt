elasmobranch fishes are an ancient group of vertebrates which have high potential as model species for research into evolutionary physiology and genomics.
the results emphasise the importance of inter-group variation in reference gene evaluation.
our results indicate that eef1b and ubq are generally the most suitable reference genes for the conditions and tissues in the present epaulette shark studies.
here we examined the suitability of  <dig> reference candidates from various functional categories after a single hypoxic insult or after hypoxia preconditioning in epaulette shark .
epaulette sharks were caught and exposed to hypoxia.
notably, in one tissue the analysis of variance indicated statistically significant differences between treatments for genes that were ranked as the most stable candidates by reference gene software.
we produced sequence information for reference gene candidates and monitored mrna expression levels in four tissues: cerebellum, heart, gill and eye.
these genes could also be potential reference gene candidates for other physiological studies examining stress in elasmobranchs.
oxygen availability has been a major force shaping the physiological evolution of vertebrates, especially fishes.
tissues were collected from  <dig> controls,  <dig> individuals with single hypoxic insult and  <dig> individuals with hypoxia preconditioning .
however, no comparative studies have established suitable reference genes for quantitative pcr  in elasmobranchs for any physiological conditions.
