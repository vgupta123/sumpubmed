as a first step to remedy this discrepancy a cdna library has been developed from salicylate-treated, whole-plant tissues and over  <dig> expressed sequence tags  have been sequenced and analyzed.
many potentially fruitful research avenues, especially large-scale gene expression surveys and development of molecular genetic markers have been limited by a lack of sequence information in public databases.
this report represents a first step in expanding molecular-genetic analyses in strawberry and demonstrates how computational tools can be used to optimally mine a large body of useful information from a relatively small data set.
homology searches indicate that  <dig> % of sequences share significant similarity to known/putative proteins or rosaceae ests.
