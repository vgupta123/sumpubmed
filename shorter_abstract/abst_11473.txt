we illustrate their potential use in a workflow analysing a generic rt-qpcr experiment, and apply this to a real dataset.
the selection of the optimal reference gene for the normalisation of this data is a recurring problem, and several algorithms have been developed in order to solve it.
so far nothing in r exists to unite these methods, together with other functions to read in and normalise the data using the chosen reference gene.
these packages increase the repetoire of rt-qpcr analysis tools available to the r user and allow them to  read their data into r, hold it in an expressionset compatible r object, choose appropriate reference genes, normalise the data and look for differential expression between samples.
we have developed two r/bioconductor packages, readqpcr and normqpcr, intended for a user with some experience with high-throughput data analysis using r, who wishes to use r to analyse rt-qpcr data.
