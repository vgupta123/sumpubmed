tgip in vertebrates is mainly maternal and short-term, supporting the adaptive immune system of the offspring during its maturation.
in a system with male pregnancy, grandparents influenced the immune system of their grandoffspring in a sex-specific manner, demonstrating multigenerational biparental tgip.
the involvement of epigenetic effects suggests that tgip via the paternal line may not be limited to the pipefish system that displays male pregnancy.
while the benefits and costs of grandparental tgip depend on the temporal heterogeneity of environmental conditions, multigenerational tgip may affect host-parasite coevolution by dampening the amplitude of red queen dynamics.
while grand-maternal impact was strong on genes of the complement component system, grand-paternal exposure changed expression patterns of genes mediating innate immune defense.
in many systems parental parasite experience influences offspring immune responses, known as transgenerational immune priming .
similarly, genes mediating epigenetic regulation including dna-methylation and histone modifications were involved in grandparental immune priming.
here, we investigate multigenerational biparental tgip in the sex-role reversed pipefish syngnathus typhle by exposing grandparents to an immune challenge with heat-killed bacteria and assessing gene expression  of the f2-generation.
grandparental immune challenge induced gene expression of immune genes in one-week-old grandoffspring.

biparental tgip may result in maximized immunological protection.
