the phytohormone abscisic acid  is involved in the regulation of various such processes, including stomatal closure, seed and bud dormancy, and physiological responses to cold, drought and salinity stress.
furthermore, we detected distinct combinations, orientation patterns and dna strand preferences of abre and ce <dig> motifs in rice gene promoters.
abre-abre pairs are common in both genomes, suggesting that these can form functional aba-responsive complexes  in arabidopsis and rice.
our results show that arabidopsis and rice use the aba-responsive elements abre and ce <dig> distinctively.
the increasing availability of genomic sequences and gene expression data enables us to dissect aba regulatory mechanisms at the individual gene expression level.
in plants, complex regulatory mechanisms are at the core of physiological and developmental processes.
the apparent absence of ce3s in arabidopsis suggests that another ce pairs with abre to establish a functional abrc capable of interacting with transcription factors.
our computational analyses revealed distinct recruitment patterns of aba-responsive cres in upstream sequences of arabidopsis and rice.
