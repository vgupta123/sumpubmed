in silico analysis indicated that all  <dig> rghs had est support for gene expression.
comparative analysis revealed high-degree sequence homology and synteny in chromosomal locations of these rgh members between the cucumber and melon genomes.
all rghs seem to be transcribed and shared significant sequence homology and synteny with the melon genome suggesting conservation of these rghs in the cucumis lineage.
cucumber has a very narrow genetic base making it difficult to construct high-density genetic maps.
fifty-four molecular markers were developed to delimit  <dig> of the  <dig> rghs, which were integrated into a genetic map through linkage analysis.

a  <dig> -locus cucumber consensus map including  <dig> gene loci and spanning  <dig> Â cm in seven linkage groups was developed by integrating three component maps with a bin-mapping strategy.
cucumber contains relatively few nb-lrr rghs that are clustered and unevenly distributed in the genome.
the  <dig> -locus consensus genetic-physical map developed and the rghs identified and characterized herein are valuable genomics resources that may have many applications such as quantitative trait loci identification, map-based gene cloning, association mapping, marker-assisted selection, as well as assembly of a more complete cucumber genome.
cucumber is an important vegetable crop that is susceptible to many pathogens, but no disease resistance  genes have been cloned.
phylogenetic analysis classified  <dig> rghs into two clades: cnl and tnl.
development of a consensus map by synthesizing information from multiple segregating populations is a method of choice to increase marker density.
as such, the objectives of the present study were to identify and characterize nb-lrr type rghs, and to develop a high-density, integrated cucumber genetic-physical map anchored with rgh loci.
physically,  <dig> scaffolds with  <dig>  mbp total dna sequences were anchored onto this consensus map that covered  <dig> % of the  <dig> mbp cucumber genome.
the availability of whole genome sequences provides an excellent opportunity for systematic identification and characterization of the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat  type r gene homolog  sequences in the genome.
