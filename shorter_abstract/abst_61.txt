since members of the tetr family of repressors regulate enzymes and pumps acting upon almost every known antibiotic and a wide range of other small molecules, reporter systems with the same design as presented here, but employing heterologous tetr-related proteins, could be developed to measure enzymatic activities against a wide range of antibiotics and other compounds.
in this system, expression of the lux operon is regulated by the tetracycline repressor, tetr, which is expressed from the same plasmid under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter.
data generated for the tetx enzyme using the reporter system could be effectively fit with the known km and kcat values, demonstrating the usefulness of this system for quantitative analyses.
we have constructed a sensitive reporter system in escherichia coli that can be used to detect and characterize the activity of enzymes that act upon the antibiotic, tetracycline and its derivatives.
addition of very low concentrations of tetracycline derivatives, well below growth inhibitory concentrations, resulted in luminescence production as a result of expression of the lux genes carried by the reporter plasmid.
