by the time of onset of the adaptive immune response around  <dig> days post-infection, malaria co-infection had reduced pulmonary expression of chaffs.
co-infected animals received both infections on the same day, and disease was assessed daily before immunological measurements were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days post-infection.
assessment of the t cell response demonstrated that the th <dig> response to the nematode was also significantly impaired by malaria co-infection.
given recent work from other laboratories showing that n. brasiliensis-induced chaffs correlate to the extent of long-term lung damage, our results raise the possibility that co-infection with malaria might alter pulmonary repair processes following nematode migration.
the larvae induce strong pulmonary type  <dig> immune responses, including t-helper  <dig> cells as well as alternatively activated macrophages  and associated chitinase and fizz/resistin family members , which are thought to promote tissue repair processes.
we observed that the nematodes themselves caused transient loss of body mass and red blood cell density, but co-infection then slightly ameliorated the severity of malarial anaemia.
we also tracked the development of immune responses in the lung and thoracic lymph node.
further experimentation in the co-infection model developed here will reveal the longer-term consequences of the presence of both malaria and helminths in the lung.
larvae of several common species of parasitic nematodes obligately migrate through, and often damage, host lungs.
