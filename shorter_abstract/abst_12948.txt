an analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company.
we report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient fit, and tajimaâ€™s d, are sensitive to this problem to various extents.
control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination.
using cytochrome oxidase  <dig> as a barcode, we identified a minimum of  <dig> events of between-species contamination, with approximately 80% of our samples being affected.
we introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts.
