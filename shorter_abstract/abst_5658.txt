we focused our investigation on the snp g.3836a>g, because in silico analysis and knowledge about the regulation of spp <dig> suggested an effect of this snp on a ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta  responsive transcriptional enhancer.
this snp affects the function of the spp <dig> gene at the dna level by affecting a c/ebpβ binding site and at the rna level by activating aberrant splicing of the first intron, and thus represents an interesting dna-marker to study phenotypic effects of spp <dig> dna-variation.
with the aim to identify putative contributing cis-regulatory dna variation we resequenced the 5' upstream region of the gene in the respective breeds pietrain and duroc.
using electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that, similar to human spp <dig>  the 3' terminal end of the first intron of porcine spp <dig> harbors a c/ebpβ binding site and showed that this binding site is negatively affected by the mutant g allele.
at the 3' terminal end of the first intron of the porcine spp <dig> we identified a unique, dually functional snp g.3836a>g.
using real-time quantitative pcr we showed that, consistent with its negative effect on a transcriptional enhancer element, the g allele tends to decrease mrna abundance of spp <dig> in the fetal musculus longissimus dorsi .
secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  is a multifunctional matricellular glycoprotein involved in development and regeneration of skeletal muscle.
moreover, we showed that the snp g.3836a>g leads to ubiquitous aberrant splicing of the first intron by generating a de novo and activating a cryptic splice acceptor site.
previously, we have demonstrated that porcine spp <dig> shows breed-related differential mrna expression during myogenesis.
genotyping of  <dig> fetuses per breed revealed that the g allele segregated exclusively in duroc fetuses with a frequency of  <dig> percent.
aberrantly spliced transcripts comprise about half of the spp <dig> messages expressed by the g allele.
