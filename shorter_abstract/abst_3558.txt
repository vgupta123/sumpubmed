<dig> inbred lines from the ames panel were genotyped with  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism markers using genotyping-by-sequencing technology and  <dig> seedling root architecture traits were phenotyped.
this study identifies putatively associated snp markers associated with root traits at the seedling stage.
these and respective linked or functional markers could be targets for breeders for marker assisted selection of seedling root traits.
gene model grmzm2g <dig> located on chromosome  <dig> contained nine significant markers.
analysis of significant snp markers for multiple traits showed that several were located within gene models with some snp markers localized within regions of previously identified root quantitative trait loci.
some snps were located within or near  gene models.
these gene models identify possible candidate genes involved in root development at the seedling stage.
a genome wide association analysis enables one to analyze allelic diversity of complex traits and identify superior alleles.
plants rely on the root system for anchorage to the ground and the acquisition and absorption of nutrients critical to sustaining productivity.
