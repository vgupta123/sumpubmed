sorghum is mainly used as a human food and beverage source, playing an important role in the production of ethanol and other bio-industrial products.
this map can provide information and serve as a reference for effective gene exploration, and for marker assisted-breeding program.
a high-throughput sequencing method was adopted to screen slaf markers with 130 f <dig> individuals from a cross between a grain sorghum variety, j <dig>  and a sweet sorghum variety, keter.
genetic map construction is the foundation for marker-assisted selection and gene cloning.
in the present study,  <dig>  suitable slaf markers out of  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads were chosen to conduct genetic map construction,  <dig> % of which were polymorphic.
the markers on each chromosome ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig> , the distance between adjacent markers ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  cm  with an average distance of only  <dig>  cm.
a high-density linkage map was constructed using specific-locus amplified fragments  markers.
however marker numbers and chromosome coverage are limited.
the total length was  <dig>  cm covering all  <dig> chromosomes with a total number of  <dig> slaf markers.
as a result, it is difficult to get consistent results and the maps are hard to unify.
so far several sorghum linkage maps have been reported using different kinds of molecular markers.
finally  <dig> slaf markers were obtained to construct a high-density genetic linkage map.
the total distance of linkage map covering all  <dig> chromosomes was  <dig>  cm.

thus it is regarded as a model crop for energy plants.
in the present study, the genomes of  <dig> individuals consisting an f <dig> population together with their parents were surveyed using a high-throughput sequencing technique.
