the purified enzyme showed an endopeptidase activity, which effectively cleaved α s1- and β- casein substrates at carboxyl-terminus as well as at multiple internal sites.
the gene was derived from a newly isolated p. lautus chn <dig> strain exhibiting a high protease activity in the skim milk assay.
carboxyl-terminal protease  plays essential functions in posttranslational protein processing in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
furthermore, ctpap exhibited a high activity at room temperature and strong tolerance to conventional protease inhibitors, demonstrating that ctpap is a novel endopeptidase.
the deduced mature protein contains  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, displaying 29-38% amino acid sequence identity to characterized bacterial ctpa enzymes.
recombinant protein was obtained from protein over-expression in escherichia coli and the biochemical properties of the enzyme were investigated.
the encoding gene, ctpap , was derived from p. lautus chn <dig>  a gram-positive bacterium isolated by functional screening.
we have demonstrated that ctpap is a novel endopeptidase with distinct cleavage specificities, showing a strong potential in biotechnology and industry applications.
ctpap was expressed as a recombinant protein and characterized.
