we propose several statistical models and different methods to compute and test a heritability measure for such data based on linear and generalized linear mixed effects models.
heritability of a phenotypic or molecular trait measures the proportion of variance that is attributable to genotypic variance.
the models and methods we investigated in this manuscript is applicable and extendable to sequencing experiments where some biological replicates are available and the environmental variation is properly controlled.
cp-fit performed best in terms of the coverage of the confidence intervals.
nb-fit and vst appear to be more robust than cp-fit for estimating and testing the heritability scores, while nb-fit is the most computationally expensive.
we show that mirna and mrna expression can be a highly heritable molecular trait in mouse, and that some top heritable features coincide with expression quantitative trait loci.
in addition, we applied the methods to both microrna  and messenger rna  sequencing datasets from a recombinant inbred mouse panel.
all the methods presented, as well as the generation of simulated sequencing data under either negative binomial or compound poisson mixed models, are provided in the r package heritseq.
our analyses show that, among the methods, the negative binomial mixed model , compound poisson mixed model , and the variance stabilizing transformed linear mixed model  outperform the voom-transformed linear mixed model .
