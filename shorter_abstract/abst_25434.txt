at subsequent larval stages, amphihtt expression is detected in the neural tube, with the strongest signal being present in the most anterior part.
amphihtt expression is detectable by in situ hybridization starting from the early neurula stage, where it is found in cells of the neural plate.
sequence conservation is greater along the entire length of the protein than in a previously identified ciona huntingtin.
in this report, we show that the exon-intron organization of the amphioxus huntingtin gene is highly conserved with that of other vertebrates species.
the cloning of amphioxus huntingtin allows to infer that the polyq in huntingtin was already present  <dig> million years ago and provides a further element for the study of huntingtin function and its evolution along the deuterostome branch.
in order to investigate the hypothesis that huntingtin was already involved in development of the nervous system in the last common ancestor of chordates, we isolated and characterised the huntingtin homologue from the amphioxus branchiostoma floridae.
at later stages, it is retained in the neural compartment but also it appears in limited and well-defined groups of non-neural cells.
the amphihtt protein has two glutamine residues in the position of the typical vertebrate polyq tract.
the first three n-terminal heat repeats are highly conserved in vertebrates and amphioxus, although exon rearrangement has occurred in this region.
