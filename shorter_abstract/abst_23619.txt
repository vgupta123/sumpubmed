others recently showed that the 3d structure of mammalian vps <dig> and the biochemical function of the yeast alpha arrestin palf are similar to those of beta arrestins.
we note that only alpha arrestins have py motifs  in their c-terminal tails, and only visual/betas have helix i in the arrestin n domain.
g protein coupled receptors  are the most numerous proteins in mammalian genomes, and the most common targets of clinical drugs.
gpcrs are intimately associated with trimeric g proteins, g protein receptor kinases, and arrestins.
our arrestin findings have implications on the evolution of gpcr signaling, and on the biological roles of human alpha arrestins.
that finding is consistent with darwin's theory that eyes evolved once, and lends some support to parker's hypothesis that vision triggered the cambrian explosion of life forms.
we identified ciliary opsins in cnidaria and propose this subfamily is ancestral to all previously known animal opsins.
curiously, we identified both the oldest visual/beta arrestin and opsin genes in cnidaria .
we found that the arrestin clan is comprised of the spo0m protein family in archaea and bacteria, and the arrestin and vps <dig> families in eukaryotes.
the arrestin clan has  <dig> human members:  <dig> alphas,  <dig> visual/betas, and  <dig> vps <dig> genes.
