co-expression network analysis suggested many lncrnas in cleavage stage embryos are associated with cell cycle regulation, transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation to regulate the process of cleavage stage embryonic development.
we reconstructed  <dig>  high-confidence transcripts in  <dig>  loci, and identified  <dig> novel lncrnas from  <dig> loci expressed in mouse cleavage stage embryos.
these lncrnas share similar characteristics with previously reported vertebrate lncrnas, such as relatively short length, low exon number, low expression level and low sequence conservation.
this study provides the first catalog of lncrnas expressed in mouse cleavage stage embryos and gives a revealing insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for early embryonic development.
expression profile analysis revealed that the profiles of lncrna vary considerably at different stages of cleavage stage embryos, suggesting that many lncrnas in cleavage stage embryos are stage-specifically expressed.
