biological nitrogen fixation in root nodules is a process of great importance to crops of soybean , as it may provide the bulk of the plant’s needs for nitrogen.
during nodule formation, a higher percentage of genes were related to primary metabolism, cell-wall modifications and the antioxidant defense system.
the data were grouped according to the ontologies of the molecular functions and biological processes.
this research aimed at analyzing the global expression of genes in soybean roots of a brazilian cultivar  inoculated with bradyrhizobium japonicum cpac  <dig>  a strain broadly used in commercial inoculants in brazil.
the subtractive library  of soybean roots resulted in  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts at 10 days after inoculation were studied.
