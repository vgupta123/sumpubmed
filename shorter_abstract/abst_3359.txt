it revealed several defense qtls, including one on chromosome x comprising the npr- <dig> gene.
the wildtype n <dig> allele for the latter qtl was associated with reduced defense against b. thuringiensis and thus produced an opposite phenotype to that previously reported for the n <dig> npr- <dig> allele against p. aeruginosa.
importantly, increased defense towards p. aeruginosa seems to be additionally influenced through the induction of oxidative stress genes and activation of gata transcription factors, while the repression of oxidative stress genes combined with activation of ebox transcription factors appears to enhance susceptibility to b. thuringiensis.
the qtl analysis focused on behavioral immune defense against b. thuringiensis, using recombinant inbred lines  and introgression lines .

we demonstrate in the model invertebrate caenorhabditis elegans that a single gene, a homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide y receptor gene, npr- <dig>  mediates contrasting defense phenotypes towards two distinct pathogens, the gram-positive bacillus thuringiensis and the gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the invertebrate immune system comprises physiological mechanisms, physical barriers and also behavioral responses.
it is generally related to the vertebrate innate immune system and widely believed to provide nonspecific defense against pathogens, whereby the response to different pathogen types is usually mediated by distinct signalling cascades.
analysis of npr- <dig> mutants confirmed these contrasting immune phenotypes for both avoidance behavior and nematode survival.
