our studies provided new information about the role of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the infection process, the change of their structure and the expression of genes participating in their metabolism during the pathogen infection.
the main aim of the study was to evaluate the role of the cell wall polymers in the flax plant response to the infection in order to better understand the process of resistance and develop new ways to protect plants against infection.
fusarium oxysporum infection leads to fusarium-derived wilt, which is responsible for the greatest losses in flax  crop yield.
plants infected by fusarium oxysporum show severe symptoms of dehydration due to the growth of the fungus in vascular tissues.
for this purpose, the expression of genes involved in cell wall polymer metabolism and corresponding polymer levels were investigated in flax seedlings after incubation with fusarium oxysporum.
fusarium oxysporum infection did not affect the contents of cell wall polymers, but changed their structure.
the results suggest that the role of the cell wall polymers in the plant response to fusarium oxysporum infection is manifested through changes in expression of their genes and rearrangement of the cell wall polymers.

we also confirmed the role of pectin and lignin in this process, indicating the major changes at the mrna level of lignin metabolism genes and the loosening of the pectin structure.
