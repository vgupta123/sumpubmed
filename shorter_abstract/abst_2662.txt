however, by combining available gene expression data with qtl mapping, we illustrated a five-filter protocol that nominated asb <dig> and tnni <dig> as candidates affecting increased mouse forebrain weight.
under these circumstances, measurement of the phenotype in the bxd lines will likely also deliver excellent candidate genes.
qtl mapping of mouse forebrain weight in  <dig> bxd ri lines found significant association on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  with each c57bl/6j allele increasing weight by more than half a standard deviation.
this prompted us to propose a simple five-filter protocol for candidate nomination.
to filter more likely from less likely candidates, we required candidate genes near to the qtl to have mrna abundance that correlated with the phenotype among the bxd lines as well as differed between the parental lines c57bl/6j and dba/2j.
we also required verification of mrna abundance by an independent method, and finally we required either differences in protein levels or confirmed dna sequence differences.
the intersection of gene lists that were within Â±  <dig> mb of the strongest associated location, that had forebrain mrna abundance correlated with forebrain weight among the bxd, and that had forebrain mrna abundance differing between c57bl/6j and dba/2j, produced two candidates, tnni <dig>  and asb <dig> .
successful strategies for qtl gene identification benefit from combined experimental and bioinformatic approaches.
we recommend our approach when  investigators are working with phenotypic differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j, and  gene expression data are available on  that relate to the phenotype of interest.
delivery of well supported candidate genes following a single quantitative trait locus mapping experiment is difficult.
