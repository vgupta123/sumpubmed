to identify genes involved in cold acclimation , a high-throughput sequencing technology was applied.
although a. mongolicus is an ideal model to study the plant response to cold stress, insufficient genomic resources for this species are available in public databases.
we sequenced cold-treated and control  samples of a. mongolicus and obtained large numbers of unigenes annotated to public databases.
after de novo assembly and quantitative assessment,  <dig> all-unigenes were finally generated with an average length of 816Â bp.
based on these results, a series of candidate genes involved in cold responsive pathways were selected and discussed.
we sequenced cold-treated and control  samples of a. mongolicus, and obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads, respectively.
in this study, we identified a large set of cdna unigenes from a. mongolicus.
we then obtained functional annotations by aligning all-unigenes with public protein databases including nr, swissprot, kegg and cog.
finally,  <dig> of the candidate genes that were up-regulated and known to be associated with cold stress were examined using qrt-pcr.
moreover, we analyzed transcription factors, and found  <dig> of them are differentially expressed.
studies of differentially expressed genes involved in cold-related metabolic pathways and transcription factors facilitate the discovery of cold-resistance genes.
differentially expressed genes  were investigated using the rpkm method.
