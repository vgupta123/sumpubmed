we analysed the distribution of initial frame disruptions in dmrnas with respect to positions of:  protein domains,  alternatively-spliced exons, and  regions susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay .
efforts to gather genomic evidence for the processes of gene evolution are ongoing, and are closely coupled to improved gene annotation methods.
our results indicate largely negative selection pressures related to frame disruption during gene evolution.
we find significant avoidance of protein-domain disruption , and highly significant overrepresentation of disruptions in alternatively-spliced exons, and 'non-nmd' regions.
significant dmrna subpopulations include: zinc-finger-containing transcription factors with long disrupted exons, and antisense homologies to distal genes.
we do not find any evidence for evolution of novelty in protein structures through frameshifting.
