moreover, we also provide various fast approximation algorithms for the computation of gap, fom and wcss.
the approximation algorithms for the computation of fom, gap and wcss perform very well, i.e., they are faster while still granting a very close approximation of fom and wcss.
we perform extensive experiments on six benchmark microarray datasets, using both hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms, and we provide an analysis assessing both the intrinsic ability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and its merit relative to the other measures.
inferring cluster structure in microarray datasets is a fundamental task for the so-called -omic sciences.
despite the wealth of internal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently proposed, some of them specifically for microarray data.
based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions for the use of those internal measures on microarray data.
it is also a fundamental question in statistics, data analysis and classification, in particular with regard to the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset, usually established via internal validation measures.
consensus is by far the best performer in terms of predictive power and remarkably algorithm-independent.
fom is the second best performer although, quite surprisingly, it may not be competitive in this scenario: it has essentially the same predictive power of wcss but it is from  <dig> to  <dig> times slower in time, depending on the dataset.
the approximation algorithm for the computation of gap deserves to be singled-out since it has a predictive power far better than gap, it is competitive with the other measures, but it is at least two order of magnitude faster in time with respect to gap.
we consider five such measures: clest, consensus , fom , gap  and me , in addition to the classic wcss  and kl .
another important novel conclusion that can be drawn from our analysis is that all the measures we have considered show severe limitations on large datasets, either due to computational demand  or to lack of precision .
unfortunately, on large datasets, it may be of no use because of its non-trivial computer time demand .
we pay particular attention both to precision and speed.
