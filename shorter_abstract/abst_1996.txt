we analyzed the expression pattern of  <dig> representative effector candidate genes on four host plants and revealed diverse expression patterns.
we focused on those showing  protein domains and motifs found in known fungal effectors,  signatures of positive selection,  recent gene duplication, or  being s. sclerotiorum-specific.
we combined bioinformatics approaches to determine the repertoire of s. sclerotiorum effector candidates and conducted detailed sequence and expression analyses on selected candidates.
these results reveal diverse predicted functions and expression patterns in the repertoire of s. sclerotiorum effector candidates.
we identified 486â€‰s. sclerotiorum secreted protein genes expressed in planta, many of which have no predicted enzymatic activity and may be involved in the interaction between the fungus and its hosts.
the white mold fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating necrotrophic plant pathogen with a remarkably broad host range.
they will facilitate the functional analysis of fungal pathogenicity determinants and should prove useful in the search for plant quantitative disease resistance components active against the white mold.
