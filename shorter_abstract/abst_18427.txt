the vsp gene diversity includes  <dig> genes containing tandem repeats, and  <dig> vsp pairs of identical genes present in either head to head or tail to tail configurations , where the two genes are separated by  <dig> to  <dig> kb of non-coding dna.
lastly, evidence for recombination within and across minor clades of vsp genes is provided.
the data we present here is the first comprehensive analysis of the vsp gene family from the genotype a <dig> wb isolate with an emphasis on vsp characterization, function, evolution and contributions to pathogenesis of this important pathogen.
the wb giardia isolate has been sequenced at 10Ã— coverage and assembled into  <dig> contigs as large as  <dig> kb in size.
we have used this assembly to evaluate the genomic organization and evolution of the vsp repertoire.
interestingly, over half the total vsp repertoire is present in the form of linear gene arrays that can contain up to  <dig> vsp gene members.
giardia lamblia trophozoites colonize the intestines of susceptible mammals and cause diarrhea, which can be prolonged despite an intestinal immune response.
