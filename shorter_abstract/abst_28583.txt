the above biological actions are regulated by src, erk1/ <dig>  akt and fak kinases as we found that n6l inhibits their activation in huvecs.
finally, down regulation of nucleolin using sirna demonstrated the implication of nucleolin in the biological actions of these peptides.
taken together, these results indicate that n6l could constitute an interesting therapeutic tool for treating diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis.
we provide evidence that n6l inhibits the in vitro adhesion, proliferation and migration of huvecs without inducing their apoptosis.
recent studies have underlined the involvement of cell surface nucleolin in angiogenesis processes.
