alternative polyadenylation  plays an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.
this is suggestive of important roles for antisense regulation of these target genes.
the results show that 64% of m. truncatula genes possess more than one poly site, comparable to the percentages reported for arabidopsis and rice.
in addition, the poly signals associated with m. truncatula genes were similar to those seen in arabidopsis and other plants.
our results reveal some distinct patterns of sense and antisense poly sites in arabidopsis and m. truncatula.
in this study, a collection of poly sites in medicago truncatula, a model system for legume plants, has been generated and compared with apa sites in arabidopsis thaliana.

very little conservation of intronic poly sites was found between arabidopsis and m. truncatula, which suggests that such sites are likely to be species-specific in plants.
little is known about how apa sites may evolve in homologous genes in different plant species.
a sizeable number of m. truncatula antisense poly sites were found.
the 3′-utr lengths are correlated in pairs of orthologous genes between m. truncatula and arabidopsis.
the poly tags from a deep-sequencing protocol were mapped to the annotated m. truncatula genome, and the identified poly sites used to update the annotations of  <dig>  genes.
a high percentage of the associated target genes possess arabidopsis orthologs that are also associated with antisense sites.
