we show that drif <dig> is nuclear localized with a prominent heterochromatin association and unlike human rif <dig>  it does not respond to dna damage by localizing to damaged sites.
in yeast, drif <dig> did not perturb yeast rif <dig>  functions; and in hela cells it did not colocalize with dna damage foci.
functional studies show that drif <dig> responds differently to dna damage, implying that drif <dig> may have a different function and this may be conserved in other organisms as well.
our analysis shows that drosophila rif <dig>  sequence is phylogenetically closer to the one of vertebrates than yeast and has identified a few rif <dig> specific motifs conserved through evolution.
we have carried out detailed bioinformatic analyses and identified rif <dig> homologues in  <dig> organisms from yeast to human.
rap <dig> interacting factor  <dig> , was identified as a protein involved in telomere length regulation in yeast.
rif <dig> is conserved upto mammals but its function has diversified from telomere length regulation to maintenance of genome integrity.
telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes which maintain the genome integrity by regulating telomere length, preventing recombination and end to end fusion events.
to test the evolutionary conservation of drif <dig> function, we expressed the drif <dig> protein in yeast and hela cells.
multiple proteins associate with telomeres and function in concert to carry out these functions.
