intriguingly, two main types of vamp <dig> isoforms either share the inhibitory longin domain and lack the fusion-promoting snare motif, or vice versa.
longins are essential in eukaryotes and prototyped by vamp <dig>  sec22b and ykt <dig>  sharing a conserved n-terminal longin domain which regulates membrane fusion and subcellular targeting.
alternative splicing has been reported for several soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors of the vesicle  or of the target membrane , which are crucial to intracellular membrane fusion and protein and lipid traffic in eukaryotes.
when considering splice variants as "natural mutants", evidence on modulation of subcellular localization by variation in domain combination can shed further light on targeting determinants.
expression analysis in different tissues and cell lines, quantitative real time rt-pcr and confocal microscopy analysis of fluorescent protein-tagged isoforms demonstrate that vamp <dig> variants have different tissue specificities and subcellular localizations.
alternative splicing of sybl <dig> by exon skipping events results in the production of a number of vamp <dig> isoforms.
moreover, design and use of isoform-specific antibodies provided preliminary evidence for the existence of splice variants at the protein level.
previous evidence on vamp <dig> suggests inhibitory functions for the longin domain and fusion/growth promoting activity for the Î”-longin molecule.
thus, non-snare isoforms with longin domain and non-longin snare isoforms might have somehow opposite regulatory functions.
human vamp7/ti-vamp, encoded by gene sybl <dig>  is involved in multiple cell pathways, including control of neurite outgrowth.
