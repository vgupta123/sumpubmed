dna was recovered from washes of epiphytic surfaces of tomato anatomical organs; leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits of solanum lycopersicum , grown at a site in close proximity to commercial farms previously implicated in tomato-salmonella outbreaks.

distinct groupings of microbial communities were associated with different tomato plant organs and a gradient of compositional similarity could be correlated to the distance of a given plant part from the soil.
unique bacterial phylotypes  were associated with fruits and flowers of tomato plants.
the most frequently observed bacterial taxa across aerial plant regions were pseudomonas and xanthomonas.
specific anatomical niches of plants may contribute to persistence of human pathogens in agricultural environments in ways we have yet to describe.
