the support vector machine  algorithm was utilized to construct an automatic detector for tf identification, where protein domains and functional sites were employed as feature vectors.
the svm method was a valid and stable means for tfs identification with protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors.
when combined with svm method, it can remarkably increase the accuracy of tf classification using protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors.
error-correcting output coding  algorithm, which was originated from information and communication engineering fields, was introduced to combine with support vector machine  methodology for tf classification.
transcription factors  are core functional proteins which play important roles in gene expression control, and they are key factors for gene regulation network construction.
in addition, our work implied that ecoc algorithm may succeed in a broad range of applications in biological data mining.
