both tkts were thermo stable at physiological temperature  with the highest activity at neutral ph.
bacillus methanolicus is a facultative rump pathway methylotroph.
unlike the recently characterized rump pathway enzymes fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase  and fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase/sedoheptulose  <dig> -bisphosphatase  from b. methanolicus mga <dig>  both tkts exhibited similar kinetic parameters although they only share 76% identical amino acids.
during growth with methanol  argues for tktp being the major tkt relevant in the rump pathway.
transketolase  is a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway , the calvin cycle and the ribulose monophosphate  cycle.
the kinetic parameters were determined for the reaction with the substrates xylulose 5-phosphate  and ribulose 5-phosphate  as well as for the reaction with the substrates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and fructose 6-phosphate .
based on the kinetic parameters no major tkt of b. methanolicus could be determined.
b. methanolicus mga <dig> harbors two genes putatively coding for tkts; one located on the chromosome  and one located on the natural occurring plasmid pbm <dig> .
the biological significance of the two tkts for b. methanolicus methylotrophy is discussed.
the inactive apoform of the tkts, yielded by dialysis against buffer containing 10Â mm edta, could be reconstituted most efficiently with mn2+ and mg2+.
they were found to be active as homotetramers and require thiamine pyrophosphate for catalytic activity.
