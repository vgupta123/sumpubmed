to address this we have used bioinformatics to analyze the class i receptor repertoire in sea squirt  and zebrafish .
only two class i receptors were identified in sea squirt, one with homology to the archetypal gp <dig> receptor, and the other with high conservation with the divergent orphan receptor clf- <dig>  in contrast,  <dig> class i cytokine receptors were present in zebrafish, including representative members for each of the five structural groups found in mammals.
the class i cytokine receptors have a wide range of actions, including a major role in the development and function of immune and blood cells.
since then, only relatively limited lineage-specific diversification within the different class i receptor structural groups has occurred.
this allowed the identification of  <dig> core receptors belonging to the last common ancestor of teleosts and mammals.
