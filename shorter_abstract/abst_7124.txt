however, there was very limited information about bvdv infections in goats.
the objective of this study was to assess the frequency of bvdv infections of goats, the relationship of these infections to clinical signs and determine what bvdv genotypes are circulating in jiangsu province.
most of these goat farms are backyard enterprises and in close proximity to pig and cattle farms.
the results indicated that bvdv- <dig> infections were indeed present and the viruses were with genetic variations in chinese goat herds.
eight different bvdv- <dig> strains were identified from these positive samples based on the 5′-untranslated region  sequences, and further clustered into four bvdv- <dig> subtypes on the phylogenetic analysis.
the bvdv- <dig> infections occurred with/without clinical signs.
currently, the goat industry in jiangsu province of china is under going a rapid expansion.
from  <dig> goat sera collected from six regions in jiangsu province between  <dig> and  <dig>  bvdv- <dig> was identified in  <dig> samples from the five regions by rt-pcr.
