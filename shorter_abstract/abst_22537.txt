meloxicam  is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in the relief of postoperative pain for human and veterinary medicine.
this study was designed to investigate the effect of surgery on the plasma disposition of mlx in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy following a single intravenous injection at a dose of  <dig> Â mg/kg bodyweight.
the results of the present study indicated that surgery could alter the plasma disposition of mlx and thus the drug efficacy and side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration, unusual bleeding and loss of kidney function/failure when repeated doses are used.
a two-phase experimental design with a 10-day washout period was used.
the volume of plasma mlx distribution at steady-state  of the control group  was significantly greater  compared to that of the surgery group .
the auc values were higher  and the cl values were lower  in the surgery group compared to the control group, respectively, but differences were not significant.
