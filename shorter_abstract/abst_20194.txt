network analysis identified hub genes such as pmr <dig> in mn homeostasis, novel members of ionomic networks such as smf <dig> in vacuolar retrieval of mn, and cross-talk between the mitochondria and the vacuole.
disruption of protein metabolism or trafficking has the highest likelihood of causing large ionomic changes, with gene dosage also being important.
here, we describe a genome-wide screen to identify genes that impact the elemental composition  of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
to balance the demand for uptake of essential elements with their potential toxicity living cells have complex regulatory mechanisms.
all yeast ionomic data can be searched and downloaded at http://www.ionomicshub.org.
clustering also identified important roles for the mitochondria, vacuole and escrt pathway in regulation of the ionome.
here, we demonstrate the power of high-throughput icp-ms analysis to functionally dissect the ionome on a genome-wide scale.
