the structural correlation of natural polymorphisms and unusual mutations with drug resistance is useful for the identification of hiv- <dig> variants with potential resistance to pis.
emerging mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  protease confer resistance to pis by inducing structural changes at the ligand interaction site.
among these mutations, nine exhibited positive selection, three were natural polymorphisms  in a codon associated with drug resistance, and six were unusual mutations .

protease sequences isolated from  <dig> mexican hiv- <dig> patients that were na√Øve to, or subjected to antiretroviral therapy, were examined.
the correlations of genotypic and phenotypic tests with treatment, clinical history and the significance of mutations in viruses of hiv-infected patients are used to establish resistance mutations to protease inhibitors .
we identified  <dig> unrelated resistance mutations with a prevalence greater than 1%.
the d29v mutation likely confers a selection advantage in viruses; however, in silico, presence of this mutation results in unstable enzyme/pi complexes, that possibly induce resistance to pis.
the d29v mutation, with a prevalence of  <dig> % in the studied population, was only found in patients treated with antiretroviral drugs.
the aim of this study was to establish an in silico structural relationship between natural hiv- <dig> polymorphisms and unusual hiv- <dig> mutations that confer resistance to pis.
