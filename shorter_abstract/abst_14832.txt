as a consequence of the increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomes, new strategies for equine parasite control are being implemented.
the planned treatment date was already exceeded by  <dig> % of the high egg-shedders and by  <dig> % of the moderate  and low egg-shedders .

between june  <dig> and may  <dig>   <dig> fecal samples from either selectively or strategically dewormed horses were collected at  <dig> horse farms all over germany and analyzed quantitatively with a modified mcmaster technique.
