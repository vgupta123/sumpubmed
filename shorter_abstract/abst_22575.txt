in a ppi network, a node represents a protein and an edge represents an interaction.
we also show and analyze some protein complexes generated by the proposed algorithm from typical ppi networks of escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae.
the proposed algorithm makes it possible to detect clusters of proteins in ppi networks which mostly represent molecular biological functional units.
therefore, protein complexes determined solely based on interaction data can help us to predict the functions of proteins, and they are also useful to understand and explain certain biological processes.
the complexes are determined by way of finding clusters, i. e. the densely connected regions in the network.
are producing huge data sets of protein-protein interactions which can be portrayed as networks, and one of the burning issues is to find protein complexes in such networks.
this paper presents an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks.
the input to the algorithm is the associated matrix of an interaction network and the outputs are protein complexes.
a comparison between a ppi and a random network is also performed in the context of the proposed algorithm.
