the objective of this study was to conduct, for the first time, molecular characterization of a population sample of mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from slaughter cattle in algeria.
altogether,  <dig> bacterial strains from  <dig> animals were subjected to molecular characterization.
the m. bovis strains isolated showed  <dig> different spoligotype patterns; four of them had not been previously reported.
the majority of m. bovis strains  showed spoligotype patterns that were previously observed in strains from european cattle.
m. bovis infections account for a high amount of granulomatous lesions detected in algerian slaughter cattle during standard meat inspection at algiers and blida abattoir.
molecular typing results suggested a link between algerian and european strains of m. bovis.
variable number of tandem repeat  typing supported a link between m. bovis strains from algeria and france.
one spoligotype pattern has also been shown to be frequent in m. bovis strains from mali although the vntr pattern of the algerian strains differed from the malian strains.
bovine tuberculosis is prevalent in algeria despite governmental attempts to control the disease.
in  <dig> animals, gross visible granulomatous lesions were detected and put into culture.
m. bovis was isolated from  <dig> animals.
other bacteria isolated included one strain of m. caprae, four rhodococcus equi strains, three non-tuberculous mycobacteria  and five strains of other bacterial species.
