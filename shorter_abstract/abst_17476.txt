to improve the screening process, we investigated the utility of the human interleukin  <dig>  p <dig> cdna as a reporter gene for studies of mammalian gene expression and for high-throughput screening of engineered mouse embryonic stem cells.
these studies included a characterization of the il- <dig> p <dig> expression system in terms of:  a time course of il- <dig> p <dig> accumulation in the medium of transfected cells;  the dose-response relationship between the input dna and il- <dig> p <dig> mrna levels and il- <dig> p <dig> protein secretion;  the utility of il- <dig> p <dig> as a reporter gene for analyzing the activity of cis-acting genetic elements;  expression of the il- <dig> p <dig> reporter protein driven by an ires element in a bicistronic mrna;  utility of il- <dig> p <dig> as a reporter gene in a high-throughput screening strategy to identify successful transformed mouse embryonic stem cells;  demonstration of pluripotency of il- <dig> p <dig> expressing es cells in vitro and in vivo; and  germline transmission of the il- <dig> p <dig> reporter gene.
the il- <dig> p <dig> assay was rapid and simple, in as much as the reporter protein secreted from the transfected cells was accurately measured by elisa using a small aliquot of the culture medium.
to our knowledge, human il- <dig> p <dig> is the first secreted reporter protein suitable for high-throughput screening of mouse es cells.
il- <dig> p <dig> showed several advantages as a reporter gene in terms of sensitivity and ease of the detection procedure.
establishing a suitable level of exogenous gene expression in mammalian cells in general, and embryonic stem  cells in particular, is an important aspect of understanding pathways of cell differentiation, signal transduction and cell physiology.
remarkably, expression of il- <dig> p <dig> does not affect the pluripotency of mouse es cells.
