measurements of cre-gene transcription and 3h-camp accumulation were made.
the purpose of this study was to examine the antagonist affinity measurements at the gi-coupling human h <dig> receptor, paying particular attention to measurements made in the presence of full agonists, partial agonists and the proxyfan protean agonist-induced state of the receptor.
cho cells stably expressing the human histamine h <dig> receptor and a cre-spap reporter were used.
several gpcrs are now known to exist in different states.
the beta-adrenoceptors, the antagonist affinity measurements vary considerably depending on which agonist-dependent state is being identified.
antagonist affinity measurements were constant, whether the measurements were made in the presence of a full agonist, a partial agonist or the protean agonist proxyfan.
in contrast to all three subtypes of the beta-adrenoceptors, but in keeping with the traditional pharmacological dogma, antagonist affinity measurements remained constant at the human h <dig> receptor, including the medium-efficacy proxyfan-induced state of the receptor and the vuf5681-induced state of the receptor.
a range of ligands of different agonist efficacies were determined, including some partial agonists e.g.
