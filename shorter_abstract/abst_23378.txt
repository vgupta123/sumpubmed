these results, together with the available functional data, suggest that three different types of ubiquitin ligase cullin-containing complexes were already present in early eukaryotic evolution: 1) scf-like complexes with culα proteins; 2) culβ/btb complexes; and, 3) complexes containing culγ and ddb1-like proteins.
fungal species have quite strictly conserved these three ancestral genes, with only occasional lineage-specific duplications.
for example, the human genes cul <dig>  cul <dig>  cul <dig>  cul <dig> and parc all derive from the ancestral culα gene.
the available data indicate that there were three cullin genes before the unikont/bikont split, which i have called culα, culβ and culγ.
