results reveal true positive rates of 99%, 99% and 98% for hpv alpha species, hbv genotyping and hiv- <dig> m subtyping, respectively.
here, we introduce a virus classification platform, castor, based on machine learning methods.
the castor web platform provides an open access, collaborative and reproducible machine learning classifiers.
castor is inspired by a well-known technique in molecular biology: restriction fragment length polymorphism .
it simulates, in silico, the restriction digestion of genomic material by different enzymes into fragments.
furthermore, castor shows a competitive performance compared to well-known hiv- <dig> specific classifiers  on whole genomes and pol fragments.
