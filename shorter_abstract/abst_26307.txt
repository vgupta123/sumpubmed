the characterisation of the full length l <dig> capsid coding gene of acanthamoebae polyphaga mimivirus provides new insights into the structure of the main capsid protein.
acanthamoebae polyphaga mimivirus  is the largest known dsdna virus.
the viral particle has a nearly icosahedral structure with an internal capsid shell surrounded with a dense layer of fibrils.
a capsid protein sequence, d13l, was deduced from the apm l <dig> coding gene and was shown to be the most abundant protein found within the viral particle.
a revised protein sequence deposited in a database suggested an additional n-terminal stretch of  <dig> amino acids missing from the original deduced sequence.
