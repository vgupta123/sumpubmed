the recent sequencing of nematode genomes has laid the basis for comparative genomics approaches to study the impact of horizontal gene transfer  on the adaptation to new environments and the evolution of parasitism.
speculating that retrotransposons might have served as carriers of foreign genetic material, we found a significant local clustering tendency of orphan genes in the vicinity of retrotransposons.
our study combined codon usage bias, phylogenetic analysis, and genomic colocalization into a general picture of the computational archaeology of the p. pacificus genome and suggests that a substantial fraction of the gene repertoire is of insect origin.
the most abundant gene family among these genes are non-ltr retrotransposons.
we introduced gc-normalized relative codon frequencies as a measure to detect characteristic features of p. pacificus orphan genes that show no homology to other nematode genes.
in cross-species comparisons, we identified  <dig> hgt candidates that show a significantly higher similarity to insect-like profiles than genes with nematode homologs.
in this study we utilized the observation that horizontally transferred genes often exhibit codon usage patterns more similar to that of the donor than that of the acceptor genome.
in the beetle associated nematode pristionchus pacificus hgt events were found to involve cellulase genes of microbial origin and diapausin genes that are known from beetles, but not from other nematodes.
by comparing codon usage profiles of  <dig> species, we detected the most significant enrichment in insect-like codon usage profiles.
we found that atypical codon usage is particularly prevalent in p. pacificus orphans.
