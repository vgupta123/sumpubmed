tblastn and sequence analysis of cdnas revealed that the a. gambiae genome contains nine genes  which code for proteins with similarity to mammalian ace.
expression of anoace <dig>  anoace <dig> and anoace <dig> is induced by a blood meal, with anoace <dig> showing the largest  induction.
anoace <dig>  however, has several features in common with mammalian somatic ace such as a two domain structure and a hydrophobic c terminus.
anoace <dig> belongs to a sub-group of insect aces which are likely to be membrane-bound and which have an unusual, conserved gene structure.
eight of these genes code for putative single domain enzymes similar to other insect aces described so far.
four of the anoace genes  were shown to be expressed at a variety of developmental stages.
the function of these ace-like proteins is largely unknown.
sequencing of the a. gambiae genome has revealed a number of ace-like genes but probable errors in the ensembl annotation have left the number of ace-like genes, and their structure, unclear.
