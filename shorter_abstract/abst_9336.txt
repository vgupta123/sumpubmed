the study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in preyâ€“predator signalling.
however, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness.
we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution.
many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution.
we undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots.
furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work.
we conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded.
