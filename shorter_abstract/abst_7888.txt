it is implemented both as an executable program that can be integrated with standalone sequence analysis pipelines and as a web-based application to enable individuals with little or no bioinformatics experience to quality trim their sequence data.
the performance of qtrim was evaluated against all other available quality trimming approaches on both poor and high quality  <dig> sequence data.
qtrim is a novel, highly sensitive and accurate algorithm for the quality trimming of roche/ <dig> sequence reads.
undertaking quality trimming of this data is essential to enable confidence in the results of subsequent downstream analysis.
further analysis of the trimmed data revealed that the novel trimming approach implemented in qtrim ensures that the prevalence of low quality bases in the resulting trimmed data is substantially lower than prinseq or any of the other approaches tested.
