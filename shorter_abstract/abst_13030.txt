based on dna sequencing analysis we show that the genomes of  <dig> derived mutations, arrufatina  and nero , share a similar 2 mb deletion of chromosome  <dig>  a 7 kb mutator-like element found in clemenules was present in arrufatina in inverted orientation flanking the 5′ end of the deletion.
this proposal requires the involvement of a unique transposon and sheds light on the unresolved question of how two distinct sites become located in close proximity.
these observations confer a crucial role to the ttc-repeats in fundamental plant processes as meiotic recombination and chromosomal rearrangements.
fine-scale single nucleotide variant analyses of the deleted fragments identified a ttc-repeat sequence motif located in the center of the deletion responsible of a meiotic crossover detected in the citrus reference genome.
taken together, this information is compatible with the proposal that in both mutants, the ttc-repeat motif formed a triplex dna structure generating a loop that brought in close proximity the originally distinct reactive ends.
in arrufatina, the loop brought the mule ends nearby the  <dig> distinct insertion target sites and the inverted insertion of the transposable element between these target sites provoked the release of the in-between fragment.
transposable-element mediated chromosomal rearrangements require the involvement of two transposons and two double-strand breaks  located in close proximity.
