however, unlike targeted amplicon sequencing, genome-wide sequencing often employs a reduced read length and coverage that impose great challenges in resolving the highly homologous hla alleles.
we have developed a new algorithm named phlat to discover the most probable pair of hla alleles at four-digit resolution or higher, via a unique integration of a candidate allele selection and a likelihood scoring.
new algorithms are therefore needed to leverage the accuracy and flexibility of hla typing at high resolution using genome-wide sequencing data.
it may benefit both basic and applied research in immunology and related fields as well as numerous clinical applications.
with the rapid adoption of genome-wide sequencing in biomedical research, hla typing based on transcriptome and whole exome/genome sequencing data becomes increasingly attractive due to its high throughput and convenience.
it also supports targeted amplicon sequencing data from illumina miseq.
phlat significantly leverages the accuracy and flexibility of high resolution hla typing based on genome-wide sequencing data.
over a comprehensive set of benchmarking data  from both rna and dna sequencing and with a broad range of read lengths and coverage, phlat consistently achieves a high accuracy at four-digit  and two-digit resolutions , outcompeting most of the existing methods.
accurate hla typing at amino acid level  is critical in hematopoietic and organ transplantations, pathogenesis studies of autoimmune and infectious diseases, as well as the development of immunoncology therapies.
