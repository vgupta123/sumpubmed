micrornas  are small rna molecules that play important regulatory roles in plant development and stress responses.
we validated  <dig> mirnas  using published small rna expression data in dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  and rdr <dig> rnai lines and confirmed  <dig> targets from  <dig> mirnas using published degradome data.
abiotic stresses are one of the major factors that limit crop growth and yield.
in addition, we identified  <dig> candidate mirnas that originated from transposable elements or repeats, especially miniature inverted-repeat elements .
transposable elements or repeats, especially mites, are rich sources for mirna origination.
we used illumina deep sequencing technology to sequence four small rna libraries that were constructed from the inflorescences of rice plants that were grown under control condition and drought, cold, or salt stress.
by comparing the expression levels of mirnas, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas that were regulated by drought, cold and salt stress conditions, respectively.
whereas abiotic stress-regulated mirnas have been identified in vegetative tissues in several plants, they are not well studied in reproductive tissues such as inflorescences.
we discovered novel mirnas and stress-regulated mirnas that may play critical roles in stress response in rice inflorescences.
