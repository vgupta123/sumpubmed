intrapulmonary cell trapping was evidenced by confocal endomicroscopy, bli and fluorescence microscopy.
cv injection of bmsc resulted in massive pulmonary infarction, leading to respiratory failure and death.
we did not find substantial evidence for ischemia-directed bmsc homing and caution against cv injection of bmsc, which can lead to massive pulmonary infarction.
despite positive reports on the efficacy of stem cell therapy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, the nature of stem cell homing to ischemic tissues remains elusive.
allogeneic bmsc survival is limited in an immunocompetent host and cannot be preserved by csa immunosuppression alone.
ia injection of bmsc proved to be a feasible and safe strategy to bypass the lung circulation.
we used a mouse model of peripheral tissue ischemia to study the survival and homing capacity of dual reporter gene  expressing bone marrow-derived stromal cells .
bli and confocal endomicroscopy are complementary imaging techniques for studying the in vivo biology of dual reporter gene-expressing bmsc.
cell homing and survival were studied in the presence and absence of ciclosporin a  immunosuppression using bioluminescence imaging  together with confocal endomicroscopy.
bli and confocal endomicroscopy evidenced complete rejection of the im injected allogeneic bmsc transplant within  <dig> to  <dig> days.
during the follow-up period, neither bli nor confocal endomicroscopy revealed any convincing ischemia-directed homing of bmsc.
