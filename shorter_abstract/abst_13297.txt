identifying and isolating cells with specific behavioral characteristics will facilitate the understanding of the molecular basis regulating these behaviors.
unlike existing assays of cell motility, this approach enables recovery of characterized cell populations, and can enable screens to identify factors that might regulate motility differences even within clonal population of cells.
although many approaches exist to characterize cell motility, retrieving cells of specific motility following analysis remains challenging.
using this approach, we sorted a glioblastoma cell line into high motility and low motility populations and found stable differences in motility following sorting.
