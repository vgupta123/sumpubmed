moreover, the high expression level of klf <dig> expression was statistically associated with poor grade, late stage, histological subtypes of simple and complex carcinoma, and shorter 24-month survival.
the kaplan-meier survival analysis also indicated that dogs with high nuclear klf <dig> expression had a significantly shorter survival than those with low/moderate klf <dig> expression .
the present study examined the expression of klf <dig> and assessed its significance in canine mammary carcinoma.
<dig> of the  <dig>  cases were histologically confirmed as mammary carcinoma.
high klf <dig> expression was identified in  <dig> of the  <dig>  dogs with mammary carcinoma and none in the benign cases.
high klf <dig> expression occurred only in the tumor cells and not the adjacent normal cells in mammary carcinoma .
klf <dig> is highly and frequently expressed in canine mammary carcinoma and correlates with a more aggressive phenotype.
quantification of immunohistochemistry was carried out using quick score which multiply the staining intensity by the percentage of positive cells.
among the klfs, klf <dig> is highly expressed in human breast cancers and plays an oncogenic role.
