among them,  <dig> protein spots were exclusively expressed or up-regulated under drought stress in xz <dig> but not in xz <dig>  including melanoma-associated antigen p <dig>  type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b, glutathione s-transferase  <dig>  ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase large chain.
thirty-eight drought-tolerance-associated proteins were identified using mass spectrometry and data bank analysis.
moreover, type i chlorophyll a/b-binding protein b was specifically expressed in xz <dig>  but not in both of xz <dig> and zau <dig>  these proteins may play crucial roles in drought-tolerance in xz <dig>  coding sequences  of rbcl and trx-m genes from xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig> were cloned and sequenced.
in this study, a proteome analysis was performed to identify the genetic resources and to understand the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants that could result in high levels of tolerance to drought stress.

to adapt to drought stress, plants have evolved sophisticated defence mechanisms.
zau <dig>  in response to drought stress at soil moisture content  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  and subsequently  <dig> days  and  <dig> days  of recovery.
wild barley germplasm is a treasure trove of useful genes and offers rich sources of genetic variation for crop improvement.
a greenhouse pot experiment was performed to compare proteomic characteristics of two contrasting tibetan wild barley genotypes  and cv.
our findings highlight the significance of specific-proteins associated with drought tolerance, and verified the potential value of tibetan wild barley in improving drought tolerance of barley as well as other cereal crops.
these proteins were categorized mainly into photosynthesis, stress response, metabolic process, energy and amino-acid biosynthesis.
comparison of gene sequences among xz <dig>  xz <dig> and zau <dig> revealed  <dig> and  <dig> snps for rbcl and trx-m, respectively, with two  <dig> snps of missense mutation in the both genes.
cds length of rbcl and trx-m was  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp , respectively, encoding  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids.
