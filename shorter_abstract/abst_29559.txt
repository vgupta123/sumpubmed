we could functionally classify  <dig>  sequences using the gene ontologies  and established pathway associations to  <dig>  sequences in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes .
the bioinformatic analyses of ests data for d. viviparus has elucidated sets of relatively conserved and potentially novel genes.
they cause pathological effects and clinical disease in various ruminant hosts, particularly in young animals.
in this study, we provide first insights into the transcriptome of the adult stage of d. viviparus through the analysis of expressed sequence tags .
of the c. elegans homologues,  <dig> had observed 'non-wildtype' rnai phenotypes, including embryonic lethality, maternal sterility, sterility in progeny, larval arrest and slow growth.
the genes discovered in this study should assist research toward a better understanding of the basic molecular biology of d. viviparus, which could lead, in the longer term, to novel intervention strategies.
the characterization of the d. viviparus transcriptome also provides a foundation for whole genome sequence analysis and future comparative transcriptomic analyses.
lungworms of the genus dictyocaulus  are parasitic nematodes of major economic importance.
dictyocaulus viviparus, called the bovine lungworm, is a major pathogen of cattle, with severe infections being fatal.
using our est analysis pipeline, we estimate that the present dataset of  <dig> ests is derived from  <dig> genes based on cluster and comparative genomic analyses of the ests.
of the  <dig> representative ests,  <dig>  had homologues in the free-living nematode c. elegans,  <dig>  in parasitic nematodes,  <dig>  in organisms other than nematodes, and  <dig>  had no significant match to any sequence in the current databases.
