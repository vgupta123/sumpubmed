human induced pluripotent stem cells  have a wide range of applications throughout the fields of basic research, disease modeling and drug screening.
here, we developed an analytical procedure to decipher the dna methylation heterogeneity of mixed cells and further exploited it to quantitatively assess the dna methylation variation in the methylomes of adipose-derived stem cells , mature adipocytes differentiated from ads cells  and ipscs reprogrammed from ads cells .
we observed that the degree of dna methylation variation varies across distinct genomic regions with promoter and 5â€™utr regions exhibiting low methylation variation and satellite showing high methylation variation.
interestingly, dna methylation variation decreases in promoter regions during differentiation but increases during reprogramming.
in addition, genes showing a bipolar methylation pattern, with both completely methylated and completely unmethylated reads, are related to the carbohydrate metabolic process, cellular development, cellular growth, proliferation, etc.
compared with differentiated cells, ads-ipscs possess globally decreased methylation variation, in particular in repetitive elements.
methylation variation in promoter regions is negatively correlated with gene expression.
this study delivers a way to detect cell-subset specific methylation genes in a mixed cell population and provides a better understanding of methylation dynamics during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming.
