clustering analysis yielded  <dig> unique sequences including  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons.
comparative genomic analysis showed that  <dig> or 33% of the unique sequences shared high similarity with existing genes in the genbank nr database.
provisional function annotation assigned  <dig> gene ontology terms to  <dig> unique sequences based on their homology with the annotated genomes of four model organisms drosophila melanogaster, mus musculus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and caenorhabditis elegans.
seven percent of the unique sequences were further mapped to  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways based on their matching enzyme commission numbers.
little is known about its genome sequence although it has been extensively used as a test organism in terrestrial ecotoxicology.
the estmd containing the sequence and annotation information of  <dig> e. fetida ests is publicly accessible at .
in order to understand its gene expression response to environmental contaminants, we cloned  <dig> cdnas or expressed sequence tags  from two e. fetida libraries enriched with genes responsive to ten ordnance related compounds using suppressive subtractive hybridization-pcr.
eisenia fetida, commonly known as red wiggler or compost worm, belongs to the lumbricidae family of the annelida phylum.
