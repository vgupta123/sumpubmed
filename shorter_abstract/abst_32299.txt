the observed pattern of enzymes involved in protein metabolism, lipid metabolism and glycolysis may reflect the central nervous system habitat of this pathogen.
we further showed that mice immunized with recombinant cystatin, a product of one of the four cdna candidate genes, were partially protected from a. cantonensis infection.
angiostrongylus cantonensis is the causative agent of this severe disease.
a cdna library of a. cantonensis fourth-stage larvae was constructed, and ~ <dig>  clones were sequenced.
the data presented here substantially expand the available genetic information about the human pathogen a. cantonensis, and should be a significant resource for angiostrongyliasis researchers.
human angiostrongyliasis is an emerging food-borne public health problem, with the number of cases increasing worldwide, especially in mainland china.
as such, this work serves as a starting point for molecular approaches for diagnosing and controlling human angiostrongyliasis.
however, little is known about the genetics and basic biology of a. cantonensis.
characterization of the functions of these encoded proteins by gene ontology analysis showed enrichment in proteins with binding and catalytic activity.
