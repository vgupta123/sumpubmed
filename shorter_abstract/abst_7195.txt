expression of the aop <dig> gene was found to be most abundant in leaf and stem tissue and was also found to be light dependent, with a number of light regulatory elements identified in the promoter region of the gene.
in arabidopsis the aop <dig> gene plays a role in the secondary modification of aliphatic  glucosinolates, namely the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates to form alkenyl glucosinolates, and also influences aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation.
to help determine the regulatory mechanisms mediating aop <dig> expression amongst accessions, aop <dig> 5' regulatory regions were also examined however no major differences were identified.
glucosinolates, a group of nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds associated with plant-insect interactions, are produced by a number of important brassicaceae crop species.
the over-expression of a functional aop <dig> allele was found to successfully convert the precursor methylsulfinyl alkyl glucosinolate into the alkenyl form.
aop <dig> exists as at least three alleles in different arabidopsis accessions and we have demonstrated that one of these, aop2- <dig>  is functionally able to convert methylsulfinyl glucosinolates into the alkenyl form.
