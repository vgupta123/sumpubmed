to aid researchers in describing results from high-throughput experiments we developed ht-sas, a web service for automatic annotation of proteins using general english words.
for each protein a poll of medline abstracts connected to homologous proteins is gathered using the uniprot-medline link.
ordering, managing and describing these raw results is the first step which allows facts to become knowledge.
our service should be useful for manual curators, as a complement to manually curated information sources and for researchers working with protein datasets, especially from poorly characterized organisms.
our tests show this approach to information extraction provides highly specific keywords, often also when the number of abstracts is limited.
we also applied the automatic annotation service to improve annotations of proteins from plasmodium bergei expressed exclusively during the blood stage.
using ht-sas we created new, or enriched already established annotations for over 20% of proteins from plasmodium bergei expressed in the blood stage, deposited in plasmodb.
