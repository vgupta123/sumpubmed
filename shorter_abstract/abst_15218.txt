these enzymes, widely distributed in microorganisms, animals and plants, are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes, such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling, fertilization, development of carcinomas, inflammatory events and lysosomal storage diseases.
careful phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> inferred protein sequences from eukaryotes and prokaryotes reveal a complex history for the gh <dig> family.
phylogenetic analyses also suggest that a second, divergent subfamily of gh <dig> family genes present in animals derive from an independent prokaryotic source.
in bacteria, multiple gene duplications and lineage specific gene loss  are required to explain the observed taxonomic distribution.
mapping of data concerning physiological function of gh <dig> family members onto the phylogenetic tree reveals that apparently convergent and highly lineage specific changes in substrate specificity have occurred in multiple gh <dig> subfamilies.
nevertheless, only limited analyses of phylogenetic relationships between gh <dig> genes have been performed until now.
the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes is likely to have possessed at least one gh <dig> family member.
at least one gene duplication before the divergence of animals, plants and fungi as well as other lineage specific duplication events have given rise to multiple paralogous subfamilies in eukaryotes.
our data suggest multiple convergent changes of functional roles of gh <dig> family members in eukaryotes.
