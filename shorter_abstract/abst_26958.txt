additionally, pai- <dig> Δcd-loop gave both higher yield and purity than wild-type pai- <dig> expressed and purified under identical conditions.
we show that pai- <dig> Δcd-loop expressed and purified from the pqe <dig> vector system presents an easier purification target than the previously used pet15b system.
importantly, absence of the cd-loop had no impact on the inhibition of both solution phase and cell surface upa or on the clearance of receptor bound upa from the cell surface.
we demonstrate that the cd-loop is redundant for the purposes of cellular upa inhibition and cell surface clearance  and is thus suitable for the development of anti-upa targeted cancer therapeutics.
