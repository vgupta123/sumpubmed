to do this, we compared the genomic structure of srrp components across three mosquito species and three major small rna pathways.
in addition, sequence pattern recognition algorithms meme, mdscan and weeder were used to identify upstream regulatory motifs for all srrp components.
common ucr elements among srrp components indicate that 1) key components from the mirna, sirna, and pirna pathways contain nf-kappab-related and broad complex transcription factor binding sites, 2) purifying selection has occurred to maintain common pathway-specific elements across mosquito species and 3) species-specific differences in upstream elements suggest that there may be differences in regulatory control among mosquito species.
analysis of argonaute and piwi subfamily genes suggests that the small regulatory rna pathways of the major arbovirus vectors, ae.
phylogenetic analyses were performed for these protein families.
further, protein and genomic features suggest functional differences between subclasses of piwi proteins and provide a basis for future analyses.
members of the argonaute family of catalytic enzymes degrade target rnas in each of these pathways.
small rna regulatory pathways  control key aspects of development and anti-viral defense in metazoans.
increased knowledge of these pathways and functional components should increase understanding of the limitations of anti-viral defense in vector mosquitoes.
implications for arbovirus vector competence in mosquitoes are discussed.
