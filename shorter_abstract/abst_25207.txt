when treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> enhanced the tolerances to heat and drought stresses but reduced the tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes.
the expression of gmgbp <dig> was induced by polyethyleneglycol  <dig>  nacl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress.
in this study, the expression patterns of soybean gamyb binding protein gene  encoding a homolog of skip protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and different day lengths.
gmgbp <dig> had transcriptional activity in c-terminal.
in arabidopsis, gmgbp <dig> might positively regulate the flowering time by affecting constans, flowering locus t, leafy and gamyb directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in lds, but gmgbp <dig> might represse flowering by affecting flowering locus c and short vegetative phase in autonomous pathway in sds.
in long-day  condition, transgenic arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette leaves; suppression of atskip in arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes ; arabidopsis myb <dig> mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type.
in short-day  condition, transgenic arabidopsis plants with gmgbp <dig> flowered later and showed a higher level of flowering locus c compared with wild type.
skip is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes.
