this novel primer set was successfully combined with a published set that targets the b. mandrillaris 18s rrna gene in a duplex real-time pcr assay to ensure maximum specificity and as a precaution against false negative results.
the assay detected at least  <dig>  genomes of b. mandrillaris grown in axenic culture.
a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using taqman® probes  was established specifically targeting the rnase p gene of b. mandrillaris amoebae.
a real-time pcr assay for b. mandrillaris amoebae is presented, that is highly specific, sensitive, and reliable and thus suited both for diagnosis and for research.
the assay efficiently detected b. mandrillaris dna in spiked cell cultures, spiked murine organ homogenates, b. mandrillaris-infected mice, and cns tissue-dna preparations from  <dig> patients with proven cerebral balamuthiasis.
rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable detection requiring little pathogen-specific expertise is an absolute prerequisite for a successful therapy and a welcome tool for both experimental and epidemiological research.
the free-living amoeba balamuthia mandrillaris may cause fatal encephalitis both in immunocompromised and in – apparently – immunocompetent humans and other mammalian species.
