this variegated class of rna species encompasses the well-known micrornas  and the most recently acknowledged long non-coding rnas .
we built normal and cancer networks of mirna-mediated sponge interactions  using breast cancer expression data provided by the cancer genome atlas.
at the heart of this phenomenon is the lncrna pvt <dig>  as illustrated by both the width of its antagonist mrnas in normal-mmi-network, and the relevance of the latter in breast cancer.
we propose a computational approach to explore the ability of lncrnas to act as cernas by protecting mrnas from mirna repression.
