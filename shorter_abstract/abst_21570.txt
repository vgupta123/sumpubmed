we developed pytms, a plugin implemented with the commonly used visualization software pymol.
ten types of modification are currently supported, including acetylation, carbamylation, citrullination, cysteine oxidation, malondialdehyde adducts, methionine oxidation, methylation, nitration, proline hydroxylation and phosphorylation.
conversely, several different pathophysiological ptms are hallmarks of oxidative imbalance or inflammatory states and are strongly associated with pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases or cancers.
advantages of pytms include standardized generation of ptms, rapid time-to-result and facilitated user control.
furthermore, advanced settings integrate the pre-selection of surface-exposed atoms, define stereochemical alternatives and allow for basic structure optimization of the newly modified residues.
although modeling cannot substitute for conventional structure determination it constitutes a convenient tool that allows uncomplicated exploration of potential implications prior to experimental investments and basic explanation of experimental data.
pytms enables users to introduce a set of common ptms into protein/peptide models and can be used to address research questions related to ptms.

post-translational modifications  constitute a major aspect of protein biology, particularly signaling events.
