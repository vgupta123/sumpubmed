these experiments are being conducted at increasingly finer resolutions as the microarray technology enjoys increasingly greater feature densities.
we have eased this requirement significantly by implementing efficient algorithms that scale well with genomic feature density.
tiling microarray analyses that rely upon a sliding window pseudomedian calculation can require many hours of computation.
specifically, the most widely employed algorithm for tiling array analysis involves smoothing observed signals by computing pseudomedians within sliding windows, a o calculation in each window.
this poor time complexity is an issue for tiling array analysis and could prove to be a real bottleneck as tiling microarray experiments become grander in scope and finer in resolution.
