specifically, in escherichia coli, we suggested binding site motifs for  <dig> non-traditional lexa protein binding sites; in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we hypothesize  <dig> disparate mechanisms for novel binding sites of the cse4p protein; and in halobacterium sp.
in each case, the motif finder with the motifcatcher extension demonstrated improved sensitivity over the motif finder alone.
we describe motifcatcher, a framework that extends the sensitivity of existing motif-finding tools by employing random sampling to effectively remove non-motif-containing sequences from the motif search.
nrc- <dig>  we discoverd subtle differences in a general transcription factor  binding site motif across several data sets.
