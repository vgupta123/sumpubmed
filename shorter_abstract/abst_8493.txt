however, as a lepidopteran host pathogenic symbiont, the virus is likely undergoing strong selective pressures for the acquisition of new functions by gene acquisition or duplication.
a generated three-dimensional model of cotesia congregata bracovirus cystatin  <dig> provides a powerful framework to position positively selected residues and reveal that they are concentrated in the vicinity of actives sites which interact with cysteine proteases directly.
in addition, phylogenetic analyses reveal two different cystatin forms which evolved under different selective constraints and are characterized by independent adaptive duplication events.
we show that cystatins are the first bracovirus genes proven to be subject to strong positive selection within a host-parasitoid system.
in pathogens, certain genes encoding proteins that directly interact with host defences coevolve with their host and are subject to positive selection.
positive selection acts to maintain cystatin gene duplications and induces directional divergence presumably to ensure the presence of efficient and adapted cystatin forms.
directional selection has acted on key cystatin active sites, suggesting that cystatins coevolve with their host target.
the virus is essential for wasp parasitism success since viral gene expression alters the immune system and development of the host.
in the lepidopteran host-wasp parasitoid system, one of the most original strategies developed by the wasps to defeat host defences is the injection of a symbiotic polydnavirus at the same time as the wasp eggs.
