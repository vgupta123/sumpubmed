if data is available for several different but related problem domains, multitask learning algorithms can be used to learn a model based on all available information.
in bioinformatics, many problems can be cast into the multitask learning scenario by incorporating data from several organisms.
our proposed method simultaneously learns or refines the similarity between tasks along with the multitask learning classifier.
this is done by formulating the multitask learning problem as multiple kernel learning, using the recently published q-norm mkl algorithm.
we present a novel approach to multitask learning that is capable of learning task similarity along with the classifiers.
the lack of sufficient training data is the limiting factor for many machine learning applications in computational biology.
we demonstrate the performance of our method on two problems from computational biology.
both variants show promising results in applications from computational biology.

first, we show that our method is able to improve performance on a splice site dataset with given hierarchical task structure by refining the task relationships.
