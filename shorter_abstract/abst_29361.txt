heat shock protein <dig> , gamma amino-butyric acid , serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and interferon γ-inducible protein  <dig> together with comet dna assay were measured in brain tissues of the six studied groups.
forty-eight young male western albino rats were used in the present study.
a high significant increase in tail length, tail dna% damage and tail moment was reported indicating the genotoxic effect of pa. administration of melatonin or coenzyme q showed both protective and therapeutic effects on pa–treated rats demonstrated in a remarkable amelioration of most of the measured parameters.
results from animal studies may guide investigations on human populations toward identifying environmental contaminants that produce or drugs that protect from neurotoxicity.
the third and fourth groups were intoxicated with pa as described above followed by treatment with either coenzyme q  or melatonin  for one week .
in conclusion, melatonin and coenzyme q have potential protective and restorative effects against pa-induced brain injury, confirmed by improvement in biochemical markers and dna double strand breaks.
