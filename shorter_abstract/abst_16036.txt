ki ganglion cultures constitutively contained a larger number of active macrophages, although no difference in p2x <dig> receptor expression was found.
since it is difficult to study this process in vivo, we investigated functional crosstalk between macrophages and sensory neurons in primary cultures from trigeminal sensory ganglia of wild-type  or knock-in  mice expressing the cacna1a gene mutation  found in familial hemiplegic migraine-type  <dig>  after studying the number and morphology of resident macrophages in culture, the consequences of adding host macrophages on macrophage phagocytosis and membrane currents mediated by pain-transducing p2x <dig> receptors on sensory neurons were examined.
this phenotype could be replicated in wt cultures by adding host macrophages, indicating an important functional crosstalk between macrophages and sensory neurons.
co-culturing wt or ki ganglia with host macrophages  strongly stimulated single cell phagocytosis.
trigeminal ganglion cultures from a genetic mouse model of migraine showed basal macrophage activation together with enhanced neuronal currents mediated by p2x <dig> receptors.
the same protocol had no effect on p2x <dig> receptor expression in wt or ki co-cultures, but it largely enhanced wt neuron currents that grew to the high amplitude constitutively seen for ki neurons.
