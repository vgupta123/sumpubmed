as yellow and green blue tit colouration are strongly affected by carotenoid availability during moult, variation in pigment availability between habitats may affect the degree of background-matching or the costliness of producing cryptic plumage.
the relationship between colouration  and detectability  followed a similar curvilinear pattern for yellow and green plumage with minimum detectability at intermediate levels of carotenoid deposition.
thus, for yellow and green plumage, colours at or close to the point of minimum detectability may aid in crypsis.
this may be the case for blue and great tit green and yellow plumage, and greenfinch green plumage, all of which had comparably low levels of detectability, while greenfinch yellow plumage was more chromatic and detectable.
here we challenge this notion using the yellow and green colouration of blue tits , great tits  and greenfinches  as a model.
in some cases, such as in blue or great tits, carotenoid deposition may be selected through enhanced background-matching, which in turn suggests that producing cryptic plumage may entail costs.
