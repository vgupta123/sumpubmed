we identified  <dig> transcripts  with altered expression  in response to treatment with nmda receptor antagonists.
gene expression alterations induced by the nmda antagonists were compared to the molecular profiles of psychotropic drugs: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, psychostimulants and opioids.
clustering based on expression profiles placed the nmda antagonists among fluoxetine, tianeptine, as well as opioids and ethanol.

the results reveal similarities between the effects of ketamine and monoaminergic antidepressants that may explain the mechanisms of its rapid antidepressant action.
the comparison with other psychotropic drugs revealed that the molecular effects of ketamine are most similar to memantine and phencyclidine.
