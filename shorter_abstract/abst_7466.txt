collective mirna expression in mouse quadriceps muscle is subjected to substantial levels of regulation during the first 12 weeks of age.
mirna clustering identified  <dig> subsets of mirnas that are potentially involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, mainly via the regulation of non-muscle specific targets.

forty-six percent of all measured mirnas were expressed in mouse quadriceps muscle during the first 12 weeks of life.
mirnas are essential regulators of skeletal muscle development and homeostasis.
as such it provides novel knowledge pertaining to post-natal myogenesis and muscle regeneration in mammals.
using a high-throughput mirna qpcr-based array, followed by stringent statistical and bioinformatics analysis, we describe the expression pattern and putative role of  <dig> mirnas in the quadriceps muscle of mice aged 2 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
we report unprecedented changes in mirna expression levels over time.
to date, the role and regulation of mirnas in myogenesis have been mostly studied in tissue culture and during embryogenesis.
this study identified a new suite of highly conserved mirnas that are predicted to influence early muscle development.
