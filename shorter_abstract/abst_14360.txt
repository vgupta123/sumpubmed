absorption spectroscopy at  <dig> nm further revealed a heme:hugz binding ratio of 1: <dig>  enzymatic assays showed that purified recombinant hugz protein can degrade hemin into biliverdin and carbon monoxide in the presence of either ascorbic acid or nadph and cytochrome p <dig> reductase.
hemin-agrose affinity analysis indicated that the recombinant hugz protein can bind to hemin.
iron is recognized as an important trace element, essential for most organisms including pathogenic bacteria.
a gene homologous to hugz, designated hp <dig>  identified in h. pylori atcc  <dig>  exhibits 66% similarity to cj1613c of campylobacter jejuni nctc  <dig>  soluble  <dig> Ã— his fused-hugz protein was expressed in vitro.
we previously observed that a hugz homologue is correlated with the adaptive colonization of helicobacter pylori , a major gastro-enteric pathogen.
this mutant strain showed poor growth when hemoglobin was provided as the source of iron, partly because of its failure to utilize hemoglobin efficiently.
a hugz deletion mutant was obtained by homologous recombination.
these findings provide biochemical and genetic evidence that hugz  encodes a heme oxygenase involved in iron release/uptake in h. pylori.
real-time quantitative pcr also confirmed that the expression of hugz was regulated by iron levels.
however, its exact physiological role remains unclear.
the biochemical and enzymatic characteristics agreed closely with those of campylobacter jejuni cj1613c protein, implying that hp <dig> is a functional member of the hugz family.
