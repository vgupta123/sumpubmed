our four samples in the family investigation of nephropathy and diabetes , european americans, mexican americans, african americans, and american indians are part of a genome- wide association study in which population structure might be particularly important.
a fixed parental allele maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to the find to estimate iga in four samples:  <dig> american indians;  <dig> african americans;  <dig> mexican americans; and  <dig> european americans.
from snps present on the affymetrix  <dig>  human snp array, we identified  <dig> sets of ancestry informative markers , each maximized for the information in one the three contrasts among ancestral populations: europeans , africans , and native americans .
failure to balance information in maximum likelihood, poly-ancestry models creates biased estimates of individual admixture with large error.
the identified set of aims, which include american indian parental allele frequencies, may be particularly useful for estimating genetic admixture in populations from the americas.
this also occurs when estimating iga using the bayesian clustering method as implemented in the program structure.
we estimate iga and present an algorithm for their standard errors, compare iga to principal components, emphasize the importance of balancing information in the ancestry informative markers , and test the association of iga with diabetic nephropathy in the combined sample.
when the samples are combined, the resulting population structure creates associations between iga and diabetic nephropathy.
odds ratios for the associations of iga with disease are consistent with what is known about the incidence and prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in these populations.

the presence of population structure in a sample may confound the search for important genetic loci associated with disease.
individual genetic admixture is highly correlated with principle components for capturing population structure.
it takes ~ <dig> snps to reduce the average standard error of individual admixture below  <dig> .
