in primary human fibroblasts expression of phic <dig> integrase leads to a dna damage response and chromosomal aberrations.
cells transfected with plasmids encoding the sleeping beauty transposase remained cytogenetically normal, and in these cells less upregulation of h2ax phosphorylation could be detected.
all control cells were cytogenetically normal, whereas cells expressing phic <dig> integrase show chromosomal abnormalities confirming our previous results using primary embryonic fibroblasts.
we have studied possible effects of the phic <dig> integrase expression in human adult fibroblasts by karyotyping.
transient transfection with phic <dig> integrase encoding plasmids lead to an elevated number of cells positive for h2ax phosphorylation detected by immunofluorescence.
in order to study the early mechanisms involved we measured h2ax phosphorylation â€“ a primary event in the response to dna double-strand-breaks.
western blot analysis confirmed the upregulated h2ax phosphorylation, whereas markers for apoptosis as well as p <dig> and p <dig> were not induced.
