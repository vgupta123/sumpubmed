our results show that p. aeruginosa employs multiple patient-specific adaption strategies during the early stage infections while certain essential adaptations are evolved in parallel during the chronic infections.
in this study, we have applied two kinds of unsupervised analysis methods, principle component analysis  and independent component analysis , to extract and characterize the most informative features from transcriptomic dataset generated from cystic fibrosis  pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
bacteria employ a variety of adaptation strategies during the course of chronic infections.
understanding bacterial adaptation can facilitate the identification of novel drug targets for better treatment of infectious diseases.
