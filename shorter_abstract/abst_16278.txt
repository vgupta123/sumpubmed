a mean peak plasma concentration  of  <dig>  μg/ml  was recorded at  <dig>  hours  with a half-life  of  <dig>  hours  after oral meloxicam administration.
no adverse effects associated with either treatment modality were observed in the llamas.
south american camelids in the united states have rapidly developed into an important agricultural industry in need of veterinary services.
six adult llamas  were administered either a 1 mg/kg dose of oral or a  <dig>  mg/kg dose of iv meloxicam in a randomized cross-over design with an 11 day washout period between treatments.
these data suggest that a single dosage of oral meloxicam at 1 mg/kg could potentially maintain therapeutic concentrations in plasma for up to 3 days in adult llamas.
the oral bioavailability  of meloxicam  was 76% .
the mean bioavailability  of oral meloxicam was 76% indicating a high degree of gastrointestinal absorption.
in comparison, a half-life  of  <dig>  hours  was demonstrated with iv meloxicam administration.
plasma meloxicam concentrations > <dig>  μg/ml were maintained for up to 72 h after oral administration; > <dig>  μg/ml is considered to be the concentration of meloxicam required for analgesic effects in other species such as the horse.
pain management is challenging in camelids because there are no drugs currently approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for use in these species.
