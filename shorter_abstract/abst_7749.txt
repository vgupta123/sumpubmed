we showed that all four genes are expressed, although at different levels, and levels of inositol phosphatase activity did not fall significantly in any of the mutants obtained.
mutants lacking either impa  or suhb  were isolated in the absence of exogenous inositol, and no differences in levels of pims, lm, lam or mycothiol were observed.
in contrast, we could only obtain mutations in impc  when a second functional copy was provided in trans, even when exogenous inositol was provided.
mutagenesis of cysq  was initially unsuccessful, but was possible when a porin-like gene of mycobacterium smegmatis was expressed, and also by gene switching in the merodiploid strain.
in contrast, we show that impc is essential for mycobacterial growth under the conditions we used, and suggest it may be required in the early stages of mycothiol synthesis.
mycobacteria use inositol in phosphatidylinositol, for anchoring lipoarabinomannan , lipomannan  and phosphatidylinosotol mannosides  in the cell envelope, and for the production of mycothiol, which maintains the redox balance of the cell.
to gain insight into how mycobacterium tuberculosis synthesises inositol we carried out genetic analysis of the four impase homologues that are present in the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome.
we have shown that neither impa, suhb nor cysq is solely responsible for inositol synthesis.
experiments to obtain a mutant in the presence of a second copy of impc containing an active-site mutation, in the presence of porin-like gene of m. smegmatis, or in the absence of inositol 1-phosphate synthase activity, were also unsuccessful.
