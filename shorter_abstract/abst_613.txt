we measured short and long term responses with video analysis and giving-up densities.
many animals live in environments where different types of predators pose a permanent threat and call for predator specific strategies.
while higher avian risk caused a delay in activity, the weasel odour shortened the latency until the voles started to be active.
the results show that previously experienced conditions cause delayed effects.
animals were exposed to factorial combinations of weasel odour and ground cover to simulate avian and/or mammalian predation.
avian predation induced a concentration on a smaller number of feeding patches.
so far, little is known about adaptive antipredator behavior under uniform risk.
we simulated two predator types, avian and mammalian, each representing a spatially uniform risk in the artificial resource landscapes.
we show that the voles differed in risk types and adjusted their feeding strategies accordingly.
after these effects ceased, the risks of both types of predation caused a reduction in food intake.
