here, we simultaneously exposed daphnia magna to predator cues  and spores of the yeast parasite metschnikowia sp.
therefore, adding parasite pressure to predatorâ€“prey systems can help to elucidate the costs of inducible defences.
to determine how life history and morphological inducible defences against these two contrasting types of predators are affected by infection.
although inducible defences have been studied extensively, only little is known about how the presence of parasites might interfere with these anti-predator adaptations.
in contrast, the parasite did not suppress inducible defences against fish: induction  and infection acted additively on the measured traits.
thus, fish-induced defences may be less costly than inducible defences against small invertebrate predators like triops; the latter defences could no longer be expressed when the host had already invested in fighting off the parasite.
in summary, our study suggests that as specific inducible defences differ in their costs, some might be suppressed if a target prey is additionally infected.
