the diffusion-sorption model better explains previously reported difficulties in staining large samples comprised of tissues with high partition coefficients .
differences in partition coefficient , bulk density , and porosity  could further explain the observed variation in staining rate and maximal staining effect among different tissues.
however, there has been only limited data available to inform detailed protocols for staining large specimens.
recommended protocols for staining large specimens are detailed.
observations of changes in the concentration of the staining agent and simulation results suggest that the sorption of iodine by tissues significantly affects the effective diffusion coefficient for the contrasting agent.
iodine-based solutions have long been known to be effective in aiding the differentiation among soft tissues in both fundamental anatomical research and for clinical diagnoses.
regular replacement of the staining solution combined with a longer staining period significantly improved contrast within tissues.
a simplified one-dimensional diffusion-sorption model with a three-zone domain was used to simulate the diffusion process by calculating the concentration profile of iodine across the adductor region, which fits well with the experiment data.
further, modeling of the staining mechanism has focused on simple diffusion processes.
a low concentration of iodine-based buffered formalin solution with a long staining period was used to visualize soft-tissue structures in a large goose head.
