lack of photosynthetic transcripts in pgt transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated pgt, as mint pgt are non-photosynthetic.
the extensive transcriptome data set renders a complete description of genes differentially expressed in spearmint pgt.
here, we performed next generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of mentha spicata  to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to pgt.
spearmint rnas from  <dig> different tissues: pgt, leaf and leaf stripped of pgts  were sequenced by illumina paired end sequencing.
a significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins.
among the  <dig> tpss, two were characterized biochemically and found to be sesquiterpene synthases.
our results provide a comprehensive overview of pgt’s dynamic metabolic activities which will help towards pathway engineering.
plant glandular trichomes are chemical factories with specialized metabolic capabilities to produce diverse compounds.
aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil in specialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes .

we found  <dig> terpene synthases ,  <dig> cytochrome p450s,  <dig> lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in pgt.
