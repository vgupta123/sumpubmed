our proteochemometric model can directly analyze inhibitor-protease interactions and facilitate treatment selection based on viral genotype.
the descriptions were correlated to the susceptibility data of  <dig> unique hiv protease variants for seven protease inhibitors in current use; the data set comprised  <dig> protease-inhibitor combinations.
the model provided excellent predictability  and identified general and specific features of drug resistance.
our results show that a proteochemometric approach can provide generalized susceptibility predictions for new inhibitors.
therefore, we used proteochemometrics to model the susceptibility of hiv to protease inhibitors in current use, utilizing descriptions of the physico-chemical properties of mutated hiv proteases and 3d structural property descriptions for the protease inhibitors.
the model's predictive ability was verified by external prediction in which the susceptibilities to each one of the seven inhibitors were omitted from the data set, one inhibitor at a time, and the data for the six remaining compounds were used to create new models.
this analysis showed that the over all predictive ability for the omitted inhibitors was q <dig> inhibitors =  <dig> .
