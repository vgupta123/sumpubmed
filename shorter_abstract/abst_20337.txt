five chromosome  <dig>  mirnas have been found overexpressed in ds individuals and could function as key elements in the pathophysiology.
in the current work, we interrogated the impact of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> upregulation on the transcriptome of ts65dn brains.
hippocampal injections of lentiviral sponges in ts65dn mice normalized the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and rescued the levels of their targets methyl-cpg-binding protein  <dig> gene , sh <dig> -containing inositol phosphatase- <dig>  and forkhead box protein m <dig> .
