in addition, our analysis shows that the enace-identified as exons tend not to pass the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratio test and not to contain protein domain, implying that such exons may be under positive selection or relaxed negative selection.
here we describe a cross-species est-to-genome comparison algorithm  that can identify novel exons for est-scanty species and distinguish conserved and lineage-specific exons.
the identified exons represent not only novel exons but also evolutionarily meaningful as events that are not previously annotated.
a genome-wide as analysis in human, mouse and rat using enace reveals a total of  <dig> novel cassette-on exons and  <dig> novel retained introns that have no est evidence from the same species.
these as exons may contribute to considerable inter-species functional divergence.
moreover, a functional analysis shows that inter-species divergence of as events may be substantial in protein carriers and receptor proteins in mammals.
our analysis further indicates that a large number of exons may have been gained or lost during mammalian evolution.
enace can identify potential novel cassette exons and retained introns between closely related species using a comparative approach.
