results obtained on protein structures showed highly significant correlations with results obtained from literature .
seqx tool is useful to detect, analyze and visualize residue co-locations in protein and nucleic acid structures.
the tool is simple and easy to use and provides a quick and reliable visualization and analyses of residue co-locations in protein and nucleic acid structures.
the seqx tool detects every residue that is located within the defined distances from the defined "backbone" atom; provides a dotplot-like visualization , and calculates the frequency of every possible residue pairs  in the observed structure.
it is possible to exclude +/-  <dig> to  <dig> neighbor residues in the same polymeric chain from detection, which greatly improves the specificity of detections .
the interacting residues of protein and nucleic acid sequences are close to each other â€“ they are co-located.
