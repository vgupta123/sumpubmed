we have previously reported the expression of variant bpi-like proteins in cattle .
characterisation of the bpi-like locus in cattle would lead to a better understanding of the role of the bpi-like proteins in cattle physiology
nine of the  <dig> contiguous bpi-like genes in the locus in cattle are orthologous to genes in the human and mouse locus, and are thought to play a role in host defence.
the genetic changes underlying the evolution of the ruminant lifestyle are poorly understood.
the bpi-like locus encodes several putative innate immune proteins, expressed predominantly in the oral cavity and airways, which are structurally related to bactericidal/permeability increasing protein .
the bpi-like locus in mammals appears to have evolved rapidly through multiple gene duplication events, and is thus a hot spot for genome evolution.
this, as well as the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous differences between pairs of the bsp <dig> genes, is consistent with at least bsp30c having acquired a distinct function from the other bsp <dig> proteins and from its paralog in human and mouse, parotid secretory protein .
we have sequenced and characterised a  <dig> kbp segment of bta <dig> containing the bovine bpi-like protein locus.
the transcripts of the four bsp <dig> genes are most abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity and airways.
phylogenetic analysis indicates the remaining four genes, which we have named bsp30a, bsp30b, bsp30c and bsp30d, appear to have arisen in cattle through a series of duplications.
