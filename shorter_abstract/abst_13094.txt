here, we report the first biochemical study of a unicellular rtk, namely rtkb <dig> from monosiga brevicollis.
the activity of rtkb <dig> is controlled by autophosphorylation, as in metazoan rtks.
receptor tyrosine kinases  are crucial components of signal transduction systems in multicellular animals.
our results are consistent with a model in which rtkb <dig> activation stimulates receptor autophosphorylation within the rm <dig> domains.
rtkb <dig> possesses six copies of a unique domain  in its c-terminal tail.
when phosphorylated, the rm <dig> domain bound to the src homology  <dig> domain of mbsrc <dig> from m. brevicollis.
