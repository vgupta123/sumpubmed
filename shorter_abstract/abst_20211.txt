a second mutant, an alanine substitution for the catalytic lysine in motif i  abolished activity in the first two steps of the ligation reaction, but preserved wild type ligation activity in step  <dig>  the activity of the k97a mutant is similar with either pre-adenylated rna or single-stranded dna  as donor substrates but we observed two-fold preference for rna as an acceptor substrate compared to ssdna with an identical sequence.
we identified amino acids essential for atp binding and reactivity but dispensable for phosphodiester bond formation with 5’ pre-adenylated donor substrate.
rna ligases are essential reagents for many methods in molecular biology including nextgen rna sequencing.
the ability of the ligase to function at 65°c should reduce the constraints of rna secondary structure in rna ligation experiments.
it is important that these ligases not have de-adenylation activity, which can result in activation of rna and formation of background ligation products.
the k97a mutant is defective in the first two steps of ligation but retains full activity in ligation of either rna or ssdna to a pre-adenylated linker.
however, the t <dig> rna ligases are ineffective in ligating ssdna acceptors.
the mutant has full ligation activity with pre-adenylated substrates but retained the undesirable activity of deadenylation, which is the reverse of step  <dig> adenylation.
the motif v lysine mutant  showed reduced activity in the first two steps of ligation reaction.
