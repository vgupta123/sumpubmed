here we present an efficient multiple conformation rigid-body docking approach, ms-dock, which is based on the program dock.
the number of protein targets with a known or predicted tri-dimensional structure and of drug-like chemical compounds is growing rapidly and so is the need for new therapeutic compounds or chemical probes.
ms-dock can be easily used for the generation of multi-conformer libraries and for shape-based filtering within a multi-step structure-based screening protocol in order to shorten computation times.
first, we developed and validated the multiconf-dock tool that generates several conformers per input ligand.
since shape complementarity is of primary importance for most protein-ligand interactions, we have developed a tool/protocol based on rigid-body docking to select compounds that fit well into binding sites.
