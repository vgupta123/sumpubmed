in the present study, we seek to determine whether ado can increase circulating levels of vegf protein in the intact human.
many in vitro studies have shown that adenosine  can induce vascular endothelial growth factor  mrna and protein expression and stimulate endothelial proliferation.
mean blood pressure  and heart rate  were determined before ado infusion and every  <dig> min for the next  <dig> min.
they were given a  <dig> min intravenous infusion of ado  in conjunction with sestamibi myocardial perfusion scans.
we conclude from these preliminary findings that intravenous infusion of adenosine can increase plasma levels of vegf in humans.
plasma vegf concentrations  were determined immediately before ado infusion and  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after the infusion.
plasma vegf concentration averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg ml- <dig> prior to ado infusion, and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg ml- <dig> at  <dig> h post- infusion .
mbp averaged  <dig> ±  <dig> mmhg and heart rate averaged  <dig> ±  <dig> prior to ado infusion.
