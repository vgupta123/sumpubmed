the results showed that the transcripts were correctly assembled and represent actively expressed genes.
in order to expedite the process of gene discovery, we have undertaken  <dig> pyrosequencing of normalized cdnas prepared from roots, mature leaves, flowers, developing seeds, and embryos of j. curcas.
the large number of transcripts reported in the current study together with existing ests and transcript sequences will serve as an invaluable genetic resource for crop improvement in jatropha.
jatropha curcas l. is an important non-edible oilseed crop with promising future in biodiesel production.
however, factors like oil yield, oil composition, toxic compounds in oil cake, pests and diseases limit its commercial potential.
sequence information of those genes that are involved in oil biosynthesis could be used for metabolic engineering of jatropha to increase oil content, and to modify oil composition.
kegg pathway mapping showed that  <dig>  transcripts are related to major biochemical pathways including the oil biosynthesis pathway.
overall, the current study reports  <dig>  new assembled transcripts which included  <dig> full-length transcripts and  <dig> transcripts that are directly involved in oil biosynthesis.
blastx analysis revealed that  <dig>  of these transcripts are full-length.
well established genetic engineering methods using cloned genes could be used to address these limitations.
