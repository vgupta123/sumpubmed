our results suggest similar patterns and rates of molecular evolution in immune and non-immune genes in a. gambiae.
within each species, no statistically significant differences in mean nucleotide diversity were detected between immune related and non immune related genes.
the extent and distribution of nucleotide diversity in immunity genes might provide insights into the evolutionary forces that condition pathogen-vector interactions.
mean nucleotide diversity  was  <dig>  in the a. gambiae s form,  <dig>  in the m form and  <dig>  in a. arabiensis.
the  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  that we identified are the first large set of anopheles snps from fresh, field-collected material and are relevant markers for future phenotype-association studies.
we sequenced coding fragments of  <dig> immune related genes in natural populations of anopheles gambiae and of  <dig> randomly chosen genes to provide a background measure of genetic diversity across the genome.
the discovery of polymorphisms is an essential step towards association studies of susceptibility to infection.
