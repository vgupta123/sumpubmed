the qtl lightspeed™ protein detection system provides a simple mix and measure "turn on" assay for the detection of kinase activity using natural protein substrates.
we have previously reported a non-radioactive and non-antibody-based fluorescence quench assay for detection of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation using synthetic peptide substrates.
enzyme inhibition yielded ic <dig> values that were comparable to those obtained using peptide substrates.
because of the key role that aberrant regulation of protein phosphorylation plays in diseases such as cancer, diabetes and hypertension, kinases have become one of the main drug targets.
however, the use of natural protein substrates has the advantage that potential inhibitors can be detected that affect enzyme activity by binding to a site other than the catalytic site.
statistical parameters that are used in the high-throughput community to determine assay robustness  demonstrate the suitability of this format for high-throughput screening applications for detection of inhibitors of enzyme activity.
with the exception of antibody-based assays, methods to screen for specific kinase activity are generally restricted to the use of small synthetic peptides as substrates.
using a modified qtl lightspeed™ assay, phosphorylation of native protein was quantified by the interaction of the phosphorylated proteins with metal-ion coordinating groups co-located with fluorescent polymer deposited onto microspheres.
the assay was tested on three different proteins: myelin basic protein , histone h <dig> and phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein .
