in contrast, amp kinase activation by aicar  in wild-type mc3t3-e <dig> cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization.
the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase  was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological amp kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside , in the cells.
osterix, but not runx- <dig>  appeared to be involved in these processes because adipor <dig> sirna transfection and aicar treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mrna expression, respectively.
the transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type i collagen and osteocalcin mrna, as determined by real-time pcr, and reduced alp activity and mineralization, as determined by von kossa and alizarin red stainings.
taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the adipor <dig> and amp kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.
adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear.
