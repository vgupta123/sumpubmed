in mammals, ctcf is active in the regulatory regions of some genes that exhibit genomic imprinting, acting as insulator on only one parental allele to facilitate parent-specific expression.
ctcf is known to act as a chromosomal insulator, bind promoter regions, and facilitate long-range chromatin interactions.
in drosophila, ctcf acts as a chromatin insulator and is thought to be actively involved in the global organization of the genome.
we propose that drosophila ctcf maintains an insulator boundary on the maternal x chromosome, shielding genes from the imprint-induced silencing that occurs on the paternally inherited x chromosome.
we observed disruption of the maternal imprint when ctcf levels were reduced, but no effect was observed on the paternal imprint.
to determine whether ctcf regulates imprinting in drosophila, we generated ctcf mutant alleles and assayed gene expression from the imprinted dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome in the presence of reduced ctcf expression.
the effect was restricted to maintenance of the imprint and was specific for the dplj <dig> mini-x chromosome.
ctcf in drosophila functions in maintaining parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain as it does in mammals.
