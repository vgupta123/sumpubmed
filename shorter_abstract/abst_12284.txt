this has been demonstrated in the case of constructed vaccine strains as well as common human seasonal strains of the virus.
fluresort utilizes those identities to calculate the weighted distance of each across two or more different phylogenetic trees constructed through viral protein sequence alignments.
each weighted mean distance value is normalized by conversion to a z-score to establish a reassorted strain.
flushuffle considers different combinations of viral protein identities that match the mass spectral data using a gibbs sampling algorithm employing a mixed protein markov chain monte carlo  method.
the flushuffle and fluresort algorithms were tested with both experimental and simulated mass spectra of whole virus digests.
the new flushuffle and fluresort algorithms can correctly identify the origins of influenza viral proteins and the number of reassortment events required to produce the strains from the high resolution mass spectral data of whole virus proteolytic digestions.
influenza is one of the oldest and deadliest infectious diseases known to man.
the algorithms significantly improve the capability of the proteotyping approach to identify reassorted viruses that pose the greatest pandemic risk.
