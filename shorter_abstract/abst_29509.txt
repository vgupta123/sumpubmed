this prediction had a substantially low estimated false discovery rate, and a considerable number of the predicted ncrnas represented novel classes with unknown functions.
in the first analysis, the predicted candidate ncrnas were identified based on conservation with the related trypanosomatid leishmania braziliensis.
our classifier for function prediction based on cis-acting regulatory elements can also, in combination with other methods, provide the means for homology-independent annotation of trypanosomatid genomes.
a few cis-acting rna elements in 3'-untranslated regions of mrnas have been identified in trypanosomatids, which affect the mrna stability or translation rate in different life stages of these parasites.
functional rnas, including non-coding rnas  and cis-acting rna elements involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, were predicted based on two independent computational analyses of the genome of trypanosoma brucei.
in the second analysis, we identified a number of function-specific regulatory motifs, based on which we devised a classifier that can be used for homology-independent function prediction in t. brucei.
other functional rnas  also play essential roles in these organisms.
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is the dominant regulatory mechanism in trypanosomatids as their mrnas are transcribed from polycistronic units.
