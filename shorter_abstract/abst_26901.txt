using coalescent simulations and an approximate bayesian computation framework we detected several instances of genes departing from selective neutrality within each group and showed that the polymorphism of two nodulation and four flowering genes has probably been shaped by recent positive selection.
we examined nucleotide variation among  <dig> accessions from natural populations in  <dig> gene fragments:  <dig> genes involved in nitrogen-fixing bacteria recognition,  <dig> genes involved in flowering, and  <dig> genes used as control loci.
here we used data from  <dig> individuals and  <dig> gene fragments to quantify the overall strength of both positive and purifying selection in m. truncatula and asked if footprints of positive selection can be detected at key genes of rhizobia recognition pathways.
we quantify the intensity of purifying selection in the m. truncatula genome and show that putative footprints of natural selection can be detected at different time scales in both flowering and symbiotic pathways.
we studied patterns of molecular adaptation in the wild mediterranean legume medicago truncatula.
phenology is an important fitness component, especially for annual plants, and many instances of molecular adaptation have been reported for genes involved in flowering pathways.
while perception of symbiotic microbes is also integral to adaptation in many plant species, very few reports of molecular adaptation exist for symbiotic genes.
