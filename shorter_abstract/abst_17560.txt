these data are being used to develop hypotheses of resistance or susceptibility mechanisms in malus to e. amylovora and provide an initial categorization of genes possibly involved in recognition events, early signaling responses the subsequent development of resistance or susceptibility.
no resistance mechanism to e. amylovora in host plants has yet been characterized, recent work has identified some molecular events which occur in resistant and/or susceptible host interaction with e. amylovora: in order to understand the mechanisms that characterize responses to fb, differentially expressed genes were identified by cdna-aflp analysis in resistant and susceptible apple genotypes after inoculation with e. amylovora.
the necrogenic enterobacterium, erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of the fire blight  disease in many rosaceaespecies, including apple and pear.
these data also provided potential candidates for improving apple resistance to fire blight either by marker-assisted selection or genetic engineering.
cdna-aflp analysis of global est expression in a resistant and a susceptible apple genotype identified different major classes of genes.
cdna were isolated from m. <dig>  and g. <dig>  apple tissues collected  <dig> h and  <dig> h after challenge with a virulent e. amylovora strain or mock  inoculated.
in the aflp experiments, m. <dig> and g. <dig> showed different patterns of expression, including genes specifically induced, not induced, or repressed by e. amylovora.
est sequencing data showed that genes linked to resistance, encoding proteins involved in recognition, signaling, defense and apoptosis, were modulated by e. amylovora in its host plant.
