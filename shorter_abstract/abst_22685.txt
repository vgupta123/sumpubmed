internal exon deletions are the absence of consecutive exons in a gene.
such deletions have potentially significant biological meaning, and they are often too short to be considered copy number variation.
therefore, to the need for efficient detection of such deletions using exome sequencing data exists.
further comparisons with multiple sequencing-based cnv tools showed that exondel is capable of detecting unique ieds not found by other cnv tools.
