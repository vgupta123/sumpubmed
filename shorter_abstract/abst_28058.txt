here, we present the results of two large-scale microarray experiments on s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens genomic dna, to explore mm oligonucleotide behavior with real sample mixtures under tiling-array conditions.
while many experiments rely on such oligos, the hybridization behavior of various degrees of mismatch  structure has not been extensively studied.
we examined all possible nucleotide substitutions at the central position of 36-nucleotide probes, and found that nonspecific binding by mm oligos depends upon the individual nucleotide substitutions they incorporate: c→a, c→g and t→a  are most disruptive, whereas a→x were least disruptive.
rna sample mixture complexity may increase the amount of nonspecific hybridization, magnify gc skew and boost the intensity of mm oligos at all levels.
multiple mismatches per oligo are largely additive in effect: each mm added in a distributed fashion causes an additional 21% intensity drop relative to pm, three-fold more disruptive than adding adjacent mispairs .
we also quantify a marked gc skew effect: substitutions raising probe gc content exhibit higher intensity .
to avoid gc skew, individual substitutions should not alter probe gc content.
mismatched oligonucleotides are widely used on microarrays to differentiate specific from nonspecific hybridization.
we investigate several parameters for oligonucleotide design, including the effects of each central nucleotide substitution on array signal intensity and of multiple mm per oligo.
