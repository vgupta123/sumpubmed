we compare two pins by combining interaction topology and sequence similarity to identify conserved network substructures .
based on the species-to-species difference in conss, we infer potential species divergence.
we also find that different species harbor many conserved interaction regions that are topologically identical and these regions can constitute larger interaction regions that are topologically different but similar in framework.
motivated by the need of analyzing and interpreting the fast-growing data in the field of proteomics, we propose a comparative strategy to carry out global analysis of pins.
our result demonstrates that the cross-species comparison strategy we adopt is powerful for the exploration of biological problems from the perspective of networks.
in spite of the incompleteness of data, pin comparison discloses species conservation at the network level and the identified conss are also functionally conserved and involve in basic cellular functions.
it seems that different species organize orthologs in similar but not necessarily the same topology to achieve similar or the same function.
