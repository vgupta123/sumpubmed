fip <dig> also controls recycling endosome distribution during interphase.
finally, we show that de/phosphorylation of the phospho-acceptor sites identified here  is not required for the spatial control of recycling endosome distribution or function.
in an attempt to identify a functional role for fip <dig> phosphorylation, we report that the change in fip <dig> distribution from cytosolic to membrane-associated observed during progression from anaphase to telophase is accompanied by a concomitant dephosphorylation of fip <dig>  however, the phospho-acceptor sites identified here did not control this change in distribution.
s <dig> is dephosphorylated during telophase; mutation of s <dig> exerts a modest effect on cytokinesis.
we identify four sites of phosphorylation of fip <dig> in vivo, s- <dig>  s- <dig>  s- <dig> and s- <dig> and identify s- <dig> as a target for cdk1-cyclin b in vitro.
rab <dig> and its effector molecule, rab11-fip <dig> , associate with recycling endosomes and traffic into the furrow and midbody of cells during cytokinesis.
over-expression of fip3-s102d increased the frequency of binucleate cells consistent with a role for this phospho-acceptor site in cytokinesis.
mutation of s- <dig>  s- <dig> or s- <dig> or other previously identified phospho-acceptor sites  was without effect on binucleate cell formation and did not modulate the distribution of fip <dig> during the cell cycle.
our data thus identify fip <dig> as a cell cycle regulated phosphoprotein and suggest dephosphorylation of fip <dig> accompanies its translocation from the cytosol to membranes during telophase.
