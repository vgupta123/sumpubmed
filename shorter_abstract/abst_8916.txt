in the economically highly important grass family, our knowledge of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional networks is still very limited.
our work provides the first large-scale collection of cis-elements for rice and sorghum and can serve as a paradigm for cis-element analysis through comparative genomics in grasses in general.
in this study, we identified thousands of phylogenetic footprints conserved between orthologous rice and sorghum upstream regions that are supported by co-expression information derived from three different rice expression data sets.
with the completion of the sorghum genome and the available rice genome sequence, comparative promoter analyses now allow genome-scale detection of conserved cis-elements.
sequence conservation and matches to known plant motifs support our findings.
expression similarities of gene pairs positively correlate with the number of motifs that are shared by gene pairs and corroborate the importance of similar promoter architectures for concerted regulation.
in a complementary approach, cis-motifs were discovered by their highly conserved co-occurrence in syntenic promoter pairs.
