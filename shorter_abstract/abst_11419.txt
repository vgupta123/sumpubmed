furthermore, co-injection of onnv with dshsc70b significantly reduced the lifespan of adult mosquitoes as compared with the control, co-injection of onnv with dsβ-gal treated mosquitoes.
onnv titers from mosquitoes co-injected with dshsc70b were about 9-fold higher at  <dig> days post-injection  as compared to the control mosquitoes.
we previously reported that expression of hsc70b and other genes including elongation factor-1α  and the agglutinin attachment subunit  were up-regulated in o'nyong-nyong virus -infected female an.
therefore, mosquitoes can function as vectors of onnv transmission to humans while onnv infection in an.
these results indicate that hsc70b plays important roles in homeostasis and suppression of onnv replication in the vector, an.
double-stranded rna interferences have been applied to further investigate hsc70b, ef-1α and the agglutinin functions in onnv replication in an.
among these three rnai silenced genes, only dsrnas of hsc70b  promoted onnv replication in adult an.
phylogenetic and functional analysis was conducted on an anopheles gambiae gene, ensangg <dig>  based on phylogenetic analysis, this gene belongs to the same lineage as heat shock protein cognate 70- <dig>  in drosophila.
gambiae compared to the control mosquitoes that were co-injected with onnv and dsrna of β-galactosidase .
