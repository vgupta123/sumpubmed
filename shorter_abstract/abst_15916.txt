to provide further insights into plant tolerance, the transcriptome profiles of drought- and cold-treated a. mongolicus seedlings were analyzed using illumina technology and differentially expressed genes  were compared.
a comprehensive transcriptome of a. mongolicus was sequenced using pooled mrna extracted from drought-, cold-stressed and unstressed seedlings as well as leaves from naturally grown shrub.
transcriptome profiles were analyzed in a. mongolicus seedlings after drought and cold treatments at three time points .
the present study provides the most comprehensive transcriptome resource and the first dynamic transcriptome profiles of a. mongolicus under drought and cold stresses.
the up-regulated degs will be valuable for further investigations of key genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation of a. mongolicus to harsh environments.
functional enrichment analyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses.
the molecular mechanisms involved in plant tolerance to either drought or cold have been extensively studied in many plant species.
ammopiptanthus mongolicus  cheng f. is the only evergreen broadleaf shrub grown in the central asian desert and it has very strong cold and drought tolerance.
these sequences were assembled into  <dig> unigenes, of which  <dig> unigenes had an annotated function and  <dig> encoded transcription factors .
this information will deepen our understanding of plant tolerance to drought and cold.
among these degs  <dig> and  <dig> degs were common across the three time points of drought and cold treatments respectively, and  <dig> degs were co-regulated by both stresses.
between  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were identified as degs at a single time point in both stresses.
