the application of our results may assist in the breeding process of a pear rootstock that confers both vigour control and precocity to the grafted scion cultivar.
the seedlings were grafted as rootstocks with ‘doyenne du comice’ scions and comprehensively phenotyped over four growing seasons for traits related to tree architecture and flowering, in order to describe the growth of the scions.
for the efficient breeding of new pyrus rootstocks it is crucial to understand the genetic determinants of vigour control and precocity.
we report the first qtls associated with vigour control and flowering traits in pear rootstocks.
orthologous loci were found to control scion growth and precocity in apple and pear rootstocks.
