the purified fusion protein wzb was active on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate , with an optimal activity in presence of bovine serum albumin  at ph  <dig>  and a temperature of 75°c.
copper ions were essential for phosphatase activity, which was significantly increased by addition of cobalt.
extracts showed phosphatase activity towards tyrosine-containing peptides.
mutated fusion wzb proteins exhibited reduced phosphatase activity on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate.
however, one variant  showed close to 20% increase in phosphatase activity.
native and modified his-tag fusion wzb proteins were purified from escherichia coli cultures.
these characteristics reveal significant differences with the manganese-dependent cpsb protein tyrosine phosphatase described for streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with the polysaccharide-related phosphatases of gram negative bacteria.
reversible phosphorylation events within a polymerisation complex have been proposed to modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae.
similar phosphatase and kinase genes are present in the exopolysaccharide  biosynthesis loci of numerous lactic acid bacteria genomes.
at 50°c, residual activity decreased to  <dig> %.
