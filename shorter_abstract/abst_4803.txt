the cf- <dig> gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  the candidate genes solyc01g <dig> .
<dig> showed related amino acid sequence structures and expression patterns.
the results from this study will facilitate the breeding of cultivars carrying the cf- <dig> gene and provide a basis for further gene cloning, resistance gene evolution and plant resistance mechanism studies.
<dig> had a close evolutionary relationship with the functional hcr <dig> members cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  and was very different from non-functional members.
cf genes confer resistance to c. fulvum, and the c. fulvum-tomato pathosystem is a model for the study of gene-for-gene interactions.
plants carrying the cf- <dig> gene show effective resistance to c. fulvum in the field, and can be used in breeding and resistance mechanism studies as new resistant materials.
a total of  <dig> diff_markers and three association regions were found in association analysis.
tomato leaf mold is a common disease in tomato cultivation.
two candidate genes, solyc01g <dig> .
sequence analysis showed that solyc01g <dig> .
