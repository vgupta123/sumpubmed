we also identified  <dig> potential novel mirnas by mireap,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in all three cycling stages, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively.
during all hair cycle stages of cashmere goats, a large number of conserved and novel mirnas were identified through a high-throughput sequencing approach.
the expression level of five arbitrarily selected mirnas was analyzed by quantitative pcr, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the solexa sequencing results.
gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses indicated that five major biological pathways  accounted for  <dig> % of target genes among  <dig> biological functions, indicating that these pathways are likely to play significant roles during hair cycling.
micrornas  are a large family of endogenous, non-coding rnas, about  <dig> nucleotides long, which regulate gene expression through sequence-specific base pairing with target mrnas.
in this study, the skin tissues were harvested from the three stages of hair follicle cycling  in a fibre-producing goat breed.
extensive studies have shown that mirna expression in the skin changes remarkably during distinct stages of the hair cycle in humans, mice, goats and sheep.
