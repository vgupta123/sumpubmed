we have generated a nucleotide sequence alignment editor  that provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface for manual editing of multiple sequence alignments with functions for input, editing, and output of sequence alignments.
for very polymorphic species such as maize, this has lead to a need for intuitive, user-friendly software that aids the biologist, often with na√Øve programming capability, in tracking, editing, displaying, and exporting multiple individual sequence alignments.
we anticipate that this software will be of general interest to biologists and population genetics in editing dna sequence alignments and analyzing natural sequence variation regardless of species, and will be particularly useful for manual alignment editing of sequences in species with high levels of polymorphism.
dnaaligneditor works as a client/server tool having two main components: a relational database that collects the processed alignments and a user interface connected to database through universal data access connectivity drivers.
