these findings shed light on the sequence correlates of a highly conserved biological process, and improve in silico prediction of 3' mrna cleavage and polyadenylation sites.
we studied these signals using exhaustive databases of cleavage sites obtained from aligning raw expressed sequence tags  sequences to genomic sequences in homo sapiens and drosophila melanogaster.
these refined motifs are applied, within a hidden markov model  framework, to predict mrna cleavage sites.
these data show that the polyadenylation signal is highly conserved in human and fly.
the signal recognized by the cleavage enzyme complex has been characterized as an a rich region upstream of the cleavage site containing a motif with consensus aauaaa, followed by a u or ug rich region downstream of the cleavage site.
