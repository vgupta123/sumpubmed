large tr were classified based on sequence similarity, chromosome position, monomer length, array variability, and gc content; we identified four superfamilies, eight families, and  <dig> subfamilies - including  <dig> not previously described.
using a bioinformatics approach, we identified large tr with array size more than  <dig> kb in two mouse whole genome shotgun  assemblies.
3) transposable elements related superfamily contains two families.
trpc-21a-mm probe hybridized to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  multi locus tr-22a-mm probe hybridized to ten chromosomes, and single locus tr-54b-mm probe hybridized with the long loops that emerge from chromosome ends.
despite multi locus location, trpc-21a-mm is placed into a separated family due to its abundance, strictly pericentromeric location, and resemblance to big human satellites.
we report here a genome wide analysis of the large tandem repeats  found in the mouse genome assemblies.
4) the superfamily of heterogeneous tandem repeats includes four families.
one family is found only in the wgs, while two families represent tandem repeats with either single or multi locus location.
1) the superfamily of centromeric minor satellite is only found in the unassembled part of the reference genome.
2) the pericentromeric major satellite is the most abundant superfamily and reveals high order repeat structure.
in addition to in silico predicted several extra-chromosomes were positive for tr by in situ analysis, potentially indicating inaccurate genome assembly of the heterochromatic genome regions.
