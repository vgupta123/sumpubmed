human height is a complex heritable trait; by integrating genome-wide snp data and human adipose bayesian causal network, which closely represents bone transcriptional regulations, we identified plag <dig> as a causal gene for limb bone length.
this finding is consistent with gwas findings for human height and supports the common genetic architecture between swine and humans.
by leveraging a human protein-protein interaction network, we identified two putative candidate causal genes tgfb <dig> and dab2ip and the known regulators mesp <dig> and mesp <dig> as responsible for the variation in rib number and identified the potential underlying molecular mechanisms.
the pig, which shares greater similarities with human than with mouse, is important for agriculture and for studying human diseases.
our findings show that integrative network analyses reveal causal regulators underlying the genetic association of complex traits in swine and that these causal regulators have similar effects in humans.
in mice, knockout of tgfb <dig> and tgfb <dig> together decreases rib number.
by comparing candidates for anemia traits identified in swine genome-wide snp association and human genome-wide association studies , we showed that both sets of candidates are related to the biological process “cellular lipid metabolism” in liver.
