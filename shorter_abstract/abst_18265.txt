our results indicate that rule discovery followed by distance separation is a powerful computational method to identify reliable mirna biomarkers.
the classification performance of our best mirna rules remarkably outperformed that by randomly selected mirna rules.
this work is aimed to detect 2-and 3-mirna groups, together with specific expression ranges of these mirnas, to form simple linear discriminant rules for biomarker identification and biological interpretation.
we also found that most of the chromosomal loci of these mirnas have a high frequency of genomic alteration in lung cancer.
a distance separation technique is used to select the most reliable rules which are then evaluated on a large independent data set.
the visualization of the rules and the clear separation between the normal and cancer samples by our rules will help biology experts for their analysis and biological interpretation.
altered expression profiles of micrornas  are linked to many diseases including lung cancer.
on the independent data set , the three mirnas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> from our best rule can separate the two classes of samples at the accuracy of  <dig> %, sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %.
our data analysis also showed that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have two common predicted target genes fzd <dig> and rps6ka <dig>  which are actually genes associated with carcinoma according to the online mendelian inheritance in man  database.
our method is based on a novel committee of decision trees to derive 2-and 3-mirna 100%-frequency rules.
mirna expression profiling is reproducible and mirnas are very stable.
this method is applied to a data set of lung mirna expression profiles of  <dig> squamous cell carcinoma  samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples.
