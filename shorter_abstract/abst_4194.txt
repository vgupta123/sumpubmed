hypo  <dig> was validated using fischer randomization method, test set with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> , leave-one-out method and decoy set with a goodness of hit score of  <dig> .
among ten generated pharmacophore hypotheses, hypo  <dig> was chosen as best pharmacophore hypothesis.
the best pharmacophore hypothesis, hypo  <dig>  with high predictive ability contains chemical features required for the effective inhibition of bace- <dig>  using hypo  <dig>  we have identified two compounds with diverse chemical scaffolds as potential virtual leads which, as such or upon further optimization, can be used in the designing of new bace- <dig> inhibitors.
these hits were docked into the active site of bace- <dig> and further refined based on molecular interactions with the essential amino acids and good gold fitness score.
hypo  <dig> consists of one hydrogen bond donor, one positive ionizable, one ring aromatic and two hydrophobic features with high correlation coefficient of  <dig> , highest cost difference of  <dig>  bits and lowest rmsd value of  <dig> .
the validated hypo  <dig> was used as a 3d query in database screening and retrieved  <dig> compounds with the estimated activity value < <dig> nm.
beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme  is a single-membrane protein belongs to the aspartyl protease class of catabolic enzymes.
the cleavage of app by bace- <dig> is the rate-limiting step in the amyloid cascade leading to the production of two peptide fragments aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  among two peptide fragments aβ <dig> is the primary species thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity and amyloid plaque formation that lead to memory and cognitive defects in alzheimer’s disease .
the hypothesis was validated by four different methods and the best hypothesis was utilized in database screening of four chemical databases like maybridge, chembridge, nci and asinex.
inhibition of bace- <dig> is expected to stop amyloid plaque formation and emerged as an interesting and attractive therapeutic target for ad.
a training set of  <dig> compounds with known experimental activity was used to generate pharmacophore hypotheses using 3d qsar pharmacophore generation module available in discovery studio.
