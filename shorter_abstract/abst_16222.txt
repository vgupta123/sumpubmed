further analysis of coordinated mechanisms involving haspin and aurora kinases will shed new light on the regulation of chromosome segregation in cell division during plant growth and development.
live imaging of athaspin-tdtomato and gfp-Î±-tubulin in by- <dig> cells showed that athaspin-tdtomato localized on chromosomes during prometaphase and metaphase, and around the cell plate during cytokinesis.
our results indicated that the haspin kinase is a histone h <dig> threonine kinase in a. thaliana.
overexpression of a kinase domain mutant of athaspin decreased the size of the root meristem, which delayed root growth.
the expression and dominant-negative analysis showed that athaspin may have a role in mitotic cell division during plant growth.
moreover, phosphorylation of histone h <dig> at thr <dig> by haspin in fission yeast, xenopus, and human is required for accumulation of aurora b on the centromere, and the subsequent activation of aurora b kinase activity for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation.
athaspin-gfp driven by the native promoter was expressed in root meristems, shoot meristems, floral meristems, and throughout the whole embryo at stages of high cell division.
haspin kinases are mitotic kinases that are well-conserved from yeast to human.
here, we identified a haspin kinase, designated athaspin, in arabidopsis thaliana.
human haspin is a histone h <dig> thr <dig> kinase that has important roles in chromosome cohesion during mitosis.
