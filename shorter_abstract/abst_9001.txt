we have developed a macrophage hybridoma cell line  created by fusion of u <dig> cells with primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, resulting in a non-adherent cell line expressing several properties of primary macrophages.
in the current study we show that the mannose receptor found on this novel cell has endocytic characteristics consistent with and similar to the mannose receptor found on the surface of monocyte-derived human macrophages and rat bone marrow-derived macrophages.
in addition, we demonstrate that these cells engage and internalize pathogen particles such as s. aureus and c. albicans.
another difficulty has been the lack of a human macrophage cell line expressing a fully functional receptor.
commonly used human macrophage cell lines such as u <dig>  thp- <dig>  mono-mac and hl <dig> do not express the mannose receptor.
the 43mr cell line represents the first naturally expressed mr-positive cell line derived from a human macrophage background.
this cell line provides an important cell model for other researchers for the study of human mr biology and host-pathogen interactions.
the mannose receptor is the best described member of the type i transmembrane c-type lectins; however much remains unanswered about the biology of the receptor.
one difficulty has been the inability to consistently express high levels of a functional full length mannose receptor cdna in mammalian cells.
the purpose of this study was to identify and select mannose receptor-expressing cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and to characterize the expression and function of the receptor.
