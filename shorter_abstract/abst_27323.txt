an essential structural role can be assigned to a widely conserved glycine residue, while aspartate and histidine residues, highly conserved in putative transmembrane domains, might be involved in metal transport.
the function of some conserved amino acids was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis in the poplar zn2+ transporter ptdmtp <dig> and compared with similar experiments performed in prokaryotic members.
in the present study phylogenetic and functional analyses have allowed the identification of three major substrate-specific cdf groups.
in this work a broad phylogenetic study has been undertaken which, considered in the context of the functional characteristics of some fully characterised cdf transporters, has aimed at identifying molecular determinants of substrate selectivity and at suggesting metal specificity for newly identified cdf transporters.
the metal selectivity of newly identified cdf transporters can be inferred by their position in one of these groups.
the potential role of group-conserved amino acid residues in metal specificity is discussed.
the modified signature sequence proposed in this work can be used to identify new hypothetical cdf members.
phylogenetic reconstruction has classified the majority of cdf family members into three groups, each containing characterised members that share the same specificity towards the principally-transported metal, i.e.
