the present updates allow constraint-based analyses to be performed; viability predictions of single knockouts are comparable to results from in vivo experiments and to those of previous reconstructions.
we have expanded the yeast network reconstruction to incorporate many new reactions from the literature and represented these in a well-annotated and standards-compliant manner.
we report the development of the most complete reconstruction of yeast metabolism to date that is based upon reliable literature evidence and richly annotated according to miriam standards.
the recent community-driven reconstruction, while rigorously evidenced and well annotated, under-represented metabolite transport, lipid metabolism and other pathways, and was not amenable to constraint-based analyses because of lack of pathway connectivity.
the representation of lipid metabolism in particular has improved, with  <dig> out of  <dig> enzymes linked to lipid metabolism now present in at least one reaction.
the new reconstruction comprises  <dig> unique metabolic reactions involving  <dig> unique metabolites - significantly larger in scope than any previous reconstruction.
