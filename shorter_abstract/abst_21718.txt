due to their role of receptors or transporters, membrane proteins play a key role in many important biological functions.
six datasets have been used for the experiments, considering different encodings for the input sequences.
an encoding that includes the topology changes in the sequence  allowed us to obtain the best results.
we compared our results with other well-known methods, that obtain a slightly better precision.
in our work we used grammatical inference  to localize transmembrane segments.
however, this work shows that it is possible to apply grammatical inference techniques in an effective way to bioinformatics problems.
