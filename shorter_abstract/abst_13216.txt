genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in parent-of-origin specific monoallelic gene expression.
the identification of a novel dmr at a non-conserved location as well as the first demonstration of histone modifications at imprinted loci in the opossum suggest that genomic imprinting may have evolved in a common ancestor of these two therian infra-classes with subsequent divergence of regulatory mechanisms in the two lineages.
interestingly, a novel dmr was identified in intron  <dig> of the imprinted igf2r gene, but this was not conserved in eutherians.
the phenomenon of genomic imprinting is conserved in therians, but the marked difference in the number and location of imprinted genes and dmrs between metatherians and eutherians indicates that imprinting is not fully conserved between the two therian infra-classes.
in this study, we determined the imprint status of metatherian orthologues of eutherian imprinted genes.
it is postulated to have evolved in placental mammals to modulate intrauterine resource allocation to the offspring.
mest expressed a monoallelic and a biallelic transcript, as in eutherians.
