thus, c. semilaevis is a good model that can be used to investigate mechanisms responsible for such dimorphism, this model can also be utilized to answer fundamental questions in evolution and applied fields of aquaculture.
in this study, c. semilaevis was subjected to de novo transcriptome sequencing and characterization.
our data provided an integrated and comprehensive transcriptome resource for c. semilaevis.
a search of repetitive elements was performed, and  <dig>  transposable elements were identified.
a total of  <dig>  reads were generated using a single  <dig> sequencing run in a full picotiter plate.
a total of  <dig>  sequences were successfully annotated based on sequence similarities; among these sequences,  <dig>  transcripts exhibited gene ontology terms and  <dig>  showed enzyme commissions associated with  <dig> pathways from kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes pathways.
