outbreaks in poultry involving influenza virus from h <dig> subtype have resulted in human infections, thus causing a major concern for public health, as well as for the poultry industry.
currently, no efficient rapid test is available for large-scale detection of either antigen or antibody of h <dig> avian influenza viruses.
the antigen detection limit was less than  <dig> ha unit of h <dig>  for antibody detection, the sensitivity and specificity of the dual elisa was evaluated and compared to hi and microneutralization using immunized animal sera to different h <dig> strains and different subtypes of aivs.
results indicated that antibodies to h <dig> were readily detected in immunized animal sera by the dual elisa whereas specimens with antibodies to other aivs yielded negative results.
this is the first dual-function elisa reported for either antigen or antibody detection against h <dig> aivs.
the dual elisa was able to detect all of the five h <dig> antigens tested without any cross reaction to other influenza subtypes.
