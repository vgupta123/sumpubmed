the phylogenetic relationships of the three major ranoid taxa  have been problematic, and mitogenomic information for afrobatrachians has not been available.
furthermore, evolutionary trends in rearranged mt genes have not been well understood.
to gain molecular and phylogenetic insights into these issues, we analyzed the mt genomes of four afrobatrachian species  and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses.
phylogenetic analyses based on mitogenomic data support a close relationship between afrobatrachia and microhylidae, with their estimated divergence  <dig> million years ago consistent with present-day endemism of afrobatrachians on the african continent.
we also showed that specific nucleotide substitution and compositional patterns expected in duplicated and rearranged mt genes did not occur, suggesting no disadvantage in employing these genes for phylogenetic inference.
extensively reorganized mt genomes having many duplicated and rearranged genes were found in three of the four afrobatrachians analyzed.
in fact, breviceps has the largest known mt genome among vertebrates.
several molecular models for mitochondrial  gene rearrangements have been proposed, but observational evidence has been insufficient to evaluate them.
furthermore we searched for two evolutionary patterns expected in the rearranged mt genes of ranoids.
