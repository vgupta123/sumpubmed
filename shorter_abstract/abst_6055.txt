our results suggest that tafer-5b plays an important role in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ros scavenging.
to examine whether the function of ferritin from mono- and dico-species is conserved, tafer-5b was transformed into arabidopsis, and overexpression of tafer-5b functionally complemented the heat stress-sensitive phenotype of a ferritin-lacking mutant of arabidopsis.
in addition, tafer-5b overexpression also enhanced drought, oxidative and excess iron stress tolerance associated with the ros scavenging.
the yield of wheat , an important crop, is adversely affected by heat stress in many regions of the world.
a novel ferritin gene, tafer, was identified from our previous heat stress-responsive transcriptome analysis of a heat-tolerant wheat cultivar .
moreover, tafer-5b is essential for protecting cells against heat stress associated with protecting cells against ros.

to confirm the function of tafer-5b in wheat, tafer-5b was transformed into the wheat cultivar jimai <dig> , and the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced thermotolerance.
