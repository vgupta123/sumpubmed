both knockdown of tlr <dig> with sirna and pharmacological inhibition of tlr <dig> with polymyxin b significantly decreased lps-induced autophagy.
escherichia coli  is the most common organism caused single-germ enterobacterial peritonitis during peritoneal dialysis.
after incubation of hmrsv <dig> cells with e.coli following lps stimulation, both the intracellular bactericidal activity and the co-localization of e.coli  with autophagosomes were enhanced.
conversely, blockade of autophagy with 3-methyladenine, wortmannin or beclin- <dig> small-interfering rna  led to a significant reduction in autophagy-associated protein expression, attenuation of intracellular bactericidal activity, and reduced co-localization of e.coli with monodansylcadaverine-labeled autophagosomes.
furthermore, tlr <dig> sirna attenuated remarkably lps-induced intracellular bactericidal activity.
our findings demonstrated for the first time that lps-induced autophagy in peritoneal mesothelial cells could enhance the intracellular bactericidal activity and the co-localization of e.coli with autophagosomes.
autophagy in human peritoneal mesothelial cell line  was induced by lipopolysaccharide  in a dose-dependent and time-dependent way, which was demonstrated by increased expression of beclin- <dig> and light chain  <dig> -ii, the accumulation of punctate green fluorescent protein-lc <dig>  and a higher number of monodansylcadaverine-labeled autophagic vacuoles.
in this study, we investigated autophagy of peritoneal mesothelial cells and its role in defense against e.coli.
these results indicate that lps-induced autophagy may be a cell-autonomous defense mechanism triggered in peritoneal mesothelial cells in response to e.coli infection.
