while only one or two major serovars from four of the most prevalent serogroups were represented, four predominant serovars were found in serogroup c <dig> salmonellae.
in order to study the prevalent serogroups and serovars of clinical isolates in taiwan,  <dig> salmonellae isolates were collected from  <dig> medical centers and district hospitals throughout the country from  <dig> to  <dig>  the pulsed-field eletrophoresis types  and antibiotic resistance profiles of salmonella enterica serovars bareilly  and braenderup  were compared, and multi-drug resistance  plasmids were characterized.
over 95% of human salmonellosis in taiwan was caused by five salmonella serogroups: b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig>  s. typhymurium, s. enteritidis, s. stanley and s. newport were the four most prevalent serovars, accounting for about 64% of isolates.
both serovars differed by xbai-pfge patterns.
two prevalent serovars within serogroup c <dig>  s. bareilly and cluster b of s. braenderup, were clonal and drug-susceptible.
two distinct major clones in s. braenderup were cluster a, mainly including mdr isolates with large mdr plasmid from north taiwan, and cluster b, mainly containing susceptible isolates without r plasmid from south taiwan.
in cluster a, there were two types of conjugative r plasmids with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb.
however, cluster a of s. braenderup was mdr and probably derived from susceptible isolates by acquiring one of two distinct conjugative r plasmids.
s. braenderup mainly caused gastroenteritis in children; in contrast, s. bareiley infected children and elderly people.
the prevalence was decreasing for s. choleraeuis and s. braenderup, and s. virchow and increasing for s. bareilly.
although type  <dig> plasmids showed higher conjugation capability, type  <dig> plasmids were the predominant plasmid.
serogroups b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> of salmonella caused over 95% of human salmonellosis.
nontyphoidal salmonella is the main cause of human salmonellosis.
