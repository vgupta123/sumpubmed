this trna is unnecessary for growth, but is required for some aspects of secondary metabolism and morphological development.
at the end of rapid growth, a co-ordinated transient up-regulation of about  <dig> genes, including many for ribosomal proteins, was seen in the parent strain but not the Î”blda mutant.
some were involved in the biosynthesis of seven secondary metabolites; and some have probable roles in reorganising metabolism after rapid growth.
we describe a transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the effects of deleting blda on cellular processes during submerged culture: conditions relevant to the industrial production of antibiotics.
only two of the  <dig> genes contain a tta codon, but some effects of blda could be traced to tta codons in regulatory genes or polycistronic operons.
different technical limitations of the two approaches were a major cause of discrepancies in the results obtained with them.
several proteins were affected post-translationally by the blda deletion.
transcripts or proteins from a further  <dig> genes classified as blda-influenced were mostly expressed late in culture in the wild-type, though others were significantly transcribed during exponential growth.
increased basal levels of the signal molecule ppgpp in the mutant strain may be responsible for this difference.
