the mutational substructure of aluyh3a <dig> can be explained completely by inference of single master gene.
in this study, subfamilies falling on the aluyi and aluyh lineages, and the aluyg <dig> subfamily, are assessed for the presence of secondary source genes, and the influence of gene conversion on the aluyh and aluyi lineages is also described.
a complete backwards gene conversion event appears to have inactivated the aluyh3a <dig> master gene in humans.
it is clear that there is considerable variation in the number of source genes present in each of the young alu subfamilies.
polymorphism data suggest a larger number of secondary source elements may be active in the aluyg <dig> family than previously thought.
it is now believed that there may be several retrotranspositionally-competent source genes within an alu subfamily.
the aluyh <dig> and aluyi <dig> subfamilies appear to contain multiple source genes.
alu elements are a family of sine retrotransposons in primates.
