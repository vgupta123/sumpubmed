where the horse/pony had been in that persons care over the previous  <dig> months , colic had been observed in  <dig> horses  during that time.
crib-biting and windsucking  behaviour in horses has been associated with increased risk of colic in general, recurrence of colic and specific forms of colic.
a total of  <dig> colic episodes were reported and  <dig> colic episodes required surgical intervention in  <dig> horses.
the results of this study can be used to identify horses that display cbws who are at increased risk of colic and identifies areas for further research to determine if there are ways in which this risk might be reduced.
the aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of colic within a population of horses that display cbws behaviour and to identify risk factors for colic.
data were obtained for a number of variables considered to be possible risk factors for colic.
increased duration of ownership, increased duration of stabling in the autumn months , crib-biting/windsucking behaviour associated with eating forage and horses that were fed haylage were associated with increased risk of colic .
a total of  <dig> colic episodes were reported in the preceding  <dig> months of which veterinary attendance was required in  <dig>  episodes.
