we found significant variability in classification accuracy, precision, and resource consumption of sequence classification programs when used to analyze various metagenomics data sets.
we divided the very large number of programs that have been released in recent years for solving the sequence classification problem into three main categories based on the general algorithm they use to compare a query sequence against a database of sequences.
a fundamental problem in modern genomics is to taxonomically or functionally classify dna sequence fragments derived from environmental sampling .
however, we observe some general trends and patterns that will be useful to researchers who use sequence classification programs.
