furthermore, some batch-biased variants occur in known cancer genes, potentially causing misinterpretation of mutation profiles.
our strategy for identifying batch-biased variants and characterising sequence patterns might be useful in eliminating false variants and facilitating correct interpretation of sequence profiles.
large-scale collection of data inevitably generates batch effects introduced by differences in processing at various stages from sample collection to data generation.
the batch-biased variants, which had a unique mutational spectrum with frequent indel-type mutations, preferentially occurred at sites prone to sequencing errors, e.g., in long homopolymer runs.
the cancer genome atlas  is a comprehensive database that includes multi-layered cancer genome profiles.
