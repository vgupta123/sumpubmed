this study expands existing knowledge on the genetic diversity and evolution of prrsv in vietnam and assists the effective strategies for prrs vaccine development in vietnam.
the results showed that phylogenetic analysis indicated that all strains belonged to sub-lineages  <dig>  and  <dig> .
furthermore, the results revealed differences in nucleotide and amino acid identities between the  <dig> sub-lineage groups.
orf <dig>  which participates in many functional processes, including virion assembly, entry of the virus into the host cell, and viral adaptation to the host immune response, has been widely used in molecular evolution and phylogeny studies.
n-glycosylation prediction identified  <dig> potential n-glycosylation sites and  <dig> glycotypes.
furthermore, the variance of n-glycosylation sites and position under selective pressure were demonstrated.
analyses of the gp <dig> sequences, revealed  <dig> sites under positive selective pressure and  <dig> under negative selective pressure.
phylogenetic analysis based on orf <dig> sequence indicated the diversity of prrsv in vietnam.
knowing of molecular evolution of prrsv fields strains might contribute to prrs control in vietnam.
the nucleotide and amino acid identities between strains were  <dig> –100% and 82–100%, respectively.
