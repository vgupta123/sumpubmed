we show that our approach is able to provide new insights into complex biological scenarios such as acetate overflow in escherichia coli.
finally, we apply this approach to find novel pathways relevant in the regulation of acetate overflow metabolism in escherichia coli.
as a result, several targets which could be relevant for better understanding of the phenomenon leading to impaired acetate overflow are proposed.

we present here an in-silico framework to infer relevant metabolic pathways for a particular phenotype under study based on its gene/protein expression data.
this framework is based on the carbon flux path  approach, a mixed-integer linear program that expands classical path finding techniques by considering additional biophysical constraints.
in particular, the objective function of the cfp approach is amended to account for gene/protein expression data and influence obtained paths.
to continue with this progress, it is essential to efficiently integrate experimental data into metabolic modeling.
we show that gene/protein expression data also influences the stoichiometric balancing of cfps, which provides a more accurate picture of active metabolic pathways.
a novel mathematical framework that determines functional pathways based on gene/protein expression data is presented and validated.
