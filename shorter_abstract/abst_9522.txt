fz <dig> expression may play a critical role in responses to wnt signaling in the tumor microenvironment.
canonical wnt pathway throughput was increased slightly in ncm <dig> following treatment with wnt3a cm but was inhibited by wnt <dig> and wnt <dig>  the colon cancer cell line, rko, responded to wnt3a cm, wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> by increasing canonical wnt pathway throughput.
wnt5a did not affect wnt pathway throughput in either cell line.
fresh normal human colon tissue and all the cell lines studied expressed mrna for fz <dig>  lrp <dig> and norrin, except colo <dig> which lacked fz <dig> expression.
wnt <dig>  but not wnt3a, abrogated fz <dig> expression in ncm <dig>  but not in rko or another colon cancer cell line, hct <dig>  this effect on fz <dig> was confirmed at both the rna and protein levels via rt-pcr and a norrin binding assay.
aberrant activation of this signaling pathway can result in colon tumors but the role of norrin-based signaling in the genesis of colon cancer, and its relationship to activation of the pathway by traditional wnt ligands, is not defined.
the data suggests that colonic mucosa and colon tumors may possess two autoregulatory positive wnt feedback loops, one through canonical signals induced by wnt:fz interactions and one through signals resulting from norrin:fz <dig> interactions.
