grouping of the gene families based on their blast identity enabled us to divide ortholog groups into those that are very conserved and those that are more evolutionarily relaxed.
the orthologous genes between the species have a very high %id  and the majority of gene families were shared for all of them.

the ratio of the non-synonumous to synonymous substitutions enabled us to pinpoint protein sequences evolving in response to positive selection.
our results indicate that vrn <dig> is a candidate gene for differentiating vernalization and non-vernalization types in the lolium-festuca complex.
species within the lolium-festuca complex show very diverse phenotypes, and many of them are related to agronomically important traits.
