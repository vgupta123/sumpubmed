feeding mice diets high in fat has been shown to enhance evidence of tlr signaling and this pathway also mediates the hepatic response to invading bacteria.
since consumption of a western-style diet  is a major factor for obesity in the united states, the purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of chronic wd consumption on hepatic inflammation in mice made septic via cecal ligation and puncture .
therefore, we hypothesized that the combined effects of sepsis and feeding wd on trl- <dig> signaling would exacerbate hepatic inflammation.
exposure of c3a cells to pa up-regulated il- <dig> and tlr- <dig> expression.
in addition, pa stimulated the static adhesion of u <dig> monocytes to c3a cells, a phenomenon blocked by inclusion of an anti-tlr-4/md <dig> antibody in the culture medium.
feeding wd increased firm adhesion of leukocytes in the sinusoids and terminal hepatic venules by 8-fold six hours after clp; the increase in platelet adhesion was similar to the response observed with leukocytes.
to demonstrate the direct effect of saturated fatty acid on hepatocytes, c3a human hepatocytes were cultured in medium containing  <dig> Î¼m palmitic acid .
