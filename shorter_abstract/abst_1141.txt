this delay in histone removal is accompanied by a decrease in association of rna pol ii with gal <dig> and altered distribution of the polymerase along the locus.
these observations may explain why initial induction of gal transcripts is reduced in ctr9- or paf1-deficient cells, and is consistent with a model suggesting that the paf <dig> complex and the histone modifications that it mediates increase efficiency of transcriptional elongation by promoting nucleosomal destabilization and histone removal.
the yeast paf <dig> protein complex is required for efficient transcription elongation by rna polymerase ii , but the precise role of the complex has been unclear.
