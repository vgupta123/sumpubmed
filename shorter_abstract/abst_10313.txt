altruism can be favored by high relatedness among interactants.
we found that at high relatedness a single clone prevailed in all twelve populations.
a combination of high spore production and short unicellular stage most successfully explained the three successful clones at low relatedness, but not why one of them fared better at high relatedness.
after one and ten social generations we assessed the strain composition of the populations.
in addition, we expected that low relatedness might allow the persistence of social cheaters as it provides opportunity to exploit other strains.
we mixed eight genetically distinct wild isolates and maintained twelve replicated populations at a high and a low relatedness treatment.
at low relatedness three clones predominated in all twelve populations.
furthermore, the dominant clone at high-relatedness was not cheated by the other two that persisted at low relatedness.
the high degree of repeatability of our results indicates that these effects are strong and points to the importance of new approaches to studying interactions in d. discoideum.
differences in density did not account for the results, as the clones did not differ in vegetative growth rates nor did they change the growth rates over relevant densities.
these results suggest that social competition and something beyond solitary growth differences occurs during the vegetative stage when amoebae eat bacteria and divide by binary fission.
interestingly, exploitation of some clones by others in the social stage did not explain the results.
we tested the effect of relatedness in experimental populations of the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum, where altruism occurs in a starvation-induced social stage when some amoebae die to form a stalk that lifts the fertile spores above the soil facilitating dispersal.
the single cells that aggregate during the social stage can be genetically diverse, which can lead to conflict over spore and stalk allocation.
