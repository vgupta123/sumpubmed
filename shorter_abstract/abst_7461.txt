in lower multicellular fungi, the c2h <dig> zinc finger crea/cre <dig> protein has been shown to act as the transcriptional repressor in this process.
among cre <dig> repressed transcripts, genes encoding unknown proteins and transport proteins were overrepresented.
here, we deciphered the cre <dig> regulatory range in the model cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungus trichoderma reesei  by profiling transcription in a wild-type and a delta-cre <dig> mutant strain on glucose at constant growth rates known to repress and de-repress ccr-affected genes.
one such wide-domain regulatory circuit, essential to all cells, is carbon catabolite repression : it allows the cell to prefer some carbon sources, whose assimilation is of high nutritional value, over less profitable ones.
analysis of genome-wide microarrays reveals  <dig> % of transcripts whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four experimental conditions:  <dig> % of which were repressed by cre <dig>  whereas  <dig> % were actually induced by cre <dig>  and  <dig> % only affected by the growth rate but cre <dig> independent.
however, the complete list of its gene targets is not known.
in addition, we found cre1-repression of nitrogenous substances uptake, components of chromatin remodeling and the transcriptional mediator complex, as well as developmental processes.
