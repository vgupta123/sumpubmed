the pollen tubes that transport sperm to female gametes also contain callose, both in their walls as well as in the plugs that segment growing tubes.
moreover, one of these alleles  resulted in the formation of pollen tubes that lacked callose walls and plugs.
in addition, despite the presence of callose-enriched walls and callose plugs in pollen tubes, the results presented here indicate that callose is not required for pollen tube functions.
here, we describe three additional cals <dig> alleles that similarly alter exine patterns, but instead produce fertile pollen.
callose  separates developing pollen grains, preventing their underlying walls  from fusing.
contrary to a previous report, these results demonstrate that a structured exine layer is not required for pollen development, viability or fertility.
in self-pollinated plants, these tubes led to successful fertilization, but they were at a slight disadvantage when competing with wild type.
