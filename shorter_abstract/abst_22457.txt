the c-terminal domain and cysteine  <dig> of ku <dig> were investigated for their contribution to redox regulation of ku.
we effectively removed the c-terminal domain of ku <dig> generating a truncation mutant and co-expressed this variant with wild type ku <dig> in an insect cell system to create a ku70/80Δc heterodimer.
together, these results suggest that the c-terminal domain and c <dig> of ku <dig> play at most a minor role in the redox regulation of ku, and that other cysteines are likely involved, either alone or in conjunction with these regions of ku <dig>
we also generated two single amino acid variants of cys <dig>  replacing this amino acid with either an alanine  or a serine , and over-expressed the variant proteins in sf <dig> insect cells in complex with wild type ku <dig>  neither the truncation nor the amino acid substitutions alters protein expression or stability as determined by sds-page and western blot analysis.
diamide oxidation of cysteines was shown to inhibit dna binding similarly for both the wild-type and all variant proteins.
ku is a key member of the nhej pathway and plays an important role in the recognition step when it binds to free dna termini.
dna binding of ku is regulated by redox conditions and evidence from our laboratory has demonstrated that ku undergoes structural changes when oxidized that results in a reduction in dna binding activity.
interestingly, differential dna binding activity following re-reduction was observed for the ku70/80Δc truncation mutant.
