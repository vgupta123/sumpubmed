despite its evolutionary and developmental significance, the functional consequence of this unusual genomic organization remains unresolved.
in the soil worm caenorhabditis elegans, this striking rule of co-linearity is broken by the anterior hox gene ceh- <dig>  which is located between the two middle hox paralogs, lin- <dig> and mab- <dig>  within the loosely organized nematode hox cluster.
these data reveal novel roles for ceh- <dig> in developmental processes known to be under the control of middle hox paralogs.
furthermore, ceh- <dig> and the middle hox paralogs share several developmental functions.
in this study we have investigated the role of ceh- <dig> in different developmental processes, and found that its expression and function are not restricted to the anterior body part.
hox genes play a central role in axial patterning during animal development.
our findings presented here show that, unlike other hox genes in c. elegans which display region-specific accumulation and function along the a-p axis, the expression and functional domain of the anterior hox paralog ceh- <dig> extends beyond the anterior region of the worm.
together, these results suggest the emergence of the middle-group hox genes from a ceh-13-like primordial hox ancestor.
