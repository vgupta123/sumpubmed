20â€“ <dig> november  <dig> international workshop on computational systems biology approaches to analysis of genome complexity and regulatory gene networks singapore
the network paradigm in which microscopic level elements  are each other related by functional links so giving rise to both global  and local  behavior is a promising metaphor to try and develop a statistical mechanics inspired approach for biological systems.
this will allow to both obtain a general frame of reference for rationalizing the burden of data coming from high throughput technologies and to derive effective operational views on biological systems.
the interaction of a multiplicity of scales in both time and space is a fundamental feature of biological systems.
the complementation of macroscopic  and microscopic  views with a mesoscopic level of analysis able to connect the different planes of investigation is urgently needed.
