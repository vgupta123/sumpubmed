snps were identified by mapping the reads of the individual assemblies against the combined assembly.
this work describes the first transcriptome assembly in sainfoin.

a combination of increased use of industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, issues with establishment and productivity in the first year and more reliable alternatives, such as red clover led to a decline in the use of sainfoin since the middle of the last century.
a phylogenetic analysis of single copy number genes showed that sainfoin was most closely related to red clover and medicago truncatula, while lotus japonicus, bean and soybean are more distant relatives.
we used the library to identify gene-based simple sequence repeats  and potential single nucleotide polymorphisms .
paired-end  sequences were generated from cdna libraries of rna extracted from 7 day old seedlings.
one genotype from each of five sainfoin accessions was sequenced.
in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in sainfoin due to its potential beneficial nutraceutical and environmental attributes.
