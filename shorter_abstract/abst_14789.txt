bioinformatics studies showed that the tasab system is present on plasmids or chromosomes of a large variety of microorganisms.
post-segregational killing systems are present in a large variety of microorganisms.
this study revealed the presence of this system in great number and in a large variety of microorganisms, either as tasa-tasb homologues or in association with toxins  from other ta systems.
the pgi <dig> plasmid of bacillus thuringiensis h <dig>  harbours a group of two genes, one showing similarities with the doc toxin of the phd-doc toxin-antitoxin system, potentially coding for a toxin-antitoxin system.
however, although several combinations of dna fragment were used in the cloning strategy, only clones containing a mutation in the toxin gene could be recovered, suggesting a toxic activity of tasb.
moreover, the association between tasa antitoxin with toxins other than tasb  revealed the composite and modular nature of bacterial ta systems.
the level of unstable antitoxin protein then rapidly decreases, leaving the toxin free to act on the cellular target, leading to cell death.
in this work, we showed that the pgi <dig> plasmid of b. thuringiensis h <dig>  harbours genes resembling a toxin-antitoxin system, named tasa-tasb for thuringiensis addiction system.
the putative antitoxin tasa was easily cloned in e. coli.
this system appeared to be functional but unregulated in e. coli.
the plasmid to be maintained through the generations harbours a group of two genes, one coding for a stable toxin and the other coding for an unstable antitoxin that inhibits the effects of the toxin.
