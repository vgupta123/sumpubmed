at the cellular level, morphine treatment caused a shift in the distribution of gpr <dig> from cytosol to the cell surface, leading to enhanced mor/gpr <dig> complex formation at the cell periphery and the inhibition of wnt protein secretion.
it is known that chronic morphine treatment decreases dendritic arborization and hippocampal neurogenesis, and wnt proteins are essential for these processes.
however, long-term exposure to opioid agonists may lead to opioid dependence.
opioid agonists appear to alter neuronal morphology in key brain regions implicated in the development of opioid dependence.
our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for gpr <dig> in regulating cellular response to opioid drugs.
we hypothesize that identifying and characterizing novel mor interacting proteins  may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of opioid dependence.
gpr <dig>  the mammalian ortholog of drosophila wntless/evi/sprinter, was identified as a morip in a modified split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen.
however, the precise role of the mor in the development of these neuronal alterations remains elusive.
the analgesic and addictive properties of opioid agonist drugs are mediated primarily via the mu-opioid receptor .
gpr <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays a critical role in mediating wnt protein secretion from wnt producing cells.
we therefore propose that the morphine-mediated mor/gpr <dig> interaction may result in decreased wnt secretion in the cns, resulting in atrophy of dendritic arbors and decreased neurogenesis.
the interaction was also observed in rodent brain, where mor and gpr <dig> were coexpressed in close spatial proximity within striatal neurons.
