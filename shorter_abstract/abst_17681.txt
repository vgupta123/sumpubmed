phe uptake is stimulated by the external k+.
the pattern is quite similar to that in phe uptake in the presence of k+.
our results provide a novel insight into the phe uptake by crop roots.
therefore, it is concluded that a k+ influx/h+ efflux reaction is coupled with the transport of phe into wheat root cells.
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to both human and non-human organisms.

the addition of blockers  for k+ channels does not suppress the process, suggesting that k+ channels are not involved.
dietary intake of pahs is a dominant route of exposure for the general population where food crops are a major source of dietary pahs.
the external medium ph treated with phe and k+ is higher than that with k+, and lower than that with phe, indicating that h+ pump involves in the interaction between phe and k+ uptake.
