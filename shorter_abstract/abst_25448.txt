once installed, workflows facilitate the tedious steps required to run rapid intra- and inter-dataset comparisons.
maamd saves time, minimizes the required computer skills, and offers a standardized procedure for users to analyze microarray datasets and make new intra- and inter-dataset comparisons.
mandatory deposit of raw microarray data files for public access, prior to study publication, provides significant opportunities to conduct new bioinformatics analyses within and across multiple datasets.
the inputs of maamd are user-editable csv files, which contain sample information and parameters describing the locations of input files and required tools.
maamd automates data downloading, data organization, data quality control assesment, differential gene expression analysis, clustering analysis, pathway visualization, gene-set enrichment analysis, and cross-species orthologous-gene comparisons.
