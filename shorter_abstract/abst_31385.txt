the genetic components underlying phenotypic diversity in grapevine must be understood in order to disentangle genetic and environmental factors.
we also discovered  <dig> apparent private genes in the corvina genome which were missing from the reference genome.
the private genes we discovered are likely to be nonessential but could influence certain cultivar-specific characteristics.
we have shown that cdna sequencing by rna-seq is a robust approach for the characterization of varietal diversity between a local grapevine cultivar  and the pn <dig> reference genome.
therefore, the application of de novo transcriptome assembly should not be restricted to species lacking a reference genome because it can also improve existing reference genome annotations and identify novel, cultivar-specific genes.
we detected  <dig>  known genes including  <dig> with novel splice isoforms, and identified  <dig> potentially novel protein-coding genes in non-annotated or unassembled regions of the reference genome.
the de novo assembly approach allowed a substantial amount of the corvina transcriptome to be reconstructed, improving known gene annotations by robustly defining gene structures, annotating splice isoforms and detecting genes without annotations.
