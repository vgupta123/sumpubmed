in vivo, the acute toxicity assay showed that dfe had no obvious acute toxicity to mice.
in the study, thrombolytic effect of dfe from bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> was studied in vitro and in vivo systematically.
and the thrombolytic effects correlated with dfe in a dose-dependent manner.
test of carrageenan-induced thrombosis in mice indicated that the dfe significantly prevented tail thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis model test indicated that douchi fibrinolytic enzyme dfe had thrombolytic effect on carotid thrombosis of rabbits in vivo.
the dfe isolated from bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> has obvious thrombolytic effects in vitro and in vivo.

among them, douchi fibrinolytic enzyme  is a promising agent.
a strain, bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> produced dfe with high fibrinolytic activity has been isolated in our lab previously.
the results showed that dfe played a significant role in thrombolysis and anticoagulation in vitro.
other results in vivo indicated that dfe could increase bleeding and clotting time obviously.
dfe was isolated from douchi, a typical and popular soybean-fermented food in china, and it can dissolve fibrin directly and efficiently.
