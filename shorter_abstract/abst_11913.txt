array comparative genomic hybridization  is commonly used for cnv detection, but the microarray platform has a number of inherent limitations.
our results show that the number of reads, not the length of the reads is the key factor determining the resolution of detection.
we also show the results for assessment of cnv between two individual human genomes.
the method is based on a robust statistical model that describes the complete analysis procedure and allows the computation of essential confidence values for detection of cnv.
dna copy number variation  has been recognized as an important source of genetic variation.
