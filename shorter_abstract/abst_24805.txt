among the identified conserved or core effector sets, we identified a significant number of previously identified aphid candidate effectors indicating these proteins may be involved in general infestation strategies.
aphids are phloem-feeding insects that cause significant economic losses to agriculture worldwide.
the identification and characterization of these effectors from different species that vary in their host range is an important step in understanding the infestation success of aphids and aphid host range variation.
insights into the overlap and differences in aphid effector repertoires are important in understanding how different species successfully infest different ranges of plant species.
using a combination of aphid transcriptome sequencing on libraries derived from head versus body tissues as well as saliva proteomics we were able to predict candidate effectors repertoires from the different aphid species and genotypes.
we assessed our candidate effector repertoires for evidence of positive selection, and identified  <dig> candidates with dn/ds ratios > <dig>  we noted higher rates of dn/ds ratios in predicted aphid effectors than non-effectors.
this study employs a multi-disciplinary approach based on transcriptome sequencing and proteomics to identify and compare effector candidates from the broad host range aphid myzus persicae  , and narrow host range aphids myzus cerasi  and rhopalosiphum padi .
our work provides a comprehensive overview of the candidate effector repertoires from three different aphid species with varying host ranges.
comparative analyses revealed candidate effectors that are most likely are involved in general aspects of infestation, whereas others, that are highly divergent, may be involved in specific processes important for certain aphid species.
whether this reflects positive selection due to co-evolution with host plants, or increased neofunctionalization upon gene duplication remains to be investigated.
