calcium sparks are ryanodine receptor mediated transient calcium signals that have been shown to hyperpolarize the membrane potential by activating large conductance calcium activated potassium  channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.
the goal of the present study was to determine the presence and properties of calcium sparks in the intact gerbil spiral modiolar artery.
calcium sparks were recorded from smooth muscle cells of intact arteries loaded with fluo- <dig> am.
the results suggest that calcium sparks may regulate the diameter of the spiral modiolar artery and cochlear blood flow.
the existence and role of calcium sparks has hitherto been unexplored in the spiral modiolar artery, the end artery that controls blood flow to the cochlea.
this is the first characterization of calcium sparks in smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar artery.
calcium sparks occurred with a frequency of  <dig>  hz, a rise time of  <dig> ms and a time to half-decay of  <dig> ms. ryanodine reduced spark frequency within  <dig> min from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hz.
along with voltage-dependent calcium channels, they form a signaling unit that has a vasodilatory influence on vascular diameter and regulation of myogenic tone.
