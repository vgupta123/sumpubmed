intra-genus variation in the pattern of mt genome fragmentation is common in the blood-sucking lice  and genus-specific minichromosomes are potential synapomorphies.
these two rodent lice share the same pattern for the distribution of all of the protein-coding and rrna genes but differ in trna gene content and gene arrangement in four minichromosomes.
our results indicate that fragmented mt genomes were present in the most recent common ancestor of the two major clades of the blood-sucking lice, which lived ~ <dig> million years ago.
the suborder anoplura contains  <dig> species of blood-sucking lice that parasitize over  <dig> species of eutherian mammals.
to understand mt genome fragmentation in the other major clade of the anoplura, we sequenced the mt genomes of two species of rodent lice in the genus hoplopleura .
akanezumi also has a chimeric minichromosome with parts of two rrna genes and a full-length trna gene for tyrosine.
these lice, eight species in total, are from the same major clade of the anoplura.
like the four genera of blood-sucking lice that have been investigated in previous studies, the hoplopleura species have four minichromosomes that are only found in this genus.
future studies should expand into more species, genera and families of blood-sucking lice to explore further the phylogenetic utility of the novel features associated with fragmented mt genomes.
we identified  <dig> mt genes on  <dig> minichromosomes in the mouse louse, ho.
we identified  <dig> mt genes on  <dig> minichromosomes in the rat louse, ho.
the mt genomes of these lice consist of 9– <dig> minichromosomes; each minichromosome is  <dig> –4 kb in size and has 1– <dig> genes.
