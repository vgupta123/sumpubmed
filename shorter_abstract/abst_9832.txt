in sexually mature male sea lamprey  a bile salt is released in large amounts across gill epithelia into water where it functions as a pheromone.
we show an 8000-fold increase in transcription of cyp7a <dig>  a three-fold increase in transcription of cyp27a <dig>  and a six-fold increase in transcription of cyp8b <dig> in the liver of mature male sea lamprey over immature male adults.
we provide a well characterized example of a complex mechanism of bile salt biosynthesis and excretion that has likely evolved for an additional function of bile salts as a mating pheromone.
in vertebrates, bile salts are primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the intestine where they aid in absorption of dietary fats.
small amounts of bile salts that are not reabsorbed into enterohepatic circulation are excreted with waste.
lcâ€“ms/ms data on tissue-specific distribution and release rates of bile salts from mature males show a high concentration of petromyzonol sulfate  in the liver and gills of mature males.
high expression of sult2b <dig> and sult2a <dig> in gill epithelia of mature males, and tissue-specific expression of bile salt transporters such as bsep, slc10a <dig>  and slc10a <dig>  suggest additional sulfation and transport of bile salts that are dependent upon maturation state.
the pzs to 3kpzs conversion is supported by greater expression of hsd3b <dig> in gill epithelium.
3-keto petromyzonol sulfate  is the primary compound released from gills, suggesting a conversion of pzs to 3kpzs in the gill epithelium.
we postulate that the release of this pheromone is associated with a dramatic increase in its biosynthesis and transport to the gills upon sexual maturation.
this report presents a rare example where specific genes associated with biosynthesis and release of a sexual pheromone are dramatically upregulated upon sexual maturation in a vertebrate.
