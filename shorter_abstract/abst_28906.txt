this redundancy might explain why roxy <dig> knock-out plants did not show a phenotype with respect to the regulation of the tiba-induced detoxification program.
complementation of the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> mutant with either tga <dig> or tga5c186s, in which the single potential target-site of roxy <dig> had been eliminated, did not reveal any evidence for a critical redox modification that might be important for controlling the detoxification program.

ectopic expression of the related grx roxy18/grxs <dig> also led to increased susceptibility to tiba, indicating potential functional redundancy of members of the roxy gene family.
roxy <dig> and related proteins of the roxy gene family can function as negative regulators of tga-dependent promoters controlling detoxification genes.
the repressive function of roxy <dig> depends on the integrity of the active site, which can be either ccmc or cpyc but not ssms.
ectopically expressed roxy <dig> interferes with the activation of tga-dependent detoxification genes.
