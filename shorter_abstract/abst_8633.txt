as the number of available three-dimensional  protein structures increases, a greater variety of studies can be conducted with increasing efficiency, among which is the design of protein structural alphabets.
we used self-organizing maps in combination with a minimum spanning tree algorithm to determine the optimum size of a structural alphabet and applied the k-means algorithm to group protein fragnts into clusters.
our method successfully recovered more egf sub-domains using our structural alphabet than when using other structural alphabets.
we also developed a flexible matrix training system to build a substitution matrix  for our alphabet.
based on fasta and using trisum- <dig> as the substitution matrix, we developed the sa-fast alignment tool.
structural alphabets allow us to characterize local structures of proteins and describe the global folding structure of a protein using a one-dimensional  sequence.
first, we wanted to introduce a modular design pipeline to those who have been working with structural alphabets.
thus, 1d sequences can be used to identify structural similarities among proteins using standard sequence alignment tools such as blast or fasta.
the centroids of these clusters defined the structural alphabet.
further, we evaluated the performance of our structural alphabet in recognizing specific structural domains of egf and egf-like proteins.
