repeat-induced point mutation  is a fungal genome defence mechanism guarding against transposon invasion.
the derip process is a new tool for fungal genomics that facilitates the identification and understanding of the role and origin of fungal repetitive dna.
in this study, we apply derip to the genome of the wheat pathogen stagonospora nodorum sn <dig> and predict the origin of several previously uncharacterised classes of repetitive dna.
rip mutates the sequence of repeated dna and over time renders the affected regions unrecognisable by similarity search tools such as blast.
