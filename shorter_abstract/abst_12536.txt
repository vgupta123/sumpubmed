there is no evidence for a gradient of sdf1a expression, however, and the origin of the directionality of migration is not known.
the formation of the posterior lateral line of teleosts depends on the migration of a primordium that originates near the otic vesicle and moves to the tip of the tail.
even though cxcr <dig> is not expressed in the cells that lead primordium migration, its inactivation results in impaired migration.
the phenotypes of cxcr4b, cxcr <dig> double morphant embryos suggest, however, that cxcr <dig> does not contribute to the migratory capabilities of primordium cells.
