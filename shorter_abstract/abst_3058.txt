furthermore, we found that semi-quantitative data analysis could capture the subtle proteome changes occurring upon microbial stimulation that differentiate resting, from lipopolysaccharides or m. tuberculosis stimulated monocytic samples.
this approach identified the specific presence/absence of m/z peaks and therefore potential biomarkers that can discriminate pan-monocytes from their cd <dig> counterparts.
the involvement of non-classical monocytes, also referred to as proinflammatory monocytes, in the pathophysiology of diseases including diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis or alzheimer’s disease is well recognized.
following resting and in vitro antigenic stimulation, cells were recovered and subjected to whole-cell mass spectrometry analysis.
whole-cell mass spectrometry fingerprinting could efficiently distinguish monocytic sub-populations that arose from a same hematopoietic lineage.
