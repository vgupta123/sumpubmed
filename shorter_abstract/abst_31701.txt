mild exercise did not induce cardiac hypertrophy and was cardioprotective as demonstrated by the decreased infarct size  after ischemia/reperfusion experiments in trained with respect to control rats.
most experimental work has focused into the effects and molecular mechanisms underlying intense, rather than mild exercise, by exploring the acute effect of training.
our study aims at investigating the cardioprotective effect of mild chronic exercise training and the gene expression profile changes at  <dig> hrs after the exercise cessation.
by affymetrix technology, we investigated the gene expression profile induced by exercise training in the left ventricle  of trained  and control  rats.
our data indicated that few, but significant, genes characterize the gene expression profile of the rat lv, when examined  <dig> hrs since the last training section and that mild exercise training determines cardioprotection without the induction of hypertrophy.
moreover, caveolin  <dig> protein levels were higher in exercised than control rats by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.
cardioprotection was investigated by ischemia/reperfusion experiments .
this gene has a high homology with the human c11orf <dig> .
