we used microcalorimetry to show that c. elegans swimming has a greater energy cost than crawling.
quantitative polymerase chain reaction  transcript analyses also suggested an increase in fat metabolism during the swim, followed by the downregulation of specific carbohydrate metabolism transcripts in the hours post-exercise.
consistent with potential antioxidant defense induction, we found that a single swim session sufficed to confer protection against juglone-induced oxidative stress inflicted 4 hours post-exercise.
qpcr data supported specific transcriptional changes in oxidative stress defense genes during and immediately after a swim.

here, we report on the impact of single swim sessions on c. elegans physiology.
overall, our data validate an easily implemented swim experience as c. elegans exercise, setting the foundation for exploiting the experimental advantages of this model to genetically or pharmacologically identify the exercise-associated molecules and signaling pathways that confer system-wide health benefits.
during a 90 min swim, muscle mitochondria matrix environments became more oxidized, as visualized by a localized mitochondrial reduction-oxidation-sensitive green fluorescent protein reporter.
