we created a reliable effector prediction tool, integrated into the database, to demonstrate the application of the database for such endeavours.
there is a need to collate and annotate existing effector sequences in public databases to enable systematic analyses of these sequences for development of models for screening and selection of putative novel effectors from bacterial genomes that can be validated by a smaller number of key experiments.
the t3sedb represents a platform for inclusion of additional annotations of metadata for future developments of sophisticated effector prediction models for screening and selection of putative novel effectors from bacterial genomes/proteomes that can be validated by a small number of key experiments.
owing to this high level of sequence diversity of t3ses, the t3sedb provides a large number of experimentally known effector sequences with wide species representation for creation of effector predictors.
t3sedb is the first specialised database reported for t3ss effectors, enriched with manual annotations that facilitated systematic construction of a reliable prediction model for identification of novel effectors.
procedures have been defined for i) comprehensive annotation of experimental status of effectors, ii) submission and curation review of records by users of the database, and iii) the regular update of t3sedb existing and new records.
however, the effectors display high level of sequence diversity, therefore making the identification a difficult process.
