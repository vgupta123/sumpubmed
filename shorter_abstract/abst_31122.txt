balb/c mice submitted to a 20% dietary restriction during  <dig> days presented a significant decrease in body weight, lymphocyte number and also atrophy in thymus and intestinal epithelium.
in addition, the degree of this inflammatory process did not change with infection or previous immunization.
our results indicated that lung injury during mrsa infection is prevented by previous immunization in well nourished but not in undernourished mice.
histopathological analysis showed that inflammation appeared in the lungs from normal mice only after infection and that immunization prevented this pulmonary inflammatory process.
in this work we evaluated the susceptibility of undernourished balb/c mice and its ability to mount a protective immunity against mrsa with emphasis on the lung involvement.
immunization reduced bacterial growth in the lungs of normal mice but not in the undernourished ones.
determination of bacterial load by the number of colony forming units  indicated a similar susceptibility whereas the findings of gram stain clearly suggested a higher amount of bacteria in the lungs of normal mice than in the undernourished ones.
