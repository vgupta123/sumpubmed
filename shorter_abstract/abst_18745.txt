the epidemiological relationship between c. perfringens isolates from the same source has previously been investigated chiefly by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis .
as revealed by pfge, there was a wide genetic diversity among c. perfringens isolates from different sources.
this is to our knowledge the first study in which the genetic diversity of c. perfringens isolates both from different animals species, from food poisoning outbreaks and from sludge has been investigated.
in this study the genetic diversity of c. perfringens isolated from various animals, from food poisoning outbreaks and from sludge was investigated.
we used pfge to examine the genetic diversity of  <dig> c. perfringens type a isolates from eight different sources.
the results of pfge revealed a wide genetic diversity among the c. perfringens type a isolates.
clostridium perfringens, a serious pathogen, causes enteric diseases in domestic animals and food poisoning in humans.
the wide diversity revealed by pfge was not reflected in the 16s rrna sequences, which had a considerable degree of sequence similarity.
epidemiologically related isolates showed a high genetic similarity, as expected, while isolates with no obvious epidemiological relationship expressed a lesser degree of genetic similarity.
almost all clusters with similar patterns comprised isolates with a known epidemiological correlation.
all isolates originating from food poisoning outbreaks carried the cpe gene and three of these also carried cpb <dig>  two evolutionary different populations were identified by sequence analysis of the partially sequenced cpb <dig> genes from our study and cpb <dig> sequences previously deposited in genbank.
sequence comparison of the partially sequenced cpb <dig> gene revealed two genetically different populations.
the genetic relatedness of the isolates ranged from  <dig> to 100% and  <dig> distinct pfge types were identified.
