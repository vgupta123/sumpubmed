the prevalence of upstream orfs in mhx genes is much higher than in most plant genes, and can limit their expression.
some plants include, besides a full mhx gene, partial mhx-related sequences.
more than one full mhx gene was currently identified only in oryza sativa and mimulus guttatus, but an est for more than one mhx was identified only in m. guttatus.
mhx genes are not present in the currently available chlorophyte genomes.
the absence of mhx genes in non-plant genomes and in the currently available chlorophyte genomes, and the presence of an ncx in chlamydomonas, are consistent with the suggestion that the mhxs evolved from the ncxs after the split of the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages of the plant kingdom.
de novo duplication of mhx occurred in o. sativa before the split between the indica and japonica subspecies, and was apparently followed by translocation of one mhx paralog from chromosome  <dig> to chromosome  <dig> in japonica.
the mhxs underwent functional diploidization in most plant species.
the structural analysis presented and the identification of elements that differ between the mhxs and the ncxs, or between the mhxs of specific plant groups, can contribute to clarification of the structural basis of the function and ion selectivity of mhx transporters.
altered mobility under reducing and non-reducing conditions suggests the presence of an intramolecular disulfide-bond in atmhx.
a structural model of the mhxs, based on the resolved structure of ncx <dig>  implies that the mhxs include nine transmembrane segments.
phylogenetic analysis showed that the mhx family is limited to plants, and constitutes a sixth family within the caca superfamily.
the arabidopsis thaliana mhx gene  encodes a mg2+/h+ exchanger.
the mhxs and ncxs share  <dig> conserved residues, including a gxg motif implicated in the formation of a tight-turn in a reentrant-loop.
three residues differ between all mhx and ncx proteins.
