here we demonstrate that delivery of ub conjugates and docking of ddi <dig>  to the proteasome are strongly impaired by an aspartic acid to alanine point mutation in the highly-conserved d <dig> residue of rpn <dig>  moreover, degradation of the ddi1-dependent proteasome substrate, ufo <dig>  is blocked in rpn1-d517a yeast cells.
to shed light on the recruitment of shuttling receptors to the proteasome, we performed both site-directed mutagenesis and genetic screening to identify mutations in rpn <dig> that disrupt its binding to uba-ubl proteins.
our studies suggest that different uba-ubl proteins are recruited to the proteasome by distinct mechanisms.
