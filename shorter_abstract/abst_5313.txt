during  <dig> growing seasons, we investigated the effect of experimental warming on the diversity and abundance of coastal plant communities in the maritime antarctic region  and the falkland islands .
we compared communities from the falkland islands , with those of signy island  and anchorage island , and experimental temperature manipulations at each of the three islands using open top chambers .
despite the strong difference in plant growth form dominance between the falkland islands and the maritime antarctic, communities across the gradient did not differ in total diversity and species number.
in the grass community at the falkland islands total vegetation cover decreased more in the otcs than in adjacent control plots, and two species disappeared within the otcs after only two years.
total lichen cover showed a non-significant decreasing trend at signy island .
these results suggest that small temperature increases may rapidly lead to decreased soil moisture, resulting in more stressful conditions for plants.
during the summer months, the experimental temperature increase at  <dig> cm height in the vegetation was similar between the locations .
