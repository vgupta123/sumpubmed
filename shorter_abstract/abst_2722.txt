in the columnar epithelia of imaginal discs or follicle cells, mutation of sds <dig> causes contraction of cells along their apical-basal axis, resulting in a more cuboidal morphology.
in addition, the mutant cells can also display altered cell polarity, forming multiple layers in follicle cells and leaving the epithelium in imaginal discs.
how epithelial cells adopt their particular polarised forms is poorly understood.
in a screen for genes regulating epithelial morphology in drosophila, we identified sds <dig>  a conserved gene previously characterised in yeast.
consistent with this, we show that drosophila sds <dig> binds to all four drosophila pp1s and shares an overlapping phenotype with pp1beta9c.
sds <dig> is a conserved pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit that controls cell shape and polarity.
