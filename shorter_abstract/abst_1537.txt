from the associated contingency table, blanket computes right fisher exact test  values used as scores over a plane of possible pairs of shortlist lengths  <cit> .
researchers seek within a universe of descriptors some minimal subset that collectively and efficiently predicts experimental outcomes.
from resulting lists of n descriptors ranked by informativeness, blanket determines shortlists of descriptors from each experiment, generally of different lengths p and q. for any pair of shortlists, four numbers are evident: the number of descriptors appearing in both shortlists, in exactly one shortlist, or in neither shortlist.
combining information from these studies can increase the reliability and generalizability of results and also yield new insights that guide future research.
blanket then chooses a pair or pairs with rfet score less than a threshold; the threshold depends upon n and shortlist length limits and represents a quality of intersection achieved by less than 5% of random lists.
