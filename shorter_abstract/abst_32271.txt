in the present study we analyzed for the first time possible effects of gc on the translational efficiency of expressed genes in two chall model systems employing whole genome polysome profiling.
childhood t-  and precursor b-all  cells were exposed to gcs and subjected to “translational profiling”, a technique combining sucrose-gradient fractionation followed by affymetrix exon microarray analysis of mrna from different fractions, to assess the translational efficiency of the expressed genes.
analysis of gc regulation in ribosome-bound fractions versus transcriptional regulation revealed no significant differences, i.e., gc did not entail a significant shift between ribosomal bound and unbound mrnas.
our results did not reveal significant differences in translational efficiency of expressed genes thereby arguing against a potential widespread regulatory effect of gcs on translation at least in the investigated in vitro systems.
glucocorticoids  are natural stress induced steroid hormones causing cell cycle arrest and cell death in lymphoid tissues.
therefore they are the central component in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, in particular childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
in this study we investigate the effect of gcs on mrna translation on a genome-wide scale.
gc control of mrna translation has also been reported but has never been assessed systematically.
