proteomic profiles were analysed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry.
all together, these results showed a differential expression of genes and proteins related to the muscle energy metabolism and cell survival/anti-apoptotic pathway .
genes belonging to canonical wnt, calcium signalling pathways and cytokine-receptor cytokine interaction were down-regulated.
comparison of the protein profiles revealed  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated proteins spots.
inactivating mutations in the mstn gene are responsible for the development of a hypermuscular phenotype.
genes involved in the pi3k pathway, insulin/igf pathway, carbohydrate metabolism and apoptosis regulation were up-regulated.
in addition, an increased abundance of survival/anti-apoptotic factors were observed.
knockout of the mstn gene was associated with up-regulation of proteins involved in glycolytic shift of the muscles and down-regulation of proteins involved in oxidative energy metabolism.
comparison of the transcriptomic profiles revealed  <dig> up- and  <dig> down- regulated genes.
they revealed the pi3k and apoptotic pathways as mstn targets and are in favour of a role of mstn as a modulator of cell survival in vivo.
