sushi source code as well as a demo server are freely available.
we present sushi, an agile data analysis framework that relieves bioinformaticians from the administrative challenges of their data analysis.
sushi lets users build reproducible data analysis workflows from individual applications and manages the input data, the parameters, meta-information with user-driven semantics, and the job scripts.
by following the sushi recipe, sushi makes data analysis straightforward and takes care of documentation and administration tasks.
it is targeted for, but by no means constrained to, ngs data analysis.
our sushi instance is in productive use and has served as data analysis interface for more than  <dig> data analysis projects.

subsequent bioinformatic analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools, where each application performs a single step towards the final result.
sushi datasets are self-contained and self-documented on the file system.
this situation leaves the bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data files and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.
sushi provides an exquisite recipe for analysing ngs data.
