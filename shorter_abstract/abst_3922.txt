we have developed a method for identifying protein complexes in the pdb x-ray structures by a four step procedure:  comprehensively collecting all protein-protein interfaces;  clustering similar protein-protein interfaces together;  estimating the probability that each cluster is relevant based on a diverse set of properties; and  combining these scores for each pdb entry in order to predict the complex structure.
our method demonstrates an almost two-fold reduction of the annotation error rate as evaluated on a large benchmark set of complexes validated from the literature.
high-resolution x-ray crystallographic structures of protein complexes can reveal the details of their function and provide a basis for many computational and experimental approaches.
these interfaces, as well as the predicted protein complexes, are available from the protein interface server  website .
protein-protein interactions are ubiquitous and essential for all cellular processes.
the resulting clusters of biologically relevant interfaces provide a reliable catalog of evolutionary conserved protein-protein interactions.
we also estimate relative contributions of each interface property to the accurate discrimination of biologically relevant interfaces and discuss possible directions for further improving the prediction method.
differentiation between biological and non-biological contacts and reconstruction of the intact complex is a challenging computational problem.
