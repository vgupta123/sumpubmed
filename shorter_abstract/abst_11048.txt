a crucial event in the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  is the exit from the pluripotent ground state that leads to the acquisition of the ‘primed’ pluripotent phenotype, characteristic of the epiblast-like stem cells .
its suppression hampers the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state and their differentiation into epilcs.
our findings reveal a novel mechanism necessary for the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state.
the hmga <dig> gene is activated by otx <dig> and hmga <dig> protein binds to the enhancers targeted by otx <dig>  thus facilitating the engagement and/or the stable association of otx <dig>  therefore, our results demonstrate that hmga <dig> is a key element of the regulatory network that governs the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state.
in hmga <dig> null induced pluripotent stem cells we observe that otx <dig> fails to regulate its target genes upon the induction of differentiation.
its high expression during embryogenesis suggests that hmga <dig> fulfills important roles in development.
the transcription factors oct <dig> and otx <dig> play a key role in this phenomenon.
hmga <dig> is a member of the high-mobility group family of proteins, non-histone components of chromatin whose expression is high during embryogenesis and becomes low or undetectable in adults.
here, we demonstrate that hmga <dig> accumulates soon after the induction of esc differentiation.
upon the induction of esc differentiation, otx <dig> alone or in combination with oct <dig> engages new enhancers, which are silent in undifferentiated escs.
in particular, otx <dig> pioneers and activates new enhancers, which are silent in escs and which control the transcription of genes responsible for the acquisition of the epilc phenotype.
an important point that remains to be addressed is the mechanism through which otx <dig> engages the new enhancers and stably associates with them.
mechanistically, hmga <dig> controls the differentiation process by cooperating with otx <dig> in the pioneering of new enhancers.
hmga <dig> associates to otx2-bound loci in epilcs, and in hmga <dig> ko cells otx <dig> is unable to engage and activate the new enhancers, thus indicating that hmga <dig> is required for the binding of otx <dig> to its cis-elements.
we find that this mechanism also operates on the hmga <dig> gene, which is one of the targets of otx <dig>  thus indicating the existence of a positive feedback loop.
