expansions and contractions of gene families and in the number of occurrences of functional domains are largely lineage specific, e.g.
while the secretomes of fungi with similar lifestyles share certain characteristics, the expansion and contraction of gene families is largely lineage specific, and not shared among all fungi of a given lifestyle.
secretome size correlates with phylogeny and to a lesser extent with lifestyle.
it is generally assumed that fungi with similar nutritional lifestyles have similar secretome compositions.
in this study, we test this hypothesis by annotating and comparing the soluble secretomes, defined as the sets of proteins containing classical signal peptides but lacking transmembrane domains of fungi representing a broad diversity of nutritional lifestyles.
however, within a given lifestyle a few general trends exist, such as the expansion of secreted family m <dig> metallopeptidases and chitin-binding proteins in plant pathogenic pezizomycotina.
small secreted cysteine-rich proteins , which may comprise many effectors important for the interaction of plant pathogens with their hosts, are defined here to have a mature length of ≤  <dig> aa residues, at least four cysteines, and a total cysteine content of ≥5%.
plant pathogens and saprophytes have larger secretomes than animal pathogens.
relative sscp content is noticeably higher in plant pathogens than in animal pathogens, while saprophytes were in between and closer to plant pathogens.
contraction of glycoside hydrolases in saccharomycotina, and are only weakly correlated with lifestyle.
