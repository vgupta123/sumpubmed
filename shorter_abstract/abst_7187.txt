the methylation status of  <dig> genomic regions as determined by dna capture and sequencing was independently validated by clonal bisulphite sequencing.
use of serum versus plasma, and storage of blood prior to separation resulted in genomic dna contamination, likely due to leukocyte lysis.
this discrete band allows minimal sample loss at the size restriction step in library preparation for next-generation sequencing, allowing for high-quality sequencing from minimal amounts of fcdna.
there are currently no definitive standards for fcdna collection, processing and whole-genome sequencing.
however, because of the low concentration of fcdna in blood, genome-wide analysis carries many technical challenges that must be overcome before fcdna studies can reach their full potential.
we report novel detailed methodology for the capture of high-quality methylated fcdna, library preparation and downstream genome-wide next-generation sequencing.
methylated fcdna fragments were isolated from  <dig> donors using a methyl-binding protein-based protocol and appear as a discrete band of ~ <dig> bases.
we also describe the effects of sample storage, processing and scaling on fcdna recovery and quality.
