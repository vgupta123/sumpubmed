we present pathrings, a new interactive web-based, scalable biological pathway visualization tool for biologists to explore and interpret biological pathways.
in many instances, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data must be interpreted in the context of signaling and metabolic pathways to yield testable hypotheses.
pathrings has been designed to accommodate interactive visual analysis of experimental data in the context of pathways defined by reactome.
pathrings permits an overview of the impact of gene expression data on all pathways to facilitate visual pattern finding.
