however, concurrent infection with t. vivax appeared to cause less effect on pcv, compared to animals infected with t. congolense alone.
a review of cases at the gambian horse and donkey trust  indicated that a common reason for presentation is a poorly defined medical condition often attributed to trypanosomosis.
in total  <dig> animals from the central river division in the gambia  were screened using whole genome amplification  followed by trypanosome species identification using polymerase chain reaction .
infection with t. congolense appeared to have the greatest clinical significance, while t. vivax infection may be of limited clinical significance in this population.
the study raises important questions about the epidemiology of trypanosome infection in relation to disease that require a full scale longitudinal analysis.
the results indicated overall trypanosome prevalence of 91%; with an infection rate of 31% for trypanosoma congolense savannah, 87% for trypanosoma vivax and 18% for trypanosoma brucei sp.
microscopy had a good specificity  and positive predictive value  for trypanosome detection, but the sensitivity  and negative predictive value  were low relative to pcr-based diagnosis.
there are few reports describing the prevalence or the range of clinical signs associated with infection with different species of trypanosomes in horses and donkeys, but given the importance of these animals, the role of trypanosomosis requires investigation.
indeed, there is evidence of t. vivax co-infection ameliorating the pathology caused by t. congolense.
infection with t congolense showed the greatest negative effect on packed cell volume , while infection with t. brucei sp also had a significant, although lesser, negative effect on pcv.
