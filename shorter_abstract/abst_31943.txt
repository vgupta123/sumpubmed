we have further tested a predicted pathway partner, rna helicase a in a reciprocal meta-analysis that identified p <dig> and p <dig> as being coexpressed, and further show a direct interaction of dhx <dig> with p <dig> and p <dig>  attesting to the predictive nature of this technique.
the oncomineâ„¢ database is an online collection of microarrays from various sources, usually cancer-related, and contains many "multi-arrays" .
we have shown our predictions corroborate previously published studies on p <dig> and p <dig>  and that novel predictions can be easily tested.
as there are often many hundreds of tumour samples/microarrays within a single multi-array results from coexpressed genes can be analyzed, and are fully searchable.
however, to increase the likelihood of revealing truly significant coexpressed genes we have analyzed their frequency of occurrence over multiple studies , greatly increasing the significance of results compared to those of a single study.
