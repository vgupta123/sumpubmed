cellular response to external stimuli requires propagation of corresponding signals through molecular signaling pathways.
the simple model implemented in this paper provides a valuable first step in modeling signaling networks.
we study the combined signaling network of three major pro-survival signaling pathways: epidermal growth factor receptor , insulin-like growth factor- <dig> receptor , and insulin receptor .
our study involves static analysis and dynamic modeling of this network, as well as an experimental verification of the model by measuring the response of selected signaling molecules to differential stimulation of egf, igf and insulin receptors.
however, to obtain a fully predictive model, a more detailed knowledge regarding parameters of individual interactions might be necessary.
we introduced two novel measures of the importance of a node in the context of such crosstalk.
this necessitates developing methods to prioritize selection of the molecules such that measuring their activity would be most informative for understanding the crosstalk.
based on these measures several molecules, namely erk1/ <dig>  akt <dig>  jnk, p70s6k, were selected for monitoring in the network simulation and for experimental studies.
