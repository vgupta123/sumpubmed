in contrast to hev viruses, hrv-a and hrv-b share also markedly lower gc content along the whole genome length.
here we report complete genome sequences of  <dig> hrv-a and hrv-b serotypes, more than doubling the current number of available hrv sequences.
the whole-genome maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis suggests that hrv-b and human enteroviruses  diverged from the last common ancestor after their separation from hrv-a.
nevertheless they differ significantly at the phenotypic level.
