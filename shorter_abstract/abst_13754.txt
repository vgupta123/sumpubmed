in this study, we have determined the transcriptome profile of a solid tissue at the level of individual cell types.
due to the solid composition of tissues it is difficult to study the transcriptomes of individual cell types that compose a tissue.
to overcome the problem of heterogeneity we have developed a method to isolate individual cell types from whole tissue that are a source of rna suitable for transcriptome profiling.
using monoclonal antibodies specific for basal , luminal secretory , stromal fibromuscular , and endothelial  cells, respectively, we separated the cell types of the prostate with magnetic cell sorting .
our data will be useful for studying prostate development and cancer progression in the context of single cell populations within the organ.
gene expression of macs-sorted cell populations was assessed with affymetrix genechips.
analysis of the data provided insight into gene expression patterns at the level of individual cell populations in the prostate.
the gene expression profiles of most human tissues have been studied by determining the transcriptome of whole tissue homogenates.
