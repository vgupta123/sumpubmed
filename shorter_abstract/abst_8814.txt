arm is found in at least seven other wolbachia a-supergroup strains infecting various drosophila, the wasp muscidifurax and the tsetse fly glossina.
although it persists at high titers in many species, in others its densities are far below the detection limit of classic end-point polymerase chain reaction .
these low-titer infections can be reliably detected by combining pcr with dna hybridization, but less elaborate strategies based on end-point pcr alone have proven less sensitive or less general.
we introduce a multicopy pcr target that allows fast and reliable detection of a-supergroup wolbachia - even at low infection titers - with standard end-point pcr.
simple end-point pcr of arm facilitates detection of low-titer wolbachia a-supergroup infections.
our arm target seems to be a general feature of wolbachia a-supergroup genomes, unlike other multicopy markers such as insertion sequences .
we demonstrate that end-point pcr targeting arm can reliably detect both high- and low-titer wolbachia infections in drosophila, glossina and interspecific hybrids.
