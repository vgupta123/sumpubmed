therefore, binding to ecm proteins may facilitate colonization, invasion and/or signaling by intestinal pathogens.
in the present study, using mass spectrometry after fibronectin-associated immunoprecipitation, two proteins, flagellin  and groel , were identified and ba <dig> binding ability to fibronectin was inhibited in the presence of anti-h <dig> and anti-groel sera, but not by either naïve rabbit or other unrelated sera.
extracellular matrix  proteins of eukaryotic cells are commonly recognized by bacterial adhesins.
our results suggest that flagellin may play a role in the in vitro interaction of ba <dig> with cellular fibronectin, and groel can be an accessory protein in this process.
previous studies from our group demonstrated that aepec o26:h <dig>  showed high binding activity to fibronectin, not shared by its counterpart, aepec o26:hnm.
it was also observed that the presence of purified flagellin inhibits adhesion of ba <dig> to cellular fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is distinguished mainly by the presence of epec adherence factor plasmid  in typical epec  and its absence in atypical epec .
