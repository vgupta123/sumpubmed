the present study provides a complete analysis of cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar anatomy in a single cohort.
participants with ptsd were found to have reduced cortical thickness, primarily in the frontal and temporal lobes, with no preference for laterality.
posttraumatic stress disorder , an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to psychological trauma, impacts up to 20Â % of soldiers returning from combat-related deployment.
these results were accompanied by decreased volumes of the caudate and right hippocampus, as computed relative to total cerebral volume.
advanced neuroimaging holds diagnostic and prognostic potential for furthering our understanding of its etiology.
enlargement in several cerebellar lobules  was also observed in the ptsd group.
subcortical volumetric analyses of the hippocampi, cerebellum, thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate, putamen, and many sub-regions were conducted following their segmentation using multiple automatically generated templates brain algorithm.
