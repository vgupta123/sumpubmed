moreover, cell treatment with hemin, a natural source of co, resulted in comparable vla- <dig> ligand dissociation.
we show that the binding of the ligand can be rapidly down-modulated in resting cells and after inside-out activation through several gαi-coupled receptors.
carbon monoxide , a byproduct of heme degradation, is attracting growing attention from the scientific community.

we used a cell permeable co releasing molecule  to elevate intracellular co, and a fluorescent very late antigen- <dig> -specific ligand to evaluate the integrin state in real-time on live cells.
because of our discovery that nitric oxide signaling actively down-regulates integrin affinity and cell adhesion, and the similarity between nitric oxide and co-dependent signaling, we studied the effects of co on integrin signaling and cell adhesion.
inhibition of vla- <dig> ligand binding by co had a dramatic effect on cell-cell interaction in a vla-4/vcam-1-dependent cell adhesion system.
we propose that co-regulated integrin deactivation provides a basis for modulation of immune cell adhesion as well as rapid cell mobilization, for example as shown for splenic monocytes in response to surgically induced ischemia of the myocardium.
