we previously identified and characterized the b. burgdorferi bama protein in detail and more recently identified two lipoproteins encoded by open reading frames bb <dig> and bb <dig> that associate with the borrelial bama protein.
a working model has been developed to further analyze outer membrane biogenesis and outer membrane protein transport in this pathogenic spirochete.
the borrelial bamb and bamd proteins both interact specifically and independently with bama to form a tripartite bam complex in b. burgdorferi.
like all diderm bacteria studied to date, borrelia burgdorferi possesses a β-barrel assembly machine  complex.
combined structural studies, functional assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that bb <dig> and bb <dig> are the respective bamb and bamd orthologs in b. burgdorferi, and are important in membrane integrity and/or outer membrane protein localization.
structural modeling of b. burgdorferi bb <dig> revealed a distinct β-propeller fold similar to the known structure for the e. coli bam accessory lipoprotein bamb.
additionally, the structural model for bb <dig> was highly similar to the known structure of bamd, which is consistent with the prior finding that bb <dig> contains tetratricopeptide repeat regions similar to other bamd orthologs.
the role of the bam accessory lipoproteins in b. burgdorferi is currently unknown.
finally, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that bb <dig> and bb <dig> each interact specifically and independently with bama to form the bam complex in b. burgdorferi.
the bacterial bam complexes characterized thus far consist of an essential integral outer membrane protein designated bama and one or more accessory proteins.
the accessory proteins are typically lipid-modified proteins anchored to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane through their lipid moieties.
additionally, bb <dig> mutants also exhibited significantly impaired in vitro growth.
