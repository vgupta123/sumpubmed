pathway enrichment analysis on metabolomics data by 3omics reveals enriched pathways in the kegg/humancyc database.
3omics incorporates the advantages and functionality of existing software into a single platform, thereby simplifying data analysis and enabling the user to perform a one-click integrated analysis.
if only two of three omics datasets are input, then 3omics supplements the missing transcript, protein or metabolite information related to the input data by text-mining the pubmed database.
visualization and analysis results are downloadable for further user customization and analysis.
integrative and comparative analyses of multiple transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics datasets require an intensive knowledge of tools and background concepts.
3omics’ coexpression analysis assists in revealing functions shared among different omics datasets.
although the principal application of 3omics is the integration of multiple omics datasets, it is also capable of analyzing individual omics datasets.
the 3omics one-click web tool was developed to visualize and rapidly integrate multiple human inter- or intra-transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data by combining five commonly used analyses: correlation networking, coexpression, phenotyping, pathway enrichment, and go  enrichment.
3omics’ phenotype analysis integrates online mendelian inheritance in man with available transcript or protein data.
