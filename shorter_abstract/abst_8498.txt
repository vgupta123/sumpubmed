these studies support core and signature genes and proteins as valuable concepts for understanding phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of coherent groups of organisms.
among the core clusters, 33% was predicted to function in metabolism, 25% in information transfer and storage, 10% in cell processes and signaling, and 22% belong to poorly characterized or general function groups.
further analysis found that  <dig> clusters were truly unique  to haloarchaea and qualify as signature proteins while  <dig> were nearly unique , the vast majority of which were coded for on the haloarchaeal chromosomes.
of the signature proteins, only one example with any predicted function, ral, involved in desiccation/radiation tolerance in halobacterium sp.
we assigned likely functions by association with established cog and kog databases in ncbi.
our studies have established conserved groups of nearly  <dig> protein clusters present in all haloarchaea, with a subset of  <dig> which are predicted to be accessory proteins that may be critical or essential for success in an extreme environment.
after identifying homologs in four additional haloarchaeal genomes, we determined that there were  <dig> core haloarchaeal protein clusters , of which  <dig> clusters were found primarily in haloarchaea.
using bioinformatic methods, we have clustered  <dig>  predicted proteins from nine haloarchaeal genomes into  <dig>  haloarchaeal orthologous groups .
