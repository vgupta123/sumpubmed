a model is presented whereby minor abrasions, which are quickly healed in normal corneas, transiently persist in aniridic patients, compromising the corneal stroma.
addition of exogenous epidermal growth factor  to wounded pax6+/- cells restored the calcium wave, increased erk1/ <dig> activation and restored the immediate healing response to wild-type levels.
erk1/ <dig> activation was shown to be required for rapid initiation of wound healing, but had only a minor effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelial sheet.
however, the intensity and speed of propagation of the calcium wave, mediated by release from intracellular stores, was reduced in pax6+/- cells.
initiation and propagation of the calcium wave could be largely decoupled, and both phases of the calcium wave responses were required for wound healing.
it demonstrates that defective calcium signaling in pax6+/- cells underlies this delay, and shows that it can be pharmacologically corrected.
and assayed the immediate molecular responses to wounding in wild-type and mutant corneal epithelial cells.
congenital aniridia caused by heterozygousity at the pax <dig> locus is associated with ocular surface disease including keratopathy.
