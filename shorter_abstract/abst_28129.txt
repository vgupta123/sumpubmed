the key idea of lhr is to estimate the feature weights through local approximation rather than global measurement, which is typically used in existing methods.
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed feature selection method combined with supervised learning in three aspects: 1) high classification accuracy, 2) excellent robustness to noise and 3) good stability using to various classification algorithms.
modeling high-dimensional data involving thousands of variables is particularly important for gene expression profiling experiments, nevertheless,it remains a challenging task.
to demonstrate the performance of our method, extensive experiments involving classification tests have been carried out on both synthetic and real microarray benchmark datasets by combining the proposed technique with standard classifiers, including the support vector machine , k-nearest neighbor , hyperplane k-nearest neighbor , linear discriminant analysis  and naive bayes .
relief is a popular and widely used approach for feature selection owing to its low computational cost and high accuracy.
