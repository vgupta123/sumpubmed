we previously found that transcranial direct current stimulation  improves learning and performance in a task where subjects learn to detect potential threats indicated by small target objects hidden in a complex virtual environment.
these results indicate that tdcs enhancement of performance in this task may be related in part to the enhancement of alerting attention, which may benefit the initial identification, learning and/or subsequent recognition of target objects indicating potential threats.
alerting, but not orienting or executive attention, was significantly higher for participants receiving  <dig>  ma compared with  <dig>  ma tdcs .
