determination of taxon specific attachments or losses might be linked to specific cellular or morphological features.
this biological signal deviated significantly from random models.
focussing on human protein complexes, we based our analysis on a manually curated dataset from hprd.
consecutive additions and losses of distinct units is a fundamental process in the evolution of protein complexes.
these evolutionary events affecting genes coding for units in human protein complexes showed a significantly different phylogenetic pattern compared to randomly selected genes.
thus, protein complexes contain not only structural and functional, but also evolutionary cores.
here, we analysed in a large scale approach whether this flexibility in evolution is only limited to a distinct number of complexes or represents a more general trend.
we computed interologs in  <dig> different species and predicted the composition of complexes.
proteins play a key role in cellular life.
still, loss of whole complexes happened rarely.
experimental and computational evidence indicate that consecutive addition and secondary losses of components played a major role in the evolution of some complexes, mostly without affecting the core function.
