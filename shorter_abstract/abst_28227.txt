identifying cellular subsystems that are involved in the expression of a target phenotype has been a very active research area for the past several years.
this algorithm has been applied to the protein functional association network of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  a hydrogen producing, acid-tolerant organism.
most studies identify genes associated with a phenotype on the basis of some statistical bias, others have extended these statistical methods to analyze functional modules and biological pathways for phenotype-relatedness.
in this paper we introduce a fast and theoretically guranteed method called dense  that can take in as input a biologist's prior knowledge as a set of query proteins and identify all the dense functional modules in a biological network that contain some part of the query vertices.
