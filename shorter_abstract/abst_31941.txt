comparison of tools reveals that ycasd is a good compromise between easy and quick capturing of scientific data from publications and complexity.
after describing the general functionality and providing an overview of the programme interface, we demonstrate on an example how to use ycasd.
it is common practice that clinical data are not available in raw formats but are provided as graphical representations.
hence, in order to include these data into environments used for model simulations and statistical analyses, it is necessary to extract them from their presentations in the literature.
after establishing a coordinate system by simple axes definitions, it supports convenient retrieval of data points from arbitrary figures.
for subsequent processing of extracted data points, results can be formatted as a matlab or an r matrix.
a major advantage of ycasd is that it does not require a certain input file format to open and process figures.
the software can also be useful for other kinds of analyses for which published data are required but are not available in raw formats such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
we conclude that our tool is suitable for convenient and accurate data retrievals from graphical representations such as papers.
we extensively compare the functionality and other features of ycasd with other publically available tools.
