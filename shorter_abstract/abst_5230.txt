after mixing crude extracts, sera and protein a/g beads together and incubating, during which the ruc-antigen fusion become immobilized on the a/g beads, antigen-specific antibody is quantitated by washing the beads and adding coelenterazine substrate and measuring light production.
the results of competition experiments, preincubating positive sera with unmodified e. coli-produced antigens, varied dramatically.
this method is based on fusing protein antigens to an enzyme reporter, renilla luciferase , and expressing these fusions in mammalian cells, where mammalian-specific post-translational modifications can be added.
we have characterized this technology with sera from patients having three different types of cancers.
assays detecting human antigen-specific antibodies are medically useful.
we developed a novel and simple immunoprecipitation technology for identifying clinical sera containing antigen-specific antibodies and for generating quantitative antibody response profiles.
this technology has several advantages over current quantitative immunoassays including its relative simplicity, its avoidance of problems associated with e. coli-produced antigens and its use of antigens that can carry mammalian or disease-specific post-translational modifications.
this assay should be generally useful for analyzing sera for antibodies recognizing any protein or its post-translational modifications.
five of six colon cancer sera tested gave responses that were statistically significantly greater than the average plus three standard deviations of  <dig> control sera.
