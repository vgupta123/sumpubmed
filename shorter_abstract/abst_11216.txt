our data define the catalytic center of ire <dig> rnase and suggest a mechanism of rna cleavage: each rnase monomer apparently contains a separate catalytic apparatus for rna cleavage, whereas two rnase subunits contribute to rna stem-loop docking.
here, we experimentally define the active site of ire <dig> rnase and quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the key active site residues to catalysis.
conservation of the key residues among ire <dig> homologues suggests that the mechanism elucidated here for yeast ire <dig> applies to ire <dig> in metazoan cells, and to the only known ire <dig> homologue rnase l.
this analysis and two new crystal structures suggest that ire <dig> rnase uses histidine h <dig> and tyrosine y <dig> as the general acid-general base pair contributing â‰¥  <dig>  kcal/mol and  <dig>  kcal/mol to transition state stabilization, respectively, and asparagine n <dig> and arginine r <dig> for coordination of the scissile phosphate.
the unfolded protein response  controls the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum .
investigation of the stem-loop recognition revealed that additionally to the stem-loops derived from the classic ire <dig> substrates hac <dig> and xbp <dig> mrna, ire <dig> can site-specifically and rapidly cleave anticodon stem-loop  of unmodified trnaphe, extending known substrate specificity of ire <dig> rnase.
