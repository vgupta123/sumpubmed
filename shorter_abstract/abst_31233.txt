it appears that lipophilicity plays a crucial role, but lipophilicity does not per se cause an adjuvant effect.
the scope of this study was to investigate which molecular characteristics that determine the observed adjuvant effect of the most widely used phthalate plasticizer, the di- phthalate , which is documented as having a strong adjuvant effect.
some chemicals, including some phthalate plasticizers, have been shown to have an adjuvant effect in mice.
however, an adjuvant effect, defined as an inherent ability to stimulate the humoral immune response, was only observed after exposure to a limited number of the phthalates.
an adjuvant effect may be due to the structure or physicochemical characteristics of the molecule.
adjuvant effect of phthalates and related compounds were restricted to the igg <dig> antibody formation.
in addition to lipophilicity, a phthalate must also possess specific stereochemical characteristics in order for it to have adjuvant effect.
the adjuvant effect of phthalates are highly influenced by both stereochemical and physico-chemical properties.
this knowledge may be used in the rational development of plasticizers without adjuvant effect as well as in the design of new immunological adjuvants.
