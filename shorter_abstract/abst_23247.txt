sequence analysis predicted a few full-length genes including two rps1-k genes, rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig>  previously reported rps1-k- <dig> from this genomic region  <cit>  was evolved through intramolecular recombination between rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> in escherichia coli.
more than one functional rps1-k gene was identified from the rps1-k locus.
the clustering feature at the rps1-k locus might have facilitated the expansion of rps1-k gene numbers and the generation of new recognition specificities.
sixteen simple repeat and  <dig> tandem repeat sequences were identified from the locus.
here the analyses of sequences of three overlapping bac clones containing the  <dig>  bp rps1-k region are reported.
the rps1-k region was sequenced to understand the possible evolutionary steps that shaped the generation of phytophthora resistance genes in soybean.
the rps1-k region is primarily composed of repetitive sequences.
the abundance of repetitive sequences in the rps1-k region suggested that the location of this locus is in or near a heterochromatic region.
five rps genes were mapped to the rps <dig> locus located near the  <dig> cm map position on molecular linkage group n of the composite genetic soybean map.
a series of rps  genes have been protecting soybean from the root and stem rot disease caused by the oomycete pathogen, phytophthora sojae.
poor recombination frequencies combined with presence of two functional rps genes at this locus has been providing stable phytophthora resistance in soybean.
a member of a highly abundant retroelement, sire <dig>  was identified from the rps1-k region.
