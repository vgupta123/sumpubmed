we observed that two shrinkage methods worked well: ridge shrinkage for estimating the quasi-linear score, and lasso shrinkage for selecting markers within each cluster.
we extended the linear score to the quasi-linear score by a generalized average form, the kolmogorov-nagumo average.
simulation studies and applications to real data show that the proposed method has good predictive performance compared with existing methods.
linear scores are widely used to predict dichotomous outcomes in biomedical studies because of their learnability and understandability.
accordingly, we developed a quasi-linear score, which effectively combines the linear scores of clustered markers.
quasi-linear scores combine such heterogeneity and have a better predictive ability compared with linear scores.

such approaches, however, cannot be used to elucidate biodiversity when there is heterogeneous structure in target population.
heterogeneous structure is captured by a clustering method.
