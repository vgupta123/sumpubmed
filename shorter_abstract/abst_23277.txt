although classical lipases and atgl have no obvious sequence similarity and differ with regard to fold and catalytic mechanism, homology links detected with familysearcher show that they are evolutionarily related.
moreover, this ancestral module also appears in numerous enzymes with various substrate specificities, but that critically rely on nucleophilic attack mechanisms.
we describe an unsupervised, sensitive sequence segment collection heuristic suitable for assembling very large protein families.
the familysearcher is an efficient tool for tracing distant evolutionary relationships involving large protein families.
the unclear evolutionary relationship between classical mammalian lipases and the recently discovered human adipose triglyceride lipase  is an exemplary case for such a problem.
manually finding subtle yet statistically significant links to distantly related homologues becomes practically impossible for very populated protein families due to the sheer number of similarity searches to be invoked and analyzed.
to prevent inclusion of unrelated hits, additional criteria are introduced: minimal alignment length and overlap with starting sequence segments, finding starting sequences in reciprocal searches, automated filtering for compositional bias and repetitive patterns.
the conserved sequence parts can be narrowed down to an ancestral core module consisting of three β-strands, one α-helix and a turn containing the typical nucleophilic serine.
