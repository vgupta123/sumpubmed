this recombinant protein readily hydrolyzed the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate  in a dose-dependent manner.
the results of the study suggest that mg <dig> is an important signaling protein of m. genitalium and its presence may be crucial for the virulence of this species.
additional studies using synthetic peptides as substrates revealed that the recombinant protein was able to hydrolyze the threonine phosphate.
further, a transposon insertion mutant strain of m. genitalium  that lacks the protein mg <dig> showed differentially phosphorylated proteins when compared to the wild type g <dig> strain.
this strain was also less efficient in inducing the differentiation of thp- <dig> cell line as compared to wild type m. genitalium.
mycoplasma genitalium, a mollicute that causes the urogenital diseases urethritis and cervicitis in men and women, respectively, is a pathogen which lacks tcs but possesses stk/stp.
mass spectrometry revealed that some of the key proteins differentially phosphorylated in tim <dig> strain were putative cytoskeletal protein encoded by the gene mg_ <dig> and pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> Î± chain encoded by the gene mg_ <dig>  in addition, tim <dig> was noticed to be less cytotoxic to hela cells and this correlated with the production of less hydrogen peroxide by this strain.
bacterial signal transduction systems like two component system  and serine/threonine kinase  and serine/threonine phosphatase  play important roles in the virulence and pathogenesis of bacterial pathogens.
