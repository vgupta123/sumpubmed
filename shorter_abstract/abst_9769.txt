the class of models includes virtually any model with a linear predictor in it, for example , multiclass logistic regression , generalised linear models  and survival models.
it is a powerful approach to finding parsimonious models for such datasets.
with the advent of high throughput biotechnology data acquisition platforms such as micro arrays, snp chips and mass spectrometers, data sets with many more variables than observations are now routinely being collected.
the method compares favourably to existing methods such as support vector machines and random forests, but has the advantage of not requiring separate variable selection steps.
the method usually produces very sparse models which make biological interpretation simpler and more focused.
whilst methods for a number of response types have been developed a general approach has been lacking.
