we examined the number of nuclei per spore of four amf taxa using high z-resolution live confocal microscopy and found that the number of nuclei was correlated with spore diameter.
more importantly, we observed surprising heterogeneity in the number of nuclei among sister spores and show that massive nuclear migration and mitosis are the mechanisms by which amf spores are formed.
heredity in microorganisms, however, can be very complex, and even unknown as is the case for coenocytic organisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi .
we followed spore development of glomus irregulare from hyphal swelling to spore maturity and found that the spores reached mature size within  <dig> to  <dig> days, and that the number of nuclei per spores increased over time.
therefore, these spores do not represent a stage in the life cycle with a single nucleus, raising the possibility that amf, unlike all other known eukaryotic organisms, lack the genetic bottleneck of a single-nucleus stage.
a conventional tenet of classical genetics is that progeny inherit half their genome from each parent in sexual reproduction instead of the complete genome transferred to each daughter during asexual reproduction.
