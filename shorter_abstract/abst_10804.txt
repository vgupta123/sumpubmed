findings of this study showed that, khat and its major metabolite, cathinone, can positively affect immune system in dose dependent manner.
in support of this, as doses of the two test substances increased, the count of t helper cells  was significantly increased , while higher dose significantly reduced whole white blood cell , cd8+, and cd3+ counts.
cathinone also share all immune modulating property of its parent compound, khat, but with intense strength.
immunological studies included humeral immunity , cellular immune response , phagocytic activities of reticuloendothelial system, and determination of t-lymphocyte population: cd3+, cd4+, cd8+ count and cd4+/cd8+ status.

when doses of crude khat extract and cathinone increase, the induction of humeral  and cellular immune responses were up-regulated significantly , while at higher dose of khat  cellular immune response was suppressed.
physical, hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters were measured.
at relatively lower dose , crude khat extract has immune stimulating property, although higher dose  leads to suppression of cellular immune response.
