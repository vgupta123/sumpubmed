in a simulation study, glossi showed sufficient power to detect loci-sets with less than 10% of snps having moderate-to-large effect sizes and intermediate minor allele frequency values.
although the enhanced resolution of these platforms increases the chance of interrogating functional snps that are themselves causative or in linkage disequilibrium with causal snps, commonly used single snp-association approaches suffer from serious multiple hypothesis testing problems and provide limited insights into combinations of loci that may contribute to complex diseases.
in contrast to methods based on the kolmogorov-smirnov statistic, the approach is parametric and only utilizes information from within the interrogated loci-set.
the most significant loci-sets can be used to formulate hypotheses from a functional viewpoint that can be validated experimentally.
