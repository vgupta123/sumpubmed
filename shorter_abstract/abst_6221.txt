a. thaliana dna was probed for short, exact matches  to each soybean sequence, and then checked for the number of additional  <dig> bp matches in the adjacent  <dig> bp region.
in addition, all java programs used to create this map are available upon request and on the web.
herein, we report the use of the model organism arabidopsis thaliana  for which the entire genomic sequence is available as a framework to align thousands of short soybean sequences.
the position of these matches was used to order soybean sequences in relation to the a. thaliana genome.
reported associations between soybean sequences and a. thaliana were within a 95% confidence interval of e- <dig> â€“ e- <dig>  in addition, the clustering of soybean expressed sequence tags  based on a. thaliana sequence was accurate enough to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphisms  within the soybean sequence clusters.
nonetheless, a large body of sequence information exists, particularly in the form of expressed sequence tags .
a series of java-based programs were created that processed and compared  <dig>  soybean dna sequences against a. thaliana chromosomal dna.
an est, bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequence and marker amplicon sequence synteny map of soybean and a. thaliana is presented.
