b. bacati also possessed novel features, such as a compact c-shaped rod apparatus encircling the nucleus, a cytostomal funnel and a distinctive cell surface organization reminiscent of the pellicle strips in phagotrophic euglenids.
we characterized the ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of b. bacati n. gen. et sp.
these parallel symbioses increase the comparative context for understanding the origin of extrusive organelles in eukaryotes and underscores how little we know about the symbiotic communities of marine benthic environments.
moreover, phylogenetic analyses of ssu rdna sequences demonstrated that b. bacati groups strongly with the symbiontida: a newly established subclade within the euglenozoa that includes calkinsia aureus and other unidentified organisms living in low-oxygen sediments.
this is concordant with ultrastructural features of b. bacati that are intermediate between c. aureus and phagotrophic euglenids, indicating that the most recent ancestor of the symbiontida descended from phagotrophic euglenids.
ultrastructural data showed that b. bacati possesses all of the euglenozoan synapomorphies.
additionally, the extrusive episymbionts in b. bacati are strikingly similar to so-called "epixenosomes", prokaryotes previously described in a ciliate species and identified as members of the verrucomicrobia.
we discovered and characterized a novel  lineage of heterotrophic euglenozoan within these environments using light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, serial sectioning and ultrastructural reconstruction, and molecular phylogenetic analyses of small subunit rdna sequences.
molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that this species belongs to the euglenozoa and currently branches as the earliest diverging member of the symbiontida.
poorly understood but highly diverse microbial communities exist within anoxic and oxygen-depleted marine sediments.
