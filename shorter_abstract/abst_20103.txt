in this paper we present evidence for a dual location of the sec translocon in the thylakoid as well as inner envelope membranes of the cyanelles from cyanophora paradoxa, i. e. conservative sorting sensu stricto.
the prerequisite was the generation of specific antisera directed against cyanelle secy that allowed immunodetection of the protein on sds gels from both membrane types separated by sucrose density gradient floatation centrifugation.
the sec translocase, an example for "conservative sorting" in the course of evolution, is found in the plasma membrane of all prokaryotes, in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and in both these membrane types of cyanobacteria.
immunoblotting of blue-native gels yielded positive but differential results for both the thylakoid and envelope sec complexes, respectively.
candidate passengers are cytochrome c <dig> and enzymes of peptidoglycan metabolism.
