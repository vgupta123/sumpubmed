the output of the bsr analysis enables global visualization of the degree of proteome similarity between all three genomes.
furthermore, we extend this synteny analysis by overlaying bsr data as a color dimension, enabling visualization of the degree of similarity of the peptides being compared.
the blast score ratio  approach, implemented in a perl script, classifies all putative peptides within three genomes using a measure of similarity based on the ratio of blast scores.
however few tools are available for this scale of comparative analysis.
