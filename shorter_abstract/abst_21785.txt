the problem is especially prominent in the identification of transcription factor  specific binding sites.
more in particular, homologous tfs are abundant and, as they are structurally very similar, it proves difficult to distinguish the related operators by automated means.
moreover, specific inducers could in most cases be linked to the tfs through phylogeny, thereby unveiling the biological role of these regulons.
to overcome the specificity problem, a comprehensive footprinting approach was formulated to identify tf-specific operator motifs and was applied to the laci-family of tfs in the model gram positive organism, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs <dig>  the main premise behind the approach is that only orthologous sequences that share orthologous genomic context will share equivalent regulatory sites.
with the tf-specific operator motifs, potential binding sites were found on the genome and putative minimal regulons could be defined.
our approach to identify specific operator motifs for different tf-family members is specific and in essence generic.
the data infer that, although the specific operator motifs can be used to identify minimal regulons, experimental knowledge on tf activity especially is essential to determine complete regulons as well as to estimate the overlap between tf affinities.
this also holds for the laci-family, a family of tfs that is well-studied and has many members that fulfill crucial roles in the control of carbohydrate catabolism in bacteria including catabolite repression.
when the approach was applied to the  <dig> laci-family tfs of the model species, a specific operator motif was identified for each of them.
