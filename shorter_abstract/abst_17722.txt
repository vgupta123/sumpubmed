in simians, multiple transposons were inserted and transformed into exons of the anril gene, after which anril became highly conserved.
anril shows a two-stage, clade-specific evolutionary process and is fully developed only in simians.
many long non-coding rna  genes identified in mammals have multiple exons and functional domains, allowing them to bind to polycomb proteins, dna methyltransferases, and specific dna sequences to regulate genome methylation.
a further survey reveals that multiple transposons exist in many lncrnas.
the domestication of multiple transposons indicates an impressive pattern of “evolutionary tinkering” and is likely to be important for anril’s structure and function.
anril/cdkn2b-as originated in placental mammals, obtained additional exons during mammalian evolution but gradually lost them during rodent evolution, and reached  <dig> exons only in simians.
anril/cdkn2b-as consists of  <dig> exons on human chromosome 9p <dig> and regulates the expression of three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors .
