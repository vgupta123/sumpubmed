six developing xylem cdna libraries were constructed from earlywood and latewood tissues sampled at juvenile , transition  and mature  ages, respectively.
assembly of  <dig>  ests from 5' end sequences generated  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
juvenile earlywood has a distinct transcriptome, which is likely to contribute to the undesirable properties of juvenile wood in radiata pine.
these xylem tissues represent six typical development stages in a rotation period of radiata pine.
about  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ests matched cell wall related genes in the maizewall database, representing all  <dig> categories,  <dig> of all  <dig> families and possibly  <dig> genes.
fifteen cell wall-related genes are ranked in the  <dig> most abundant genes, including cesa, tubulin, agp, sams, actin, laccase, ccoamt, mete, phytocyanin, pectate lyase, cellulase, susy, expansin, chitinase and udp-glucose dehydrogenase.
cell wall-related genes and transcription factors were identified.
comparative analysis of go term abundance revealed a distinct transcriptome in juvenile earlywood formation compared to other stages of wood development.
more than half  of the  <dig>  ests have matches in the pfam database and represent  <dig> known protein families.
the publicly available resource of radiata pine will also be valuable for gene function studies and comparative genomics in forest trees.
about  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ests and  <dig> % of the unigenes have matches in the uniprot and tigr databases.
our primary objective was to sequence a large number of expressed sequence tags  from genes involved in wood formation in radiata pine.
based on the planttfdb database  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factor families in the poplar genome were identified as being involved in radiata pine wood formation.
the first large scale genomic resource in radiata pine was generated from six developing xylem cdna libraries.
pinus radiata d. don is the most important commercial plantation tree species in australia and several other countries; however, genomic resources for this species are very limited in public databases.
