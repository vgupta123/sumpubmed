copy number variation  in the human genome is recognised as a widespread and important source of human genetic variation.
quadmaph is an accurate, high-resolution method that allows targeted screening of large numbers of subjects without the expense of genome-wide approaches.
we show that the quadmaph probes report copy number with equivalent accuracy to simplex maph, reliably demonstrating diploid copy number in control samples and accurately detecting deletions in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer  samples.
we have used this method to analyse a genomic region of  <dig> kb, including the msh <dig> gene and  <dig> kb of flanking dna.
now the challenge is to screen for these cnvs at high resolution in a reliable, accurate and cost-effective way.
