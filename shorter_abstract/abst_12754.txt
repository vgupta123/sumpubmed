the decrease in response at higher stimulation rates was significantly greater for mua than lfp and meg data, while no significant difference was observed between lfp and meg recordings.
furthermore, response latency was the shortest for mua and the longest for meg data.
signal intensity was inversely related to the rate of stimulation, but to different degrees for each measurement method.
we examined changes in neuromagnetic fields, local field potentials  and multi-unit activity  in macaque monkey primary somatosensory cortex that were induced by varying the rate of mechanical stimulation.
further, the intensity and latency of the meg signal were better correlated with the lfp than mua data suggesting that the meg signal reflects primarily synaptic currents rather than spiking activity.
to examine the reliability of the meg signal, we compared magnetic and electrophysiological responses to complex natural stimuli from the same animals.
the meg signal is an accurate representation of electrophysiological responses to complex natural stimuli.
