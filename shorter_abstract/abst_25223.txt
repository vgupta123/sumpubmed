gene ontology of the transcriptome differentially regulated by rgl <dig>  as well as extensive cross-comparison with other available microarray data indicates that rgl2-mediated inhibition of germination causes seeds to enter a state of dormancy.
seed germination is of immense significance for agriculture and has been studied for centuries.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation , we show that rgl <dig> directly downregulates at least one cell wall modifying enzyme, which is predicted to constrain cell growth thereby leading to inhibition of seed germination.
collectively, our data indicate that gibberellins, acting via rgl <dig>  control several aspects of seed germination.
yet, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of dormancy and germination is still in its infancy.
germination is completely inhibited if functional rgl <dig> is overexpressed and/or stabilized; however, the molecular mechanisms of rgl <dig> function are still largely unknown.
through the repression of cell wall modifying enzymes, cell growth is directly constrained to inhibit germination.
our results reveal that rgl <dig> controls various aspects of germination.
a promoter analysis of differentially expressed genes identified an enrichment of several motifs that can be bound by specific transcription factors, for example gamyb, arf <dig>  or dof-type zinc fingers.
furthermore, rgl <dig> likely interacts with various types of proteins to regulate transcription, and differentially regulates several transcription factors.
rgl <dig> also appears to differentially regulate a number of transcription factors, many of which are known to be involved in light- or phytohormone-mediated aspects of germination.
