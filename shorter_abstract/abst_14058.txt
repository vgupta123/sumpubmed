the results indicate the potential of liposomes in attenuating excessive inflammation as a future adjunctive treatment of pneumococcal diseases.
cholesterol and sphingomyelin-containing liposomes designed to sequester pneumolysin were highly effective at reducing cxcl <dig> levels from epithelial cells exposed to different clinical pneumococcal isolates.
these liposomes also reduced cxcl <dig> response from epithelial cells exposed to pneumolysin knock-out mutants of s. pneumoniae indicating that they also reduce the cxcl8-inducing effect of an unidentified pneumococcal virulence factor, in addition to pneumolysin.
streptococcus pneumoniae causes several human diseases, including pneumonia and meningitis, in which pathology is associated with an excessive inflammatory response.
here, we measured the amount of inflammatory cytokine cxcl <dig> -8) by elisa released by human nasopharyngeal epithelial  cells as inflammatory response to a 24Â h exposure to different pneumococcal strains.
