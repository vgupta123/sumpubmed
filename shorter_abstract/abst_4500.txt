a comparative in silico analysis of the mir- <dig> target sites of myb 3'utrs from different species led to the identification of a single set of putative target sites in amphibians and zebrafish, whereas two sets of putative target sites were identified in chicken and mammals.
reporter assays showed that gga-mir- <dig> acted on the avian myb 3'utr and identified the avian myb target site involved in gga-mir- <dig> binding.
we identified the avian mature mirna-150-5p, gallus gallus gga-mir- <dig> from chicken leukocyte small-rna libraries and showed that, as expected, the gga-mir- <dig> sequence was highly conserved, including the seed region sequence present in the other mir- <dig> sequences listed in mirbase.
micrornas are small, highly conserved non-coding rnas that inhibit translation and decrease mrna stability by binding to regulatory motifs mostly located in the 3'utr of target mrnas conserved throughout evolution.
the expression of c-myb is tightly regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms involving micrornas.
this specific mir- <dig> site usage was not cell-type specific and persisted when the chicken c-myb 3'utr was used in the cell system to identify mammalian target sites, showing that this mir- <dig> target site usage was intrinsic to the chicken c-myb 3'utr.
its deregulation has been implicated in human leukaemogenesis and other cancers.
however, only the target site present in the chicken myb 3'utr that was identical to that in zebrafish was functional, despite the additional presence of mammalian target sites in chicken.
the c-myb proto-oncogene is the founding member of a family of transcription factors involved principally in haematopoiesis, in diverse organisms, from zebrafish to mammals.
our study of the avian myb/gga-mir- <dig> interaction shows a conservation of mir- <dig> target site functionality between chicken and zebrafish that does not extend to mammals.
