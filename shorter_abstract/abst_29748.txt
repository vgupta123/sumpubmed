moreover, the solutions provided, heavily depend on the programming skills of the user, whereas in the case of gui embedded solutions, they do not provide direct support of various raw image analysis formats or a versatile and simultaneously flexible combination of signal processing methods.
gene armada requires matlab  <dig>   or higher and is also distributed as a stand-alone application with matlab component runtime.
besides being fully automated, gene armada incorporates numerous functionalities of the statistics and bioinformatics toolboxes of matlab.
it also supports the analysis of already processed results through its versatile import editor.
the microarray data analysis realm is ever growing through the development of various tools, open source and commercial.
this suite integrates all steps of microarray data analysis including automated data import, noise correction and filtering, normalization, statistical selection of differentially expressed genes, clustering, classification and annotation.
gene armada provides a highly adaptable, integrative, yet flexible tool which can be used for automated quality control, analysis, annotation and visualization of microarray data, constituting a starting point for further data interpretation and integration with numerous other tools.
in its current version, gene armada fully supports  <dig> coloured cdna and affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, plus custom arrays for which experimental details are given in tabular form .
we describe here gene armada , a matlab implemented platform with a graphical user interface.
however there is absence of predefined rational algorithmic analysis workflows or batch standardized processing to incorporate all steps, from raw data import up to the derivation of significantly differentially expressed gene lists.
