iggalaxy has two analysis options one using the built in igblast algorithm and the second using output from imgt; in either case repertoire summaries for the b-cell populations tested are available.
re-analysis of ngs data from our samples of rag-deficient patients demonstrated the validity and user friendliness of this tool.
in this study we describe immunoglobulin galaxy - a convenient web based application for analyzing next-generation sequencing results and reporting igh gene rearrangements for both repertoire and clonality studies.
we demonstrate the technical validity of this platform using a standard dataset, s <dig>  used for benchmarking the performance of antibody alignment utilities with a  <dig>  % concordance with previous results.
iggalaxy was developed for  <dig> ngs results but is capable of analyzing alternative ngs data .
