multipartite mitochondrial genomes are very rare in animals but have been found previously in two insect orders with highly rearranged genomes, the phthiraptera , and the psocoptera .
thysanoptera, along with the other minor paraenopteran insect orders should be considered models for rapid mitochondrial genome evolution, including fragmentation.
we provide the first report of a multipartite mitochondrial genome architecture in a third order with highly rearranged genomes: thysanoptera .
we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of two divergent members of the scirtothrips dorsalis cryptic species complex.
continued use of these models will facilitate a greater understanding of recombination and other mitochondrial genome evolutionary processes across eukaryotes.
this genome also features paralogous control regions with high similarity suggesting a very recent origin of the nad <dig> mini-circle chromosome in the south asia  <dig> cryptic species.
the east asia  <dig> species has the single circular chromosome common to animals while the south asia  <dig> species has a genome consisting of two circular chromosomes.
