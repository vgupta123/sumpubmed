we used a neonatal mouse model to assess new cells in the hippocampus after h-i injury.
we found a significant increase in brdu-positive cells in the neonatal mouse hippocampus in the injured area compared to the non-injured area, most prominent in the dentate gyrus  .
mechanisms that affect recovery from fetal and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic  brain injury have not been fully elucidated.
these findings demonstrate that the neonatal animal responds to brain injury with neurogenesis, much like the adult animal.
the presence of new cells was determined by bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation into cells with sacrifice of the animals at intervals.
the incidence of intrapartum asphyxia is approximately  <dig> %, but the occurrence of adverse clinical outcome is much lower.
one of the factors which may account for this relatively good outcome is the process of neurogenesis, which has been described in adult animals.
