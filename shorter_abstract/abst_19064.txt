the results of the current study suggest that increased serum cobalamin concentrations should not be ignored in cats with no history of supplementation, and investigation for underlying hepatic or neoplastic disease is warranted.
the aim of this retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study was to determine the significance of increased cobalamin in cats.
multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that increased serum cobalamin concentration was positively related to pedigree breed , to having liver disease , and to having a solid neoplasm .
when increased serum cobalamin concentrations are encountered clinically they are usually attributed to parenteral supplementation, dietary factors, or otherwise ignored.
a total of  <dig> cats had increased serum cobalamin concentration, and had not received prior supplementation.
