comparison of tes and vas transcriptomes demonstrated that genes participating in dna replication, rna transcription and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways are expressed at significantly higher levels in tes tissues than in vas tissues.
a large portion of a. suum gonadal genes have related rnai phenotypes in c. elegans and, thus, might be rnai targets for parasite control.
widespread study of a. suum would be facilitated by more comprehensive genome resources and, to this end, we have produced a gonad transcriptome of a. suum.
two  <dig> pyrosequencing runs generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads for germline  and somatic  tissues of the a. suum gonad, respectively.
comparison of the a. suum tes transcriptome with the c. elegans microarray dataset identified  <dig> a. suum germline-enriched genes .
a total of  <dig>  a. suum genes were identified to have associated rnai phenotypes in c. elegans, the majority of which display embryonic lethality, slow growth, larval arrest or sterility.
using deep sequencing technology, this study has produced a gonad transcriptome of a. suum.
by comparison with c. elegans datasets, we identified sets of genes associated with spermatogenesis and gonad development in a. suum.
<dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons were annotated according to the c. elegans protein and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  protein databases.
ascaris suum  is a parasitic nematode that causes substantial losses to the meat industry.
<dig>  million bp of unique sequences were obtained with a coverage that reached  <dig> -fold.
many of these genes encode serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases  as well as tyrosine kps.
this nematode is suitable for biochemical studies because, unlike c. elegans, homogeneous tissue samples can be obtained by dissection.
it has large sperm, produced in great numbers that permit biochemical studies of sperm motility.
