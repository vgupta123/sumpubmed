one of the main explanations for the stunning diversity of teleost fishes  is that a fish-specific whole-genome duplication event  in the ancestor to teleosts triggered their subsequent radiation.
teleosts diversified explosively in their early history and this burst of diversification may have been caused by genome duplication.
~88% of species diversity is derived from two relatively recent radiations of freshwater and marine fishes where genome duplication is not suspected.
genome duplications are a common event on the tree of life and have been implicated in the diversification of major clades like flowering plants, vertebrates, and gnathostomes.
however our results suggest that the causes of diversification in large clades are likely to be complex and not easily ascribed to a single event, even a dramatic one such as a whole genome duplication.
however, one critical assumption of this hypothesis, that diversification rates in teleosts increased soon after the acquisition of a duplicated genome, has never been tested.
