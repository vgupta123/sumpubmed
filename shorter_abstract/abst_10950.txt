here, we identify genes whose deletion has minimal or no effect on growth, but results in failure to achieve timely completion of the fermentation of a chemically defined grape juice with  <dig> g l− <dig> total sugar.
an extreme phenotype, ‘stuck’ fermentation, was also observed when doa <dig>  npt <dig>  plc <dig>  ptk <dig>  sin <dig>  ssq <dig>  tps <dig>  tps <dig> or zap <dig> were deleted.
their importance is highlighted in our fermentation relevant yeast genes  database, generated from literature and the fermentation-relevant phenotypic characteristics of null mutants described in the saccharomyces genome database.
clustering and numerical enrichment of genes annotated to specific gene ontology  terms highlighted the vacuole’s role in ion homeostasis and ph regulation, through vacuole acidification.
the initial high osmotic pressure and acidity of grape juice is followed by nutrient depletion and increasing concentrations of ethanol as the fermentation progresses.
wine fermentation is a harsh ecological niche to which wine yeast are well adapted.
these  <dig> fermentation essential genes  are required to complete an extended high-sugar  fermentation.
