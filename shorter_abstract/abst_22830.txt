minimal cns were estimated from the ratio of hcs and compared to absolute cns determined by alternative methods.
the beta-defensin gene cluster  at chromosome 8p <dig>  is one of the most copy number  variable regions of the human genome.
for  <dig> samples and  <dig> amplicons, the  <dig> haplotyping results were compared to those by cloning/sanger sequencing.
whereas individual defb cns have been suggested as independent genetic risk factors for several diseases , the role of multisite sequence variations  is less well understood and to date has only been reported for prostate cancer.
concordance in cns was found for  <dig> samples, the cns differed by one in  <dig> samples and the estimated minimal cn was half of the absolute in one sample.
intrinsic problems related to chimera formation during pcr and differences between haplotyping by  <dig> and cloning/sanger sequencing are discussed.
deep amplicon sequencing using the  <dig> technology yield thousands of hcs per amplicon for an affordable price and may represent an effective method for parallel haplotyping and cn estimation in small to medium-sized cohorts.
here, we demonstrate that amplicon sequencing of pooled individual pcr products by the  <dig> technology allows in-depth determination of msv haplotypes and estimation of defb cns in parallel.
the obtained haplotypes represent a valuable resource to facilitate further studies of the biomedical impact of highly cn variable loci such as the beta-defensin locus.
six pcr products spread over ~ <dig> kb of defb and harbouring  <dig> known msvs were amplified from  <dig> dna samples, pooled and sequenced on a roche  <dig> gs flx sequencer.
