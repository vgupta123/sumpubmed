the molecular surface volume is a useful metric that describes contribution of geometrical volume, which includes van der waals volume and volume of the voids, to the total volume of a protein in solution, thus isolating the effects of hydration for separate calculations.

voids and cavities in the native protein structure determine the pressure unfolding of proteins.
proteinvolume generates the molecular surface of a protein and uses an innovative flood-fill algorithm to calculate the individual components of the molecular surface volume, van der waals and intramolecular void volumes.
in addition, the volume changes due to the interaction of newly exposed atoms with solvent upon protein unfolding also contribute to the pressure unfolding of proteins.
