single cell analysis of a v. harveyi population has already indicated intercellular heterogeneity in the production of bioluminescence.
importantly, simultaneous analysis of two autoinducer induced phenotypes, bioluminescence  and exoproteolytic activity , in single cells provided evidence for functional heterogeneity within a v. harveyi population.
two genes involved in pathogenesis - vhp and vscp, which code for an exoprotease and a component of the type iii secretion system, respectively, and luxc  were chosen for analysis.
here we used reporter strains bearing promoter::gfp fusions to monitor the induction/repression of three autoinducer-regulated genes in wild type conjugates at the single cell level.
the lux operon and the exoprotease gene are induced, while vscp is repressed at high cell density.
autoinducers are not only an indicator for cell density, but play a pivotal role in the coordination of physiological activities within the population.
this study was undertaken to analyze the expression of various autoinducer-dependent genes in individual cells.
the responses of the promoter::gfp fusions in individual cells from the same culture ranged from no to high induction.
a complex quorum sensing cascade involving three autoinducers controls bioluminescence and several genes encoding virulence factors.
