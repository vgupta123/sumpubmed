in root tips, there were 2c, 4c and 8c peaks.
systemic variation of cellular endopolyploidy in different tissues during growth and development of spathoglottis plicata from field-grown plants and in vitro cultures was identified.
columns, floral pedicels of newly open flowers and growing flower stems were observed to have an endopolyploid 8c peak in addition to 2c and 4c peaks.
many of the members of the orchid family are commercially micropropagated.
a similar pattern was found in the vegetative tissues of both greenhouse-grown plants and tissue-cultured plantlets.
the dna contents and ploidy level of nuclei extracted from various tissues of a tropical terrestrial orchid spathoglottis plicata were examined by flow cytometry.
in mature leaves, a different pattern of ploidy level was found at different parts of the leaves.
very little has been done to characterize the ploidy variation in different tissues of the orchid plants during development.
but in the root tissues at the region with root hairs, only a 2c peak was observed.
sepals, petals and ovary tissues were found to have only a 2c  peak.
nuclei extracted from young leaves shown three peaks for 2c, 4c and 8c.
in developing floral pedicels, four peaks were observed for 2c, 4c, 8c and 16c.
in the leaf tips and middle parts, there were 2c and 4c peaks.
the family orchidaceae is the largest among the flowering plants.
