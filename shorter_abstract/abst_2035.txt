in this study we investigated the phylogeny and biogeography of hydrocharitaceae by integrating fossils and dna sequences from eight genes.
we also conducted ancestral state reconstruction for three morphological characters.
ancestral state reconstruction suggested that in hydrocharitaceae evolution of dioecy is bidirectional, viz., from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and from hermaphroditism to dioecy, and that the aerial-submerged leaf habit and short-linear leaf shape are the ancestral states.
hydrocharitaceae is a fully aquatic monocot family, consists of  <dig> genera with approximately  <dig> species.
the family includes both fresh and marine aquatics and exhibits great diversity in form and habit including annual and perennial life histories; submersed, partially submersed and floating leaf habits and linear to orbicular leaf shapes.
the family has a cosmopolitan distribution and is well represented in the tertiary fossil record in europe.
we have also provided valuable information for understanding the evolution of breeding system and leaf phenotype in aquatic monocots.
at present, the historical biogeography of the family is not well understood and the generic relationships remain controversial.
the study has resolved the historical biogeography of this family and supported dispersal as the most likely explanation for the intercontinental distribution.
phylogenetic analyses produced a phylogeny with most branches strongly supported by bootstrap values greater than  <dig> and bayesian posterior probability values of  <dig> .
biogeographic analyses  and divergence time estimates  resolved the most recent common ancestor of hydrocharitaceae as being in asia during the late cretaceous and palaeocene .
