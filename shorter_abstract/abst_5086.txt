particularly, the mode of regulation of mrna/lancrna pairs is associated with mrna transcription levels; the correlation between the pairs is positive at high mrna transcriptional levels and negative at low levels.
in addition, significant induction of mrna and coverage of more than half of the mrna sequence by a lancrna strengthens the positive correlation between mrna/lancrna pairs.
studies of the mode of regulation of mrna/lancrna pairs suggest that induction of lancrna may be associated with switch-like behavior of mrna/lancrna pairs and efficient regulation of the carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways in the exponential growth phase of k. marxianus being used in industrial applications.
we found that approximately 60Â % of the transcriptome consists of ncrnas transcribed from antisense and intergenic regions of the genome that were transcribed at lower levels than mrna.
in this study, we measured changes in transcriptome at three time points during the exponential growth phase of k. marxianus by using strand-specific rna-seq.
transcriptome sequencing of k. marxianus in the exponential growth phase reveals pervasive transcription of ncrnas with evolutionarily conserved functions.
in the transcriptome, a substantial number of long antisense ncrnas  are differentially expressed and enriched in carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways.
