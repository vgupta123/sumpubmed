simulations using large biologically realistic data sets with known gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that influence the risk of a complex disease are a convenient and useful way to assess the performance of statistical methods.
the gens <dig> tool is able to simulate gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.
because multifactoriality is expected to play a pivotal role, many studies are currently focused on collecting information on the genetic and environmental factors that potentially influence these diseases.
gens <dig> is based on data with realistic patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and imposes no limitations either on the number of individuals to be simulated or on number of non-predisposing genetic/environmental factors to be considered.
the analysis of complex diseases is an important problem in human genetics.

data produced by gens <dig> can be used as a benchmark for evaluating statistical tools designed for the identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
the gene-environment interaction simulator  <dig>  simulates interactions among two genetic and one environmental factor and also allows for epistatic interactions.
to make the simulator more intuitive, the input parameters are expressed as standard epidemiological quantities.
