carbohydrate metabolism and transport functions contributed up to 45% of the accessory genes, with some genomes having a higher content of genes encoding phosphotransferase systems for the uptake of carbohydrates than any previously sequenced genome.

within phylotypes, we found a remarkably high level of gene content diversity.
the honeybee gut microbiota has been described as consisting of a modest number of phylotypes; however, the genomes sequenced in the current study demonstrated a very high level of gene content diversity within all three described phylotypes of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, particularly in terms of metabolic functions and surface structures, where many features were strain-specific.
hits for crispr spacers were almost exclusively found within phylotypes, suggesting that the phylotypes are associated with distinct phage populations.
together, these results indicate niche differentiation within phylotypes, suggesting that the honeybee gut microbiota is more complex than previously thought.
the dynamics of these segments contrasted with low recombination frequencies and conserved gene order structures for the core genes.
these genes were often located in highly variable genomic segments that also contained genes for enzymes involved in the degradation and modification of sugar residues.
