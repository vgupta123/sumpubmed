the results indicated that cell free supernatant  of the strain had the good antimicrobial activity against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
the results indicated that the antimicrobial substances were still active after treatment with catalase and proteinase, respectively.
the results showed that e. faecium kq  <dig>  did not harbor any tested virulence genes such as gele, esp, asa <dig>  cyla, efaa and hyl.
the biochemical characteristics of antimicrobial substances were investigated.
moreover, the stability of antimicrobial substances did not change after heat treatment at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 80°c for 30 min, respectively.
the activity of antimicrobial substances remained stable at  <dig> and −20°c after long time storage.
agar well diffusion method was adopted in antimicrobial activity assay.

the objective of this paper was to study antimicrobial activity and safety of enterococcus faecium kq  <dig>   isolated from peacock feces.
the antimicrobial activity of cfs was compared with that of the buffer with similar strength and ph.
the inhibitory zone of the buffer was apparently smaller than that of cfs, which meant that the acid in cfs was not the only factor that was contributed to antibacterial activity of cfs.
disk diffusion test was used to determine the antibiotic resistance.
the antibiotic resistance and virulence potential were evaluated using disk diffusion test and pcr amplification.
it was susceptible to most of tested antibiotics except for vancomycin and polymyxin b.
