previous studies identified several core genes that respond to xenobiotic ahr ligands across a broad range of species and tissues.
research on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  has largely focused on variations in toxic outcomes resulting from its activation by halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.

in the absence of exogenous ligands.
because ahr status alone has been shown sufficient to alter transcriptomic responses, we reason that by contrasting profiles amongst ahr-variant animals, we may elucidate effects of the ahr on constitutive mrna abundances.
these findings, though preliminary, present a platform for further evaluating the role of the ahr in regulation of constitutive mrna levels and physiologic function.
analysis of regulatory motifs suggests that the ahr mostly mediates transcriptional regulation via direct binding to response elements.
we also find greater overlap between tissues at the pathway level than at the gene level, suggesting coherency to the ahr signalling response within these processes.
to address this, we profiled transcriptomic variations between ahr-active and ahr-less-active animals in the absence of an exogenous agonist across five tissues, three of which came from rats  and two of which came from mice .
one gene, creg <dig>  was significantly up-regulated in all ahr-less-active animals.
