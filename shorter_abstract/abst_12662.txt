detailed manual annotation demonstrated that almost 5% of the gene repertoire consists of pseudogenes.
here, we report the complete sequence and comprehensive annotation of the bloom-forming anabaena sp.
two novel excision elements were found in the nifh gene that is required for nitrogen fixation.
cyanobacteria can form massive toxic blooms in fresh and brackish bodies of water and are frequently responsible for the poisoning of animals and pose a health risk for humans.
it comprises two circular chromosomes and three plasmids with a total size of  <dig>  mb, encoding a total of  <dig>  genes.
the genome contains a large number of genes encoding restriction-modification systems.
genome analysis demonstrated that this strain invests heavily in the production of bioactive compounds and restriction-modification systems.
the genome is replete with mobile genetic elements.

inactivation of the hassallidin  biosynthetic gene cluster through a deletion event and a natural mutation of the buoyancy-permitting gvpg gas vesicle gene were documented.
a further 5% of the genome is dedicated to the synthesis of small peptides that are the products of both ribosomal and nonribosomal biosynthetic pathways.
