separating the paternal and maternal chromosomes is an important component of genetic analyses such as determining genetic association, inferring evolutionary scenarios, computing recombination rates, and detecting cis-regulatory events.
given technologies like strobe sequencing that allow for large variations in advance lengths, we design and implement a simulated annealing algorithm to sample a large space of distributions over advance-lengths.
extensive simulations on individual genomic sequences suggest that a non-trivial distribution over advance lengths results a 1- <dig> order of magnitude improvement in median haplotype length.
our results suggest that haplotyping of large, biologically important genomic regions is feasible with current technologies.
as the pair of chromosomes are mostly identical to each other, linking together of alleles at heterozygous sites is sufficient to phase, or separate the two chromosomes.
in haplotype assembly, the linking is done by sequenced fragments that overlap two heterozygous sites.
we show that a number of parameters influence haplotype length, with the most significant one being the advance length .
