the compound is widely used as a wnt agonist, although its target molecules remain to be clarified.
in drug discovery research, cell-based phenotypic screening is an essential method for obtaining potential drug candidates.
these results demonstrate that tubulin is identified for the first time as a target molecule of the wnt-activating small molecule and that this might have misled the conclusions of some previous studies.
to identify its target proteins, we compared a series of cellular assay results for the compound with our pathway profiling database.
however, elucidating the target molecules of hit compounds from phenotypic screening campaigns remains a difficult and troublesome process.
simple and efficient methods for identifying the target molecules are essential.
based on our database analysis, the compound was anticipated to be a tubulin disruptor, which was subsequently confirmed by its inhibitory activity of tubulin polymerization.
revealing the mechanism of action is a key step on the path to drug discovery.
moreover, the present study also emphasizes that our pathway profiling database is a simple and potent tool for revealing the mechanisms of action of hit compounds obtained from phenotypic screenings and off targets of chemical probes.
