the search of  <dig>  human micrornas  binding sites in  <dig>  mrnas of human genes using the mirtarget program has been completed.
binding sites of mir-619-5p in the mrnas of transcription factor genes znf <dig> and znf <dig> encode the ahacnp oligopeptide in another reading frame.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
binding sites of mir-619-5p in the coding regions of mrnas of c8h8orf <dig>  c8orf <dig>  and isy <dig> genes encode the wlmpvip oligopeptide, which is present in the orthologous proteins.
the mir-619-5p binding site in the 5’utr of mrna of human usp <dig> gene is found in the mrnas of orthologous genes of primates.
binding sites of mir-619-5p in the 3’utrs of all human target genes are also present in the 3’utrs of orthologous genes of mammals.
normally, one mirna interacts with the mrna of one gene.
the completely complementary binding sites for mir-619-5p are conservative in the orthologous mammalian genes.
the binding sites of mir-619-5p in 3’utrs, 5’utrs and cdss are conservative in the orthologous mammalian genes.
identical nucleotide sequences of binding sites encode different amino acids in different proteins.
several genes have binding sites for mirnas in the cdss that are read in different open reading frames.
this significantly complicates the study of the properties of mirnas and their diagnostic and medical applications.
for the binding sites of the mir-619-5p the hybridization free energy of the bonds was equal to 100% of the maximum potential free energy.
the mrnas of  <dig> human genes have complete complementary binding sites of mir-619-5p in the 3’utr , cds , and 5’utr .
