like other water quality parameters, dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation reservoirs fluctuates dramatically over time.
zoospores of these species survived the best in control hoagland’s solution at dissolved oxygen concentrations of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  zoospore survival rates decreased with increasing and decreasing concentration of dissolved oxygen, depending upon phytophthora species and exposure time.
zoospores of p. megasperma, p. nicotianae, p. pini and p. tropicalis were assessed for survival in 10% hoagland’s solution at a range of dissolved concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> for up to seven exposure times from  <dig> to 72 h. zoospore survival was measured by resultant colony counts per ml.
overall, p. megasperma and p. pini are less sensitive than p. nicotianae and p. tropicalis to hyperoxia and hypoxia conditions.
however, zoosporic response to dissolved oxygen, an important water quality parameter, is not known.
the aim of this study was to determine whether and how zoospore survival may be affected by elevated and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in water to better understand the aquatic biology of these pathogens in irrigation reservoirs.
these findings suggest that dramatic fluctuations of dissolved oxygen in irrigation reservoirs contribute to the population decline of phytophthora species along the water path in the same reservoirs.
these findings advanced our understanding of the aquatic ecology of these pathogens in irrigation reservoirs.
zoospores in the control solution declined over time and this natural decline process was enhanced under hyperoxia and hypoxia conditions.
they also provided a basis for pathogen risk mitigation by prolonging the turnover time of runoff water in recycling irrigation systems via better system designs.
they produce motile zoospores that can move via water currents and on their own locomotion in aquatic environments.
