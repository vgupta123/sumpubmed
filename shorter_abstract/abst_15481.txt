a full-length igg specific for fibronectin ed-b was expressed as fusion protein with an intein  attached to each heavy chain.
the protocols were used to prepare immunoconjugates containing two biotin molecules per antibody, attached to the c-termini of the heavy chains.
full-length antibodies can be efficiently and site-specifically modified at the c-termini of their heavy chains by intein-fusion technologies.
the described protocols can be used to prepare immunoconjugates of high homogeneity and with a defined drug load of two.
both include the expression as an intein fusion protein, followed by the exchange of the intein for a functionalized moiety.
currently these immunoconjugates are prepared by rather unspecific coupling chemistries, resulting in heterogeneous products.
expressed protein ligation  and protein trans-splicing  are methods for the specific c-terminal modification of a target protein.
as the drug load is a key parameter for the antitumor activity, site-specific strategies are desired.
the attachment to the c-termini is expected to retain the affinity and effector functions of the antibodies.
