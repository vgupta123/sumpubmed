using synthetic mirna samples and plasma rna samples spiked with different ratios of  <dig> synthetic mirnas we assessed the performance characteristics reproducibility, recovery, specificity, sensitivity and linearity.
mirnas are found both in tissues and body fluids such as plasma.
at low mirna levels, as in plasma, the mircury platform showed better sensitivity and linearity than the taqman platform.
it was found that while the qrt-pcr based platforms were sufficiently sensitive to reproducibly detect mirnas at the abundance levels found in human plasma, the array based platform was not.
for profiling clinical samples with low mirna abundance, such as plasma samples, the mircury platform with its better sensitivity and linearity would probably be superior.
this motivated us to evaluate the performance of three commonly used commercial mirna quantification platforms: genechip mirna  <dig>  array, mircury ready-to-use pcr, human panel i+ii v <dig> m, and taqman human microrna array v <dig> .
a major perspective for the use of mirnas in the clinical setting is as diagnostic plasma markers for neoplasia.
for quantification of mirna in plasma it is therefore of importance to use a platform with high sensitivity and linear performance in the low concentration range.
