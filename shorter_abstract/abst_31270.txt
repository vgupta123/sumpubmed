a subset of breast cancer cells displays increased ability to self-renew and reproduce breast cancer heterogeneity.
we found breast cancer cells grown under non-attachment conditions display a unique pattern of mirna expression, highlighted by a marked low expression of mir- <dig> family members relative to parental cells.
mir30-family regulates the growth of breast cancer cells in non-attachment conditions.
to explore the notion that mirnas may have a role in sustaining bt-ics, we performed a comprehensive profiling of mirna expression in a model of putative bt-ics enriched by non-attachment growth conditions.
this is the first analysis of target prediction in a whole family of micrornas potentially involved in survival of putative bt-ics.
at least one of these targets, the anti-apoptotic protein aven, was able to partially revert the effect of mir-30a overexpression.
we further show that mir-30a regulates non-attachment growth.
