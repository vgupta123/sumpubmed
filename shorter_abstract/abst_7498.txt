cell morphology was preserved in all stored samples, except for increased vacuolization of mononuclear cells and cleaved nuclei of some small mononuclear cells.
we compared the changes in cell morphology, total and differential cell counts between cerebrospinal fluid  samples analyzed within an hour of collection  and after the addition of autologous serum and storage for 24 h  in  <dig> cattle with central nervous system disorders.
adding 11 % of autologous serum to csf samples might allow delayed analysis with a good agreement rate for csf cytological interpretation.
mononuclear pleocytosis diagnosed in  <dig> fresh samples was cytologically confirmed in  <dig> of the  <dig> stored samples.
in the stored csf samples, the total nucleated cell count and monocyte percentage were decreased , while the lymphocyte percentage was increased .
the overall agreement rate between cytologic interpretation of the fresh and the stored csf samples was 70 % .
caution is nonetheless warranted, as animal age, anamnesis, and neurological presentation need to be considered when interpreting stored csf without pleocytosis.
in the remaining eight stored samples, the number of total nucleated cells was within the normal range.
neutrophilic pleocytosis was confirmed in all seven stored samples.
there was a positive linear correlation between total and differential cell counts in the fresh and the stored samples.
