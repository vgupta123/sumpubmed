in this study we show that binding characteristics such as affinity can be improved for cbm generated from the cbm4- <dig> scaffold by using random mutagenesis in combination with phage display technology.
molecular evolution of carbohydrate binding modules  is a new approach for the generation of glycan-specific molecular probes.
the usefulness of the evolved binders was verified by staining of plant sections, where they performed better than the xyloglucan-binding module from which they had been derived.
we conclude that affinity maturation of cbm selected from molecular libraries based on the cbm4- <dig> scaffold is possible and has the potential to generate new analytical tools for detection of plant carbohydrates.
both improved modules differ from other existing xyloglucan probes by binding to galactose-decorated subunits of xyloglucan.
