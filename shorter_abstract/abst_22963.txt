based on microarray data we identify potential biomarkers as well as biomarker combinations using three feature selection methods: information gain, mean decrease accuracy of random forest and a wrapper of genetic algorithm and support vector machine .
ga/svm is rarely used for the analysis of microarray data, but it is able to identify genes capable of classifying tissues into different classes at least as well as the two reference methods.
alzheimerâ€™s disease has been known for more than  <dig> years and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood.
we compare their output to the results obtained from ga/svm.
information gain and random forest are two commonly used methods.
the biological significance of the genes and gene pairs is discussed.
