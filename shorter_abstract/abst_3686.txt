here, we demonstrate that a visual motion aftereffect can be contingent on a specific sound.
this phenomenon, which is known as contingent motion aftereffect, indicates that the brain can establish new neural representations even in the adult's brain.
these results indicate that a new neural representation can be rapidly established between auditory and visual modalities.
however, contingent motion aftereffect has been reported only in visual or auditory domain.
after a 3-minutes exposure, the tones began to exert marked influence on the visual motion perception, and the percentage of dots required to trigger motion perception systematically changed depending on the tones.
