we have modified the evolutionary model of meng and kubatko  to incorporate intraspecific sampling of multiple individuals for estimation of speciation times and times of hybridization events for testing for hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting.
although the possibility that this arises through incomplete lineage sorting is often incorporated in models for the species-level phylogeny, it is much less common for hybridization to also be formally included in such models.
we have also utilized a more efficient algorithm for obtaining our estimates.
using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach performs well under conditions motivated by an empirical data set for sistrurus rattlesnakes where putative hybridization has occurred.
a well-known characteristic of multi-locus data is that each locus has its own phylogenetic history which may differ substantially from the overall phylogenetic history of the species.
