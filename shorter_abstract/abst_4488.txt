hevea has a similar number of ap2/erf genes to that of other dicot species.
several ap2/erf genes highly expressed in latex suggest they have a specific function in hevea.
the  <dig> contigs with the full ap <dig> domain were classified into three main families  and  <dig> soloist members.
we observed several specific features for the erf family.
rubber tree  laticifers are the source of natural rubber.
ap2/erf transcription factors, and especially ethylene-response factors, play a crucial role in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
the analysis of ap2/erf transcripts in hevea presented here provides the basis for studying the molecular regulation of latex production in response to abiotic stresses and latex cell differentiation.
this study set out to sequence transcript expressed in various tissues using next-generation sequencing and to identify ap2/erf superfamily in the rubber tree.
alongside the microrna <dig> already described in plants, eleven additional micrornas were predicted to inhibit hevea ap2/erf transcripts.
reads from all libraries were pooled and reassembled to improve mrna lengths and produce a global library.
one hundred and seventy-three ap2/erf contigs were identified by in silico analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the conserved ap <dig> domain from the global library.
