western blot analyses were used to assess changes in the levels of phospho-ser2448-mtor, phospho-thr37/46-4e-bp- <dig>  phospho-thr389-p70s6 k, phospho-ser422-eif4b, phospho-ser240/244-s <dig>  phospho-ser473-akt, and phospho-thr202/tyr204-erk in the hippocampus.
these findings provide further data that contribute to understanding the possible relationships among mtor activity, stress, and antidepressant drugs.
therefore, the present study evaluated whether antidepressant drugs would exert differential effects on mtor signaling in the rat hippocampus under conditions of chronic restraint stress.
recent studies have suggested that the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin  signaling may be related to antidepressant action.
male sprague–dawley rats were subjected to restraint stress for 6 h/days for 21 days with either escitalopram  or paroxetine  administered after the chronic stress procedure.
chronic restraint stress significantly decreased the levels of phospho-mtor complex  <dig> , phospho-4e-bp- <dig>  phospho-p70s6 k, phospho-eif4b, phospho-s <dig>  phospho-akt, and phospho-erk ; the administration of escitalopram and paroxetine increased the levels of all these proteins .
additionally, chronic restraint stress reduced phospho-mtorc <dig> signaling activities in general, while escitalopram and paroxetine prevented these changes in phospho-mtorc <dig> signaling activities.
