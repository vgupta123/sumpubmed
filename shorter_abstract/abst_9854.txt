interestingly, akap <dig> binds in vivo to two rii-like proteins  that contain only the d/d domain.
it appears that the flagella of chlamydomonas reinhardtii contain proteins that bind to akaps and except for the d/d domain, lack the conventional a.a. stretches of pka regulatory subunits .
the chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella harbour two akaps; viz., the radial spoke akap <dig> or rsp <dig> and the central pair akap <dig>  both these were identified on the basis of their rii-binding property.
we show that fap <dig> localises to the central pair of the axoneme.
using overlay assays we show that fap <dig> binds akap <dig> previously identified in the c <dig> portion of the central pair apparatus.

binding of fap <dig> was tested with the akap97/rsp <dig> using in vitro pull down assays; however, this binding was rather poor with akap97/rsp <dig>  antibodies were generated against fap <dig> and the cellular localization was studied using western blotting and immunoflourescence in wild type and various flagella mutants.
