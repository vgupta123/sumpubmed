cpdl consistently identifies positions near enzyme active sites that include those predicted from structural and/or biochemical studies to be important for specificity and/or function.
this suggests that cpdl will have broad utility for the identification of potential class determining residues based on multiple sequence analysis of groups of homologous proteins.
we present a straightforward method for the identification of residues likely to determine class specific functionality in which multiple sequence alignments are converted to an annotated graphical form by the conserved property difference locator  program.
three test cases, each comprised of two groups of funtionally-distinct homologs, are presented.
of the test cases, one is a membrane and two are soluble enzyme families.
