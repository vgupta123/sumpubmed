algorithm  for generating generalized bpms from high-throughput genetic interaction data.
given a matrix of weighted epistasis values for a set of double knock-outs, genecentric returns a list of generalized bpms that may represent compensatory pathways.
for each pair in a collection of non-essential genes, an epistasis score is obtained, representing how much sicker  the double-knockout organism will be compared to what would be expected from the sickness of the component single knockouts.
