a graphical user interface provides easy access to all steps of data processing via a script builder to generate matlab scripts, providing an option to alter code manually.
the combination of an intuitive graphical user interface along with advanced data processing algorithms facilitates the use of metabolab in a broader metabolomics context.
despite wide-spread use of nuclear magnetic resonance  in metabolomics for the analysis of biological samples there is a lack of graphically driven, publicly available software to process large one and two-dimensional nmr data sets for statistical analysis.
algorithms within metabolab help to optimize the flow of metabolomics data preparation for statistical analysis.
it includes tools for batch processing and gives access to a wealth of algorithms available in the matlab framework.
the analysis of two-dimensional spectra  is facilitated by the use of a spectral library derived from publicly available databases which can be extended readily.
