with the same assembly parameters these tools can generate markedly different assembly outputs.
another measure of assembly completeness  also confirmed that our approach yields more information.
this step creates a significant bioinformatic challenge for accurate de novo assembly of novel transcriptome data.
for all eight datasets our pipeline generates more concise transcriptomes that in fact possess more unique annotatable protein domains than any of the three individual assemblers we employed.
our approach yields coding transcriptome assemblies that are more likely to be closer to biological reality than any of the three individual assembly packages we investigated.
this approach does not represent a new assembler, rather it combines the outputs of a variety of established assembly packages, and removes redundancy via a series of clustering steps.
all of these datasets were assembled using three currently popular assembly packages .
we test and validate our approach using illumina datasets from six phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes  and two simulated datasets derived from metazoan reference genome annotations.
for researchers working with nonconventional model organisms one major problem with the currently dominant ngs platform  stems from the obligatory fragmentation of nucleic acid material that occurs prior to sequencing during library preparation.
