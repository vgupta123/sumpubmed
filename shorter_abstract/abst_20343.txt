for these species identifying these defense genes could be an important step towards obtaining sweet orange resistant varieties through breeding or genetic engineering.
we also hypothesized the induction of auxin-related genes indicates that resistant plants initially recognize x. fastidiosa as a necrotrophic pathogen.
furthermore, many genes involved in secondary metabolism, biosynthesis and cell wall modification were upregulated as well as in synthesis of abscisic acid, jasmonic acid and auxin.
this work demonstrated that the defense response to the perception of bacteria involves cell wall modification and activation of hormone pathways, which probably lead to the induction of other defense-related genes.
thus, we investigated the gene expression in ponkan mandarin at one day after infection with x. fastidiosa, using rna-seq.
gene expression analysis of mock inoculated and infected tissues of ponkan mandarin identified  <dig> transcripts repressed and  <dig> significantly induced in the later.

among the induced transcripts, we identified genes encoding proteins similar to pattern recognition receptors.
on the other hand, among the citrus genus there are different sources of resistance against x. fastidiosa.
