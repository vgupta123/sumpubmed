sparta outputs quality analysis reports, gene feature counts and differential gene expression tables and scatterplots.
generally, the workflow includes quality control of reads, mapping to a reference, counting transcript abundance, and statistical tests for differentially expressed genes.
this software will enable microbiologists with limited bioinformatics experience to analyze their data and integrate next generation sequencing  technologies into the classroom.
many tools exist in the analysis of bacterial rna sequencing  transcriptional profiling experiments to identify differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions.
sparta provides an easy-to-use bacterial rna-seq transcriptional profiling workflow to identify differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions.
the easy-to-install, complete workflow processes whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing data files by trimming reads and removing adapters, mapping reads to a reference, counting gene features, calculating differential gene expression, and, importantly, checking for potential batch effects within the data set.
to make bacterial rna-seq data analysis more accessible, we developed a simple program for automated reference-based bacterial rna-seq transcriptome analysis .
sparta is turnkey software that simplifies the process of analyzing rna-seq data sets, making bacterial rna-seq analysis a routine process that can be undertaken on a personal computer or in the classroom.
