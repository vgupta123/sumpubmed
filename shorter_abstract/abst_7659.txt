autosomal recessive inheritance was also assumed, after ruling out, from pedigree analysis, dominant and x-linked inheritance.
the finnish lapphund is a dog breed presenting late-onset progressive retinal atrophy for which the disease locus remains unknown.
in this study we mapped the progressive retinal atrophy locus in the finnish lapphund using a dna pooling approach, assuming that all affected dogs within the breed share the same identical-by descent-mutation as the cause of the disease .
dna from  <dig> finnish lapphund cases was mixed in one pool, and dna from  <dig> first-degree relatives of these cases was mixed to serve as the control pool.
swedish lapphund cases, but not lapponian herder cases, had the same galk <dig> microsatellite genotype as finnish lapphund cases.
the locus for progressive rod-cone degeneration is known to be close to the galk <dig> locus, on the telomeric region of chromosome  <dig>  where the retinal atrophy locus of the finnish lapphund has been mapped.
further individual genotyping with additional samples  confirmed the association between this marker and the disease locus .
closely related to this breed are the swedish lapphund and the lapponian herder for which a small number of retinal atrophy cases have been reported.
this suggests that the disease in this breed, as well as in the swedish lapphund, may correspond to progressive rod-cone degeneration.
dogs have the second largest number of genetic diseases, after humans.
this would increase the number of known dog breeds having this particular form of progressive retinal atrophy.
among the diseases present in dogs, progressive retinal atrophy has been reported in more than a hundred breeds.
