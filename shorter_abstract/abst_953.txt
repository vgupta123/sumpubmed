a visualisation tool for peptide fractionation has been developed to support the evaluation of ief data quality and can be implemented in proteomics research.
we can assess performance characteristics of offgel ief peptide fractionation in proteomics by generating plots of the overall fractionation patterns and the pairwise comparisons of adjacent fractions.
offgel isoelectric focussing  has become a popular tool in proteomics to fractionate peptides or proteins.
