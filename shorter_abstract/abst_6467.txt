homeotic gene complexes determine the anterior-posterior body axis in animals.
we suggest that such sequences are likely to provide molecular handle to gain insight into the evolution and mechanism of regulation of associated gene complexes.
the expression pattern and function of hox genes along this axis is colinear with the order in which they are organized in the complex.
although the molecular basis of 'colinearity' of hox complexes is not yet understood, it is possible that there are control elements within or in the proximity of these complexes that establish and maintain the expression patterns of hox genes in a coordinated fashion.
such a high degree of conservation in the core regions of this  <dig> kb dna, where no variation occurred during ~ <dig> million years of evolution, suggests critical function for these sequences.
stretches of hundreds of base pairs in a  <dig> kb region, upstream of hoxd complex, show 100% conservation across the vertebrate species.
this offers a comparative genomics approach to identify conserved regions linked to this complex.
genomic sequences covering the hoxd complex from several vertebrate species are now available.
