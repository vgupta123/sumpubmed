we propose multiple canonical correlation analysis  as a method to align the non-linearly distorted time scales of repeated lc/ms experiments in a robust way.
multiple canonical correlation analysis is able to map several time series to a consensus time scale.
quantitative analysis of differential protein expressions requires to align temporal elution measurements from liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry .
the proposed method significantly increases the number of proteins that are identified as being differentially expressed in different biological samples.
we compare our approach with previously published methods for aligning mass spectrometry data on a large proteomics dataset.
jointly aligning multiple liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry samples by mcca substantially increases the detection rate of potential bio-markers which significantly improves the interpretability of lc/ms data.
