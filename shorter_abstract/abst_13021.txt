a whole-genome approach was applied to resolve the phylogeny of eight plasmodium species and four outgroup taxa.
by using  <dig> orthologous proteins we received unanimous support for a sister group position of laverania and avian malaria parasites.
p. falciparum exports pathogenicity-related proteins into the host cell using the plasmodium export element .
our phylogenomic analyses strongly support the hypotheses that the laverania have been founded by a single plasmodium species switching from birds to african great apes or vice versa.
predictions based on the presence of a pexel motif suggest that more than  <dig> proteins are exported by p. falciparum, while there are many fewer exported proteins in non-laverania.
most interestingly, several deviations from the p. falciparum pexel motif were found to be present in the orthologous sequences of non-laverania.
the deviations from the canonical pexel motif in orthologs may explain the comparably low number of exported proteins that have been predicted in non-laverania.
it belongs to the taxon laverania, which includes other ape-infecting plasmodium species.
this observation was corroborated by the analyses of  <dig> exported proteins with orthologs present in all plasmodium species.
