the prion-like phenotype can be reversibly cured in the presence of guanidine hcl or by over-expression of the hsp <dig> chaperone protein.
in an established yeast test system the two gaf q domains convey prion activities comparable to well known yeast prions.
additionally, when fused to gfp, the q domains form aggregates in yeast cells.
here we show that the q domains exhibit prion-like properties.
the q domains stably maintain two distinct conformational states imposing functional constraints on the fused yeast reporter protein.
we conclude that prion-like behavior of the gaf q domain suggests that this c-terminal structure may perform stable conformational switches.
gaf functions are intimately associated to chromatin-based epigenetic control, linking basic transcriptional regulation to heritable long-term maintenance of gene expression.
