the data presented above can be also used as valuable and early markers in cellular changes induced by metals for the evaluation of metal contamination.
the results indicated that al accumulated mainly in the roots, and small amounts were transported to aboveground organs.
nucleolar particles containing argyrophilic proteins were accumulated and leached out from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
al induced the formation of abnormal microtubule  arrays, consisting of discontinuous wavy mts or short mt fragments at the cell periphery.
evidence from cellular experiments showed that al had an inhibitory effect on the root growth at all concentrations  used.
masson pine  is one of the most important timber species with adaptable, fast growing, versatile advantages in southern china.
chromosome fragments, chromosome bridges, c-mitosis and chromosome stickiness were induced during mitosis in the root tip cells.
despite considerable research efforts, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of a <dig> toxicity and resistance in p. massoniana are still poorly understood.
mt organization and function of the mitotic spindle and phragmoplast were severely disturbed.
based on the information provided in this article, it is concluded that root tips of plants are the most sensitive organ to environmental stresses and the accumulation of al ions primarily is in roots of p. massoniana, and small amounts of al are transported to aboveground.
the effects of al on uptake and translocation of al and other minerals, cell division and nucleolus in p. massoniana were investigated.
al induces a series of the cellular toxic changes concerning with cell division and nucleolus.
