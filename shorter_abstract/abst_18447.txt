primer combinations are optimized based on lengths, melting temperatures, and spacing among primer sites.
lava identifies combinations of six primer regions for basic lamp signatures, or combinations of eight primer regions for lamp signatures with loop primers, which can be used as lamp signatures.
we also include signatures from a sample run targeting all strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
we have designed and demonstrated new software for identifying signature candidates appropriate for lamp assays.
we compare lamp signature candidates for staphylococcus aureus created both by lava and by primerexplorer.
