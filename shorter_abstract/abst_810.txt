the high ld distance and abundant polymorphisms described here increase our understanding of the forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in sesame and will be a valuable resource for future gene–phenotype and genome-wide association studies .
this study represents the first report of genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in sesame.
the population snp rate, population diversity  and watterson’s estimator of segregating sites  were estimated at  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10-3 bp- <dig>  respectively.
phylogenetic relationships between each of the  <dig> sesame strains were consistent with the hypothesis of sesame originating on the indian subcontinent.
characterization of genome-wide patterns of allelic variation and linkage disequilibrium can be used to detect reliable phenotype–genotype associations and signatures of molecular selection.
in addition, we proposed novel roles for adenylate isopentenyltransferase  genes in determining the number of flowers per leaf axil of sesame by mediating zeatin biosynthesis.
the linkage disequilibrium  decay distance was estimated at 150 kb, with no distinct structure observed in the population.
