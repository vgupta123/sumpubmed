it allows customization of essentially all aspects of figures, but also supports integration into computational pipelines via download of r code.
visualization of data generated by high-throughput, high-dimensionality experiments is rapidly becoming a rate-limiting step in computational biology.
venndiagramweb allows real-time modification of venn and euler diagrams, with parameter setting through a web interface and immediate visualization of results.
to facilitate this process for the generation of highly-customizable, high-resolution venn and euler diagrams, we introduce venndiagramweb: a web application for the widely used venndiagram r package.
for application support please contact paul.boutros@oicr.on.ca.
venndiagramweb allows the easy creation of venn and euler diagrams for computational biologists, and indeed many other fields.
