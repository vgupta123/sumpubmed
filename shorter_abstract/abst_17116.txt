however, there is a number of short  genomic segments with the total length of  <dig>  kb which possess phylogenetic patterns strikingly different from the rest of the genome.
instead, each permafrost strain has close relatives from temperate environments.
demonstrates no evidence of sexual reproduction.
predominantly clonal structure of genome sequences is consistent with the observations that sexual reproduction is rare in p. spp.
spp.,  <dig> of which were extracted from permafrost,  <dig> from a cryopeg, a layer of unfrozen ground in permafrost, and  <dig> from temperate surface environments.
although several lineages of p. spp.
were shown to produce ascospores in culture, the vast majority of p. spp.
nucleotide diversity among these genomes is very high, with a typical evolutionary distance at synonymous sites ds ≈  <dig> , suggesting that the last common ancestor of these strains lived >50mya.
small number of regions with noncanonical phylogenies seem to arise due to some recombination events between derived lineages of p.
