the primary neural stem/progenitor cells used were neurospheres, generated from the lateral ventricle wall of the adult mouse brain.
in order to achieve these goals effective strategies to isolate, expand and differentiate neural stem cells into the desired specific phenotypes must be developed.
the results were compared to both differentiation and proliferation controls, which revealed an unexpected and significant differential expression relating to withdrawal of epidermal growth factor  from the neurosphere growth medium.
the recently discovered adult neural stem cells, which maintain continuous generation of new neuronal and glial cells throughout adulthood, are a promising and expandable source of cells for use in cell replacement therapies within the central nervous system.
we used cdna microarrays with the aim of analysing the transcriptional changes underlying pacap induced proliferation of neural stem cells.
the effect of egf removal was so pronounced that it masked the changes in gene expression patterns produced by the addition of pacap.
