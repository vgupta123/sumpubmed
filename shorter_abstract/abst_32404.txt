<dig> appears to act as a leptin mimetic, at least with respect to katp channel activation, and may bypass up-stream signalling components of the leptin pathway.
<dig> activates katp channels in a pi3k-independent manner, but, like leptin, channel activation is dependent on actin cytoskeleton remodelling.
<dig>  like leptin, activates katp channels in insulinoma cells.
<dig>  opens katp channels in rat insulinoma cells, by the same mechanism as leptin.
<dig> hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> rat insulinoma cells by activation of katp channels.
3-guanidinopropionic acid derivatives reduce body weight in obese, diabetic mice.
