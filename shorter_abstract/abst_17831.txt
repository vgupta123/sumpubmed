the precise role of the mobile gene product is unknown but impacts on the regulation of outermembrane porins.
integrons are found in many diverse bacterial genera and is a genetic system ubiquitous in vibrios that captures mobile dna at a dedicated site.
the presence of integron-associated genes, contained within units of mobile dna called gene cassettes makes up a substantial component of the vibrio genome .
this demonstrates that strain specific laterally acquired mobile dna can be integrated rapidly into bacterial networks such that it becomes advantageous for survival and adaptation in changing environments.
it is generally regarded that strain-specific mobile genes cannot be readily integrated into the cellular machinery since any perturbation of core metabolism is likely to result in a loss of fitness.
mobile genes that are highly strain specific are generally believed to act in isolation.
lateral gene transfer  is a major contributor to bacterial evolution and up to 25% of a bacterium's genome may have been acquired by this process over evolutionary periods of time.
successful lgt requires both the physical transfer of dna and its successful incorporation into the host cell.
