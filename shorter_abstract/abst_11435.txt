using differential gene content, we characterized enrichment profiles of the collection of strains relating to phylogeny, early vs. late colonization, pathogenicity and growth rate.
an important step toward achieving a more complete understanding of e.coli biology entails elucidating relationships between gene content and adaptation to the ecological niche.
we found clear gene content distinctions relating to the various grouping criteria.
one pair, in which the strains were isolated four months apart, showed maintenance of an early colonizer genome profile but also gene content and codon usage changes toward the late colonizer profile.
this analysis demonstrated the importance of geography in shaping strain level gene content profiles.
our results indicate a general pattern where alternative genetic pathways lead toward a consistent ecological role for e.coli as a species.
within this framework however, we saw selection shaping the coding repertoire of e.coli strains toward distinct ecotypes with different phenotypic properties.
here, we present genome comparisons of  <dig> e.coli strains that represent commensals and pathogens isolated from infants during a specific time period in trondheim, norway.
lastly, we placed our sequenced isolates into a broader genomic context by comparing them with  <dig> published e.coli genomes that represent a variety of pathotypes and commensal strains.
the sequenced genomes included two pairs of strains where each pair was isolated from the same infant at different time points.
