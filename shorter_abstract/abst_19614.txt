eighty-three adult male and female sprague–dawley rats were subjected to mcao or sham surgery and the ebst was performed up to 7 days after the lesion.
in a previous study from our lab using the ebst after middle cerebral artery occlusion , rats swung contralateral to the infarct day  <dig> post-mcao, but ipsilateral day  <dig> post-mcao.

both experimentally and through systematic literature review, the present study shows that the direction of biased swing activity in the ebst for rodents after cerebral ischemia can differ and even shift over time in some situations.
this study highlights the importance of adequate reporting of behavioral tests for lateralization and it is concluded that the ebst cannot be recommended as a test for motor asymmetry after mcao in rats.
the ebst curve for females was significantly different from that of males after the same occlusion time .
this shift was unexpected and prompted us to perform the present study.
the basic idea is that when the animal is suspended vertically by the tail, it will swing its head laterally to the left or right depending on lesion side.
