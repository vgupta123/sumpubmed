therefore, we believe that these snps will be valuable as they recapitulate and strengthen the history of mango diversity.
those markers have divided the israeli mango collection into two major groups: one group included mostly mango accessions from southeast asia  and india and the other with mainly of floridian and israeli mango cultivars.
a slight population differentiation was detected , suggesting that if the mango accessions of the western world apparently was originated from southeast asia, as has been previously suggested, the duration of cultivation was not long enough to develop a distinct genetic background.
a subset of snps was sampled to explore the israeli mango collection and most of them were polymorphic in many mango accessions.
further investigation of the diversity in the israeli mango collection was performed based on a subset of  <dig> snps.
variation discovery was performed using illumina resequencing of ‘keitt’ and ‘tommy atkins’ cultivars identified  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> simple-sequence repeats .
germplasm collections are an important source for plant breeding, especially in fruit trees which have a long duration of juvenile period.
even though mango is an economically important crop, most of the studies on diversity in mango collections have been conducted with a small number of genetic markers.
the set of snp markers described in this study is novel.
