in search of new antifungal targets of potential interest for pharmaceutical companies, we initiated a comparative genomics study to identify the most promising protein-coding genes in fungal genomes.
we report the enzymatic characterization and the crystallographic structure of the candida albicans thiamine pyrophosphokinase.
the presence of an inorganic phosphate in the crystallographic structure opposite the known amp binding site relative to the thiamine moiety suggests that a second amp molecule could be accommodated in the c. albicans structure.
since thiamine pyrophosphate is an essential product involved in a variety of metabolic pathways, proteins responsible for its production satisfied these two criteria.
finally, the tpk/thiamine-pnp complex is consistent with a one step mechanism of pyrophosphorylation.
a second criterion was that the corresponding gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae should be essential.
