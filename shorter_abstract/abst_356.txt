gene expression was evaluated for transformation growth factor beta  <dig>  proving that l-ha alone increased its expression at 4 h followed by restoration of similar trends for all the stimuli.
it has been shown that ha fragments  usually trigger an inflammatory response that, on one hand, is the first signal in the activation of a repair mechanism but on the other, when it’s overexpressed, it may promote unwanted side effects.
compared to the others, persistence of a significant higher expression level at 24 h for the h-ha/l-ha complex was found.
the outcomes of this research showed that, both at high and low concentrations, hybrid complexes proved to perform better than ha alone thus suggesting their potential as medical devices in aesthetic and regenerative medicine.
recent studies have reported the roles of hyaluronic acid  chains of diverse length in wound repair, especially considering the simultaneous occurrence in vivo of both high-  and low-molecular weight  hyaluronan at an injury site.
