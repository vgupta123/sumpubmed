we use this robust gene list to build higher order networks of gene interaction by interconnecting associated networks, supporting and extending the important role of the egf signaling pathway in cancer.
we propose that the use of global genomic cross-validation derived from high content technologies  can be used to generate more reliable datasets.
here we use a combined approach to study the egf dependent transcriptome of hela cells by using multiple long oligonucleotide based microarray platforms  in combination with digital gene expression profiling  with the illumina genome analyzer.
epidermal growth factor  is a key regulatory growth factor activating many processes relevant to normal development and disease, affecting cell proliferation and survival.
by applying a procedure for cross-platform data meta-analysis based on rankprod and globalancova tests, we establish a well validated gene set with transcript levels altered after egf treatment.
