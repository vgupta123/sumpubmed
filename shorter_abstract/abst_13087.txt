the different information sources are combined using deep neural networks.
the problems resulting from the increased dimensionality and complexity of the learning problem are combated with a careful feature analysis, which results in a drastically reduced feature set.

our study suggests that critical feature analysis can improve the performance of contact prediction methods that combine multiple information sources.
therefore, recent methods combined evolutionary and sequence-based information as well as evolutionary and physicochemical information.
we develop a new contact predictor  that goes beyond current methods by combining evolutionary, physicochemical, and sequence-based information.
on  <dig> hard casp <dig> fm targets, epsilon-cp achieves a mean precision of  <dig> % for top- l/ <dig> predicted long-range contacts, which is 11% better than the casp <dig> winning version of metapsicov.
the size of the refined feature set decreased by 75%, enabling a significant increase in training data for machine learning, contributing significantly to the observed improvements.
furthermore, in this study we find that the amino acid composition, a commonly used feature, is rendered ineffective in the context of meta approaches.
since the solution space of native residue-residue contact pairs is very large, it is necessary to leverage information to identify relevant regions of the solution space, i.e.
accurately predicted contacts allow to compute the 3d structure of a protein.
