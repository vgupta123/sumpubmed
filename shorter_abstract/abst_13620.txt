in addition, the interacting sites identified from sonication-based data are enriched with chip-seq signals of transcription factors oct <dig>  klf <dig>  esrrb, tcfcp2i <dig>  and zfx that are critical for reprogramming and pluripotency.
due to the nature of sonication-based method, correlation analysis of the 4c interactions with transcription factor binding should be more straightforward.
from all mapped interactions, we further applied statistical models to identify enriched interacting regions.
however, bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing sonication-based 4c-seq data are not well developed.
compared to enzyme approach, sonication method generated less distal intra-chromosomal interactions, possibly due to the difference in chromatin fragmentation.
from biological replicates, we found good correlation  for inter-chromosomal interactions identified in either enzyme or sonication method.
circular chromosome conformation capture, when coupled with next-generation sequencing , can be used to identify genome-wide interaction of a given locus  with all of its interacting partners.
here we present a comparative analysis of 4c-seq data generated by both methods, using an enhancer element of pou5f <dig> gene in mouse embryonic stem  cells.
conventional 4c approaches used restriction enzyme digestion to fragment chromatin, and recently sonication approach was also applied for this purpose.
interestingly, data generated from the two methods showed 30% overlap of the reproducible interacting regions.
the interacting sites in the reproducible regions from both methods are similarly enriched with active histone marks.
