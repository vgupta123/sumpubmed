this paper presents an image analysis pipeline  for high-throughput plant phenotyping.
htpheno, an open source image analysis pipeline, supplies a flexible and adaptable imagej plugin which can be used for automated image analysis in high-throughput plant phenotyping and therefore to derive new biological insights, such as determination of fitness.
one of the latest developments is automated greenhouse systems for high-throughput plant phenotyping.
during such screening different images of each plant are recorded and must be analysed by applying sophisticated image analysis algorithms.
within the analysis different phenotypical parameters for each plant such as height, width and projected shoot area of the plants are calculated for the duration of the screening.
