to assess whether a compound is druglike or not as early as possible is always critical in drug discovery process.
there have been many efforts made to create sets of 'rules' or 'filters' which, it is hoped, will help chemists to identify 'drug-like' molecules from 'non-drug' molecules.
classifying approved drugs from experimental drugs may be more helpful to obtain future approved drugs.
the best results were obtained by svm, in which the accuracy is  <dig> , the sensitivity is  <dig> , and the specificity is  <dig> .
based on the results, consensus model was developed to effectively discriminate drugs, which further pushed the correct classification rate up to  <dig> , sensitivity up to  <dig> , specificity up to  <dig> .
however, among the chemical space of the druglike molecules, the minority will be approved drugs.
the studies would have potential applications in the research of combinatorial library design and virtual high throughput screening for drug discovery.
therefore, discrimination of approved drugs from experimental ones has been done in this paper by analyzing the compounds in terms of existing drugs features and machine learning methods.
