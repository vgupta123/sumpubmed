to extend the computational analysis, we showed that hlsg <dig> is an essential gtpase predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and, in some cells, in cajal bodies in the nucleus.
compartmentalization is a key feature of eukaryotic cells, but its evolution remains poorly understood.
comparison of localization and sirna datasets suggests that all members of the family are essential gtpases that have increased in number as the compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell and the ribosome biogenesis pathway have evolved.
