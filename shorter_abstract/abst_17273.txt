the non-local duplications in the vertebrate ancestor are predated by local  duplications leading to the formation of about a dozen ancient microrna clusters.
using this uniform data basis we analyze their evolutionary history in terms of individual gene phylogenies and in terms of preservation of genomic nearness across species.
our results suggest that microrna innovation is an ongoing process.
here we report on a comprehensive comparative study of all known mirna families in animals.
we identify three episodes of microrna innovation that correspond to major developmental innovations: a class of about  <dig> mirnas is common to protostomes and deuterostomes and might be related to the advent of bilaterians.
