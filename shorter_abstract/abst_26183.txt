indeed, starting from ~ <dig>  mouse lncrnas we could predict that between  <dig> and 11% present conserved sequence fragments in fish genomes.
our results show that a subset of mouse candidate lncrnas could be distinguished from random sequences based on their alignment with zebrafish phastcons elements.
in summary, we show that interesting genomic regions in zebrafish could be marked based on their sequence homology to a mouse lncrna, overlap with ests and proximity to genes involved in nervous system development.
low sequence conservation and lack of functional annotations make it difficult to identify homologs of mammalian lncrnas in other vertebrates.
