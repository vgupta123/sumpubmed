the observed genome to genome variation in gene content and is elements of different species supports the view that similar evolutionary paths of host adaptation developed independently in f. tularensis  and f. noatunensis subsp.
the genus francisella can be divided into two main genetic clades occupying both terrestrial and marine habitats.
only limited data were available for other members of the francisella genus, including f. philomiragia, an opportunistic pathogen of humans, f. noatunensis, a serious pathogen of farmed fish, and other less well described endosymbiotic species.
the genus francisella could be divided into two main genetic clades: one included f. tularensis, f. novicida, f. hispaniensis and wolbachia persica, and another included f. philomiragia and f. noatunensis.
however, the fish pathogen f. noatunensis subsp.
however, our analyses suggest that the ancestral francisella species originated in a marine habitat.
we determined the phylogenetic relationships of all known francisella species, including some for which the phylogenetic positions were previously uncertain.
some francisella species were found to have significant recombination frequencies.
noatunensis was an exception due to it exhibiting a highly clonal population structure similar to the human pathogen f. tularensis.
previously published francisella genome sequences were largely restricted to the zoonotic agent f. tularensis.
