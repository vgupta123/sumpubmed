to further understand the role of efnb <dig> in t cell immunity, we generated t-cell-specific efnb <dig> gene knockout mice to assess t cell development and function in these mice.
our results suggest that the function of efnb <dig> in the t cell compartment could be compensated by other members of the efn family, and that such redundancy safeguards the pivotal roles of efnb <dig> in t cell development and function.
na√Øve ko cd <dig> cells showed an ability to differentiate into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells similar to control cd <dig> cells.
the ligands of ephs, ephrins , are also cell surface molecules.
efnb <dig> is known to be able to co-stimulate t cells in vitro and to modulate thymocyte development in a model of foetal thymus organ culture.
eph kinases are the largest family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases.
the bone marrow progenitors from ko mice and wt control mice repopulated host spleen t cell pool to similar extents.
