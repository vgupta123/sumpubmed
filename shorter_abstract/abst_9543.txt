bitter taste, which is mediated by bitter taste receptors  in the tongue, helps organisms avoid ingesting potentially toxic substances in food.
our results provide a basis for understanding the differences in feeding ecology among nwms with respect to bitter taste.

in this study, we compared the ligand sensitivities of the tas2rs of five species of nwms by heterologous expression in hek293t cells and calcium imaging.
new world monkeys  are unique in that they exhibit remarkable interspecific variation in color vision and feeding behavior, making them an excellent model for studying sensory ecology.
we then reconstructed the ancestral receptors of nwm tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig>  measured the evolutionary shift in ligand sensitivity, and identified the amino acid replacement at residue  <dig> as responsible for the high sensitivity of marmoset tas2r <dig> to colchicine.
