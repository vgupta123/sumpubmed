afterparty datasets can either be created using the existing afterparty server, or using local instances that can be built easily using a virtual machine.
afterparty's main use case scenario is one in which a working biologist has generated a large volume of transcribed sequence data and wishes to turn it into a useful resource that has some durability.
by reducing the effort, bioinformatics skills, and computational resources needed to annotate and publish a transcriptome, afterparty will facilitate the annotation and sharing of sequence data that would otherwise remain unavailable.
contigs are functionally annotated based on similarity to known sequences and protein domains.
to promote best-practice in annotation and to ensure that data remain accessible, we have written afterparty, a web application that allows users to assemble, annotate and publish novel transcriptomes using only a web browser.
afterparty is a robust web application that implements best-practice transcriptome assembly, annotation, browsing, searching, and visualization.
afterparty includes powerful visualization tools for transcriptome dataset exploration and uses a flexible annotation architecture which will allow additional types of annotation to be added in the future.
