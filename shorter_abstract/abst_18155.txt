we examine here how the relative length of the light and dark phases of the environmental cycle influences this rhythm splitting and the necessity of a running wheel for expression of this entrainment condition.
these circadian entrainment patterns may be of therapeutic value to human shift-workers and others facing chronobiological challenges.
access to a running wheel was necessary neither for the induction nor maintenance of this entrainment pattern.
rhythm splitting was observed in wheel-running and general locomotion of siberian and syrian hamsters.
