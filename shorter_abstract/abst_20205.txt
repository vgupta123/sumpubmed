two porcine cell lines, st and 3d4/ <dig>  were used to investigate in vitro antiviral activity of ptd-pomx <dig> against csfv using confocal microscopy, western blot, flow cytometry, and real-time rt-pcr.
classical swine fever  caused by csf virus  is highly contagious andcauses significant economic losses in the pig industry throughout the world.
we demonstrated the anti-csfv activity of ptd-pomx <dig> in vitro and in vivo.
furthermore, in vivo antiviral activity of ptd-pomx <dig> was assessed by means of rectal temperature, clinical score, pathological lesion, white blood cell count, viral load, etc.
the results have shown that treatment with ptd-pomx <dig> alleviated symptoms and viral load in infected pigs.
the results support our previous in vitro studies and suggest that ptd-pomx <dig> could be promising in reducing the clinical signs caused by csfv.
previously we demonstrated that porcine mx <dig> , when fused to hiv tat protein transduction domain , inhibits csfv propagation in pk- <dig> cells, but it is unknown whether ptd-pomx <dig> exhibits antiviral activity in other porcine lines and it is efficacious for controlling csfv infection in pigs in china.
viral titers and qrt-pcr data showed that ptd-pomx <dig> inhibited csfv replication in both cell lines, showing significant antiviral activity after infection.

ptd-pomx <dig> entered both cell lines within  <dig> h and maintained for  <dig> h, but did not affect csfv binding and uptake.
