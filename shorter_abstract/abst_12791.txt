compound profiling and drug screening generates large amounts of data and is generally based on microplate assays.
being able to reuse already constructed plates and plate layouts by starting out from an earlier step in the plate layout design process saves time and cuts down on error sources.
brunn is capable of handling the data from microplate assays.
a bioclipse plugin consisting of a client part and a relational database was constructed.
the system contains a data validation step, where outliers can be removed, and finally a plate report with all relevant calculated data, including dose-response curves.
it can create dose-response curves and calculate ic <dig> values.
