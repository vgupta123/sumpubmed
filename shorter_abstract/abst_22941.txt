we developed an open source variant filtering pipeline, targeted sequencing support vector machine , that uses a support vector machine  and a new score the normalized allele dosage test to identify high quality variants from microfluidic pcr data.

to reduce false positive variant calls from these experiments, previous studies have used threshold-based filtering of alternative allele depth ratio and manual inspection of the alignments.
we compared the accuracy of tarsvm versus existing variant quality filtering strategies on two cohorts , and validated our method on a third cohort .
our approach is less labor intensive than existing approaches, and is available as an open source pipeline for read trimming, aligning, variant calling, and variant quality filtering on github at https://github.com/christopher-gillies/targetspecificgatksequencingpipeline.
finally, our method had a false discovery rate of 5 % for the validation cohort.
this results in higher confidence downstream analyses, and ultimately reduces the costs sanger validation.
tarsvm improves on previous approaches by synthesizing variant features from the genome analysis toolkit and allele dosage information.
however even after manual inspection and filtering, many variants fail to be validated via sanger sequencing.
one method to achieve this pairs microfluidic pcr with next generation sequencing.
to improve the accuracy of variant calling from these experiments, we are challenged to design a variant filtering strategy that sufficiently models microfluidic pcr-specific issues.
tarsvm increases the accuracy of variant calling when using microfluidic pcr based targeted sequencing approaches.
