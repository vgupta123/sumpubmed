their success in delimiting species boundaries depends on the existence of a clear-cut difference between inter- and intraspecific variability.
we tested the ability of these regions to discriminate among closely related species in seven genera of flowering plants with different generation times .
evolutionary histories are the main factor influencing dna barcoding success in the studied genera.
to ensure a maximum coverage of intraspecific diversity, and therefore to better evaluate the resolution power of each barcode, we applied a population genetics approach by sampling three to  <dig> individuals per species over a wide geographical range.
for salix, adenostyles, and gentiana, the best results were obtained with the combination of matk, rpob, and trnh-psba.
our results strongly suggest that adding trnh-psba to the two obligate dna barcodes proposed by the cbol plant-working group  should be mandatory for closely related species.
all possible combinations between loci were analysed, which showed that using more than one locus does not always improve the resolution power.
four plastid regions, rpob, rpoc <dig>  matk, and trnh-psba, have been recommended as dna barcodes for plants.
in our sampling, generation time had no influence on dna barcoding success, as the best and worst identification successes were found for the two tree genera .
