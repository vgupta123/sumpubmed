using gene ontology  function annotation as a benchmark, we demonstrated that the prediction by combining microarray and e-map data is generally >50% more accurate in identifying co-functional gene pairs than the prediction using either data source alone.
this integrative method significantly improves the reliability of identifying co-functional gene pairs.
by combining e-map data with co-expression data, we first predicted a potential cell cycle related gene set.
we also used transcription factor â€“dna binding data  and protein phosphorylation data to construct a local cell cycle regulation network based on potential cell cycle related gene set we predicted.
finally, based on the e-map screening with  <dig> cell cycle genes crossing  <dig> library strains, we predicted four unknown genes  as potential cell cycle genes, and analyzed them in detail.
by integrating e-map and dna microarray data, potential cell cycle-related genes were detected in budding yeast.
in addition, the reconstructed network sheds light on both the function of known and predicted genes in the cell cycle process.
as such, derived interaction networks can be utilized to discover novel genes involved in specific biological processes.
finally, our strategy can be applied to other biological processes and species, given the availability of relevant data.
