the craniometry of subspecies, or closely related species, of mice provide a good systemic model to study the relationship between genetic variance and cranial shape evolution.
we performed linear measurements and geometric morphometrics.
geometric morphometrics revealed that the cranial characteristics of each strains were clearly distinguishable.
geometric morphometrics proved to be useful for identifying and classifying variations in form, and it revealed that m. spretus has a slender cranium when compared with our other strains.
for this reason, we performed quantitative analysis of cranial shape morphology between several mouse strains.
this article reports on a craniometric assay of seven mouse strains: four inbred strains  from mus musculus domesticus ; one closed colony strain  from m. m. domesticus; one inbred strain  from mus musculus molossinus; and, mus spretus as a strain from a species other than m. m. domesticus.
the mean cranial shape of c3h or cba was more similar to msm/ms, which is derived from m. m. molossinus, than to either c57bl/6j, balb, or icr which are derived from m. m. domesticus.
the lack of a quantified framework for comparing and analyzing mouse cranial shape has been a problem.
future work in this field will aid in elucidating the mechanism of whole cranial shape regulation.
we obtained mean scores for each species using the tpsrelw program and plotted them.
