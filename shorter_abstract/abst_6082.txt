the high level of haplotype variation among starch biosynthesis/degradation genes in the progenitors of cultivated barley shows that domestication and breeding have greatly eroded their allelic diversity in current elite cultivars.
this study is based on the characterization of genetic variation in barley, with a view to enhancing its response to terminal drought stress.
haplotypes within a set of  <dig> starch biosynthesis/degradation genes were defined, and a particularly high level of haplotype variation was uncovered in the genes encoding sucrose synthase  and starch synthase.
the ability of a panel of  <dig> barley accessions to maintain grain starch content under terminal drought conditions was explored.
prospective association analysis based on core drought-regulated genes may simplify the process of identifying favourable alleles, and help to understand the genetic basis of the response to terminal drought.
the increasingly narrow genetic background characteristic of modern crop germplasm presents a challenge for the breeding of cultivars that require adaptation to the anticipated change in climate.
the linkage/expression map is an informative resource in the context of characterizing the response of barley to drought stress.
