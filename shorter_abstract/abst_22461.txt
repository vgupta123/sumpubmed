ducks play an important role in the persistence and genetic recombination of ai viruses.
five cloacal swabs and one oropharyngeal swab were positive for m gene of type a influenza virus by real time rt-pcr , but all of them were negative for h <dig> influenza virus.
this paper presents the results of serological and virological monitoring of ai in domestic ducks in  <dig> in the north-east region of bangladesh.
wild waterfowl are considered as the natural reservoir for avian influenza  viruses.
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> serum samples and  <dig> and  <dig> pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from domestic ducks of mymensingh and sylhet division, respectively, were analysed.
on sequencing and phylogenetic analysis the ha and na genes were found to be of eurasian avian lineage.
low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were detected from apparently healthy domestic ducks.
a small proportion of domestic ducks were found seropositive to h <dig> ai virus.
antibodies to type a influenza virus were detected by blocking elisa in  <dig>  and  <dig> % serum samples of mymensingh and sylhet division, respectively.

on haemagglutination-inhibition  test  <dig> % of elisa positive serum samples were found to be seropositive to h <dig> avian influenza virus.
three of the six viruses were successfully characterized as h1n <dig>  h2n <dig> and h7n <dig> subtype of ai virus, the other three remained uncharacterized.
