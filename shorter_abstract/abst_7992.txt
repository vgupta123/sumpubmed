further, our analysis suggests that the majority of halocynthia mirnas are specific to ascidian or tunicates, with only a small number of widely conserved mirnas.
recently, an annotated draft genome sequence for a distantly related ascidian, halocynthia roretzi, has become available, but mirnas in h. roretzi have not been previously studied.
we report the prediction of  <dig> candidate h. roretzi mirnas, obtained through three complementary methods.
the majority of predicted h. roretzi mirnas appear specific to ascidians or tunicates, and only  <dig> candidates, belonging to  <dig> families, are widely conserved across metazoans.
our study presents a comprehensive identification of candidate h. roretzi mirnas.
this result is consistent with the general notion that animal mirnas are less conserved between taxa than plant ones.
