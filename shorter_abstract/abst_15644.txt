then, the cpg methylation status around the lrrc <dig> promoter region in glioma cell lines and primary gliomas was examined by methylation-specific pcr and bisulfite dna sequencing.
methylation-mediated inactivation of lrrc <dig> is a frequent and glioma-specific event, and it may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis or prognosis, or serve as a therapeutic target.
in order to demonstrate a functional association between lrrc <dig> promoter methylation and its gene inactivation, we performed dna demethylation analysis with two human glioma cell lines using methylation-specific pcr and rt-pcr.
lrrc <dig> inactivation is commonly found in glioma cell lines and primary glioma biopsies.
furthermore, lrrc <dig> promoter methylation was observed by methylation-specific pcr in two glioma cell lines and all  <dig> primary glioma specimens, but not in normal brain tissue.
bisulfite dna sequencing showed that most of the cpg sites were located around the lrrc <dig> promoter methylated in glioma cells and tissues, but not in normal brain tissue.
in a previous study, we did not find any genetic alteration in lrrc <dig> in primary glioma, which led us to explore an alternative mechanism underlying this phenomenon.
it is not only a brain-specific gene but also a novel candidate for tumor suppression.
leucine-rich repeat c <dig> protein  is a new member of the leucine-rich repeat  superfamily.
the sequence spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the translation start site was identified as the lrrc <dig> promoter; this sequence is a tata- and caat- less, high gc content region.
it was found that lrrc <dig> promoter activity is strongly suppressed after treatment with sssi methylase in vitro.
in the present paper, we cloned the lrrc <dig> promoter with characteristics of a cpg island by luciferase reporter assay.
