caseins, the main milk proteins, aggregate in the secretory pathway of mammary epithelial cells into large supramolecular structures, casein micelles.
these experiments reveal for the first time the existence of a membrane-associated form of αs1-casein in the endoplasmic reticulum and in more distal compartments of the secretory pathway of mammary epithelial cells.
our data suggest that αs1-casein, which is required for efficient export of the other caseins from the endoplasmic reticulum, plays a key role in early steps of casein micelle biogenesis and casein transport in the secretory pathway.
furthermore, a substantial amount of αs1-casein remained associated with microsomal or post-er membranes after saponin permeabilisation in non-conservative conditions or carbonate extraction at ph <dig>  all in the presence of dtt.
saponin permeabilisation of microsomal membranes in physico-chemical conditions believed to conserve casein interactions demonstrated that rat immature β-casein is weakly aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum.
in this study, we investigate primary steps of casein micelle formation in rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles prepared from rat or goat mammary tissues.
the role of individual caseins in this process and the mesostructure of the casein micelle are poorly known.
in striking contrast, a large proportion of immature αs1-casein was recovered in permeabilised microsomes when incubated in conservative conditions.
the majority of both αs1- and β-casein which are cysteine-containing casein was dimeric in the endoplasmic reticulum.
