gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis were used to identify overrepresented signaling pathways in pkd1-/- kidneys.
we examined the molecular pathways that modulate renal cyst formation and growth in the pkd1-/- model by performing global gene-expression profiling in embryonic kidneys at days  <dig>  and  <dig> .
we have described global transcriptional reprogramming during the progression of pkd in the pkd1-/- model.
mirnas are small, regulatory non-coding rnas, implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes.
we found dysregulation of developmental, metabolic, and signaling pathways  in pkd1-/- kidneys.
our results suggest that several mirnas may be involved in regulating signaling pathways in adpkd.
using a comparative transcriptomics approach, we determined similarities and differences with human adpkd: ~50% overlap at the pathway level among the mis-regulated pathways was observed.
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is characterized by cyst formation throughout the kidney parenchyma.
genome wide transcriptome reprogramming and the possible roles of micro-rnas  that affect the initiation and progression of cyst formation in the pkd1-/- have yet to be studied.
we propose a model for the cascade of signaling events involved in cyst formation and growth.
it is caused by mutations in either of two genes, pkd <dig> and pkd <dig>  mice that lack functional pkd <dig> , develop rapidly progressive cystic disease during embryogenesis, and serve as a model to study human adpkd.
