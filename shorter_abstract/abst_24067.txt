as many gwas datasets based on both family and case-control designs are available, a flexible and efficient tool such as capl will be very helpful to combine the datasets to greatly increase statistical power and finish the analysis in a reasonable time frame.
we used a hybrid of open message passing interface  and posix threads to parallelize capl, which enable the program to operate in a cluster environment.
we recently proposed the combined apl  method, which can use family and case-control datasets and can account for population stratification in the data.
we used simulations to demonstrate that the parallel implementation of capl can analyze a large gwas dataset in a reasonable time frame when a parallel computing resource is available.
