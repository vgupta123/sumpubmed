until now, only a few small-molecule compounds that inhibit nuclear entry of viral dna have been documented.
analyses of the viral dna synthesis indicated that sjp-l- <dig> specifically blocks the entry of the hiv- <dig> pre-integration complex  into the nucleus.
sjp-l- <dig> displayed relatively low cytotoxicity  and high antiviral activity against a variety of hiv strains ) of hiv- <dig> laboratory-adapted strains ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml; ec50s of primary isolates ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml).
further results implicated that sjp-l- <dig> inhibits the disassembly of hiv- <dig> particulate capsid in the cytoplasm of the infected cells.
sjp-l- <dig> is a novel small-molecule compound that inhibits hiv- <dig> nuclear entry by blocking the disassembly of the viral core.

small-molecule compounds that inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infection can be used not only as drug candidates, but also as reagents to dissect the life cycle of the virus.
sjp-l- <dig> is a nitrogen-containing, biphenyl compound whose synthesis was based on the dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan gomisin m <dig>  an anti-hiv bioactive compound isolated from schisandra micrantha a. c. smith.
