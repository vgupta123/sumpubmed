although the pac sequences of Φ <dig> show no similarity to those of Φ <dig>  segment m of Φ <dig> could be acquired by Φ <dig> resulting in a change of host specificity.
phage were constructed with one, two or three genomic segments.
the base sequences for many of the genes and for the segment termini were similar but not identical to those of bacteriophage Φ <dig>  however, the host specificity was for the type iv pili of pseudomonas syringae hb10y rather than for the rough lps to which Φ <dig> attaches.
reverse genetics techniques enabled the production of infectious phage from cdna copies of the genome.
