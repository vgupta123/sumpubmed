initially, to establish the principle, we identified specific protein peaks from  <dig>  laser-microdissected cells, combining column chromatography, sds-page, tryptic digestion, seldi technology and tandem ms/ms using a proteinchip® tandem ms interface.
laser-microdissection may thus be combined with seldi-tof ms for generation of protein marker profiles in a cell-type- or compartment-specific manner in complex tissues, linked with mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing by tandem ms/ms for definite characterization.
hemalaun stained mouse lung sections were used to isolate 500– <dig>  cells, enough material for complex protein profiles by seldi-tof ms , employing different chromatographic proteinchip® arrays.
therefore, we first defined target proteins in a few microdissected cells, then recovered in whole tissue section homogenates from the same lung and applied to these analytical techniques.
laser microdissection allows precise isolation of specific cell types and compartments from complex tissues.
