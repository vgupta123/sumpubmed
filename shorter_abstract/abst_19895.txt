furthermore, ten bac clones harbouring agxt, ghr, fshr, irbp, sox <dig>  ttr, bdnf, nt- <dig>  lh and zfx <dig> were mapped to  <dig> pairs of giant panda chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
the giant panda, one of the most primitive carnivores, is an endangered animal.
in order to promote research on this genome, a bacterial artificial chromosome  library of the giant panda was constructed in this study.
this bac library contains  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb, which represents approximately seven equivalents of the giant panda haploid genome.
this is the first large-insert genomic dna library for the giant panda, and will contribute to understanding this endangered species in the areas of genome sequencing, physical mapping, gene cloning and comparative genomic studies.
we also identified the physical locations of ten genes on their relative chromosomes by fish, providing a preliminary framework for further development of a high resolution cytogenetic map of the giant panda.
although it has been the subject of many interesting studies during recent years, little is known about its genome.
