shared evolutionary histories appear to be modified by lineage-specific expansions or deletions.
genes encoding glycoside hydrolases are found in a wide range of organisms, from archea to animals, and are relatively abundant in plant genomes.
insights gained from brachypodium will inform translational research studies, with applications for the improvement of cereal crops and bioenergy grasses.
glycoside hydrolases cleave the bond between a carbohydrate and another carbohydrate, a protein, lipid or other moiety.
to improve our understanding of glycoside hydrolases in plants generally and in grasses specifically, we annotated the glycoside hydrolase genes in the grasses brachypodium distachyon  and sorghum bicolor .
we then compared the glycoside hydrolases across species, at the levels of the whole genome and individual glycoside hydrolase families.
this work provides the foundation for further comparative and functional analyses of plant glycoside hydrolases.
defining the brachypodium glycoside hydrolases sets the stage for brachypodium to be a grass model for investigations of these enzymes and their diverse roles in planta.
within gh families, the brachypodium and sorghum proteins generally cluster with those from other monocots.
