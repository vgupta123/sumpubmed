the complete genome sequences for eight strains of this family have been resolved so far, all of which were determined depending on clone-based sequencing.
acholeplasma oculi belongs to the acholeplasmataceae family, comprising the genera acholeplasma and ‘candidatus phytoplasma’.
the a. oculi strain 19l chromosome was sequenced using two independent approaches.
comparative genome analyses revealed that the process of losing particular basic genetic features during genome reduction occurs in both genera, as indicated for several phytoplasma strains and at least a. oculi.
the loss of the f1fo-type na+ atpase system may separate acholeplasmataceae from other mollicutes, while the loss of those genes encoding the chaperone groel/es is not a rare exception in this bacterial class.
our genome analysis revealed  <dig>  protein-coding genes and highlighted the absence of the f1fo-type na+ atpase system and groel/es chaperone.
the first approach comprised sequencing by synthesis  in combination with sanger sequencing, while single molecule real time sequencing  was used in the second.
sequencing by synthesis resulted in six large genome fragments, while the single molecule real time sequencing approach yielded one circular chromosome sequence.
the application of two state-of-the-art sequencing technologies highlights the potential of single molecule real time sequencing for complete genome determination.
