some features did not change at all despite 10-fold differences in other integrated features.
the population from carrie bow cay, belize  was examined to determine the phenotypic integration of modular features such as branch thickness, polyp aperture, inter-polyp distance, internode length and branch length.
this study examined the patterns of morphological integration at the intraspecific level.
to characterize the genotype/environment relationship and phenotypic plasticity in p. bipinnata, two microsatellite loci, mitochondrial  and nuclear  dna sequences, and  dgge banding patterns were initially compared among the populations present in the coral reefs of belize , panama , colombia  and the bahamas .
its1â€“ <dig> s-its <dig> phylogenetic analysis afforded evidence for considering the species p. kallos  as the shallow-most morphotype of p. bipinnata from exposed environments.
thus, evolutionary change in polyp form or size  does not imply a change in colony form .
comparisons among diverse caribbean gorgonian corals suggest decoupling of evolution at the polyp vs. branch/internode levels.
consequently, module integration in gorgonian corals can be shifted, switched or canalized along lineages.
modular marine organisms such as corals are variations on a single theme: their modules can couple or decouple, allowing them to adapt to all marine benthic environments.
third-order partial correlation coefficients suggested significant integration between polypar and colonial traits.
pseudopterogorgia bipinnata   is a caribbean shallow water gorgonian that can colonize most reef habitats  and shows great morphological variation.
more importantly, some colonial features showed dependence on modular features.
