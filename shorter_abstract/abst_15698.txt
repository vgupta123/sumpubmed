kaempferol is the unique flavonol present in c. sativus stigmas and the levels of its glucosides changed during stigma development, and these changes, are correlated with the expression levels of csgt <dig> during these developmental stages.
using degenerate primers designed to match the plant secondary product glucosyltransferase  box we cloned a full length cdna encoding csgt <dig> from c. sativus stigmas.
to date there are no reports of functionally characterized flavonoid glucosyltransferases in c. sativus, despite the importance of these compounds as antioxidant agents.
moreover, their bitter taste makes them excellent candidates for consideration as potential organoleptic agents of saffron spice, the dry stigmas of c. sativus.
findings presented here suggest that csgt <dig> is an active enzyme that plays a role in the formation of flavonoid glucosides in c. sativus.
flavonol glucosides constitute the second group of secondary metabolites that accumulate in crocus sativus stigmas.
