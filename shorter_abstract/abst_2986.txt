taken together, these results promote the use of dppsc as a new pluripotent-like cell model to evaluate the biocompatibility and the differentiation capacity of biomaterials used in bone regeneration.
the capacity of dppsc to differentiate into osteogenic lineage was compared with human sarcoma osteogenic cell line .
in this study we aim to describe the use of dppsc to test biomaterials, since we believe that the biomaterial cues will be more critical in order to enhance the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.
the analyses were performed by flow cytometry, alkaline phosphatase and mineralization stains, rt-pcr, immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, western blot and enzymatic activity.
nevertheless, their osteogenic differentiation showed similar trend among both cell types.
interestingly, only dppsc maintained a normal chromosomal dosage before and after differentiation on 2d monolayer and on biomaterials.
however, their uncontrolled proliferation rate, phenotypic changes or aberrations in mitotic processes limits their use in long-term investigations.

recently, we described a new pluripotent-like subpopulation of dental pulp stem cells derived from the third molars  that shows genetic stability and shares some pluripotent characteristics with embryonic stem cells.
moreover, the genetic stability was evaluated and compared before and after differentiation by short-comparative genomic hybridization .
in order to evaluate their potential use for clinical applications, these need to be tested and evaluated in vitro with cell culture models.
