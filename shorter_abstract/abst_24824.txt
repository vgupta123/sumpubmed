to date, few programs exist for regional analysis of enriched or whole-genome bisulfate conversion sequencing data, even though such data are increasingly common.
dna methylation profiling reveals important differentially methylated regions  of the genome that are altered during development or that are perturbed by disease.
our algorithm takes the spatial distribution of cpgs into account for the enrichment assay, allowing for optimization of the definition of empirical regions for differential methylation.
here we show that our bimodal distribution model and weighted cost function for optimized regional methylation analysis provides accurate boundaries of regions harboring significant epigenetic modifications.
