go analysis showed that the predominant classes in biological process category include metabolic process followed by cellular process and primary metabolic process.
therefore, deep transcriptome sequencing of crocus stigma and rest of the flower tissue was done to identify the genes and transcriptional regulators involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds.
transcriptome of stigma and rest of the flower tissue was sequenced using illumina genome analyzer iix platform which generated  <dig> , <dig> flower and  <dig> , <dig> stigma reads.
<dig> transcripts showed similarity to transcription factors representing  <dig> families out of which myb family was most abundant.
the database would also help in investigating many questions related to saffron biology including flower development.
differential expression analysis indicated that key carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway genes including phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  <dig> are enriched in stigma thereby providing molecular proof for stigma to be the site of apocarotenoid biosynthesis.
kegg mapping analysis indicated that pathways involved in ribosome, carbon and starch and sucrose metabolism were highly represented.
inspite of their importance, the biosynthetic pathway of crocus apocarotenoids is not fully elucidated.
many genes involved in carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway were identified for the first time in this study which includes zeta-carotene isomerase and desaturase, carotenoid isomerase and lycopene epsilon-cyclase.
