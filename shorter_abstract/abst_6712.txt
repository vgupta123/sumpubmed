berry skins of red-  and white-skinned  wine grapes were harvested near optimum maturity  from the same experimental vineyard.
principal components analysis of each of five omic technologies showed similar results across cultivars in all omic datasets.
the cultivars were exposed to a mild, seasonal water-deficit treatment from fruit set until harvest in  <dig>  identical sample aliquots were analyzed for transcripts by grapevine whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and rnaseq technologies, proteins by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
there was high concordance between transcriptomic technologies, but generally protein abundance did not correlate well with transcript abundance.
integration of metabolite with protein and transcript data produced an expected model of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which distinguished red from white grapes, yet provided detail of individual cultivar differences.
comparison of the processed data of genes mapped in rnaseq and microarray data revealed a strong pearson’s correlation .
the overall concordance of protein with transcript data was low with a pearson’s correlation of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the rnaseq and microarray data, respectively.
omic analyses  are powerful tools for assessing biochemical differences in biological systems.
the mild water deficit treatment did not significantly alter the abundance of proteins or metabolites measured in the five cultivars, but did have a small effect on gene expression.
