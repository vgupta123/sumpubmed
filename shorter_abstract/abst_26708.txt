both mappability and control genome normalization reduce the total number and length of copy number regions.
we use multiple configurations corresponding to different read-count normalization methodologies in freec, and statistically characterize the concordance of the cnv calls between freec configurations and the analogous output from cnv-seq.
the most critical impact of using mappability as a normalization factor is substantial reduction of deletion cnv calls.
choice of read-count normalization methodology has a substantial effect on cnv calls and the use of genomic mappability or an appropriately chosen control genome can optimize the output of cnv analysis.
whole genome sequencing enables a high resolution view of the human genome and provides unique insights into genome structure at an unprecedented scale.
the gc content normalization methodology generates the highest number of altered copy number regions.
the normalization methodologies evaluated in freec are: gc content, mappability and control genome.
mappability normalization yields jaccard indices in the  <dig>  -  <dig>  range, whereas using a control genome normalization yields jaccard index values around  <dig>  with normalization based on gc content.
the output of another method based on control genome normalization, cnv-seq, resulted in comparable cnv call profiles, and substantial agreement in variable gene and cnv region calls.
we further stratify the concordance analysis within genic, non-genic, and a collection of validated variant regions.

we evaluate in detail the effect of normalization methodologies in two cnv algorithms freec and cnv-seq using whole genome sequencing data from  <dig> individuals spanning four populations.
