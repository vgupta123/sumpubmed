in the present study, the expression profile of hrhp/hrhp skin was investigated using microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression was affected by the overexpression of hr.
recently, we reported a new hr mutant mouse called 'hairpoor' .
from  <dig>  mouse probes, differential expressions in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> genes  in skin from hrhp/hrhp mice were discovered and compared with skin from wild-type mice.
this confers the overexpression of hr and hrhp is an animal model of marie unna hereditary hypotrichosis in humans.
among the  <dig> genes with a >  <dig> -fold increase in expression, further analysis showed that the expression of eight genes known to have a close relationship with hair follicle development, ascertained by conducting real-time pcr on skin rna produced during hair follicle morphogenesis , indicated that four genes, wif <dig>  casp <dig>  krt <dig>  and sfrp <dig>  showed a consistent expression pattern with respect to hr overexpression in vivo.
the transcriptional cofactor, hairless , acts as one of the key regulators of hair follicle cycling; the loss of function mutations is the cause of the expression of the hairless phenotype in humans and mice.
