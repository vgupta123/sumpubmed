however, a serotype- and even strain-dependent contribution on survival in whole human blood and biofilm formation was noted, respectively.
these data provide new information on the action of the covs sensor kinase and revealed that its activity on capsule expression and keratinocyte adherence is uniform across serotypes, whereas the influence on biofilm formation and blood survival is serotype or even strain dependent.
covs mutation uniformly repressed capsule expression and hampered keratinocyte adherence in all tested serotypes.
this adds the covrs system to a growing list of serotype-specific acting regulatory loci in s. pyogenes.
