in this study, we characterized the interaction of g. cichoracearum with te- <dig> plants to investigate the basis of this plant resistance.
a suitable system to study host compatibility factors is the interaction between arabidopsis thaliana and the powdery mildew  golovinomyces cichoracearum.
te- <dig> plants allowed germination of conidia and development of functional haustoria, but could not support the formation of mature conidiophores.
using a suppressive subtractive hybridization technique, we identified plant genes showing differential expression between resistant te- <dig> and susceptible col- <dig> plants at the fungal pre-conidiation stage.
