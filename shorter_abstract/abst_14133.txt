we find a clear correspondence between incidence of alternative splicing and intron number per gene both within and between genomes.
along with previous studies indicating intron-rich genes with weak intron boundary consensus and complex spliceosomes in ancestral organisms, our results suggest that at least a simple form of alternative splicing may already have been present in the unicellular ancestor of plants, fungi and animals.
to better understand the origin and evolution of alternative splicing and its usage in diverse organisms, we studied alternative splicing in  <dig> eukaryotic species, comparing rates of alternative splicing across genes of different functional classes, cellular locations, intron/exon structures and evolutionary origins.
ancient genes  show high levels of alternative splicing.
however, whether widespread alternative splicing has evolved independently in the different eukaryotic groups or was inherited from their last common ancestor, and may therefore predate multicellularity, is still unknown.
genes with products expressed in the nucleus or plasma membrane are generally more alternatively spliced while those expressed in extracellular location show less alternative splicing.
