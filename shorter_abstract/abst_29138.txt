we hypothesize that the hmms in a connected component belong to the same family or superfamily more often than expected under a random network connection model.
moreover, the hmm network possesses features distinctly different from the previously documented biological networks, exemplified by the exceptionally high clustering coefficient and the large number of connected components.
the structural classification of proteins  database uses a large number of hidden markov models  to represent families and superfamilies composed of proteins that presumably share the same evolutionary origin.
results show a pattern consistent with this working hypothesis.
