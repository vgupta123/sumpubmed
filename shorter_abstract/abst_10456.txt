to identify genes involved in the processes of leaf or cotyledon development and senescence in soybean, we used rna-seq to profile multiple stages of cotyledon and leaf tissues.
during the seed filling period, developing seeds rely on the transport of nutrients from the trifoliate leaves.
immediately following germination, the developing soybean seedling relies on the nutrient reserves stored in the cotyledons to sustain heterotrophic growth.
these results help validate functional annotation for soybean genes and promoters.
the importance of the wrky, nac, and gras family transcription factors as major regulators of plant senescence is confirmed for both soybean leaf and cotyledon tissues.
the process of leaf and cotyledon development can be divided into distinct stages characterized by the expression of specific gene sets.
differentially expressed genes between stages of leaf or cotyledon development were determined, major patterns of gene expression were defined, and shared genes were identified.
over  <dig>  transcripts were expressed during the course of leaf and cotyledon development.
analysis of the enrichment of biological functions within genes sharing common expression profiles highlights the main processes occurring within these defined temporal windows of leaf and cotyledon development.
over  <dig>  genes were identified with predicted regulatory functions that may have a role in control of leaf or cotyledon senescence.
