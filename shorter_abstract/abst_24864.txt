one strategy of reducing the allergenicity of peanuts is to alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins through mutagenesis.
targeting induced local lesions in genomes , a reverse-genetics approach, was used to identify mutations affecting seed traits in peanut.
tilling also was used to identify mutations in fatty acid desaturase ahfad <dig> , a gene which controls the ratio of oleic to linoleic acid in the seed.
the same situation has been shown for major allergen ara h  <dig>  due to the challenge of discriminating between homeologous genes in allotetraploid peanut, nested pcr was employed, in which both gene copies were amplified using unlabeled primers.
tilling in peanut can be extended to virtually any gene, and could be used to modify other traits such as nutritional properties of the seed, as shown in this study.
using ethyl methanesulfonate  as a mutagen, a mutation frequency of  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb  was observed.
allergic reactions to peanuts  can cause severe symptoms and in some cases can be fatal, but avoidance is difficult due to the prevalence of peanut-derived products in processed foods.
