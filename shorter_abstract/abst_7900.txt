in this study, the polyadenylated transcripts from the male and female s. japonicum were sequenced using a high-throughput rna-seq technique.
by using rna-seq technology, we obtained the global transcriptomes of male and female s. japonicum.
further, we identified four types of post-transcriptional processing, or alternative splicing, in both female and male worms of s. japonicum: exon skipping, intron retention, and alternative donor and acceptor sites.
the findings of a substantial level of alternative splicing events dynamically occurring in s. japonicum parasitization of mammalian hosts suggest complicated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms employed by the parasite.
these results further provide a comprehensive view of the global transcriptome of s. japonicum.
schistosoma japonicum is a pathogen of the phylum platyhelminthes that causes zoonotic schistosomiasis in china and southeast asian countries where a lack of efficient measures has hampered disease control.
the numbers of protein-coding sequences identified in the transcriptomes of the female and male s. japonicum were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which is more than predicted from the annotated genome sequence.
unlike mammalian organisms, in s. japonicum, the alternative donor and acceptor sites were more common than the other two types of post-transcriptional processing.
in total, respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  alternative splicing events were predicted in the transcriptomes of female and male s. japonicum.
these data should not only significantly improve the re-annotation of the genome sequences but also should provide new information about the biology of the parasite.
bioinformatic and experimental analyses focused on post-transcriptional rna processing, which revealed extensive alternative splicing events in the adult stage of the parasite.
