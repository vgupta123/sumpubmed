protein remote homology detection is a central problem in computational biology.
when tested on two scop benchmarks, the superfamily and fold recognition problems, the gpkernel gives significantly better results compared to related methods of remote homology detection.
one successful approach is to base a kernel on shared occurrences of discrete sequence motifs.
we introduce the gpkernel, which is a motif kernel based on discrete sequence motifs where the motifs are evolved using genetic programming.
this rich set of motifs give a better description of the similarities and differences between different folds than do previous motif-based methods.
all proteins can be grouped according to evolutionary relations and structure, and the method uses this inherent structure to create groups of motifs that discriminate between different families of evolutionary origin.
the gpkernel gives particularly good results on the more difficult fold recognition problem compared to the other methods.
still, many protein sequences fail to be classified correctly for a lack of a suitable set of motifs for these sequences.
