alternative assemblies of the variable region demonstrate intra-strain heterogeneity of the maxicircle population.
the non-coding components have strain-specific repetitive regions and a variable region that is unique for each strain with the exception of a conserved sequence element that may serve as an origin of replication, but shows no sequence identity with l. tarentolae or t. brucei.
the mitochondrial dna of kinetoplastid flagellates is distinctive in the eukaryotic world due to its massive size, complex form and large sequence content.
esmeraldo shows additional insertions and deletions outside of areas edited in other species in nd <dig>  murf <dig>  and murf <dig>  while cl brener has a distinct insertion in murf <dig>
the cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles represent two of three previously defined maxicircle clades and promise utility as taxonomic markers.
the extent of mrna editing required for particular genes approximates that seen in t. brucei.
we present the complete sequence and annotation of the trypanosoma cruzi maxicircles for the cl brener and esmeraldo strains.
gene order is syntenic with trypanosoma brucei and leishmania tarentolae maxicircles.
