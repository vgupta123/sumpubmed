genome structure and content followed the ancestral angiosperm pattern and were highly conserved in the proteales, whilst size differences were largely explained by the relative contraction of the single copy regions and expansion of the inverted repeats in macadamia.
phylogenetic analyses based on 83-gene and inverted repeat region alignments, the largest sequence-rich datasets to include the basal eudicot family proteaceae, provide strong support for a proteales clade that includes macadamia, platanus and nelumbo.
genomic resources for the family are limited, and until now it is one of the few early-diverging 'basal eudicot' lineages not represented in chloroplast phylogenomic analyses.
the complete genome is  <dig> bp in length and was assembled at deep coverage .
sequence data from the chloroplast genome have played a central role in elucidating the evolutionary history of flowering plants, angiospermae.
it provides a high-quality reference genome for future evolutionary studies and will be of benefit for taxon-rich phylogenomic analyses aimed at resolving relationships among early-diverging angiosperms, and more broadly across the plant tree of life.
the macadamia chloroplast genome presented here is the first in the proteaceae, and confirms the placement of this family with the morphologically divergent plantanaceae  and nelumbonaceae  in the basal eudicot order proteales.
in the past decade, the number of complete chloroplast genomes has burgeoned, leading to well-supported angiosperm phylogenies.
the chloroplast genome of the australian nut crop tree macadamia integrifolia was assembled de novo from illumina paired-end sequence reads.
