they were subjected to comprehensive medical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests, followed by comparison of mirna levels found in peripheral blood serum.
a systems level analysis revealed a remarkable degree of convergence in the top changes seen in all of these data sets, specifically identifying cell death, cell proliferation and cell cycle processes as most consistently affected.
there is currently a lack of reliable, minimally invasive biomarkers that could predict the extent of alcoholism-induced cns damage.
in this study, we performed a global analysis of extracellular mirnas to identify robust biomarkers of early cns damage in humans diagnosed with dsm-iv auds.
our results identified several mirnas with significant and reproducible expression changes in aud subjects versus controls.
collectively, our results suggest that serum mirna expression changes can directly relate to alterations in cns structure and function, and may do so through effects on highly specific cellular pathways.
cross-species validation of mirna expression was performed using two different in vivo rat drinking models and two different in vitro mouse neural stem cell exposure models.
extracellular micrornas  can be informative molecular indicators of changes in neuronal gene expression.
developing such biomarkers may prove useful in reducing the prevalence of alcohol use disorders .

employing a conservative strategy to identify candidate biomarkers, mirnas were quantified using two independent high-throughput methods: microarray and next-generation rna-sequencing.
