global transcriptome profiles of tomato leaf responses to exogenous aba were generated using illumina rna-sequencing.
in both the aba treatment and control samples,  <dig>  transcripts were available to analyze their expressions, of which  <dig>   responded to exogenous aba.
exogenous aba can influence the aba signaling pathway with pyr/pyl/rcars-pp2cs-snrk2s as the center.
a large number of genes related to various transcription factors, heat shock proteins, pathogen resistance, and the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling pathways were up-regulated by exogenous aba.

however, in defense responses to pathogens, mounting evidence suggests that aba plays variable roles.
the results indicated that aba has the potential to improve pathogen-resistance and abiotic stress tolerance in tomato.
additionally,  <dig>  transcripts were categorized into  <dig> functional groups based on gene ontology terms, and  <dig>  were assigned to  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways.
little information exists about genome-wide gene expression in aba responses in tomato , a model fruit crop plant.
more than  <dig> million base pair reads were mapped onto the tomato reference genome and the expression pattern differences between treated and control leaves were assessed.
