francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, displays subspecies-specific differences in virulence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity.
holarctica isolates have largely been assigned to two phylogenetic groups that have specific geographic distributions.
this restricted geographic distribution, as well as the high levels of genetic diversity within the lineage, is consistent with a relatively older origin and localized differentiation.
holarctica isolates from the country of georgia, and by placing these isolates into a global phylogeographic context.
most isolates from western europe are assigned to the b.br.ftnf002- <dig> group, whereas most isolates from eastern europe are assigned to numerous lineages within the b.br.
in this study, we address this knowledge gap by describing the phylogenetic structure of f. tularensis subsp.
holarctica populations in eastern europe and asia have the potential to yield important new insights into the evolutionary history and phylogeography of this broadly dispersed f. tularensis subspecies.
we identified a new genetic lineage of f. tularensis subsp.
we identified a new lineage of f. tularensis subsp.
this finding suggests that additional phylogenetic studies of f. tularensis subsp.
<dig> group is currently unknown due to a lack of phylogenetic knowledge about populations at the european/asian juncture and in asia.
<dig> group, indicating the georgian lineage diverged before the diversification of the other known b.br.
although two isolates from the georgian lineage were collected nearby in the ukrainian region of crimea, all other global isolates assigned to this lineage were collected in georgia.
this new lineage is genetically and geographically distinct from lineages previously described from the b.br.
importantly, this new lineage is basal within the b.br.
holarctica is widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere.
the eastern geographic extent of the b.br.
