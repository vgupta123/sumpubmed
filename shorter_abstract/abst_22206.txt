their particular spatial and temporal expression patterns along with their unique enzymatic properties imply a high degree of functional specialization.
here we report the purification and biochemical characterization of a novel nodulin from common bean  root nodules.
we demonstrate that pvnod <dig> has limited peptidase activity against casein and is partially inhibited by pepstatin a. a pvnod41-specific antiserum was used to assess the expression pattern of this protein in different plant organs and throughout root nodule development, revealing that pvnod <dig> is found only in bean root nodules and is confined to uninfected cells.
pvnod41's biochemical properties and specific cell-type localization, in uninfected cells of the common bean root nodule, strongly suggest that this aspartyl peptidase has a key role in plant defense during the symbiotic interaction.
nodule development is accompanied by the induction of specific plant genes, referred to as nodulin genes.
the legume-rhizobium symbiosis requires the formation of root nodules, specialized organs where the nitrogen fixation process takes place.
to date, only a small number of atypical aspartyl peptidases have been characterized in plants.
