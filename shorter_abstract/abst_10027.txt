the rt-lamp assay was performed in a water bath for  <dig> minutes at 63Â°c, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light.
this brv specific rt-lamp assay could detect  <dig>  copies of subtype a brv.
the bovine rotavirus-specific rt-lamp assay was highly sensitive and holds promise as a prompt and simple diagnostic method for the detection of group a bovine rotavirus infection in young calves.
a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of brv.

the brv-specific-rt-lamp results were also confirmed by real-time rt-pcr assay.
this viral infection causes acute diarrhea leading to death.
no cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens.
