phylogenetic analyses indicate that dhh has recently evolved and is a mammal-specific hedgehog orthologue.
like other hedgehog proteins, dhh signals through the patched  receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  here we examine the expression and protein distribution of dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> in the developing testes of a marsupial mammal  to determine whether dhh signalling is a conserved factor in gonadal development in all therian mammals.
interestingly we found evidence of this exon in humans and show that its translation would result in a truncated protein with functions similar to ptch <dig>  we also show that dhh expression was not restricted to the testes during gonadal development , but was also expressed in the developing ovary.
together these findings indicate dhh is an essential therian mammal-specific morphogen in gonadal development and gametogenesis.
desert hedgehog  belongs to the hedgehog gene family that act as secreted intercellular signal transducers.
dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> were present in the marsupial genome and highly conserved with their eutherian orthologues.
the marsupial ptch <dig> receptor had an additional exon  not annotated in eutherian ptch <dig> proteins.
