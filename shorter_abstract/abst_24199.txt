previously, one lytic bacteriophage, pa <dig>  from p. acnes has been sequenced and partially characterized.
we recently isolated several inducible phages from p. acnes classified as siphoviruses based on morphology and partial genome sequencing.
in this study we sequenced the inducible p. acnes phages pad <dig> and pas <dig>  isolated from deep infection and from skin, respectively.
construction of a phylogenetic tree based on more than  <dig> phage genomes, suggested that p. acnes phages represent a new lineage of siphoviruses.
the investigated p. acnes siphovirus genomes share a high degree of homology to other p. acnes phages sequenced, but not to genomes of other phages isolated from propionibacteria.
the genomes of pad <dig> and pas <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively, compared with the  <dig>  bp of pa <dig>  the phage genomes have  <dig> - <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity.
the phage genomes are not integrated in the bacterial genome, but instead, most likely have a pseudolysogenic life cycle.
propionibacterium acnes is a gram positive rod inhabiting the human skin that also infects orthopaedic implants and is associated with acne vulgaris.
pad <dig> and pas <dig> share four genes encoding identical amino acid sequences.
