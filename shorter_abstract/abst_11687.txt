our results clearly demonstrate that lncrnas play an important role in regulating puberty in goats.
for example, oxytocin signaling pathway, sterol biosynthetic process, and pheromone receptor activity signaling pathway were enriched as kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  or gene ontology  analyses showed.
our results showed  <dig> predicted lncrnas, including  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas, which corresponded to  <dig> target genes.
we also investigated the role of lncrnas that act cis and trans to the target genes and found a number of lncrnas involved in the regulation of puberty and reproduction, as well as several pathways related to these processes.
however, further research is needed to explore the functions of lncrnas and their predicted targets to provide a detailed expression profile of lncrnas on goat puberty.
