the presence of the f-plasmid resulted in a different gene expression in the two host genotypes.
we propose that epistatic effects also contribute to the maintenance of f-plasmids in natural populations.
comparing two different escherichia coli strains, mg <dig> and dh5Î±, we found a strong host genotype-specific crosstalk of the host chromosome with the f-plasmid.
host genotype independent crosstalk between plasmid and host chromosome.
we performed a large-scale survey for genes on the e. coli chromosome that are affected by the presence of the conjugative f-plasmid .
less than 12% of the genes showed an additive effect of gene expression, i.e.
about 88% of the genes affected by the presence of the f-plasmid showed a significant plasmid by host genotype interaction, i.e.
