in this study, the host immune response of an antigen induced inflammation model using spf mice repeatedly sensitized with m. pneumoniae antigens was analyzed.
this raises the possibility that breakdown of the immune balance may be part of the process leading to subsequent development of extrapulmonary mycoplasmal pneumonia.
m. pneumoniae antigen stimulation induced proliferation of mouse lymphocytes and caused production of il-17a and il- <dig>  in addition, it was shown that il-17a and il- <dig> production was increased in the presence of il- <dig> and tgf-Î² <dig>
the specificity of m. pneumoniae antigens in the th <dig> response of murine lymphocytes in vitro was also examined.
it was shown that m. pneumoniae antigens induced potent immunoreaction and enhanced the th <dig> cell response both in vivo and in vitro, and that both treg and il- <dig> are involved in the suppression of il-17a production.
extrapulmonary complications similar to autoimmune disease are caused by m. pneumoniae following the initial infection.
the mechanism and pathology of onset is not clear, but it is considered that excessive host immunoreactions play a part in the onset of mycoplasmal pneumonia and its extrapulmonary complications.
frequent and concentrated sensitization induced exacerbation of lung inflammation immunologically and pathologically, and evoked intrapulmonary il-17a and il- <dig> production.
in this study, we investigated the participation of the immune response, excluding the participation of th <dig> and th <dig> which has previously been investigated.
