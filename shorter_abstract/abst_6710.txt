the conjugation experiments demonstrated that a resistance plasmid can easily be transferred between y. enterocolitica strains.
mlva was also a less labor-intensive method than pfge and the results were easier to analyze.
all of the multiresistant y. enterocolitica strains belonged to four pfge pulsotypes that did not contain any susceptible strains.
mlva discriminated  <dig> sporadic ye 3-4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> strains into  <dig> types, whereas pfge with the restriction enzyme noti discriminated the strains into  <dig> different pfge pulsotypes.
we assessed the potential of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for discriminating  <dig> sporadic and outbreak-related yersinia enterocolitica  bio/serotype 3-4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> isolates.
mlva using six loci had better discriminatory power than pfge with the noti enzyme.
resistance to nalidixic acid was related to changes in codons  <dig> or  <dig> that stemmed from mutations in the gyra gene.
the conjugation experiments demonstrated that resistance to chl, str, and sul was carried by a conjugative plasmid.
the multiresistance of y. enterocolitica strains  correlated significantly  with travel abroad.
antimicrobial multiresistance of y. enterocolitica strains was significantly associated with travel abroad.
the discriminatory index for a sporadic strain was  <dig>  for pfge and  <dig>  for mlva.
