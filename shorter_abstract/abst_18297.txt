in the present study, the neural correlates of motor memory consolidation were probed using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  to the dorsal premotor cortex .
a delayed retention test assessed motor learning of repeated and random sequences of continuous movement; no rtms was applied at retention.
following practice of skilled movements, changes continue to take place in the brain that both strengthen and modify memory for motor learning.
our data support the hypothesis that pmd is important for continuous motor learning, specifically via off-line consolidation of learned motor behaviors.
we discovered that  <dig> hz excitatory rtms to pmd stimulated motor memory consolidation as evidenced by off-line learning, whereas only memory stabilization was noted following  <dig> hz inhibitory or sham stimulation.
these changes represent motor memory consolidation a process whereby new memories are transformed from a fragile to a more permanent, robust and stable state.
