we also performed these different rna-seq protocols using  <dig> tcga tumors as a validation set.
we tested  <dig> human breast tumor samples using:  ff rnas by microarray, mrna-seq, ribo-zero-seq and dsn-seq  and  ffpe rnas by ribo-zero-seq and dsn-seq.
typically, rna-seq libraries are prepared from total rna using poly enrichment of the mrna  to remove ribosomal rna , however, this method fails to capture non-poly transcripts or partially degraded mrnas.
moreover, ribo-zero-seq and dsn-seq have consistent transcript quantification using ffpe rnas, suggesting that rna-seq can be used with ffpe-derived rnas for gene expression profiling.
compared to mrna-seq where 69% of bases were mapped to the transcriptome, dsn-seq and ribo-zero-seq contained significantly fewer reads mapping to the transcriptome ; in these rna-seq protocols, many if not most reads mapped to intronic regions.
our results demonstrate that compared to mrna-seq and microarrays, ribo-zero-seq provides equivalent rrna removal efficiency, coverage uniformity, genome-based mapped reads, and consistently high quality quantification of transcripts.
we obtained paired fresh frozen  and ffpe rnas from multiple tumors and subjected these to different gene expression profiling methods.
the data from paired rna samples showed high concordance in transcript quantification across all protocols and between ff and ffpe rnas.

rna sequencing  is often used for transcriptome profiling as well as the identification of novel transcripts and alternative splicing events.
