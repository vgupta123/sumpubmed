in addition, recently, as-es <dig> cells derived from apodemus sylvaticus were established and identified by our laboratory as a new mammalian es cell line.
herein we report the generation of multiple mesodermal as-es <dig> lineages via embryoid body  formation by the hanging drop method and the addition of particular reagents and factors for induction at the stage of eb attachment.
the appropriate reagents and culture milieu used in mesodermal differentiation of mouse es cells also guide the differentiation of in vitro as-es <dig> cells into distinct mesoderm-derived cells.
this study provides a better understanding of the characteristics of as-es <dig> cells, a new species es cell line and promotes the use of apodemus es cells as a complement to mouse es cells in future studies.
embryonic stem  cells have attracted significant attention from researchers around the world because of their ability to undergo indefinite self-renewal and produce derivatives from the three cell lineages, which has enormous value in research and clinical applications.
