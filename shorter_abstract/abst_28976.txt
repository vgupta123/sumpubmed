here, we report new insights into how destructive/lethal pdt alters the transcriptome not only at the transcriptional level but also at post-transcriptional level via alternative splicing.
results were independently verified by two different technological microarray platforms.
in this study, we address the effects of a destructive/lethal hexaminolevulinate  mediated pdt dose on the transcriptome by using transcriptional exon evidence oligo microarrays.
hal-pdt mediated stress also altered expression of genes encoded by mitochondrial dna .
a number of mechanisms seem to be involved in the protective responses to pdt, including activation of transcription factors, heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes and apoptotic pathways.
specifically, the atf <dig> alternative isoform  was up-regulated, while the full-length variant was not changed by the treatment.
