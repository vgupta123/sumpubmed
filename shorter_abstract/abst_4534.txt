bac <dig> is a proline-rich peptide with a potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria.
our results provide a first indication for a potential development of bac7-based drugs in the treatment of salmonellosis and, eventually, other gram-negative infections.
the peptide increased significantly the number of survivors and the mean survival times of treated mice reducing the bacterial load in their organs despite its rapid clearance.
here we investigated its activity in biological fluids and in vivo using a mouse model of s. typhimurium infection.
the efficacy of the active 1- <dig> fragment of bac <dig> was assayed in serum and plasma, and its stability in biological fluids analyzed by western blot and mass spectrometry.
in addition, the peptide's biodistribution was evaluated by using time-domain optical imaging.
the ability of the peptide to protect mice against salmonella was assayed in a typhoid fever model of infection by determination of survival rates and bacterial load in liver and spleen of infected animals.
