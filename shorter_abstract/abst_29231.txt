the mathematical model describes the temporal responses on both the single cell level as well as the level of a heterogeneous cell population, as observed in the respective quantitative experiments using tnf-r <dig> stimuli of different strengths and durations.
cell ensemble modeling of a heterogeneous cell population including a global sensitivity analysis presented here allowed us to illuminate the role of the different elements and parameters on apoptotic signaling.
global sensitivity of the heterogeneous population was quantified by measuring the average gradient of time of death versus each population parameter.
apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and the removal of potentially damaged cells in multicellular organisms.
a simulated knockout of the nf-κb-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling reveals the importance of this pathway for delaying the time of death, reducing the death rate in the case of pulse stimulation and significantly increasing cell-to-cell variability.
the global sensitivity analysis of the cell population model further revealed an unexpected impact of heterogeneity, i.e.
differential dose-response relationships of these two major tnf signaling pathways have been described experimentally and using mathematical modeling.
this study analyzes the complex interplay of the crosstalk of tnf-r <dig> induced pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways based on an experimentally validated mathematical model.
this global sensitivity analysis uncovers the concentrations of caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  and their respective inhibitors bar and xiap, as key elements for deciding the cell's fate.
the receptors serve to transmit the external stimulus; procaspases and their inhibitors control the switching from life to death, while nf-κb enhances the heterogeneity of the cell population.
