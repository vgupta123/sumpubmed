in arabidopsis, ppv is transferred by mechanical inoculation, by biolistics and by agroinoculation with infectious cdna clones.
it identified a major genomic region, rpv <dig>  fine mapping led to the positioning of rpv <dig> to a 200 kb interval on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  a candidate gene approach identified the chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase  as a potential gene underlying the resistance.
partial resistance to ppv has been observed in the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> arabidopsis accessions and is characterized by a tendency to escape systemic infection.
sharka is caused by plum pox virus  in stone fruit trees.

these results indicate that rpv <dig> resistance to ppv carried by the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions is linked to allelic variations at the arabidopsis cpgk <dig> locus, leading to incomplete, compatible interaction with the virus.
a virus-induced gene silencing strategy was used to knock-down cpgk <dig> expression, resulting in drastically reduced ppv accumulation.
genetic analysis showed this partial resistance to be monogenic or digenic depending on the allelic configuration and recessive.
indeed, only one third of the plants are infected following inoculation, in comparison with the susceptible ler accession.
