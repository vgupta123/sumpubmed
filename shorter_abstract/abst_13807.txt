in addition, adiponectin assembly is an example of oxidative oligomerization of multi-subunit protein complexes in endoplasmic reticulum .
increased ratios of hmw to hexameric adiponectin could be achieved rapidly under oxidizing conditions by promoting disulfide rearrangement.
based upon these observations, we propose oxidative assembly of multi-subunit adiponectin complexes in a defined and stable redox environment is favored under oxidizing conditions coupled with high rates of disulfide rearrangement.
we previously reported that trimers assemble into hmw adiponectin via intermediates stabilized by disulfide bonds, and complete oxidation of available cysteines locks adiponectin in hexameric conformation.
reassembly of adiponectin under oxidizing conditions accelerated disulfide bonding but favored formation of hexamers over the hmw species.
in this study, we examined the effects of redox environment on the rate of oligomer formation and the distribution of oligomers.
