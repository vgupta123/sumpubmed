simple autocatalytic cycle intermediates are considered as non-informational replicators.
the most important claim is that replication, in general, is basically autocatalysis, with a specific defined environment and selective force.
a replicator is not valid unless its working environment, and the selective force to which it is subject, is specified.
a hierarchical classification for the partition of the replicator-continuum is provided where specific replicators are nested within more general ones.
replication is basically an autocatalytic process which enables us to rest on the notions of formal chemistry.
the classification should be able to be successfully applied to known replicators and also to future candidates.
the formal definition and the abstract models presented can distinguish between among all possible replicator types, based on their quantity of variable and heritable information.
therefore, it is importance to decide the nature and characteristics of any multiplying entity, in a detailed and formal way.
this sheds light on the old problem of the units and levels of selection and evolution.
