to address whether enhancing circadian rhythmicity in tumor cells affects cell cycle progression and reduces proliferation, we compared growth and cell cycle events of b <dig> melanoma cells and tumors with either a functional or dysfunctional clock.
we found that clock genes were suppressed in b <dig> cells and tumors, but treatments inducing circadian rhythmicity, such as dexamethasone, forskolin and heat shock, triggered rhythmic clock and cell cycle gene expression, which resulted in fewer cells in s phase and more in g <dig> phase.
here we demonstrated that the effects of dexamethasone on cell cycle and tumor growth are mediated by the tumor-intrinsic circadian clock.
circadian clocks control cell cycle factors, and circadian disruption promotes cancer.
knocking down the essential clock gene bmal <dig> in b <dig> tumors prevented the effects of dexamethasone on tumor growth and cell cycle events.

thus, our work reveals that enhancing circadian clock function might represent a novel strategy to control cancer progression.
accordingly, b <dig> proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo was slowed down.
