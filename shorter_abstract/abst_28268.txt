low dab diversity in otawa may limit this population’s adaptive potential to future pathogenic challenges.
we characterized a major histocompatibility complex  class ii b gene  in l. hochstetteri from a spleen transcriptome, and then compared its diversity to neutral microsatellite markers to assess the adaptive genetic diversity of five populations .
l. hochstetteri possessed very high mhc diversity, with  <dig> dab alleles characterized.
clustering analysis on putative peptide binding residues of the dab alleles indicated four functional supertypes, all of which were represented in  <dig> of  <dig> populations, albeit at different frequencies.
otawa was an exception to these observations, with only two dab alleles present.
supertype differentiation was high among populations, suggesting spatial and/or temporal variation in selection pressures.
extremely high differentiation was observed at the dab locus, with only two alleles shared between populations, a pattern that was not reflected in the microsatellites.
