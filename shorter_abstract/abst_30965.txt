this allowed the cellular activity of erα, in cells cotransfected with the candidate gene, to be quantified in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand e <dig>
from a library of  <dig> human cdna clones, we identified zinc finger protein  <dig>  as a repressor of erα mediated transactivation.
in an effort to identify the human genes involved in the regulation of erα, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based, functional screening platform by linking a response element  with a reporter gene.
the luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that znf <dig> inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation by erα in a dose-dependent manner.
estrogen receptor α  is a transcription factor whose activity is affected by multiple regulatory cofactors.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay clearly demonstrated that the interaction between znf <dig> and erα interrupts or prevents erα binding to the estrogen response element .
znf <dig> is a typical member of the btb/poz family of transcription factors, and shows both ubiquitous expression and a high degree of sequence conservation.
