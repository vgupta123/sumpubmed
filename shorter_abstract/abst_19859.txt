the microarrays were hybridized with synthesized complementary oligonucleotide targets at different temperatures .
the mm probes with four flexible positional mismatches were designed using the newly established mpdnn model and the experimental results demonstrated that the redesigned mm probes could yield more consistent hybridizations.
this study provides guidance on the design of mm probes for long oligonucleotides .
one of most effective approaches to estimating nonspecific hybridizations in oligonucleotide microarrays is the utilization of mismatch probes; however, this approach has not been used for longer oligonucleotide probes.
based on the experimental data generated from this study, a modified positional dependent nearest neighbor  model was constructed to adjust the thermodynamic parameters of matched and mismatched dimer nucleotides in the microarray environment.
mm probes with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mismatched nucleotides were differentiated for 50-mer oligonucleotide probes hybridized at  <dig>   <dig> and 42Â°c, respectively.
the novel mpdnn model has improved the consistency for long mm probes, and this modeling method can potentially be used for the prediction of oligonucleotide microarray hybridizations.
nonspecific hybridization is currently a major concern with microarray technology.
