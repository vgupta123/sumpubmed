the package includes novel methodology on  filtering, reducing false positives, and  gc content correction, improving copy number profile quality, especially under great read coverage and high correlation between gc content and copy number.
on data obtained from high-throughput sequencing, improving quality through gc bias correction and keeping false positives to a minimum help build reliable copy number alteration profiles.
seqcna, available through bioconductor, provides accurate copy number predictions in tumoural data, thanks to the extensive filtering and better gc bias correction, while providing an integrated and parallelized workflow.
we introduce seqcna, a parallelized r package for an integral copy number analysis of high-throughput sequencing cancer data.
deviations in the amount of genomic content that arise during tumorigenesis, called copy number alterations, are structural rearrangements that can critically affect gene expression patterns.
additionally, copy number alteration profiles allow insight into cancer discrimination, progression and complexity.
