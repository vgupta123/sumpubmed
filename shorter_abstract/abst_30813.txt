we assessed the ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intra- and inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence comparison of the "best close match" and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.
based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of dna variation between species and within species, we propose that the atpf-atph noncoding spacer could serve as a universal dna barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds.
we developed a simple and rapid dna-based molecular identification system for the lemnaceae based on sequence polymorphisms.
we compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the cbol  plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species from the family of lemnaceae.
