we demonstrate the broad range of uses of the produced enzyme in detection of mutations.
most enzymatic mutation detection methods are based on the cleavage of heteroduplex dna by a mismatch-specific endonuclease at mismatch sites and the analysis of the digestion product on a dna sequencer.
the co-agroinfiltration of endo <dig> and p <dig> constructs into n. benthamiana leaves allowed high level of transient expression of a mismatch-specific and sensitive endonuclease, endo <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana.
in plants, we report the use of endo <dig> system for detection of mutant alleles of retinoblastoma-related gene by tilling in pisum sativum and discovery of natural sequence variations by eco-tilling in arabidopsis thaliana.
we introduce a cost-effective tool based on a simplified purification protocol of a mismatch-specific and sensitive endonuclease, endo <dig>  especially, we report the successful applications of endo <dig> in mutation diagnostics in humans, fingerprinting of complex population of viruses, and in tilling and eco-tilling in plants.
in human, we report the diagnosis of the g1691a mutation in leiden factor-v gene associated with venous thrombosis and the fingerprinting of hiv- <dig> quasispecies in patients subjected to antiretroviral treatments.
