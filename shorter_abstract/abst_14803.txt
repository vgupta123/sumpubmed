rab proteins are regulators of vesicular trafficking, requiring a lipid modification for proper function, prenylation of c-terminal cysteines.
we found different domain insertions in different taxa, in Î±-subunits of rggtase and rep. our results suggest that there were multiple insertions, expansions and contractions in the evolution of this prenylation complex.
we profiled the domain architecture of the components of the rab prenylation complex in evolution.
this is catalysed by a complex of a catalytic heterodimer  and an accessory protein .
we identified the orthologues of the components of the rab prenylation machinery in  <dig> organisms, representing the crown eukaryotic groups.
