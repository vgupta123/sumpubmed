ccl <dig> is a well-established hepatotoxin inducing liver injury by producing free radicals.
the present study was designed to establish the protective effect of hesperidin , a citrus bioflavonoid, on ccl4-induced oxidative stress and resultant dysfunction of rat liver and kidney.
exposure to ccl <dig> also induces acute and chronic renal injuries.
in conclusion, our study demonstrated a protective effect of hdn in ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress in rat liver and kidney.
ccl <dig> caused a marked rise in serum levels of alt and ast .
oxidative stress in liver and kidney tissue was estimated using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , glutathione  content, superoxide dismutase, and catalase
this protective effect of hdn can be correlated to its direct antioxidant effect.
