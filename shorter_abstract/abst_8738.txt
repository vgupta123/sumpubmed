here we report that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  regulates chondrocyte proliferation via arginine methylation of sox <dig>
carm <dig> specifically methylates sox <dig> at its hmg domain in vivo and in vitro.
conversely, cartilage development of carm <dig> transgenic mice was accelerated.
these results establish a role for carm <dig> as an important regulator of chondrocyte proliferation during embryogenesis.
carm1-null mice display delayed endochondral ossification and decreased chondrocyte proliferation.
