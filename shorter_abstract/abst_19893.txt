the molecular mechanisms of cork formation are still poorly understood, in great part due to the difficulty in studying a species with a long life-cycle and for which there is scarce molecular/genomic information.
these were annotated according to their similarity to known plant genes, to known interpro domains, go classes and e.c.
despite the economic and social value of the q. suber species, few genomic resources have been developed, useful for biotechnological applications and improved forest management.
we generated in excess of  <dig> million sequence reads, by pyrosequencing  <dig> normalized cdna libraries derived from multiple q. suber tissues and organs, developmental stages and physiological conditions.
cork oak  is one of the rare trees with the ability to produce cork, a material widely used to make wine bottle stoppers, flooring and insulation materials, among many other uses.
cork oak forests are of great ecological importance and represent a major economic and social resource in southern europe and northern africa.
however, global warming is threatening the cork oak forests by imposing thermal, hydric and many types of novel biotic stresses.
the phylogenetic extent of this ests set was investigated, and we found that cork oak revealed a significant new gene space that is not covered by other model species or est sequencing projects.
