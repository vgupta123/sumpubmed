bacteriocin production is an important characteristic of e. coli strains of human origin.
the production incidence of  <dig> bacteriocin types and e. coli phylogroups were tested in a set of  <dig> e. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections  and in  <dig> control strains isolated from feces of patients without bacterial gut infection.
e. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections showed increased incidence of microcin h <dig> and colicin e <dig> production, respectively.
moreover, colicin e <dig> itself appears to be a potentially important virulence factor of certain uropathogenic e. coli strains.
as shown by southern blotting, pcole <dig> dna was not recognized by the colia probe and vice versa suggesting that pcole <dig> was independently associated with pcolia in uti strains.
production of  <dig> and  <dig> individual bacteriocin types was found in the uti and control strains, respectively.
producers of  <dig> or more identified bacteriocin types were more common in the uti group .
microcin h <dig> encoding determinants were found more often among uti strains compared to controls  and strains producing microcin h <dig> belonged predominantly to phylogroup b <dig> when compared to other bacteriocin producers .
in the uti strains, there was a markedly higher number of those producing colicin e <dig> compared to controls .
to date,  <dig> colicin and  <dig> microcin types have been analyzed on a molecular level allowing molecular detection of the corresponding genes.
