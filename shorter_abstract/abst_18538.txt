our statistical measures provide a means of quantifying how independent an individual's actions are.
for organisms living or interacting in groups, the decision-making processes of an individual may be based upon aspects of both its own state and the states of other organisms around it.
state-dependent modelling techniques are a powerful tool for exploring group decision-making processes, but analyses conducted so far have lacked methods for identifying how dependent an individual's actions are on the rest of the group.
here, we introduce and evaluate two easy-to-calculate statistics that quantify how dependent an individual's actions are upon the state of a co-player in a two-player state-dependent dynamic game.
they also allow researchers to quantify the output of state-dependent dynamic games, and quantitatively assess the predictions of these models.
