while much effort has been invested in the analysis of lncrnas from established plant models arabidopsis, maize, and rice, almost nothing is known about lncrnas from fruit crops, including those in the rosaceae family.
our study identifies a large number of tissue-specifically expressed lncrnas in f. vesca, thereby highlighting their potential contributions to strawberry flower and fruit development and paving the way for future functional studies.
finally, blast searches within plant species indicate that lncrnas are not well conserved.
to identify regulatory interactions between lncrnas and their potential protein-coding  gene targets, pairs of lncrnas and pc genes with positively or negatively correlated expression trends were identified based on their expression; these pairs may be candidates of cis- or trans-acting lncrnas and their targets.
long non-coding rnas  are a new class of regulatory molecules with roles in diverse biological processes.
these lncrnas were carefully cataloged based on expression level and whether or not they contain repetitive sequences or generate small rnas.
about one fourth of them are termed high-confidence lncrnas  because they are expressed at a level of fpkm higher than  <dig> and produce neither small rnas nor contain repetitive sequence.
here, we present a genome-scale identification and characterization of lncrnas from a diploid strawberry, fragaria vesca, based on rich rna-seq datasets from  <dig> different flower and fruit tissues.
