in the present study, we generated three sets of drug-like molecules in order to screen potential inhibitors against mtb drug target dhdps.
<dig> pyruvate analogues,  <dig> pyruvate-like molecules and  <dig> anti-infective molecules were docked at the active site of mtb dhdps  to select inhibitors establishing favorable interactions.
structurally similar to pyruvate, obtained using 3d flexible similarity search against nci and pubchem database.
the above-mentioned virtual screening procedures helped in the identification of several potent candidates that possess inhibitory activity against mtb dhdps.
therefore, these novel scaffolds/candidates which could have the potential to inhibit mtb dhdps enzyme would represent promising starting points as lead compounds and certainly aid the experimental designing of antituberculars in lesser time.
the first set of compounds was a combinatorial library, which comprised analogues of pyruvate .
the lysine/dap biosynthetic pathway is a promising target due its specific role in cell wall and amino acid biosynthesis.
