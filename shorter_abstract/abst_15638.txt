in our effort to understand the epigenetic mechanisms regulating seed development in barley , an agronomically important monocot plant cultivated for its endosperm, we set out to characterize the genes encoding barley pcg proteins.
expression analysis of the pcg genes revealed significant differences in gene expression among tissues and seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars with varying seed size.
the pcg differential expression pattern in different tissues and seed developmental stages as well as in two barley cultivars with different seed size is suggestive of a role for these genes in barley seed development.
hvfie and hve were also found to be induced by the plant hormone aba implying an association with aba-mediated processes during seed development, germination and stress response.
all genes co-localized with known chromosomal regions responsible for malting quality related traits, suggesting that they might be used for developing molecular markers to be applied in marker assisted selection.
different pcg complex variants operating during different developmental stages have been described in plants.
epigenetic phenomena have been associated with the regulation of active and silent chromatin states achieved by modifications of chromatin structure through dna methylation, and histone post-translational modifications.
four barley pcg gene homologues, named hvfie, hve, hvsu12a, and hvsu12b were identified and structurally and phylogenetically characterized.
furthermore, hvfie and hve gene expression was responsive to the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid  known to be involved in seed maturation, dormancy and germination.
in particular, the so-called fie/mea/fis <dig> complex governs the expression of genes important in embryo and endosperm development in arabidopsis.
