finally, the results obtained with the two lectins were compared and their potential use as prostate tumour biomarkers was discussed.
a total of  <dig> cases of prostate carcinoma and  <dig> cases of benign prostate hyperplasia were studied.
also, this study shows that both lectins may be used as histochemical biomarkers for the prostate cancer.
moreover, the successful use of a recombinant lectin in immunohistochemical studies of prostate cancer was for the first time demonstrated, highlighting the advantages of using recombinant systems in the preparation of pure lectin samples for diagnostic purpose.
the binding of recombinant and native frutalin to specific glycoconjugates expressed in human prostate tissues was assessed by using an immuhistochemical technique.
the binding intensity of native frutalin was stronger in the neoplasic cells than in hyperplasic cells; however no significant statistical correlation could be found .
on the other hand, recombinant frutalin bound exclusively to the neoplasic cells and a significant positive statistical correlation was obtained .
lectins have shown the ability to recognise these modifications in several carcinomas, namely in the prostate carcinoma, one of the most lethal diseases in man.
both lectins bound to the cells cytoplasm of the prostate carcinoma glands.
however, recombinant frutalin did not recognise all malignant prostate cases and, when positive, the binding to those tissues was heterogeneous.
native and recombinant frutalin yielded different binding responses in the prostate tissues due to their differences in carbohydrate-binding affinities.
frutalin was obtained from different sources namely, its natural source  and a recombinant source .
