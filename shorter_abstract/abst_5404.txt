their phylogenetic relationships with other ciliates are not completely resolved and the available literature, especially concerning electron microscopy and molecular studies, is quite scarce.
sonderia vorax kahl,  <dig> is redescribed from an oxygen-deficient, brackish-water pond along the ligurian sea coastlines of italy.
the ventral kinetom has a “secant system” including fronto-ventral and fronto-lateral kineties.
s. vorax is ovoid-ellipsoid in shape, dorsoventrally flattened, 130 x 69 μm ; it shows an almost spherical macronucleus, and one relatively large micronucleus.
the phylogeny based on 18s rrna gene sequences places s. vorax among plagiopylida; sonderiidae clusters with plagiopylidae, although lower-level relationships remain uncertain.
the studied population is fixed as neotype and the ciliate is established as type species of the genus, currently lacking.
a distinctive layer of bacteria laying between kineties covers the ciliate surface.
ciliates of the family sonderiidae are common members of the eukaryotic communities in various anoxic environments.
