we screened the nci- <dig> for dysregulated homologous recombination by using the gene cluster instability  assay we pioneered, and for defects in base excision repair by sensitivity to 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine .
gene cluster instability, sensitivity to hmdurd and sister chromatid exchange are mechanistically distinct phenomena.
we wanted to understand the contributions of specific mechanisms of genomic instability to the etiology of cancers represented by the nci- <dig>
genomic instability in the nci- <dig> appears to involve only one mechanism of instability for each individual cell line.
none of the lines examined in either subset exhibited significant changes in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges , neither did any of the lines in either subset exhibit microsatellite instability  indicative of defects in dna mismatch repair.
