the consequences of this increase in accuracy for prediction of in vivo binding sites  in the e. coli genome are also discussed.
characterizing transcription factor binding motifs is a common bioinformatics task.
for transcription factors with variable binding sites, we need to get many suboptimal binding sites in our training dataset to get accurate estimates of free energy penalties for deviating from the consensus dna sequence.
we believe that with progress in short-read sequencing technology, one could use selex methods to characterize binding affinities of many low specificity transcription factors.
to obtain large number of sequences required for this analysis we used a selex sage protocol developed by roulet et al.
we found that bioinformatics scores based on selex sage data does better in terms of prediction of physical binding energies as well as in detecting functional sites.
we analyzed low stringency selex data for e. coli catabolic activator protein , and we show here that appropriate quantitative analysis improves our ability to predict in vitro affinity.
