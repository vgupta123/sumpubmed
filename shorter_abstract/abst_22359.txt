in this study, we examine how memory traits evolve as a response to different pathogen environments using an individual-based model.
relating immune memory traits to the pathogen environment of the hosts, our population biological framework sheds light on the evolutionary determinants of immune memory.
in vertebrates, the memory of previous infection is physiologically accomplished by the development of memory t and b cells.
this immunological memory has evolved in response to the pathogen environment of the hosts.
many questions concerning the generation and maintenance of immunological memory are still debated.
if there is a limit, how should new cells be incorporated into a filled memory compartment?
and how many different pathogens should the immune system remember?
the ability of an immune system to remember pathogens improves the chance of the host to survive a second exposure to the same pathogen.
is there a limit to how many memory cells a host can generate and maintain?
