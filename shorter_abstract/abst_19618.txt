here, we present genfamclust, a pipeline that combines the network properties of sequence similarity and synteny to assess homology relationship and merge known homologs into groups of gene families.
we tested our method against the neighborhood correlation method on two diverse datasets consisting of fully sequenced genomes of eukaryotes and synthetic data.
the results obtained from both datasets confirm that synteny helps determine homology and genfamclust improves on neighborhood correlation method.
there are many algorithms developed for this purpose, most of which are based on either direct similarity between gene pairs or some sort of network structure, where weights on edges of constructed graphs are based on similarity.
