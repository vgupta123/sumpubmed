recent studies have suggested that rdr <dig> is involved in a second rddm pathway that relies mostly on 21 nt smrnas and functions to silence a subset of genomic loci that are usually refractory to the normal rddm pathway in arabidopsis.
it has been established that rdr <dig> is involved in the 24 nt sirna-dependent rna-directed dna methylation  pathway.
some of the regions with altered smrna clusters were associated with changes in dna methylation.
our results showed that osrdr <dig> plays a role in regulating a substantial number of endogenous genes with diverse functions in rice through smrna-mediated pathways involving dna methylation, and which participates in abiotic stress response.

despite these changes, no phenotypic difference was identified in osrdr <dig> relative to wt under normal condition; however, ephemeral phenotypic fluctuations occurred under some abiotic stress conditions.
microarray analysis identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  between osrdr <dig> and wt, of which  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in osrdr <dig>  smrna sequencing revealed regional alterations in smrna clusters across the rice genome.
we characterized a loss-of-function mutant  of the osrdr <dig> gene in rice  derived from a retrotransposon tos <dig> insertion.
