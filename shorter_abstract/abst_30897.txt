by using multiple data sources as well as targeted search methods, highly divergent genes across the tasmanian devil immune system were identified and characterised.
constant regions for immunoglobulins and t cell receptors were also identified.
the repertoire of genes in these families was similar to the opossum, however devil specific duplications were seen and orthologs to eutherian genes not previously identified in any marsupial were also identified.
we focus on immunoglobulins, t cell receptors and cytokine families.
the tasmanian devil  is being threatened with extinction in the wild by a disease known as devil facial tumour disease .
this understanding will allow for the development of devil specific assays and reagents and allow for future studies into the immune response of the tasmanian devil immune system to dftd.
in order to prevent the spread of this disease a thorough understanding of the tasmanian devil immune system and its response to the disease is required.
we identify and describe  <dig> cytokines including  <dig> interleukins,  <dig> chemokines,  <dig> interferons,  <dig> tumour necrosis family cytokines and  <dig> additional cytokines.
this has provided us with the raw data required to begin to investigate the tasmanian devil immunome in depth.
in this study we characterise immune gene families of the tasmanian devil.
