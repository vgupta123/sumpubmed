sample entropy , detrended fluctuation analysis  exponent, fractal dimension  and largest lyapunov exponents  of the two respiratory parameters were computed in all patients and during the two phases of ps.
a few studies have explored changes of breathing pattern variability for weaning outcome prediction, with conflicting results.
tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow were analyzed for  <dig> minutes during two phases:  <dig>  pressure support  ventilation  and  <dig>  weaning trials with ps:  <dig> cm h2o.
weaning failure patients exhibited significantly decreased respiratory pattern complexity, reflected in reduced sample entropy and lyapunov exponents and increased dfa exponents of respiratory flow time series, compared to weaning success subjects .
in this study, we tried to assess respiratory complexity during weaning trials, using different non-linear methods derived from theory of complex systems, in a cohort of surgical critically ill patients.
separation from mechanical ventilation is a difficult task, whereas conventional predictive indices have not been proven accurate enough, so far.
a new model including rapid shallow breathing index , its product with airway occlusion pressure at  <dig>  sec , sampen and lle predicted better weaning outcome compared with rsbi, p <dig>  and rsbi* p <dig>  .
we suggest that complexity analysis of respiratory signals can assess inherent breathing pattern dynamics and has increased prognostic impact upon weaning outcome in surgical patients.
