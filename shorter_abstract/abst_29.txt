enterobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infections such as necrotizing enterocolitis, bacteraemia, meningitis and brain abscess/lesions.
in this study the taxonomic relationship of strains described as e. sakazakii was further investigated.
the phenotypic profiles of the genomospecies were determined and biochemical markers identified.
strains identified as e. sakazakii were divided into separate groups on the basis of f-aflp fingerprints, ribopatterns and full-length 16s rrna gene sequences.
this study clarifies the taxonomy of e. sakazakii and proposes a reclassification of these organisms.
