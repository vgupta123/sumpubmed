our approach performs better than four existing prediction methods in identifying the scl of membrane proteins, and as well as or better for soluble proteins.
we show how ppi data can be used more effectively to yield reliable scl predictions for both soluble and membrane proteins.
based on a large, manually curated ppi dataset, we demonstrate that a substantial proportion of interacting proteins are in fact co-located.
we develop an approach to predict the scl of a protein based on the scl of its interaction partners, given sufficient confidence in the interaction itself.
the frequency of false positive ppis can be reduced by use of six lines of supporting evidence, three based on type of recorded evidence  and three based on type of biological evidence , with biological evidence more-effective than recorded evidence.
as protein-protein interactions  and subcellular location  are discovered via separate empirical approaches, ppi and scl annotations are independent and might complement each other in helping us to understand the role of individual proteins in cellular networks.
