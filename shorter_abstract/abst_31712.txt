the s. aureus sav <dig> locus plays a pronounced role in temperature adaptation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence by regulating a wide range of genes and proteins involved in metabolism and stress tolerance.
the sav <dig> deletion mutant is more tolerant to oxidative stress in vitro and is less pathogenic in a murine infection model when compared with wild-type parent strain mu <dig>  furthermore, the sav <dig> mutant exhibits lower mics for gentimicin, tetracyclines and glycopeptides, increased autolysis, and a thinner cell wall when compared with the wild-type strain.
in addition, the sav <dig> mutant displays altered expression of proteins involved in carbohydrate/energy metabolism, cell wall metabolism, and stress or heat shock response, as well as other metabolic processes including lipid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, purine or pyrimidine metabolism, transcription, and protein biosynthesis.
in staphylococcus aureus,  <dig> tcrs types have been identified.

deletion of the sav <dig> locus in s. aureus results in reduced growth when cultured under low  and high  temperature conditions.
microarray and proteomic analyses show that the expression of cell-wall-associated genes glms and murz are lower, and the expression of heat shock and stress-related genes  are higher in the sav <dig> mutant when compared with the wild-type strain.
