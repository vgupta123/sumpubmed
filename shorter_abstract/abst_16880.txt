although several sequence based search methods have been exploited for protein family prediction, less effort has been devoted to the prediction of obps from sequence data and this area is more challenging due to poor sequence identity between these proteins.
the algorithm was applied to the dataset derived from pfam and gendis database and we obtained overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> % .
our study suggests that rlsc is potentially useful for predicting the odorant binding proteins from sequence-derived properties irrespective of sequence similarity.
