it is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination r <dig> is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models.
in fact, with the 'true' model having up to  <dig> times more strength of evidence based on akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of r <dig>  in addition, even the bias-corrected r2adj exhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models.
