using the protein alignment which included  <dig> sequences, we constructed the neighbour-joining tree which showed four major clusters, including shadoos, shadoo2s and prion protein-likes , fish prion proteins , tetrapode prion proteins  and doppels .
we showed that the entire prion protein conformationally plastic region is well conserved between eutherian prion proteins and shadoos , and there could be a potential structural compatibility between shadoos and the left-handed parallel beta-helical fold.
in the prnp 3'-utrs, there are conserved cytoplasmic polyadenylation element sites .
we deduced  <dig> new protein primary structures, and performed the first phylogenetic analysis of all vertebrate prion genes.
however, this idea needs to be confirmed by functional assays in transgenic systems.
we made use of the present availability of vertebrate genomic sequences, and we have conducted the most comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the prion protein gene prnp and its homologues, shadow of prion protein gene sprn and doppel gene prnd, and prion testis-specific gene prnt so far.
it is likely that the conserved genomic elements identified in this analysis represent bona fide cis-elements.
the homologues of human disease genes are expected to contribute to better understanding of physiological and pathogenic processes.
using human as the base sequence for genomic sequence comparisons , we annotated numerous potential cis-elements.
