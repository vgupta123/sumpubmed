the identification of transcription factor binding sites is difficult since they are only a small number of nucleotides in size, resulting in large numbers of false positives and false negatives in current approaches.
computational methods to reduce false positives are to look for over-representation of transcription factor binding sites in a set of similarly regulated promoters or to look for conservation in orthologous promoter alignments.
to improve upon existing binding site predictions, the tool searches for position weight matrices from the transfacr database that are over-represented in an experimental set compared to a random set of promoters and identifies cross-species conservation of the predicted transcription factor binding sites.
we also implement and demonstrate the importance of matching the random set of promoters to the experimental promoters by gc content, which is a unique feature of our tool.
