these findings provide a new insight into rewarding effects of nicotine and the underlying mechanism.
nicotine induces significant metabonomic alterations in brain, which are involved in neurotransmitter disturbance, energy metabolism dysregulation, anti-oxidation and membrane function disruptions, as well as amino acid metabolism imbalance.
studies have shown a few cerebral metabolites modified by nicotine; however, endogenous metabolic profiling in brain has not been well explored.
h nmr-based on metabonomics was applied to investigate the endogenous metabolic profiling of brain hippocampus, nucleus acumens , prefrontal cortex  and striatum.
these modified metabolites included glutamate, acetylcholine, tryptamine, glucose, lactate, creatine, 3-hydroxybutyrate and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide , which was closely associated with neurotransmitter and energy source.
