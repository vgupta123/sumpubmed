the majority of these genes were repressed by butyrate and associated with cell cycle control.
this study presented the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis.
these findings enable better recognition of the full range of beneficial roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and possibly in fighting gastrointestinal pathogens.
the profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes.
global gene expression profiles of bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays.
the results from real-time pcr positively correlated  with the results from the microarray.
the expression levels of  <dig> selected genes identified by the microarray were confirmed using real-time pcr.
