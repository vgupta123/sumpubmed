reconstructing species trees for archaea and bacteria, and inferring that their last common ancestors encoded lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig>  respectively, we studied the gains and losses of both classes.
in one occasion, within the alpha proteobacteria, a lysrs <dig> to lysrs <dig> lgt was followed by reversal to lysrs <dig>  after establishing the most likely lgt paths, we studied the possible origins of the laterally transferred genes.
the family of lysrss features complex lgt events.
to this end, we reconstructed lysrs gene trees and evaluated the likely origins of the laterally transferred genes.
the replacement of one lysrs by another apparently transits through a stage simultaneously coding for both synthetases, probably conferring a selective advantage to the affected organisms.
a selective advantage is suggested to organisms encoding simultaneously lysrs1- <dig>
aarss are ancient enzymes, guarding the fidelity of the genetic code.
a complex pattern of lgt events emerged.
the currently available data were sufficient for identifying unambiguously the origins of lysrs <dig> but not of lysrs <dig> gene transfers.
