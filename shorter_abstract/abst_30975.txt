we show that the strong selective pressure acting on the function of persistent genes, in a permanent state of flux of genes in bacterial genomes, maintaining their size fairly constant, that drives persistent genes clustering.
however, genomes harbor two very different categories of genes: those genes present in a majority of organisms – persistent genes – and those present in very few organisms – rare genes.
we show that two classes of genes are significantly clustered in bacterial genomes: the highly persistent and the rare genes.
the clustering of rare genes is readily explained by the selfish operon theory.
yet, genes persistently present in bacterial genomes are also clustered and we try to understand why.
a further selective stabilization process might contribute to maintaining the clustering.
we then test if known selective processes, such as co-transcription, physical interaction or functional neighborhood, account for the stabilization of these clusters.
