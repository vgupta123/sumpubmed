azospirillum amazonense has potential to be used as agricultural inoculant since it promotes plant growth without causing pollution, unlike industrial fertilizers.
furthermore, glnk-specific a. amazonense mutants were generated utilizing the pk19mobsacb vector system.
in this work, genetic tools that can support the study of a. amazonense were described.
