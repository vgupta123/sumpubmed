furthermore, we looked at the effects of fms-like tyrosine kinase  <dig> ligand , astrocyte-conditioned medium  and gm-csf on the differentiation to microglia-like cells.
replenishment by bone marrow-derived progenitor cells is still under debate.
integration, survival and migration were assessed in organotypic brain slices.
we assessed in vitro-derived microglia differentiation by marker expression , but also for the first time for functional performance  and in situ migration into living brain tissue.
the cells differentiated from mouse bm show function, markers and morphology of primary microglia and migrate into living brain tissue.
we conclude that in vitro-derived microglia are the phenotypic and functional equivalents to primary microglia and could be used in cell therapy.
microglia, the macrophages of the brain, have been implicated in the causes of neurodegenerative diseases and display a loss of function during aging.
