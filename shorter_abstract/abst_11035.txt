all animals were sacrificed after neurological evaluation with modified tarlov criteria at the 48th hour after reperfusion, and the spinal cord segments  were harvested for histopathological examination, biochemical analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick end labeling  staining.
thirty-nine rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, i/r group and hsya group.
neurological outcomes in hsya group were slightly improved compared with those in i/r group.
histopathological analysis revealed that hsya treatment attenuated i/r induced necrosis in spinal cords.
these findings suggest that hsya may protect spinal cords from i/r injury by alleviating oxidative stress and reducing neuronal apoptosis in rabbits.
moreover, as seen from tunel results, hsya also protected neurons from i/r-induced apoptosis in rabbits.
hydroxysafflor yellow a , which is one of the most important active ingredients of the chinese herb carthamus tinctorius l, is widely used in the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases.
similarly, alleviated oxidative stress was indicated by decreased malondialdehyde  level and increased superoxide dismutase  activity after hsya treatment.
