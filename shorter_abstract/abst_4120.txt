differential network analysis with direct physical gene interactions needs to be explored in this endeavour.
c3net is a recently introduced information theory based gene network inference algorithm that infers direct physical gene interactions from expression data, which was shown to give consistently higher inference performances over various networks than its competitors.
we apply dc3net on a synthetic and real prostate cancer datasets, which show promising results.
as an example, we predicted that rad <dig> with trf <dig> have prostate cancer specific interaction that turned out to be having validation from the literature.
our enrichment analysis suggests that the identified tumor specific gene interactions may be potentially important in driving the growth in prostate cancer.
differential analysis of gene networks allows spotting condition-specific interactions that, for instance, form disease networks if the conditions are a disease, such as cancer, and normal.
our approach reveals disease specific interactions.
it is known that rad <dig> complex associates with trf <dig> in the s phase of cell cycle, which suggests that this predicted interaction may promote telomere maintenance in tumor cells in order to allow tumor cells to divide indefinitely.
although there are no reference interactions databases for the specific conditions of our samples in the literature, we found verifications for  <dig> of our predicted direct physical interactions from only four of the biological interaction databases.
with loose cutoffs, we predicted  <dig> interactions from tumor and normal samples in total.
genes might have different gene interactions in different cell conditions, which might be mapped into different networks.
