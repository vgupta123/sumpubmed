cecal samples and fecal samples via cloacal swab were collected from  <dig> birds across  <dig> replicate trials.
the fecal and cecal samples were investigated to determine to what extent the microbiota found in fecal samples represented the microbiota of the ceca.
fecal samples can be effectively used to detect some shifts and responses of cecal microbiota.
fecal sample analysis captures a large percentage of the microbial diversity present in the ceca.
the fecal microbiota is qualitatively similar to cecal microbiota but quantitatively different.
the microbial populations present within the paired ceca of individual birds were also compared and shown to be similar.
there was a positive correlation between cecal and fecal abundance in the shared sequences, however the two communities differed significantly in community structure, represented as either alpha or beta diversity.
it was found that  <dig> % of all operational taxonomic units , containing  <dig> % of all sequences, were shared between the two sample types, with otus unique for each sample type found to be very rare.
this is a more meaningful and preferred way of sampling as the same animals can be monitored and tracked for temporal studies.
