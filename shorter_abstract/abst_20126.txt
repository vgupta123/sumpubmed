we developed a web-based application, called atgc transcriptomics, with a flexible and adaptable interface that allows users to work with new generation sequencing  transcriptomic analysis results using an ontology-driven database.
atgc transcriptomics provides access to non-expert computer users and small research groups to a scalable storage option and simple data integration, including database administration and management.
the software is freely available under the terms of gnu public license at http://atgcinta.sourceforge.net.
this new application simplifies data exploration, visualization, and integration for a better comprehension of the results.
this problem is especially significant for small research groups working with non-model species.
