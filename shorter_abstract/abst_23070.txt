finally, we analyzed promoters of regulated genes which where apparently not regulated by c-myc or other c-myc targeted tfs and identified overrepresented oct <dig>  mzf <dig>  ppargamma, plzf, ets, and hmgiy binding sites when compared against control promoter background.
we determined molecular rules for transcriptional regulation to explain, in part, the carcinogenic effect seen in mice overexpressing the c-myc oncogene.
by using microarray technology, alterations in the expression of genes were captured based on a female transgenic mouse model in which, indeed, c-myc overexpression in alveolar epithelium results in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma .
in this study, we analyzed exclusively the promoters of induced genes by different in silico methods in order to elucidate the c-myc transcriptional regulatory network.
targeted overexpression of this gene in mice results in distinct types of lung adenocarcinomas.
our in silico data suggest a model of a transcriptional regulatory network in which different tfs act in concert upon c-myc overexpression.
then, we analyzed the promoters of  <dig> induced genes with respect to binding sites of other transcription factors  which were upregulated by c-myc overexpression.
