we propose that the reduced incidence and severity of gvhd after allogeneic transplantation of umbilical cb cells is due to lesser activation of specific transcription factors and a subsequent reduction in production of certain cytokines.
this may be reduced by umbilical cord blood transplantation, an effect that has been attributed to qualitative differences between neonatal and adult t cells.
production of the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> and the hematopoietic cytokine il- <dig> was much lower in cbl versus abl after t-cell receptor-mediated stimulation, whereas production of gm-csf was comparable in the  <dig> cell types.
time course experiments revealed that t-bet expression was stimulated in both cell types, whereas c-maf and gata- <dig> were induced only in abl.
furthermore, there was less expression of the th subset-specific transcription factors t-bet and c-maf in cbl versus abl, whereas gata- <dig> expression was similar.
we compared levels of secreted proteins and cytokine mrna induced in cord blood leukocytes  and adult blood leukocytes  by various stimuli.
in contrast, there was less expression and activation of transcription factors in cbl.
