the increased susceptibility of the ein2b-rnai line, which is deficient in et signaling, further confirmed that biochar-induced priming acts at least partly through et signaling.
these results suggest that biochar amendments protect rice plants challenged by nematodes.
a  <dig> Â % concentration of biochar added to the potting medium of rice was found to be the most effective at reducing nematode development in rice roots, whereas direct toxic effects of biochar exudates on nematode viability, infectivity or development were not observed.
