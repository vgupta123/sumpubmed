using this, a framework rh map was constructed with  <dig> markers.
ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the  <dig> hybrid cell lines.
we suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.
we successfully developed a yellowtail rh panel to facilitate the localization of markers.
we constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid  panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use snps  in ests  for the dna-assisted breeding of yellowtail.
this high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny.
given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture.
based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected  <dig> hybrid cell lines to form an rh panel.
importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an rh panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array .
