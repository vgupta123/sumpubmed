in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay cbp60g and sard <dig> were shown to bind specifically to a 10mer oligonucleotide with the sequence gaaattttgg.
co-expression analysis across a defined set of ath <dig> full genome microarray experiments expanded this gene set; clustering analysis was then applied to group densely interconnected genes.
putative components of the cbp60g sard <dig> signalling network have been uncovered by co-expression analysis.
gene expression profiling on a custom microarray identified a set of genes, like sid <dig>  down-regulated in cbp60g sard <dig> mutant plants.
a stringent threshold for co-expression identified two related calmodulin-like genes tightly associated with sid <dig>  sid <dig> was found to cluster with genes whose promoter regions were significantly enriched with gaaatt motifs.
salicylic acid is a critical signalling component in plant defence responses.
in arabidopsis, isochorismate synthase encoded by sid <dig> is essential for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid in response to biotic challenges.
representative genes from other clusters enriched with the gaaatt motif were found to be variously down-regulated, unchanged or up-regulated in the double mutant.
genes clustering with sid <dig> were found to be down-regulated in the cbp60g sard <dig> double mutant.
