taken together, our results indicate that a relatively long lasting form of adaptation occurs within the axon terminals of the orns in the antennal lobes, which depends on intracellular ca2+-stores, attributable to a positive feedback through the gabaergic synapses.
using either a genetic approach to target specific rnas, or a pharmacological approach, we show that the second component, relying on the intracellular ca2+-stores, is responsible for the adaptation to repetitive stimuli.
recently, in drosophila, we reported that odor-induced ca2+-response in axon terminals of olfactory receptor neurons  is related to odor duration.
we used a recently developed in-vivo bioluminescence imaging approach to quantify the odor-induced ca2+-activity in the axon terminals of orns.
these results indicate that gaba exerts a feedback control.
in the antennal lobes  orns make synaptic contacts with second-order neurons, the projection neurons .
in vertebrates and invertebrates, sensory neurons adapt to variable ambient conditions, such as the duration or repetition of a stimulus, a physiological mechanism considered as a simple form of non-associative learning and neuronal plasticity.
although various signaling pathways, as camp, cgmp, and the inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate receptor  play a role in adaptation, their precise mechanisms of action at the cellular level remain incompletely understood.
in particular, a relatively long odor stimulus  triggers the induction of a second component involving intracellular ca2+-stores.
finally, at the behavioral level, using an olfactory test, genetically impairing the gababr or its signaling pathway specifically in the orns disrupts olfactory adapted behavior.
