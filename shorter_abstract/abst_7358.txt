these gene expression data are then used as seeds to find important nodes by using a novel combination of the gene ontology database and the human network of gene interactions.
analysis of gene clustering in the gene ontology shows no significant clustering of genes unique to h5n <dig> response at  <dig> hours post infection.
there were no significant clusters of genes in the gene ontology for the control  or rsv experiments that were unique relative to the h5n <dig> response.
many of the genes that are found to be significantly expressed in h5n <dig> response relative to the control experiments are not found to cluster significantly in the gene ontology.
these genes are, however, often closely linked to the clustered genes through the human network.
we analyzed differential gene expression of lung epithelial cells to compare the response to h5n <dig> infection with a more benign infection with respiratory syncytial virus .
the recent emergence of the h5n <dig> influenza virus from avian reservoirs has raised concern about future influenza strains of high virulence emerging that could easily infect humans.
