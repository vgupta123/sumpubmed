by individually aligning these networks with the yeast interactome, we simultaneously partition the functional space of human genes, and their corresponding pathways, based on their conservation both across species and among different tissues.
consequently, they provide excellent candidates as drug targets for therapeutic interventions.
however, different human tissues, while inheriting a similar genetic code, exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties.
we present a novel framework to systematically quantify the suitability of yeast as a model organism for different human tissues.
we further study each of these subspaces in detail, and shed light on their unique biological roles in the human tissues.
while tissue-selective genes are significantly associated with the onset and development of a number of tissue-specific pathologies, we show that the human-specific subset has even higher association.
finally, we couple our framework with a novel statistical model to assess the conservation of tissue-specific pathways and infer the overall similarity of each tissue with yeast.

our framework provides a novel tool that can be used to assess the suitability of the yeast model for studying tissue-specific physiology and pathophysiology in humans.
budding yeast, s. cerevisiae, has been used extensively as a model organism for studying cellular processes in evolutionarily distant species, including humans.
to this end, we develop a computational method for dissecting the global human interactome into tissue-specific cellular networks.
