as a result, the vast majority of vertebrate genome sequences generated to date remain at a draft stage.
the approaches for shotgun-based sequencing of vertebrate genomes are now well-established, and have resulted in the generation of numerous draft whole-genome sequence assemblies.
to date, our genome sequencing efforts have focused on comparative studies of targeted genomic regions, requiring sequence finishing of large blocks of orthologous sequence  from various subsets of  <dig> vertebrates.
this experience has provided a unique opportunity to compare the relative effort required to finish shotgun-generated genome sequence assemblies from different species, which we report here.
importantly, we found that the sequence assemblies generated for the same orthologous regions from various vertebrates show substantial variation with respect to misassemblies and, in particular, the frequency and characteristics of sequence gaps.
as a consequence, the work required to finish different species' sequences varied greatly.
our findings have important implications for the eventual finishing of the draft whole-genome sequences that have now been generated for a large number of vertebrates.
application of the same standardized methods for finishing provided a novel opportunity to "assay" characteristics of genome sequences among many vertebrate species.
