as a highly conserved core protease, clpp is involved in various cellular processes as well as virulence in bacteria, and has been proved to be required for the expression of transmission traits and cell division of l. pneumophila.
during the conversion between its highly resistant, infectious dormant form and vigorously growing, uninfectious replicative form, l. pneumophila utilizes a complicated regulatory network in which proteolysis may play a significant role.
the clpp-deficient l. pneumophila strain failed to replicate and was digested in the first 3 h post-infection in mammalian cells j774a.
the data indicate that clpp plays an important role in regulating the virulence and effector translocation of legionella pneumophila.
<dig>  further investigation demonstrates that the clpp deficient mutant strain was unable to escape the endosome-lysosomal pathway in host cells.
we also found that the clpp deficient mutant strain still expresses t4bss components, induces contact-dependent cytotoxicity and translocate effector proteins ralf and legk <dig>  indicating that its t4bss was overall functional.
the opportunistic bacterial pathogen legionella pneumophila uses substrate effectors of dot/icm type ivb secretion system  to accomplish survival and replication in amoebae cells and mammalian alveolar macrophages.
