genomic clusters of up to  <dig> genes were identified.
the genome sequences of eucalyptus grandis and e. globulus were mined for terpene synthase genes  and compared to other plant species.
we investigated the relative expression of tps in seven plant tissues and functionally characterized five tps genes from e. grandis.
we discovered  <dig> and  <dig> putative functional tps genes in e. grandis and e. globulus, respectively.
all but one tps from e. grandis were expressed in at least one of seven plant tissues examined.
compared to other sequenced plant genomes, eucalyptus grandis has the largest number of putative functional tps genes of any sequenced plant.
while the majority of tps genes occur in orthologous pairs some clades show evidence of recent gene duplication, as well as loss of function.
terpenoids are abundant in the foliage of eucalyptus, providing the characteristic smell as well as being valuable economically and influencing ecological interactions.
phylogenetic comparison of the two investigated eucalyptus species gives insight about recent evolution of different clades within the tps gene family.
