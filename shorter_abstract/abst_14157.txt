we confirm the validity of this screen and show that ing <dig> interacts specifically with three of the three proteins tested; p38mapk, mekk <dig> and rad <dig>  these novel ing-interacting proteins further link ing proteins to cell stress and dna damage signaling, providing previously unknown upstream links to dna damage response pathways in which ing <dig> participates.
here we test a cross-species  bioinformatics-based approach to identify potential human ing-interacting proteins with higher probability and accuracy than approaches based on screens in a single species.
the inhibitor of growth  family of type ii tumor suppressors  is involved in many cellular processes such as cell aging, apoptosis, dna repair and tumorigenesis.
