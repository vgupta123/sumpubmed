similar analysis of the set of starch metabolic enzymes shows that several have strong to moderate coiled-coil potential.
gene expression analysis shows strongly correlated patterns of co-expression between at5g <dig> and several starch metabolic enzymes.
bioinformatic analysis demonstrates a diurnal pattern of gene expression, with an accumulation of transcript during the light cycle and decline during the dark cycle.
a corresponding diurnal pattern of change in protein levels in leaves is also observed.
sequence analysis shows that at5g <dig> has a strongly-predicted coiled-coil domain.
we propose that at5g <dig> is a regulatory scaffold protein, persistently binding the starch granule, where it is positioned to interact by its coiled-coil domain with several potential starch metabolic enzyme binding-partners.
we here show that at5g <dig> is chloroplast-localized, and binds starch, with a preference for amylose.
