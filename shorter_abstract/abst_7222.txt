further development of methods that detect and describe familial motif trends has the potential to help in measuring the similarity of novel computational motif predictions to previously known data and sensitively detecting regulatory motifs similar to previously known ones from novel sequence.
we show that metamotifs can be used as pwm priors in the nestedmica motif inference algorithm to dramatically increase the sensitivity to infer motifs.
we propose a probabilistic model for position weight matrix  sequence motif families.
it has been shown that there are familial tendencies in dna sequence motifs that are predictive of the family of factors that binds them.
the metamotif framework models variation within a family of sequence motifs.
metamotifs were also successfully applied to a motif classification problem where sequence motif features were used to predict the family of protein dna binding domains that would interact with it.
the consequential growth of sequence motif data sets makes it important to systematically group and categorise regulatory motifs.
the model, which we call the 'metamotif' describes recurring familial patterns in a set of motifs.
development of high-throughput methods for measuring dna interactions of transcription factors together with computational advances in short motif inference algorithms is expanding our understanding of transcription factor binding site motifs.
the metamotif has great potential for further use in machine learning tasks related to especially de novo computational sequence motif inference.
