cdnas synthesized by a template switching approach were size-fractionated by two dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis prior to pcr amplification and cloning.
effective size selection was demonstrated by pcr amplification of conserved gene families specific of each size class.
construction of high quality cdna libraries from the usually low amounts of eukaryotic mrna extracted from environmental samples is essential in functional metatranscriptomics for the selection of functional, full-length genes encoding proteins of interest.
a simple and cost effective technique has been developed to construct sized eukaryotic cdna libraries from environmental samples.
we report here a simple and cost effective technique for preparation of sized eukaryotic cdna libraries from as low as three microgram of total soil rna dominated by ribosomal and bacterial rna.
