in addition, down regulation of pdil 2â€“ <dig> and bip was detected in the chalky tissue, indicating the important role of protein metabolism in grain chalkiness formation.
grain chalkiness is a complex trait adversely affecting appearance and milling quality, and therefore has been one of principal targets for rice improvement.
in addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain chalkiness formation are still imperfectly understood.
protein metabolism was the most abundant category, accounting for  <dig> % of the total differentially expressed proteins.
approximately half of these differentially expressed proteins involved in central metabolic or regulatory pathways including carbohydrate metabolism  and protein synthesis, folding and degradation, providing proteomic confirmation of the notion that chalkiness formation involves diverse but delicately regulated pathways.
using this novel comparison system, our comprehensive survey of endosperm proteomics in the notched-belly mutant provides a valuable proteomic resource for the characterization of pathways contributing to chalkiness formation at molecular and biochemical levels.
we identified a notched-belly mutant  with high percentage of white-belly, which only occurs in the bottom part proximal to the embryo.
an itraq-based comparative display of the proteins between the bottom chalky part and the upper translucent part of grains of dy <dig> was performed.
using this mutant, a novel comparison system that can minimize the effect of genetic background and growing environment was developed.
a total of  <dig> proteins responsible for chalkiness formation was identified.
