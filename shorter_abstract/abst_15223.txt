the non-repetitive fraction of the sequences was aligned to the ucsc human-mouse alignment and the resulting three-species alignments were annotated using the human genome annotation.
additionally, the joint alignment of the shot-gun sequences to the human-mouse alignment offers the investigator a rapid way to defining specific regions for analysis and resequencing.
the results show that for each of these types of orthologous data, pig is much closer to human than mouse is.
we have generated ~ <dig>  million shotgun sequences  from the pig genome.
the data are hereby released  together with an initial evolutionary analysis.
the pig is an obvious choice due to its economic and medical importance as well as its evolutionary position in the artiodactyls.
purifying selection has been more efficient in pig compared to human, but not as efficient as in mouse, and pig seems to have an isochore structure most similar to the structure in human.
