in conclusion, our results have demonstrated that ecp increased tnf-α production in beas-2b cells and triggered apoptosis by caspase- <dig> activation through mitochondria-independent pathway.
however, the specific pathway underlying the mechanisms of ecp-induced cytotoxicity remains unclear.
this study investigated ecp-induced apoptosis in bronchial epithelial beas-2b cells and elucidated the specific pathway during apoptosis.
to address the mechanisms involved in ecp-induced apoptosis in human beas-2b cells, investigation was carried out using chromatin condensation, cleavage of poly  polymerase , sub-g <dig> distribution in cell cycle, annexin v labeling, and general or specific caspase inhibitors.
many cationic proteins with cytotoxic activities, such as eosinophil cationic protein  and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , are released from activated eosinophils.
moreover, ecp-induced apoptosis was effectively inhibited in the presence of neutralizing anti-tnf-α antibody.
caspase-8-dependent apoptosis was demonstrated by cleavage of caspase- <dig> after recombinant ecp treatment, accompanied with elevated level of tumor necrosis factor alpha .
eosinophilic granulocytes are important for the human immune system.
