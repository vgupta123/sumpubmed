according to the first criterion,  <dig> of the candidate models are indistinguishable.
the task is difficult due to the limited observability of the system variables and the noisy measurements, which pose serious challenges to the process of model selection.
process-based modeling focuses on explanatory models of dynamical systems; it constructs such models from measured time-course data and formalized modeling knowledge.
given its recent rapid development and the central role that modeling plays in the discipline, systems biology clearly needs methods for automated modeling of dynamical systems.

in a series of modeling experiments, we compare the results of process-based modeling obtained with different model selection criteria.
however, the use of domain-specific criteria results in a remarkable improvement over the other two model selection criteria.
to address these issues, we propose a domain-specific model selection criteria that take into account knowledge about the necessary properties of the simulated model behavior.
we also find that some of the model structures discarded as implausible in previous studies lead to the expected rab5-rab <dig> switch behavior.
we also introduce three domain-specific criteria based on domain expert expectations about the simulated behavior of an endocytosis model.
our experiments show that the domain-specific criteria outperform the standard domain-independent criteria for model selection.
furthermore, taking into account the complexity of the model does not lead to better model selection.
