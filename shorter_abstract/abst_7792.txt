canine intervertebral disc πherniation causes a naturally-occurring spinal cord injury  that bears critical similarities to human sci with respect to both injury pathomechanisms and treatment.
arachidonic acid metabolism is altered in dogs with sci, and these data suggest that these aa metabolites reflect injury severity and recovery, paralleling data from other model systems.
the csf concentrations of pla <dig> and pge <dig> were higher in sci dogs compared to control dogs , but csf lct <dig> concentration in sci dogs was significantly lower than that in control dogs .
currently, there is limited understanding of the role of arachidonic acid metabolites in canine sci.
prostaglandin e <dig> concentration in the csf was significantly and positively associated with increased severity of sci at the time of sampling  and recovery 42 days post-injury , as measured by ordinal behavioral scores.
