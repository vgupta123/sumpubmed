in general, compared to recent studies, the resulting trees reflect the living style of organisms as well as classical taxa.
most studies have focused on the classification of organisms based on structural comparison and local alignment of metabolic pathways.
moreover, for phylogenetically closely related organisms, the classification results are consistent with specific metabolic characteristics, such as the light-harvesting systems, fermentation types, and sources of electrons in photosynthesis.
in contrast, global alignment of multiple metabolic networks complements sequence-based phylogenetic analyses and provides more comprehensive information.
we explored the phylogenetic relationships between microorganisms through global alignment of multiple metabolic networks.
we demonstrate the usefulness of global alignment of multiple metabolic networks to infer phylogenetic relationships between species.
in addition, our exhaustive analysis of microbial metabolic pathways reveals differences in metabolic features between phylogenetically closely related organisms.
with the ongoing increase in the number of genomic sequences and metabolic annotations, the proposed approach will help identify phenotypic variations that may not be apparent based solely on sequence-based classification.
the proposed approach integrates sequence homology data with topological information of metabolic networks.
