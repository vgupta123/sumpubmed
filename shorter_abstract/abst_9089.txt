otophryninae is distantly related to all other new world microhylids that were recovered as a monophyletic group, gastrophryninae.
this hypothesis of relationships and updated classification for new world microhylids may serve as a guide to better understand the evolutionary history of this group that is apparently subject to convergent morphological evolution and chromosome reduction.
based on a divergence analysis calibrated with hypotheses from previous studies and fossil data, it appears that microhylid genera inhabiting the new world originated during a period of gradual cooling from the late oligocene to mid miocene.
we observed a close relationship between synapturanus and otophryne of the subfamily otophryninae.
one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes  were sequenced to assess phylogenetic relationships.
specifically, we placed an emphasis on assessing relationships among new world genera and those taxa with uncertain phylogenetic affinities .
we utilized an unprecedented sampling of  <dig> microhylid taxa representing 91% of currently recognized subfamilies and 95% of new world genera.
our analyses do not fully resolve relationships among subfamilies supporting previous studies that have suggested a rapid early diversification of this clade.
