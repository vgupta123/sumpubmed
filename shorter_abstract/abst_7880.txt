prestimulus eeg alpha activity in humans has been considered to reflect ongoing top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks.
since task-differences were reflected in both theta and alpha activities prior to stimulus onset, both prestimulus theta  and prestimulus alpha  activities may reflect prestimulus top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks.
we observed a relationship between both anterior theta and posterior alpha power in the prestimulus period and the type of subsequent task.
since theta oscillations may be related to poststimulus top-down processing, we investigated whether prestimulus eeg theta activity also reflects top-down cognitive preparation for a stimulus.
