precision in identification was substantially improved by use of data from multiple tissues and treatments.
we also discriminate several common carp genes and gene isoforms that were not discriminated by blast sequence alignment alone.
it benefits from the use of multiple treatments or contrasts, and from the large-scale microarray data.
for the common carp, an environmental model of aquacultural interest, large numbers of ests remained unidentified using blast sequence alignment.
sequence identification of ests from non-model species offers distinct challenges particularly when these species have duplicated genomes and when they are phylogenetically distant from sequenced model organisms.
the detailed analysis of co-expression landscapes is a sensitive technique for suggesting an identity for the large number of blast unidentified cdnas generated in est projects.
this was based on the pearsons correlation coefficient relating each gene with all other genes, from which a network description provided clusters of highly correlated genes as 'mountains'.
we have used the expression profiles from large-scale microarray experiments to suggest gene identities.
expression profiles from ~ <dig> cdna microarrays describing responses of  <dig> major tissues to multiple environmental stressors were used to define a co-expression landscape.
it is capable of detecting even subtle changes in expression profiles, and thereby of distinguishing genes with a common blast identity into different identities.
