in order to chart the phylogenetic distribution of individual snorna families in plants, we applied a sophisticated approach for identifying homologs of known plant snornas across the plant kingdom.
many of the plant snorna families comprise paralogs.
we also found that targets are well-conserved for most snorna families.
they fall into two classes, box c/d snornas and box h/aca snornas, which are clearly distinguished by conserved sequence motifs and the type of chemical modification that they govern.
in response to the relatively fast evolution of snornas, information on conserved sequence boxes, target sequences, and secondary structure is combined to identify additional snornas.
plant snornas are frequently organized in highly conserved spatial clusters.
their main function is to target chemical modifications of ribosomal rnas.
the sequence conservation of snornas is sufficient to establish homologies between phyla.
we identified  <dig> families of snornas in  <dig> species and traced their evolution throughout the plant kingdom.
as a resource for further investigations we provide carefully curated and annotated alignments for each snorna family under investigation.
the degree of this conservation tapers off, however, between land plants and algae.
