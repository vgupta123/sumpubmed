this cross-talk rate corresponded to  <dig>  misassigned reads on a single lane of the illumina hiseq  <dig>  notably, all types of misassignment occur at similar rates: incorrect i <dig>  incorrect i <dig>  and incorrect sequence reads.
this results in a low rate of cross-talk among multiplexed samples and can cause detrimental effects in studies requiring the detection of rare variants or when multiplexing a large number of samples.
cross-talk among multiplexed samples is a significant error mode on the illumina platform, especially if samples are only separated by a single unique index.
multiplexing multiple samples during illumina sequencing is a common practice and is rapidly growing in importance as the throughput of the platform increases.
furthermore, we propose a straightforward method for verifying the extent of cross-talk between samples and optimizing quality score thresholds that does not require additional control samples and can even be performed post hoc on previous runs.
we observed rates of cross-talk averaging  <dig> Â % when multiplexing  <dig> different samples with unique i <dig> and i <dig> index sequences.
quality filtering of index sequences offers an effective solution to minimizing cross-talk among samples.
