in this paper, we employ a novel neighborhood subnetwork alignment approach to identify network components that are potentially involved in pathogenesis.
our module-based subnetwork alignment approach identified  <dig> functional homologs of pathogenesis-related proteins in the malaria parasite p. falciparum, using the protein-protein interaction networks in escherichia coli as references.
eighteen out of these  <dig> proteins are associated with  <dig> other proteins that are related to dna replication, transcriptional regulation, translation, signaling, metabolism, cell cycle regulation, as well as cytoadherence and entry to the host.
the latest report released by the world health organization estimated about  <dig> million cases of malaria infection, and about  <dig>  deaths in  <dig> alone.
the subnetwork alignments and subsequent protein-protein association network mining predicted a group of malarial proteins that may be involved in parasite development and parasite-host interaction, opening a new systems-level view of parasite pathogenesis and virulence.
however, the mechanism of malaria pathogenesis remains largely unknown.
during the past decade, new therapeutic targets have been identified and are at various stages of characterization, thanks to the emerging omics-based technologies.
