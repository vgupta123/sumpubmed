this strain displays secretion-mediated hemolytic activity involving phospholipase c and cyclolipopeptides.
gacs/gaca is a negative regulator of this activity.
we found that mfn <dig> displays a cell-associated hemolytic activity distinct from the secreted hemolytic activity.
we showed that disruption of this operon abolished cell-associated hemolytic activity.
to our knowledge this the first demonstration of cell-associated hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of pseudomonas fluorescens.
precise link between a functional hrpu operon and cell-associated hemolytic activity remains to be elucidated.
mfn <dig> is a clinical pseudomonas fluorescens strain able to grow at 37Â°c.
in contrast to the pseudomonas fluorescens strains pfo- <dig> and pf <dig>  whose genomes have been sequenced, the mfn <dig> strain has the type iii secretion-like genes hrcrst belonging to the hrpu operon.
moreover, this activity seems to be related to a functional hrpu operon and is independent of biosurfactant production.
