to examine this issue, we have created a new mouse resource, a heterogeneous stock  formed from the same eight inbred strains that have been used to create the collaborative cross .
as measured by the wgcna, the modular structure of the transcriptome networks was also preserved both on the basis of module assignment and from the perspective of the topological overlap maps.
the current study focused on the extent genetic diversity within a species  affects gene co-expression network structure.
the eight inbred strains capture > 90% of the genetic diversity available within the species.
despite the marked differences in genetic diversity, the transcriptome structure was remarkably similar for the f <dig>  hs <dig> and hs-cc.
details of the hs-cc gene modules are provided; essentially identical results were obtained for the hs <dig> and f <dig> modules.
a careful examination of the hs-cc transcriptome revealed the expected structure for striatal gene expression.
gene ontology annotation of the modules revealed a significant overrepresentation in some modules for neuronal processes, e.g., central nervous system development.
we also noted significant overlap with markers of central nervous system cell types .
using the allen brain atlas, we found evidence of spatial co-localization within the striatum for several modules.
