rna-seq experiments showed that the truncated form of aae <dig>  integrated in chromosome 5q <dig>  produced a local gene over-expression and a large variety of viral-human fusion transcripts, including long distance spliced transcripts.
finally, in the high-risk variant, we detected a molecular signature of host chromosomal instability, a common property of cancer cells.
having a tropism for mucosal tissues, high-risk hpvs are detected in nearly all cervical cancers.
host genome instability is closely linked to viral integration into the host genome of hpv-infected cells, which is a key phenomenon for malignant cellular transformation and the reason for uncontrolled e <dig> oncogene expression.

in particular, the finding of variant-specific integration potential represents a new paradigm in hpv variant biology.
based on epidemiological studies we chose to examine the hpv <dig> asian-american  and hpv <dig> european prototype  variants.
