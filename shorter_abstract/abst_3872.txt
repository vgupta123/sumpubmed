a highly non-random distribution of nucleotides is observed in the immediate vicinity of edited sites , but no precise consensus motif has been identified.
however, the results suggest that primary sequence data and simple free energy of folding calculations alone are insufficient to make highly accurate predictions.
data for analysis were derived from the the complete mitochondrial genomes of arabidopsis thaliana, brassica napus, and oryza sativa; additionally, a combined data set of observations across all three genomes was generated.
we used tree-based statistical methods and random forests to generate models of c-to-u rna editing based on the nucleotides surrounding the edited/non-edited sites and on the estimated folding energies of those regions.
tree-based statistical methods based on primary sequence data surrounding edited/non-edited sites and estimates of free energy of folding yield models with optimistic re-substitution-based estimates of ~ <dig>  accuracy, ~ <dig>  sensitivity, and ~ <dig>  specificity.
despite substantial study, the molecular biological mechanism by which c-to-u rna editing proceeds remains relatively obscure, although several experimental studies have implicated a role for cis-recognition.
simple models do moderately well in predicting which cytidines will be edited to uridines, and provide the first quantitative predictive models for rna edited sites in plant mitochondria.
rna editing is the process whereby an rna sequence is modified from the sequence of the corresponding dna template.
our analysis shows that the identity of the nucleotide - <dig> to the edited c and the estimated free energy of folding for a  <dig> nt region surrounding the edited c are the most important variables that distinguish most edited from non-edited sites.
