several quantitative trait loci  have been reported for phs resistance, and two of them on chromosome 3as  and 4a have been cloned.
these grain color genes showed significant effects on phs resistance in some environments.
to determine genetic architecture of phs and gc and genetic relationships of the two traits, a genome-wide association study  was conducted by evaluating a panel of  <dig> u.s. elite breeding lines and cultivars for sprouting rates of wheat spikes and gc in both greenhouse and field experiments.
qtl for phs resistance showed varied effects under different environments, and those on chromosomes 3as, 3al, 3b, 4al and 7a were the more frequently identified qtl.
therefore, it is possible to breed phs-resistant white wheat by pyramiding these non-color related qtl.
the common qtl for gc and phs resistance were identified on the long arms of the chromosome 3a and 3d.
the panel was genotyped using the wheat 9k and 90k single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays.
grain color  together with other components affect phs resistance.
four qtl for gc on four chromosomes and  <dig> qtl for phs resistance on  <dig> chromosomes were identified in at least two experiments.
however, several other qtl that did not affect grain color also played a significant role on phs resistance.
wheat grain color is regulated by the three known genes on group  <dig> chromosomes and additional genes from other chromosomes.
