the results indicate that rip <dig> is expressed differentially in retinal neurons in adult rats, including subsets of ganglion cells, amacrine and horizontal cells.
in the present study we determined the expression of rip <dig> in normal rat retina and its changes following acute high intraocular pressure .
rip <dig> expressing cells frequently co-localized with propidium iodide .
western blot analysis confirmed the above time-dependent alteration in rip <dig> protein expression.
rip <dig> immunoreactivity  was largely present in the inner retinal layers, localized to subsets of cells expressing neuron-specific nuclear antigen , parvalbumin and calbindin in the ganglion cell layer  and inner nuclear layer .
evidence suggests that necroptosis may be a mode of neuronal death in the retina.
rip <dig> labeling co-localized with pi, bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> among cells in the ganglion cell layer following ahiop, which suggest its involvement of rip <dig> in neuronal responses to acute ischemic insults.
