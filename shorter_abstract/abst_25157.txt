dep-based network analysis also revealed the hiv- <dig> stage-specific network modules; the main biological processes were related to “translation,” “rna splicing,” “mrna, rna, and nucleic acid transport,” and “dna metabolism.” through the hiv- <dig> stage-related modules, changing stage-specific patterns of protein interactions could be observed.
and the score has higher absolute value if expression-changing ratios are similar between the two genes.
our approach distinguishes each sample using differentially co-expressed interacting protein pairs  based on co-expression scores of individual interacting pairs within a sample.
the co-expression score has positive value if two genes in a sample are simultaneously up-regulated or down-regulated.
the method can identify a genetic signature for a single sample as contrasted with existing protein-protein-based analyses with correlational designs.
