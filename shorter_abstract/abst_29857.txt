the system is implemented with smith-waterman as protein distance measurement and optics at its core to perform protein sequence clustering.
it is a promising protein sequence clustering method with future possible improvement on parallel computing and other protein distance measurements.
protein sequence clustering has been widely used as a part of the analysis of protein structure and function.
optics  is an attractive approach due to its emphasis on visualization of results and support for interactive work, e.g., in choosing parameters.
analysis of the results demonstrates that seqoptics performs better based on some evaluation criteria including jaccard coefficient, precision, and recall.
however, optics has not been used, as far as we know, for protein sequence clustering.
