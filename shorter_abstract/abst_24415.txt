understanding the molecular bases of freezing tolerance is of great interest for breeding programs.
the present study aimed to identify positional candidate genes for a major freezing tolerance quantitative trait locus that was previously mapped to m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  using the lr <dig> population derived from a cross between the freezing-tolerant accession f83005- <dig> and the freezing-sensitive accession dza045- <dig>
unique features characterizing cbf/dreb <dig> genes from m. truncatula, such as alternative splicing and large tandem duplication, are elucidated for the first time.
furthermore, cbf/dreb <dig> related data will certainly have a large impact on research studies targeting this group of transcriptional activators in m. truncatula and other legume species.
twenty positional candidate genes including twelve c-repeat binding factor /dehydration-responsive element binding factor  <dig>  genes were identified from bac-derived sequences and whole-genome shotgun sequences .
is an annual temperate forage legume that has been chosen as a model species for agronomically and economically important legume crops.
cbf/dreb <dig> genes are organized in a tandem array within an approximately 296-kb region.
the confidence interval of mt-ftqtl <dig> was narrowed down to the region comprised between markers mtic <dig> and nt <dig> using recombinant f <dig> and f <dig> lines.
