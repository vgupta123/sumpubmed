association with non-cognates resulted in decreased fitness, virulence, and bacterial carriage of the nematode-bacterial pairings.
non-cognate nematode-bacteria pairings result in reductions for multiple measures of success, including total progeny production and virulence.
entomopathogenic nematodes and their bacterial symbionts are a useful, tractable, and reliable model for testing hypotheses regarding the evolution, maintenance, persistence, and fate of mutualisms.

together steinernema nematodes and their bacterial symbionts successfully infect, kill, utilize, and exit their insect hosts.
finally, we show that steinernema nematodes can distinguish heterospecific and some conspecific non-cognate symbionts in behavioral choice assays.
steinernema-xenorhabdus symbioses are tightly governed by partner recognition and fidelity.
additionally, nematode infective juveniles carry fewer bacterial cells when colonized by a non-cognate symbiont.
this interaction can be complicated when two different nematodes co-infect an insect host.
