based on a related causality graph, an algorithm was developed to propose a reasonable set of upstream regulators from lists of target molecules.
the proposed upstream regulators are the transcription factors themselves and protein complexes, so that a multi-level description of how cell metabolism is regulated is obtained.
this study aimed at developing an automatic method to propose a reasonable number of upstream regulatory candidates from lists of various regulated molecules by confronting experimental data with encyclopedic information.
this method proposes a reasonable number of regulatory candidates for lists of input molecules that may include transcripts of genes and metabolites.
a new formalism of regulated reactions combining biochemical transformations and regulatory effects was proposed to unify the different mechanisms contained in knowledge libraries.
by testing  <dig> lists of target genes as inputs, each with a known solution, the success of the method to provide the expected transcription factor among  <dig> or  <dig> proposed regulatory candidates, was evaluated to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the situations, respectively.
the efficiency of the method in merging reactions and regulations was also illustrated by identifying gene candidates participating in glucose homeostasis from an input list of metabolites involved in cell glycolysis.
the benefit of this strategy was proved by identifying ppar isotypes and their partners as the upstream regulators of a list of experimentally-identified targets of ppara, a pivotal transcriptional factor in lipid oxidation.

an additional prioritization among candidates might be further realized by adding functional ontology information.
the proposed candidates participated in various biological functions that further enriched the original information.
