we demonstrate that a covariance-based method yields a fast, reliable, automated measurement of c. elegans motility which can replace the far more time-consuming, manual method.
the "thrashing assay", in which nematodes are placed in liquid and the frequency of lateral swimming  movements estimated, is a well-established method for measuring motility in the genetic model organism caenorhabditis elegans as well as in parasitic nematodes.
furthermore, the algorithm successfully measured the actions of levamisole on a parasitic nematode, haemonchus contortus, which undergoes complex contorted shapes whilst swimming, without alterations in the code or of any parameters, indicating that it is applicable to different nematode species, including parasitic nematodes.
the absence of a morphometry step means that the method can be applied to any nematode that swims in liquid and, together with its speed, this simplicity lends itself to deployment in large-scale chemical and genetic screens.
the algorithm used also enabled us to determine a dose-dependent inhibition of thrashing frequency by the anthelmintic drug, levamisole, illustrating the suitability of the system for assaying the effects of drugs and chemicals on motility.
we tested the performance of our covariance method in measuring thrashing rates of worms using mutations that affect motility and found that it accurately substituted for laborious, manual measurements over a wide range of thrashing rates.
our method uses principal components analysis to remove the background, followed by computation of a covariance matrix of the remaining image frames from which the interval between statistically-similar frames is estimated.
