detailed genomic descriptions and comparisons of the three phages are presented, as well as two new clusters of phage genomes in the viral orthologous clusters database of large dna viruses.
composting is a microbial-driven process in which complex organic matter is converted into humus-like substances.
using pseudomonas aeruginosa as host, we isolated three new phages from a composting operation at the sao paulo zoo park .
the other two isolated phages are similar to each other and present genomes sharing low similarity with phage genomes in public databases; we therefore hypothesize that they belong to a new genus in the podoviridae family.
the results about the newly discovered and described phages contribute to the understanding of tailed bacteriophage diversity, evolution, and role in the complex composting environment.
infection tests on  <dig> different strains of bacteria reveal a narrow host range for the three phages, restricted to p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and three other p. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
among viruses, bacteriophages are a group of special interest due to their capacity of infecting bacteria that are important for biotechnology and human health.
