the onco-i2b <dig> platform is a bioinformatics tool designed to integrate clinical and research data and support translational research in oncology.
onco-i2b <dig> is a concrete example of how integrated information and communication technology architecture can be implemented to support translational research.
the next steps of our project will involve the extension of its capabilities by implementing new plug-in devoted to bioinformatics data analysis as well as a temporal query module.
onco-i2b <dig> manages data of more than  <dig>  patients with breast cancer diagnosis collected between  <dig> and  <dig> , more than  <dig>  visits and  <dig>  observations over  <dig> medical concepts.
i2b <dig> has delivered an open source suite based on a data warehouse, which is efficiently interrogated to find sets of interesting patients through a query tool interface.
onco-i2b <dig> gathers data from the fsm pathology unit  database and from the hospital biobank and merges them with the clinical information from the hospital information system.
our main effort was to provide a robust integrated research environment, giving a particular emphasis to the integration process and facing different challenges, consecutively listed: biospecimen samples privacy and anonymization; synchronization of the biobank database with the i2b <dig> data warehouse through a series of extract, transform, load  operations; development and integration of a natural language processing  module, to retrieve coded information, such as snomed terms and malignant tumors  classifications, and clinical tests results from unstructured medical records.
i2b <dig> data are then stored in a data warehouse, where facts are hierarchically structured as ontologies.
