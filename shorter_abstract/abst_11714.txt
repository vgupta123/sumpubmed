while diverse bacterial and protistan communities are reported from some dhab haloclines and brines, loriciferans are the only metazoan reported to inhabit the anoxic dhab brines.
our goal was to further investigate metazoan communities in dhab haloclines and brines.
nematode abundance data, in some cases determined from direct counts of sediments incubated in situ with celltrackertm green, was patchy but generally indicates the highest abundances in either normoxic control samples or in upper halocline samples; nematodes were absent or very rare in lower halocline samples.
we document a community of living nematodes in normoxic, normal saline deep-sea mediterranean sediments and in the upper halocline portions of the dhabs.
the majority of rrna sequences were from planktonic taxa, suggesting that at least some individual metazoans were preserved and inactive.
occurrences of nematodes in mid-halocline and lower halocline samples did not provide compelling evidence of a living community in those zones.
the deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins  of the mediterranean  are some of the most extreme oceanic habitats known.
ultrastructural analysis indicates the nematodes in l’atalante normoxic control sediments were fit, while specimens from l’atalante upper halocline were healthy or had only recently died and those from the lower halocline had no identifiable organelles.
loriciferans, which were only rarely encountered, were found in both normoxic control samples as well as in discovery and l’atalante haloclines.
