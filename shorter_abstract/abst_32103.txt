alveoli, the milk-producing units of the mammary gland, are generated during pregnancy by collaboration of different epithelial cell types.
we harvested mammary glands from virgin, 3-day and 7-day pregnant mice and isolated a few hundred hormone-sensing cells per animal by facs for microarray analysis.

we recently showed that igf <dig> is produced specifically by hr+ cells in early pregnancy, but is undetectable in the virgin state.
here, we define the transcriptome of hr+ cells in early pregnancy with the aim to elucidate additional changes that are unique for this dynamic developmental time window.
hormone-receptor positive  cells play a key role in the initiation of alveologenesis as they sense systemic hormonal changes and translate these into local instructions for neighboring hr- cells.
there was a high concordance between animals with a clear induction of cell cycle progression genes at day  <dig> of pregnancy and molecules involved in paracrine signalling at day  <dig>
we present the first analysis of transcriptional changes within the hormone sensing population during pregnancy.
these findings underscore the proliferative capacity of hr+ cells upon specific stimuli and elucidate developmentally-restricted changes in cellular communication.
since the majority of breast cancers are hr+, with a variable proportion of hr+ cells per tumor, we anticipate that this data set will aid further studies into the regulation of hr+ cell proliferation and the role of heterotypic signalling within tumors.
