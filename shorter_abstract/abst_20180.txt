this result provides some useful guidelines for the analysis of complex designs.
these procedures are compared with the usual ml and reml mixed model procedures proposed in most statistical toolboxes, on both simulated and real data.
in individually dye-balanced microarray designs, each biological sample is hybridized on two different slides, once with cy <dig> and once with cy <dig>  while this strategy ensures an automatic correction of the gene-specific labelling bias, it also induces dependencies between log-ratio measurements that must be taken into account in the statistical analysis.
we present two original statistical procedures for the statistical analysis of individually balanced designs.
