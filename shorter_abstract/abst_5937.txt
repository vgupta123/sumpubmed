however, the role of ecm/integrin interaction in the formation of embryoid bodies  during cardiogenesis from murine induced pluripotent stem cells  remains unclear.
these findings indicate that collagen/β <dig> integrin interaction is required for the growth and cardiac differentiation of mipsc-derived ebs and will be helpful in future engineering of the matrix microenvironment within ebs to efficiently direct the cardiac fate of pluripotent stem cells to promote cardiovascular regeneration.
in the present study, collagen type i and β <dig> integrin were expressed and upregulated synergistically during the formation of mipsc-derived ebs, with a peak expression at day  <dig> of differentiation.
the quantification of spontaneous beating activity, cardiac-specific gene expression and cardiac troponin t  immunostaining showed that the cardiac differentiation of these defective mipsc-derived ebs was lower than that of control ebs.
