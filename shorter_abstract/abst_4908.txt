the specific ubc used during ubiquitination can determine the type of polyubiquitin chain linkage, which in turn plays an important role in determining the fate of the ubiquitinated protein.
thus, ubcs may serve an important role in the cellular response to misfolded proteins and the fate of protein aggregates.
rnai of ubc- <dig>  a nematode homolog of e2-25k, resulted in higher pre-aggregation levels of q82::gfp and a faster initial aggregation rate relative to control.
when measured with time-lapse microscopy in young larvae, the initial formation of individual q82::gfp aggregates occurs in approximately  <dig> minutes.
in fact, the presence of ubiquitin at protein aggregates is a common feature of protein misfolding diseases.
the q <dig> strain of c. elegans harbors a transgene encoding an aggregation prone tract of  <dig> glutamine residues fused to green fluorescent protein  that is expressed in the body wall muscle.
this process is largely unaffected by a mutation in the c. elegans e <dig> ubiquitin activating enzyme.
these data indicate that initial formation of q82::gfp aggregates in c. elegans is not directly dependent on ubiquitination, but is more likely a spontaneous process driven by biophysical properties in the cytosol such as the concentration of the aggregating species.
ubiquitin conjugating enzymes  are part of the cascade of enzymes responsible for the regulated attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates.
knockdown of ubc- <dig> , ubc- <dig>  and uev- <dig> did not affect the kinetics of initial aggregation.
however, rnai of ubc- <dig> decreases the rate of secondary growth of the aggregate.
mcherry::ubiquitin becomes localized to q82::gfp aggregates during the fourth larval  stage of life, a time point long after most aggregates have formed.
the cell has a variety of mechanisms for coping with misfolded protein stress, including ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.
