medicinal property of the species is attributed to the presence of podophyllotoxin in the rhizome tissue.
the present work analyzed transcriptome of rhizome tissue of s. hexandrum exposed to 15°c and 25°c to understand the temperature mediated molecular responses including those associated with podophyllotoxin biosynthesis.
fpkm data was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data using a total of thirty four genes and a positive correlation between the two platforms of gene expression was obtained.
also, detailed analyses yielded cytochrome p450s, methyltransferases and glycosyltransferases which could be the potential candidate hitherto unidentified genes of podophyllotoxin biosynthesis pathway.
data suggested expression of genes for growth and development and podophyllotoxin biosynthesis at 15°c, and prevalence of those associated with stress response at 25°c.
deep sequencing of transcriptome with an average coverage of  <dig> x yielded  <dig>  assembled transcript sequences representing  <dig>  unique genes having homology to known genes.
the present work revealed temperature responsive transcriptome of s. hexandrum on illumina platform.
fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped  based expression analysis revealed genes related to growth and development were over-expressed at 15°c, whereas genes involved in stress response were over-expressed at 25°c.

there was a decreasing trend of podophyllotoxin accumulation at 25°c; data was well supported by the expression of corresponding genes of the pathway.
sinopodophyllum hexandrum is an endangered medicinal herb, which is commonly present in elevations ranging between  <dig> – <dig>  m and is sensitive to temperature.
