structural comparisons reveal that the active site of α and γ forms are covered by aliphatic amino acids, and the β form has a highly conserved aromatic residue in this position.
minor conformational changes at the active site of α, β and γ forms can produce type- <dig> copper proteins with capacities to either carry oxygen , oxidize diphenols  or o-hydroxylate monophenols  and appear to underlie some functional convergences.
tyrosinases, tyrosinase-related proteins, catechol oxidases and hemocyanins comprise the type- <dig> copper protein family and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including pigment formation, innate immunity and oxygen transport.
the subsequent evolution of this gene family in modern lineages of multicellular eukaryotes is typified by the loss of one or more of these three subclasses and the lineage-specific expansion of one or both of the remaining subclasses.
the former duplication gave rise to a cytosolic form  and the latter to a membrane-bound form .
