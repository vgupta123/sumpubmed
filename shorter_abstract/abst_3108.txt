importantly, the high rate of aneuploidy encountered in parthenogenetic embryos activated by certain chemical means was not observed in plcz <dig> activated embryos.
mouse and bovine plcz <dig> crnas were injected into matured bovine oocytes at different concentrations.
we tested the hypothesis that plcz <dig> crna injection can be used to activate bovine oocytes.
within the concentrations tested, mouse plcz <dig> injection activated bovine oocytes at a maximum rate when the pipette concentration of crna ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/μl, while bovine plcz <dig> was optimal at  <dig>  μg/μl.
injection of plcz <dig> crna efficiently activated bovine oocytes by inducing a sperm-like calcium oscillatory pattern.
at their most effective concentrations, plcz <dig> induced parthenogenetic development at rates similar to those observed using other activation stimuli such as ionomycin/chx and ionomycin/dmap.
during natural fertilization, sperm fusion with the oocyte induces long lasting intracellular calcium oscillations which in turn are responsible for oocyte activation.
