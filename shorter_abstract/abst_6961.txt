the resulting orthology predictions serve as the data basis for a variety of evolutionary studies.
a case study on the phylogeny of  <dig> fungal taxa illustrates that hamstr is well suited to compile informative data sets for phylogenomic studies from ests and protein sequence data.
in the same fashion hamstr can be applied to protein sequence data, and thus provides a comprehensive approach to compile ortholog cluster from any protein coding data.
we show that the hamstr results are consistent with those obtained with existing orthology prediction methods that require completely sequenced genomes.
existing methods either depend on a known species tree or cannot cope with redundancy in est data.
we present a novel approach  to mine est data for the presence of orthologs to a curated set of genes.
hamstr combines a profile hidden markov model search and a subsequent blast search to extend existing ortholog cluster with sequences from further taxa.
however, we envision that studies tracing the evolutionary fate of individual genes or functional complexes of genes will greatly benefit from hamstr orthology predictions as well.
the widespread use of ests in evolutionary studies and particularly in molecular systematics studies is still hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable approaches for automated ortholog predictions in ests.
