transcription factors binding to the cyclicamp response element  are known to regulate these processes.
in addition, atf <dig> mrna levels are increased in response to cytochalasin d treatment, an inducer of chondrocyte maturation.
here we demonstrate that overexpression of atf <dig> in primary mouse chondrocytes results in reduced transcription of both genes, as well as decreased activity of a cre reporter plasmid.
our data suggest that transcriptional induction of the atf <dig> gene in maturing chondrocytes results in down-regulation of cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a expression as well as activation of runx2-dependent transcription.
therefore, atf <dig> induction appears to facilitate cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes.
here we demonstrate that atf <dig> mrna levels increase during mouse chondrocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo.
one member of this family, activating tanscription factor  <dig> , is expressed during skeletogenesis and acts as a transcriptional repressor, but the function of this protein in chondrogenesis is unknown.
