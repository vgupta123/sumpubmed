here, we report the first genomic analysis of p. aeruginosa isolates sampled from italian cf patients.
many of the identified mutations were located in pathoadaptive genes previously associated with host adaptation, and we correlated mutations with changes in cf-relevant phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance.
by genome sequencing of  <dig> isolates sampled over 19Â years from four patients, we elucidated the within-host evolution of clonal lineages in each individual patient.
chronic infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis  patients, and a more complete understanding of p. aeruginosa within-host genomic evolution, transmission, and population genomics may provide a basis for improving intervention strategies.
furthermore, we compared the genomes of the italian cf isolates to a panel of genome sequenced strains of p. aeruginosa from other countries.
isolates from two of the italian lineages belonged to clonal complexes of p. aeruginosa that have previously been identified in danish cf patients, and our genomic comparison showed that clonal isolates from the same country may be more distantly related than clonal isolates from different countries.
this is the first whole-genome analysis of p. aeruginosa isolated from italian cf patients, and together with both phenotypic and clinical information this dataset facilitates a more detailed understanding of p. aeruginosa within-host genomic evolution, transmission, and population genomics.
in addition, the genomic analysis revealed that three patients shared the same clone.
