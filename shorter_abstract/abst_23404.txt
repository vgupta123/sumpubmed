the influence of network size may indicate that scaling up findings on social behaviour from small populations to larger ones will be difficult.
through the use of exponential random graph models , we found that the networks in any given year were able to predict the structure of networks in other years for some network characteristics.

there has been growing interest in the potential to capture these interactions in the form of a social network.
however, in the context of selection and evolution, the utility of this approach relies on social network structures persisting across generations.
we constructed social networks for six annual generations over a period of eight years for a wild population of the cricket gryllus campestris.
our results indicate that cricket social network structure resists the turnover of individuals and is stable across generations.
this is an assumption that has been difficult to test because networks spanning multiple generations have not been available.
this would allow evolutionary processes that rely on network structure to take place.
instead, the capacity of a network model to predict the structure of a network in another year depended on the similarity in population size between those years.
such networks can then be used to examine how relationships among individuals affect ecological and evolutionary processes.
