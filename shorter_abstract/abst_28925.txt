however, the degree to which we can extend in vitro results to in vivo activity and possible mechanisms of action remains to be fully addressed.
similarly modulated common pathways were identified between in vitro and in vivo.
the results of our investigation of tnt effects on gene expression in liver suggest that gene regulatory networks obtained from an in vitro system can predict in vivo function and mechanisms.
evolution of toxicity testing is predicated upon using in vitro cell based systems to rapidly screen and predict how a chemical might cause toxicity to an organ in vivo.
here we use the nitroaromatic  <dig> ,6-trinitrotoluene  as a model chemical to compare and determine how we might extrapolate from in vitro data to in vivo effects.
the major functional term corresponding to these transcripts was cell cycle.
interestingly, all  <dig> genes in the pttg <dig> module were involved in cell cycle and downregulated by tnt both in vitro and in vivo.
furthermore, we uncovered the conserved common transcriptional gene regulatory networks between in vitro and in vivo cellular liver systems that responded to tnt exposure, which mainly contain  <dig> subnetwork modules: pttg <dig> and pir centered networks.
