acinetobacter baumannii, a significant nosocomial pathogen, has evolved resistance to almost all conventional antimicrobial drugs.
moreover, when zz <dig> alone was incubated at different phs and different temperatures, the phage was stable over a wide ph range  and at extreme temperatures .
in this study, one lytic bacteriophage, zz <dig>  which infects a. baumannii and has a broad host range, was selected for characterization.
bacteriophage therapy is a potential alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
most of the predicted orfs of the phage were similar to the predicted orfs from other acinetobacter phages.
several aspects of the life cycle of zz <dig> were investigated using the sensitive strain ab09v under optimal growth conditions.
phage zz <dig> and  <dig> of its natural hosts, a. baumanni clinical isolates ab09v, ab <dig>  and ab <dig>  are described in this study.
bioinformatic analysis of the phage whole genome sequence further suggested that zz <dig> was more likely to be a new member of the myoviridae phages.
morphologically, it could be classified as a member of the myoviridae family and the caudovirales order.
zz <dig> is highly infectious with a short latent period  and a large burst size .
zz <dig> possesses a 100-nm icosahedral head containing double-stranded dna with a total length of  <dig>  bp and a 120-nm long contractile tail.
the phage zz <dig> has a relatively broad lytic spectrum, high ph stability, strong heat resistance, and efficient antibacterial potential at body temperature.
it exhibited the most powerful antibacterial activity at temperatures ranging from 35°c to 39°c.
