here we determined the relative efficiencies of hiv- <dig> binding and infection in human fetal astrocytes , mainly at the single cell level, using hiv- <dig> tagged with green fluorescence protein -vpr fusion proteins, termed hiv-gfp, to detect virus binding and hiv- <dig> expressing rev and nefgfp fusion proteins to detect productive infection.
astrocytes respond to hiv- <dig> binding by rapidly increased cytokine production suggesting a role of this virus-brain cell interaction in hiv- <dig> neuropathogenesis.
our results indicate that hiv- <dig> binding to human astrocytes, although extensive, is not generally followed by virus entry and replication.
essentially all hfa in a population bound hiv-gfp specifically and independently of ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  the dynamics of this binding at 37Â°c resembled binding of an hiv fusion mutant to cd4-positive cells, indicating that most of hiv-gfp arrested infection of hfa at the stage of virus-cell fusion.
hiv- <dig> infects human astrocytes in vitro and in vivo but the frequency of infected cells is low and its biological significance is unknown.
in studies in vitro, recombinant gp <dig> alone can induce profound effects on astrocyte biology, suggesting that hiv- <dig> interaction with astrocytes and its functional consequences extend beyond the limited levels of infection in these cells.
