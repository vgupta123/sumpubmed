similar studies must be performed to evaluate the same parameters in other dog breeds of different sizes and skull conformations.
the results of this study might be used to establish normal parameters for labrador retriever dogs and thus help in the diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with alterations of the carotid arteries.
the objective of this study was to register normal values for systolic peak velocity, minimum diastolic velocity, diameter and resistance index of both common carotid arteries of  <dig> healthy labrador retriever dogs between  <dig> and 5 years of age.
there were no statistical differences between the values for the right and left vessels: the systolic peak velocity was  <dig>  ± 16 cm/s, minimum diastolic velocity was  <dig>  ± 4 cm/s, common carotid diameter was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm, and resistance index was  <dig>  ±  <dig> .
hence, dus examination might aid in the differential diagnosis of neurological disorders of ischemic origin, among other causes.
by gathering these values, we might be able to improve the sensitivity of hemodynamic studies in clinically important brain disorders.
