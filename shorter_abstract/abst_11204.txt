in this study, we investigated temporal chromatin signatures induced by mdv by analyzing early cytolytic and latent phases of infection in the bursa of fabricius of md-resistant and â€“susceptible birds.
finally, several members of the focal adhesion pathway, e.g.
our comprehensive analysis of chromatin signatures, therefore, revealed further clues about the epigenetic effects of mdv infection although further studies are necessary to elucidate the functional implications of the observed variations in histone modifications.
major global variations in chromatin marks were observed at different stages of md in the two lines.
thbs <dig> and itga <dig>  showed marked concordance between gene expression and chromatin marks indicating putative epigenetic regulation in response to mdv infection.
md pathogenesis involves multiple stages including an early cytolytic phase and latency, and transitions between these stages are governed by several host and environmental factors.
differential h3k27me <dig> marks were associated with immune-related pathways, such as map kinase signaling, focal adhesion and neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, and suggested varying degrees of silencing in response to infection.
while multiple gene expression studies have been performed in resistant and susceptible populations, little is known about the epigenetic effects of infection.
gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir-10b, bore chromatin signatures, which suggested their contribution to md-susceptibility.
