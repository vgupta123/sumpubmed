aspergillus nomius is an opportunistic pathogen and one of the three most important producers of aflatoxins in section flavi.
phylogenomic inference shows nrrl  <dig> as ancestral to the other aflatoxigenic species examined from section flavi.
this study provides a preliminary analysis of the a. nomius genome.
given the recently discovered potential for a. nomius to undergo sexual recombination, and based on our findings, this genome sequence provides an additional evolutionary reference point for studying the genetics and biology of aflatoxin production.
this fungus has been reported to contaminate agricultural commodities, but it has also been sampled in non-agricultural areas so the host range is not well known.
having a similar mycotoxin profile as a. parasiticus, isolates of a. nomius are capable of secreting b- and g- aflatoxins.
in this study we discovered that the a. nomius type strain  has a genome size of approximately 36 mb which is comparable to other aspergilli whose genomes have been sequenced.
more than  <dig>  of those predicted genes were identified as unique to a. nomius, and the most significantly enriched go category among the unique genes was oxidoreducatase activity.
