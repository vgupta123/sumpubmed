while nnn triplet parameters provided an adequate model to fit our data, nn doublet parameters did not.
we used singular value decomposition  to fit experimental data from our laboratory in which phosphorothioate-modified antisense dnas   <dig> nucleotides long were used to inhibit cellular protein expression in  <dig> experiments involving four gene targets and two cell lines.
data were fitted using a nnn model, neglecting end effects, to derive nnn inhibition parameters that could be combined to give parameters for a set of  <dig> sequences that represents the inhibitory effects of all possible overlapping triplet interactions in the cellular targets of these antisense s-dnas.
the enumeration of tetrameric and other sequence motifs that are positively or negatively correlated with in vivo antisense dna effects has been a useful addition to the arsenal of information needed to predict effective targets for antisense dna control of gene expression.
these problems are circumvented by a next-nearest-neighbor  analysis of antisense dna effects in which the overlapping nature of nearest-neighbors is taken into account.
this procedure is more robust than the tallying of tetrameric motifs that have positive or negative antisense effects.
such retrospective information derived from in vivo cellular experiments characterizes aspects of the sequence dependence of antisense inhibition that are not predicted by nearest-neighbor  thermodynamic parameters derived from in vitro experiments.
we also show that parameters to describe subsets of the data, such as the mrnas being targeted and the cell lines used, can be included in such a derivation.
