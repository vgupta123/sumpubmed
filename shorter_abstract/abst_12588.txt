to date, there have been no reports of mirnas in t. multiceps.
in this study, we obtained  <dig>  million high quality raw reads from adult t. multiceps small rna library using illumina sequencing technology.
among these, six corresponding t. multiceps mirnas are considered specific for taeniidae because no homologs were found in other species annotated in mirbase.
in addition,  <dig>  target sites within t. multiceps transcriptome were predicted for  <dig> candidate newly mirnas.
our large-scale investigation of mirnas in adult t. multiceps provides a substantial platform for improving our understanding of the molecular regulation of t. multiceps and other cestodes development.
furthermore,  <dig> candidate novel mirna precursors were verified by genomic pcr.
micrornas  have important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of a large number of animal genes by imperfectly binding target mrnas.
a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families  from  <dig>  unique mirnas were characterized using mirbase .
