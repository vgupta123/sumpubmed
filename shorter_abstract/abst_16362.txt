epigenetic analysis of the 5â€™-flanking region of the hsd17b <dig> gene showed that there was little 5-methylcytosine  in a normal male, and that none of cpg dinucleotides in the cpg island approached 50% methylation in females.
the hypomethylation of the cpg island provides additional evidence for the variable escape of the hsd17b <dig> gene from x-chromosome inactivation which could influence the range of severity of hsd <dig> deficiency, an inherited error in isoleucine metabolism, in heterozygous females.

however, accurate information about its several transcripts is still lacking, and additional evidence for its escape from x-chromosome inactivation remains to be obtained in order to help settle a debate .
its transcripts result from a slippery transcription complex.
the actual length of first exon of the hsd17b <dig> gene was found to be about a quarter larger than that originally reported.
expression of this gene is also elevated significantly in colonic mucosa of the inactive ulcerative colitis patients.
