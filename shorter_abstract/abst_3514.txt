the specific signal factors gaba and succinic semialdehyde  activated gabt expression, whereas gaba- and ssa-inducible gabt transcription was abolished in sigl and gabr mutants.
gabr positively regulates the expression of the gabt gene of the gab gene cluster, which is responsible for the γ-aminobutyric acid  shunt.
repression is released upon gaba addition, whereupon transcription is induced.
deletion of the pas domain of gabr resulted in increased gabt transcriptional activity, both in the presence and absence of gaba.
gabt transcription is induced by gaba and ssa, and inducible expression is dependent on sigl and activated by gabr.
the pas domain in gabr is repressing its enhancer transcriptional activity on the gabt promoter.
bacillus thuringiensis gabr is a sigma 54-dependent transcriptional activator containing three typical domains, an n-terminal regulatory domain per-arnt-sim , a central aaa+  domain and a c-terminal helix-turn-helix  dna binding domain.

this study identified the gabr-binding site on the gabt promoter; however, gabr does not bind to its own promoter.
purified gabr was shown to specifically bind to a repeat region that mapped 58 bp upstream of the gabt start codon.
