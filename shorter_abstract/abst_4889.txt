moreover, the speed of our gpu-based algorithms can be almost linearly increased when using more than one graphics card.
the article shows that the backtracking procedure of the sequence alignment algorithms may be designed to fit in with the gpu architecture.
these solutions show a great potential of a gpu platform but in most cases address the problem of sequence database scanning and computing only the alignment score whereas the alignment itself is omitted.
in this paper we present the solution that performs the alignment of every given sequence pair, which is a required step for progressive multiple sequence alignment methods, as well as for dna recognition at the dna assembly stage.
