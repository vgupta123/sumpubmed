here, the simple sequence repeat  marker technique was used to study genetic diversity of rootstocks and scions in ancient olive trees from the levant and its implications for past cultivation of olives.
genetic diversity values were much higher among suckers than among scions, and  <dig> and  <dig> multi-locus genotypes  were found in the two sample groups, respectively.
for the majority of grafted trees it seems likely that saplings were used as rootstocks; their genetic diversity probably is best explained as the result of a long history of sexual reproduction involving cultivated, feral and wild genotypes.
our results provide strong evidence that the majority of olive trees in the study are grafted, that the large majority of scions belong to a single ancient cultivar containing somatic mutations, and that the widespread occurrence of one sucker genotype may imply rootstock selection.
only five private alleles were found among scions, but  <dig> among suckers.
leaf samples were collected from tree canopies  and shoots growing from the trunk base .
past clonal propagation of olive trees is intimately linked to grafting.
however, evidence on grafting in ancient trees is scarce, and not much is known about the source of plant material used for rootstocks.
a frequency analysis revealed a bimodal distribution of genetic distance among mlgs, indicating the presence of somatic mutations within clones.
