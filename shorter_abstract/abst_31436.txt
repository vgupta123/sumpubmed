deletion of ubx <dig> in yeast causes cycloheximide sensitivity, while ubx <dig> cdc48- <dig> double mutations cause proteasome mislocalization.
the central area in aspl, containing both a shp box and a ubx domain, is required for binding to the p <dig> n-domain.
its putative yeast orthologue, ubx <dig>  is important for proteasome localization, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation , and uv-induced degradation of rna polymerase.
in mammalian cells, aspl is involved in insulin-stimulated redistribution of the glucose transporter glut <dig> and assembly of the golgi apparatus.
knock-down of aspl does not impair degradation of misfolded secretory proteins via the erad pathway.
in addition, aspl interacts in vitro with nsf, another hexameric atpase complex.
