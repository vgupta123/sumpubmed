the latter’s assembly yielded > <dig>  transcripts, with over  <dig> transcripts uniquely or more highly expressed in specific midgut sections.
the differential gene expression between the two midgut sections provides the first molecular hints as to their function in living phasmids.
if these expressed genes are translated into active enzymes, then phasmids can theoretically break plant cell walls into their monomer components independently of microbial symbionts.
sequence alignments revealed catalytic sites on most pcwde transcripts.
they represent an ideal system for investigating the adaptations necessary for obligate folivory, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes .
we de novo assembled transcriptomes for the anterior and posterior midguts of six diverse phasmatodea species, with rna-seq on one exemplar species, peruphasma schultei.
while most phasmid pcwde genes showed homology with those of other insects, the pectinases were homologous to bacterial genes.
stick and leaf insects  are an exclusively leaf-feeding order of insects with no record of omnivory, unlike other “herbivorous” polyneoptera.
these genes were also found in genomic dna from phasmid brain tissue, suggesting endogenous production.
two to three dozen pcwde encoding gene families, including cellulases and pectinases, were differentially expressed in the anterior midgut.
