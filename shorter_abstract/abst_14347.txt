taken together, our data not only provided new information for identification of novel genes from marine vertebrates, but also shed new light on the understanding of defense mechanisms of marine fish to viral pathogens.
comparative expression analysis indicated that certain genes associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase , chemokine, toll-like receptor and rig-i signaling pathway were alternated in response to sgiv infection.
limited available information on the genomics of e. coioides has hampered the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie host-virus interactions.
further kegg analysis revealed that pathways, including cellular metabolism and intracellular immune signaling, existed in the control and infected libraries.
among the  <dig> clusters of orthologous group  categories, the cluster for "translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis" represented the largest group in the control  and infected  libraries.
furthermore, the alterations of predicted gene expression patterns reflected possible responses of these fish to the virus infection.
in this study, we used a  <dig> pyrosequencing method to investigate differentially-expressed genes in the spleen of the e. coioides infected with singapore grouper iridovirus .
this study provided abundant ests that could contribute greatly to disclosing novel genes in marine fish.
moreover, changes in the pattern of gene expression were validated by qrt-pcr, including cytokines, cytokine receptors, and transcription factors, apoptosis-associated genes, and interferon related genes.
orange-spotted grouper  is an economically important marine fish cultured in china and southeast asian countries.
