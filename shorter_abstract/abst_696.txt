our study provides strong support for diphyly of nectarivorous phyllostomids.
our phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the nectarivorous genera lonchophylla and lionycteris are closer related to mainly frugivorous phyllostomids of the subfamilies rhinophyllinae, stenodermatinae, carolliinae, and the insectivorous glyphonycterinae rather than to nectarivorous bats of the glossophaginae.
this taxon includes species that are highly specialized on insects, blood, small vertebrates, fruits or nectar, and pollen.
molecular clock analysis revealed a relatively short time frame of about ten million years for the divergence of subfamilies.
several attempts were made to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this family in order to reconstruct the evolutionary transitions accompanied by nutritional specialization.
