the salmon louse is an ectoparasitic copepod that causes major economic losses in the aquaculture industry of atlantic salmon.
cortisol reduced expression of genes encoding proteins involved in formation of various tissue structures, regulators of cell differentiation and growth factors.
this host displays a high level of susceptibility to lice which can be accounted for by several factors including stress.
down-regulation of collagens and other structural proteins was in parallel with the induction of proteinases that degrade extracellular matrix .
in addition, the parasite itself acts as a potent stressor of the host, and outcomes of infection can depend on biotic and abiotic factors that stimulate production of cortisol.
cortisol and lice equally down-regulated a large panel of motor proteins that can be important for wound contraction.
cortisol stimulated expression of genes involved in metabolism of steroids and amino acids, chaperones, responses to oxidative stress and eicosanoid metabolism and suppressed genes related to antigen presentation, b and t cells, antiviral and inflammatory responses.
these results suggest that cortisol-induced stress does not affect the level of infection of atlantic salmon with the parasite, however, it may retard repair of skin.
consequently, examination of responses to infection with this parasite, in addition to stress hormone regulation in atlantic salmon, is vital for better understanding of the host pathogen interaction.
atlantic salmon post smolts were organised into four experimental groups: lice + cortisol, lice + placebo, no lice + cortisol, no lice + placebo.
gene expression changes in skin were assessed with  <dig> k oligonucleotide microarray and qpcr at the chalimus stage  <dig> days post infection at 9Â°c.
infection levels were equal in both treatments upon termination of the experiment.
