our modeling paradigm can accurately reproduce a number of known features of e. coli colony growth, as well as predict a novel one that had until now gone unrecognized.
our results are supported by imaging experiments involving strains of fluorescently-labeled e. coli.
here we show that a cell’s position within an in silicoescherichia coli colony grown on glucose minimal agar can drastically affect its metabolism: “pioneer” cells at the outer edge engage in rapid growth that expands the colony, while dormant cells in the interior separate two spatially distinct subpopulations linked by a cooperative form of acetate crossfeeding that has so far gone unnoticed.
furthermore, the height-to-width ratios of both the experimental and simulated colonies are in good agreement over a growth period of  <dig> hours.
the spatial patterns of fluorescence within these experimental colonies identify cells with upregulated genes associated with acetate crossfeeding and are in excellent agreement with the predictions.
