syntenically conserved tfrs are also more enriched for regulatory genes compared to lineage-specific tfrs.
two thirds of zebrafish tfrs over  <dig> kb are orthologous to tfrs in at least one mammal, and many have orthologous tfrs in all three mammalian genomes as well as in the genome of xenopus tropicalis.
here we report that transposon-free regions  are prominent genomic features of amphibian and fish lineages, and that many have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, although most transposon-derived sequences have entered these lineages after their divergence.
we recently reported the existence of large numbers of regions up to  <dig> kb long that lack transposon insertions in the human, mouse and opossum genomes.
however, the majority of tfr bases cannot be aligned between distantly related species, demonstrating that tfrs are not the by-product of strong primary sequence conservation.
