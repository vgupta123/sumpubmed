scale ridges with multilayered lamellae, lumen multilayers or gyroid photonic crystals in the scale lumen create structural colors that are variously combined with these pigmentary colors.
by applying various physical techniques, we investigate the coloration toolkit of the wing scales.
the wing scales contain two different, wavelength-selective absorbing pigments, causing pigmentary colorations.
the experimental findings add crucial insight into the evolution of butterfly wing scales and show the importance of morphological parameter mapping for butterfly phylogenetics.
the colorful wing patterns of butterflies, a prime example of biodiversity, can change dramatically within closely related species.
wing pattern diversity is specifically present among papilionid butterflies.
we here investigate the cattlehearts, parides, a small neotropical genus of papilionid butterflies with  <dig> members, the wings of which are marked by distinctly colored patches.
the pigmentary and structural traits strongly correlate with the taxonomical distribution of parides species.
