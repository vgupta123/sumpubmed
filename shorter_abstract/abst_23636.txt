in addition, the residues gln <dig>  ala <dig>  ala <dig>  and thr <dig> on the ikca channel turret formed polar and non-polar interactions with mtx, whereas the turret of kv <dig>  was almost not involved in recognizing mtx.
in this study, we applied computational methods to explore the differential binding modes of mtx to kv <dig>  and ikca channels, which would help to understand the diversity of channel-toxin interactions and accelerate the toxin-based drug design.
the inhibitory peptide maurotoxin  recognized the distantly related ikca and kv <dig>  channel with approximately the same potency and using the same functional residues, their differential binding mechanism remain elusive.
despite sharing similar pharmacological profiles toward both ikca and kv <dig>  channels, mtx adopted totally diverging modes in the two association processes.
a reasonably stable mtx-ikca complex was obtained by combining various computational methods and by in-depth comparison with the previous model of the mtx-kv <dig>  complex.
all the molecular information unveiled here could not only offer a better understanding about the structural differences between the ikca and kv <dig>  channels, but also provide novel structural clews that will help in the designing of more selective molecular probes to discriminate between these two channels.
in all, the pairs of interacting residues on mtx and the ikca channel of the bound complex indicated that electrostatic and van der waal interactions contributed equally to the formation of a stable mtx-ikca complex, in contrast to the mtx-kv <dig>  binding that is dominantly mediated by electrostatic forces.
in contrast, the other critical residues lys <dig>  lys <dig>  and tyr <dig> of mtx adopted distinct interactions when associating with the ikca channel.
