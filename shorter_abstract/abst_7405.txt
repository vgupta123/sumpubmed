hotspotter is a quick, easy-to-use visualization tool that delivers gene identities with associated mutation locations and frequencies overlaid upon a large cancer mutation reference set.
when analyzing across different cancers, particular mutation sites or mutations within a particular region of the gene may be of relatively low frequency in some cancers, but still provide selective growth advantage.
this allows the user to identify potential driver mutations that are less frequent in a cancer or are localized in a hotspot region of relatively infrequent mutations.
driver mutations are positively selected during the evolution of cancers.
however, driver mutations may occur with relative infrequency at a particular site, but cluster within a region of the gene.
as an example, we identified hotspot regions in the nfe2l <dig> gene that are potentially functionally relevant in endometrial cancer, but would be missed using other analyses.
