the bacterial sm-like protein hfq is known as an important regulator involved in many reactions of rna metabolism.
furthermore, hfq binds specifically to trna transcripts, which seems to be the prerequisite for the observed effect on cca-addition.
a prominent function of hfq is the stimulation of rna polyadenylation catalyzed by e. coli poly polymerase i .
as a member of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, this enzyme shares a high sequence similarity with an other representative of this family, the trna nucleotidyltransferase that synthesizes the 3'-terminal sequence c-c-a to all trnas .
in case of the cca-adding enzyme, however, the presented data indicate that the complex between hfq and trna substrate might enhance the product release from the enzyme.
