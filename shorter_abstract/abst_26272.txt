using in vitro analyses of medaka egfra, we could show that this receptor is only activated by medaka ligands, but not by human egf.
our data indicate that medaka egfr signaling occurs via its two copies, egfra and egfrb, each of them being preferentially coexpressed with different subsets of egfr ligands.
special focus was put on medaka, for which we more closely investigated all egf receptors and egfr ligands.
furthermore, our results strongly support the use of homologous ligands in future studies, as sufficient cross-specificity is very unlikely for this ligand/receptor system.
preferential co-expression of different subsets of egfr ligands corroborates the possible subfunctionalization and specialization of the two receptors in adult tissues.
we found two duplicated egfr genes, egfra and egfrb, in all available teleost genomes.
we identified the predicted components of the egf receptor-ligand signaling system in teleost fishes .
the different expression patterns of egfra, egfrb and their ligands in medaka tissues and embryo stages suggest differences in role and function.
the epidermal growth factor receptor  with its numerous ligands has fundamental roles in development, cell differentiation and physiology.
surprisingly only one copy for each of the seven egfr ligands could be identified in most fishes, with zebrafish hbegf being the only exception.
bioinformatic analyses of the ligand-receptor interface between egfr and its ligands show a very weak evolutionary conservation within this region.
