we have found that in naïve rats chronic agomelatine, contrary to traditional antidepressants, did not increase creb phosphorylation, but modulates the time-dependent regulation of mapk/erk1/ <dig> and akt/glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>  pathways.
our results suggest that the intracellular molecular mechanisms modulated by chronic agomelatine may be partly different from those of traditional antidepressants and involve the time-dependent regulation of mapk/erk1/ <dig> and akt/gsk- <dig> signalling pathways.

aim of this work was to analyse possible effects of chronic agomelatine on time-dependent changes of different intracellular signalling pathways in hippocampus and prefrontal/frontal cortex of male rats.
in the last several years, particular attention was given to camp-responsive element binding protein -related pathways, since it was shown that chronic antidepressants increase creb phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, through the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent  and mitogen activated protein kinase cascades .
