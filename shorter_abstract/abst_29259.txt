eleven large breed, privately owned dogs wore a collar fitted with both the whistle device and a previously validated accelerometer-based activity monitor  for a 24-h time period.
the total activity time provided by the whistle application offers an inexpensive method for obtaining at-home, canine, real-time physical activity data.
activity intensity from the whistle device was calculated manually from screenshots of the activity bars displayed in the smartphone-application and compared to the activity count recorded by the actical in the same 3-min time period.
there was a strong correlation between activity intensity of both devices for individual time points .
limitations of the whistle device include the limited battery life, the need for manual derivation of activity intensity data and data transfer, and the requirement of wi-fi and bluetooth availability for data transmission.
activity data provided by the whistle activity monitor may be used as an objective outcome measurement in dogs.
an even stronger correlation was observed between the total activity data between the two devices .
total activity time obtained from the whistle device in minutes was compared to the total activity count from the actical device.
