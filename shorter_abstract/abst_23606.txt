formulas, chemical structures, identification numbers to other databases etc.
mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics ought to connect the relevant mass traces of the metabolites to other relevant data, e.g.
mspecs is a versatile tool for the management and editing of mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics.
mspecs can be used on all major platforms and is licensed under the gnu general public license and available at .
beyond that it provides capabilities for the automatic management of libraries though its scripting functionality.
here we present mspecs, an open source software tool to manage mass spectral data in the field of metabolomics.
it provides editing of mass spectra and virtually any associated information, automatic calculation of formulas and masses and is extensible by scripts.
