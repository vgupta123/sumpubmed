this approach can serve as a preprocessing step for model integration, exchange and extraction data, and simulation.
in this work, we have defined  <dig> rules which constrain event-specific participants and the related features and adding missing processes based on biological events.
the experimental results show that the relatively simple rules can efficiently detect errors made during curation, such as misassignment and misuse of ontology concepts and terms in curated models.
to obtain high-quality pathway databases, it is essential to improve the efficiency of model validation and model update based on appropriate feedback.
modeling in systems biology is vital for understanding the complexity of biological systems across scales and predicting system-level behaviors.
we have developed a new method to guide creating novel high-quality biological pathways, using a rule-based validation.
this approach is applied to data in cell system ontology which is a comprehensive ontology that represents complex biological pathways with dynamics and visualization.
our rule-based validation embedding biological semantics enables us to provide high-quality curated biological pathways.
rules are defined to correct models against biological semantics and improve models for dynamic simulation.
