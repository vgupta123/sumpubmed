it reveals that clinical isolates originating from various geographic and biological sources exhibit a high conservation rate, indicating that t. whipplei rarely interacts with exogenous dna.
fifteen clinical isolates originating from biopsy samples recovered from different countries were compared with the t. whipplei twist strain.
the results revealed a limited genetic variation among the t. whipplei isolates, with at most  <dig> % of the probes exhibiting differential hybridization against the twist strain.
this work provides the first comprehensive genomic comparison of several t. whipplei isolates.
remarkably, frequent inter-strain variations were dicovered that affected members of the wisp family.
the aim of this study was to analyze the genomic diversity of several tropheryma whipplei strains by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization.
the main variation was found in genes encoding the wisp membrane protein family.
this deletion occurs in the same region as the previously described large genomic rearrangement between twist and tw08/ <dig>  thus, this can be considered as a major hot-spot for intra-specific t. whipplei differentiation.
this work also demonstrated a  <dig>  kb-pair deletion within the t. whipplei dig <dig> strain.
analysis of this deleted region confirmed the role of wnd domains in generating t. whipplei diversity.
