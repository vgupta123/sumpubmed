this decision is primarily based on the primary targets and mechanisms of action of the chemical compounds under consideration.
we have designed an algorithm, cuttree that when applied to whole-genome expression datasets identifies the primary affected genes  of a chemical compound by separating them from downstream, indirectly affected genes.
a key problem of drug development is to decide which compounds to evaluate further in expensive clinical trials .
unlike previous methods requiring whole-genome deletion libraries or a complete map of gene network architecture, cuttree identifies pags from a limited set of experimental perturbations without requiring any prior information about the underlying pathways.
whole-genome expression measurements have shown to be useful for this process but current approaches suffer from requiring either a large number of mutant experiments or a detailed understanding of the regulatory networks.
using an exhaustive search strategy to detect these pags would not have been feasible .
in combination with genetic perturbation techniques like short interfering rna  followed by whole-genome expression measurements, cuttree sets the stage for compound target identification in less well-characterized but more disease-relevant mammalian cell systems.
