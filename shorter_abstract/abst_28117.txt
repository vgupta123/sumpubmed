together, our results establish acetylation of k <dig> as an important regulatory modification of p <dig> and subsequently of nf-κb-dependent gene expression.
nf-κb regulates the expression of a large number of target genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.
in this study, we describe that site-specific mutation of p <dig> at lysines  <dig> and  <dig> enhances gene expression of a subset of nf-κb target genes including mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  increased gene expression was mainly observed three hours after tnfα stimulation.
