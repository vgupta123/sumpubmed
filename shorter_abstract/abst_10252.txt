the objective of this study was to identify mirnas associated with aiv infections in chickens.
elucidation of the mechanism of these mirnas on the regulation of host-aiv interaction will lead to the development of new control strategies to prevent or treat aiv infections in poultry.
total rnas were isolated from lung and trachea of low pathogenic h5n <dig> infected and non-infected spf chickens at  <dig> days post-infection.
avian influenza virus  not only causes significant economic losses in poultry production, but also is of great concern to human health.
micrornas  play critical roles in a wide spectrum of biological processes and have been shown to be important effectors in the intricate host-pathogen interaction networks.
during aiv infection, many host mirnas were differentially regulated, supporting the hypothesis that certain mirnas might be essential in the host-pathogen interactions.
