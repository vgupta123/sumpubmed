we also investigated transcription profiles of the atp <dig> and cox <dig> genes.
most dna haplotypes and transcription profiles were maternally inherited; for these, transcription profiles were associated with specific mitochondrial dna haplotypes.
specific transcription profiles of mitochondrial genes were associated with specific mitochondrial dna haplotypes in a natural population of a gynodioecious species s. vulgaris.
we analyzed rflp variation in two mitochondrial genes, cox <dig> and atp <dig>  in offspring of ten plants from a natural population of s. vulgaris in central europe.
although rapid changes in copy number and gene order are common within plant mitochondrial genomes, associated patterns of gene transcription are underinvestigated.
here we address whether variation in dna molecular markers is correlated with variation in transcription of mitochondrial genes in s. vulgaris collected from natural populations.
previous studies have shown that the gynodioecious plant species silene vulgaris exhibits high mitochondrial diversity and occasional paternal inheritance of mitochondrial markers.
one individual exhibited a pattern consistent with paternal inheritance of mitochondrial dna; this individual exhibited a transcription profile suggestive of paternal but inconsistent with maternal inheritance.
we found no associations between gender and transcript profiles.
