in this study we describe the crystal structure of a complex of the e. coli β-clamp with a 12-mer peptide from the umuc protein.
our structure shows that the umuc peptide follows the overall disposition of previously characterised structures with respect to the highly conserved glutamine residue.
additionally, interactions between asn- <dig> of umuc and arg- <dig> on the clamp surface may compensate for the reduced interaction of phe- <dig>
the sliding clamp processivity factors play a central role in this regulation, interacting with both dna polymerases and multiple dna processing and repair proteins.
given the degree of conservation of these motifs, much research effort has focussed on understanding how the temporal and spatial regulation of multiple clamp binding partners is managed.
strict regulation of replisome components is essential to ensure the accurate transmission of the genome to the next generation.
due to its potentially mutagenic action, pol v is tightly regulated in the cell to limit access to the replication fork.
the bacterial sliding clamps have come under scrutiny as potential targets for rational drug design and comprehensive understanding of the structural basis of their interactions is crucial for success.
although the β-clamp binding motif of umuc conforms to the consensus sequence, variation in its mode of clamp binding is observed compared to related structures, presumably dictated by the proximal aspartate residues that act as linker to the poorly characterised, unique c-terminal domain of umuc.
umuc is the catalytic subunit of the translesion dna polymerase, pol v .
atypically for the translesion polymerases, both bacterial and eukaryotic, pol v is heterotrimeric and its β-clamp binding motif  is internal to the protein, rather than at the more usual c-terminal position.
despite good agreement with the consensus β-clamp binding motif, distinct variation is shown within the hydrophobic binding pocket.
