comparisons of original and updated qtl and gwas results confound the effects of linkage map density, gwas marker density, population sample size, and phenotype estimates.
of the four parameters varied, map density caused the largest changes in qtl and gwas results.
whereas joint linkage qtl positions were relatively stable to input changes, the residual values derived from those qtl models  were more sensitive, resulting in substantial differences between gwas results.
the updated nam gwas identified several candidate genes consistent with previous qtl fine-mapping results.
we recommend use of the updated genetic resources and results but emphasize the limited repeatability of small-effect associations.
an updated nam genetic linkage map has a nearly six-fold greater marker density than the previous map and the combined snps and read-depth variants  from maize hapmaps  <dig> and  <dig> provided  <dig>  m genomic variants for association analysis,  <dig> fold more than hapmap  <dig>  in addition, phenotypic values of the nam rils were re-estimated to account for environment-specific flowering time covariates and a small proportion of lines were dropped due to genotypic data quality problems.
the updated higher density linkage map improves qtl estimation and, along with a much denser snp hapmap, greatly increases the likelihood of detecting snps in linkage with causal variants.
the highly polygenic nature of resistance to slb complicates the identification of causal genes.
gwas associations have higher resolution, but lower power due to stringent thresholds designed to minimize false positive associations, resulting in variability of detection across studies.
the updated qtl model had better cross-validation prediction accuracy than the previous model.
