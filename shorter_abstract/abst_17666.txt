sigma- <dig> is a central regulator in many pathogenic bacteria and has been linked to a multitude of cellular processes like nitrogen assimilation and important functional traits such as motility, virulence, and biofilm formation.
we found clear highly-represented and conserved genetic associations with genes that concern the transport and biosynthesis of the metabolic intermediates of exopolysaccharides, flagella, lipids, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins and peptidoglycan.
we observed a phylum-dependent distribution that is suggestive of an evolutionary relationship between sigma- <dig> and lipopolysaccharide and flagellar biosynthesis.
c) the function annotations, that were represented within the genomic context of all genes encoding sigma- <dig>  its activators and its promoters, were analyzed for intra-phylum representation and inter-phylum conservation.
