furthermore, we uncovered evidence that both n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae have separately acquired dna from their human host.
looking specifically at the rucps present within the  <dig> genomes considered, a stronger similarity between n. meningitidis and n. lactamica is observed, suggesting that n. meningitidis arose before n. gonorrhoeae.
while the majority of such genes have an origin unknown, a number of putative sources including pathogenic and capsule-containing bacteria were determined, indicative of gene exchange between neisseria spp.
pathogenicity islands  or genomic islands  are considered to be the result of a recent horizontal transfer.

this comparative analysis provides a means for tracing the evolutionary history of the acquisition of foreign dna within this genus.
utilizing s-plot and new functionality developed here, we examined  <dig> publicly available neisseria genomes, including strains of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, in order to identify regions of unusual compositional properties  using both a sliding window as well as a gene-by-gene approach.
data suggests that all three neisseria species have received horizontally transferred elements post-speciation.
numerous geis and pais were identified including virulence genes previously found within the pathogenic neisseria species.
previously we introduced a tool called s-plot which provides a visual representation of the variation in compositional properties across and between genomic sequences.
detecting pais/geis as well as their putative source can provide insight into the organismâ€™s pathogenicity within its host.
while some genes were conserved amongst all species, only pathogenic species, or an individual species, a number of genes were detected that are unique to an individual strain.
