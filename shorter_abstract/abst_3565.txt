in a simple case study, we demonstrate the advantage of maintaining heterozygotes in our library whereby fine-mapping efforts are conducted simply by self-pollination.
seven such rils were used in  <dig> generations of crossing to tsu- <dig> to create bc <dig> seed.
the present results introduce a new and valuable resource to the brassicaceae research community that enables rapid fine-mapping of candidate loci in parallel with qtl validation.
additionally, we utilize a homozygous nil for validation of a qtl underlying stomatal conductance, a low heritability trait.
bc <dig> plants were genotyped with ssr markers so that lines could be selected that carried kas- <dig> introgressions, resulting in a population carrying chromosomal introgressions spanning the genome.
these attributes along with dense marker coverage and genome-wide chromosomal introgressions make this population an ideal starting point for discovery of genes underlying important complex traits of agricultural and ecological significance.
near-isogenic lines are the ideal raw material for qtl validation, refinement of qtl location and, ultimately, gene discovery.
in this study, a population of  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana near-isogenic lines was developed from an existing recombinant inbred line  population derived from a cross between physiologically divergent accessions kas- <dig> and tsu- <dig>  first, a novel algorithm was developed to utilize genome-wide marker data in selecting rils fully isogenic to kas- <dig> for a single chromosome.
despite major advancements in genomics technology, moving from qtl to causal alleles remains a major challenge in genetics research.
