however, solid barriers are considered more effective than liquids in decreasing postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion formation; therefore, a new pectin-honey hydrogel  was produced and its effectiveness was evaluated in a rat cecal abrasion model.
phh is a novel absorbable barrier that is effective in preventing intra-abdominal adhesions in a cecal abrasion model in rats.
in group c,  <dig> of  <dig>  animals developed adhesions between the cecum and peritoneum, while in group t only  <dig> of  <dig>  did .
in group c, one rat had an adhesion score of  <dig>  sixteen had scores of  <dig>  and seven rats had scores of  <dig>  in group t, four rats had adhesion scores of  <dig>  one rat had an adhesion score of  <dig> and nineteen have score  <dig> .
adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and adhesion scores were recorded and compared between the two groups.
in group t, phhs were placed between the injured peritoneum and cecum.
significantly lower grades of inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization were seen in group t .
