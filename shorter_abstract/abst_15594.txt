rad9-rad1-hus <dig>  is a heterotrimeric protein complex that plays a role in cell cycle checkpoint control and dna repair.
in humans, hmyh and 9-1- <dig> interact through hus <dig> and to a lesser degree with rad <dig> in the presence of dna damage.
mrna and protein levels of hmyh and hrad <dig> were increased following hu treatment.
this interaction is enhanced by hu treatment.
in saccharomyces pombe, each component of the 9-1- <dig> complex interacts directly with spmyh.
co-ip and bifc indicates that hmyh interacts with hrad <dig>  as shown by gst-pull down assay, this interaction is direct.
the glycosylase activity of hmyh is stimulated by hus <dig> and the 9-1- <dig> complex and enhanced by dna damage treatment.
since both protein functions in the early detection of dna damage, we suggest that this interaction occurs early in dna damage pathway.
furthermore, bifc with deletion mutants of hmyh showed that hrad <dig> interacts with n-terminal region of hmyh.
our data reveal that hrad <dig> interacts directly with n-terminal region of hmyh.
human muty glycosylase homolog , a component of the base excision repair pathway, is responsible for the generation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites.
