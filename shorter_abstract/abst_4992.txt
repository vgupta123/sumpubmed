these samples originated from  <dig> farms and encompassed  <dig> different cantons with the highest bdv-seroprevalence found in central switzerland.
on the base of epidemiological information collected by questionnaire in case- and control farms, common housing of cattle and sheep was identified as the most significant risk factor for bdv infection in cattle by logistic regression.
after targeted elimination of persistently infected animals that represent the main virus reservoir, the absence of bvd is surveilled serologically since  <dig>  in view of steadily decreasing pestivirus seroprevalence in the cattle population, the susceptibility for  infection by border disease  virus mainly from small ruminants increases.
due to serological cross-reactivity of pestiviruses, serological surveillance of bvd by elisa does not distinguish between bvd and bd virus as source of infection.

in this work the cross-serum neutralisation test  procedure was adapted to the epidemiological situation in switzerland by the use of three pestiviruses, i.e., strains representing the subgenotype bvdv-1a, bvdv-1h and bdswiss-a, for adequate differentiation between bvdv and bdv.
