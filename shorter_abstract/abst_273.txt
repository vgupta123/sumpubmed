target prediction and function annotation of associated genes revealed that these genes were predominantly involved in metabolic, insulin signaling, and adipocytokine signaling pathways that directly link the pathophysiological changes associated with obesity and weight reduction.
to examine the circulating microrna  expression profile in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity  with subsequent weight reduction achieved via low-fat diet  feeding.
these results imply that obesity-related reductions in the expression of circulating mirnas could be reversed through changes in metabolism associated with weight reduction achieved through lfd feeding.
microarray analysis of mirna using the mouse & rat mirna onearray® v <dig> system revealed significant alterations in the expression of mirnas in dio and dio + lfd mice.
a switch to lfd feeding led to decreases in body weight, adiposity, and blood glucose levels in dio mice.
notably,  <dig> circulating mirnas  were significantly downregulated in dio mice but upregulated in dio + lfd mice.
