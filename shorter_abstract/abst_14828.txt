our results help focus experimental studies onto investigating the biochemical functions of key homeodomain residues in different gene classes.
although homeobox genes have been the subject of many studies, little is known about the main amino acid changes that occurred early in the evolution of genes belonging to different classes.
the reported protein features will facilitate the robust classification of homeobox genes from newly sequenced bilaterian genomes.
furthermore, we look for diagnostic amino acid residues that can be used to distinguish hoxl, nkl and prd genes.
in this study, we report a method for the fast and efficient retrieval of sequences belonging to the antp  and prd classes.
