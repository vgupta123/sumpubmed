the absorptive and goblet cells are the main cellular types encountered in the intestine epithelium.
indeed, some authors report in caco- <dig> a low paracellular permeability and an ease of access of highly diffusible small molecules to the microvilli, due to an almost complete lack of mucus.
the systematic use of a co-culture system requires the characterization of the monolayer under a given experimental procedure.
in this study, we investigated the activity and localization of the alkaline phosphatase and the expression of iap and muc5ac genes to determine a correlation between these markers and the cellular composition of a differentiated monolayer obtained from a mixture of caco- <dig> and ht29-5m <dig> cells.
the culture formed by 75% caco- <dig> and 25% ht29-5m <dig> produce a monolayer containing the two main cell types of human intestinal epithelium and characterized by a reduced permeability to macromolecules.
the alkaline phosphatase expression characterizing caco- <dig> cells was influenced by the presence of ht29-5m <dig> cells.
a co-culture system carried out in a serum-free medium and comprising both caco- <dig> and ht29-5m <dig> cells was developed.
