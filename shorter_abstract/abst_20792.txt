this circuit may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases.
synovial fluid-derived mononuclear cells  were stimulated with bacterial antigens or sf-conditioned media, and cytokines and iga were analyzed in the supernatants.
however, it is unknown whether and how il- <dig> mediates synovial iga production.
here we aim to investigate the connection of synovial il- <dig> with iga production in the joint.
conditioned media with sf containing il- <dig> induced anti-lps iga production by sfmcs which was independent of il- <dig> activity.
in addition, it demonstrates that enterobacterial antigens trigger synovial il- <dig> production, and that tgf-β <dig> and baff may mediate the effect of il- <dig> on iga production.
in this study we included synovial fluids  from patients with rheumatoid arthritis , spondyloarthritis  and osteoarthritis .
blockade of il- <dig> decreased the production of tgf-β <dig> and anti-lps iga by sf-stimulated sfmcs.
il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> were increased in sf from both ra and spa compared with oa patients.
bacterial-stimulated sfmcs from ra and spa patients secreted higher il- <dig> than vehicle-stimulated sfmcs.
total iga was measured by radial immunodiffusion assay.
concentrations of synovial tgf-β <dig> and baff correlated with anti-lps and total iga levels, respectively.
