the fragment was amplified using non-specific primers designed from the ndieyyg and knnyvvfn consensus motifs from aspartic proteinases of different fungi.
it was shown that p. pastoris secreted non-glycosylated and glycosylated mcaps with molecular weights of  <dig> and 37 kda, respectively.
mcap was expressed in p. pastoris under the control of the constitutive gap promoter.
the results suggest that p. pastoris could be exploited as a safe production platform for the milk clotting enzyme.
despite its prospects in the dairy industry, the molecular characteristics of this enzyme remain unknown.
a novel mcap was expressed in p. pastoris and efficiently secreted into the culture medium.
extracellular aspartic proteinase  produced by mucor circinelloides in solid state fermentations has been shown to possess milk clotting activity and represents a potential replacement for bovine chymosin in cheese manufacturing.
the cloning of cdna sequence encoding mcap from m. circinelloides was performed using a fragment of approximately  <dig> kbp as a probe.
