although trimming off low-quality tails helped align more reads, it introduced lots of false positives.
our findings clarify the necessity and effectiveness of computational steps for improving the accuracy of snp and genotype calls from illumina sequencing data and can serve as a general guideline for choosing snp calling strategies for data with different coverage.
in this study, we made a systematic assessment of the relative contribution of each step to the accuracy of variant calling from illumina dna sequencing data.
however, whether each step does contribute to the performance of variant calling and how it affects the accuracy still remain unclear, making it difficult to select and arrange appropriate steps to derive high quality variants from different sequencing data.
rearranging these steps did not affect the results.

a number of computational steps are required or recommended when translating the raw sequencing data into the final calls.
the relative performance of three popular multi-sample snp callers, samtools, gatk, and glfmultiples, also varied with the sequencing depth.
the ability of markup duplication, local realignment and recalibration, to help eliminate false positive variants depended on the sequencing depth.
