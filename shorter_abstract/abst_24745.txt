it then addresses the second issue by relying directly on the rich graph topology described in the systems biology markup language  standard, and uses multidigraphs to efficiently handle multiple queries on biological graph databases.
our approach mimo  addresses the first problem by allowing the introduction of gaps and mismatches between query and template pathways and permits -when necessary- supervised queries incorporating a priori biological information.
to date, these characteristics are only partially available in tools designed to compare molecular interaction maps.
the algorithm has been here successfully used to highlight the contact point between various human pathways in the reactome database.
