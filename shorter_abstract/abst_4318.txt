we also introduce the bayesian minimum mean squared error  conditional error estimator and demonstrate its computation over the feature space.
through model-based, optimal bayesian classification, we demonstrate superior classification performance for both synthetic and real rna-seq datasets.
thus, we introduce a hierarchical multivariate poisson model  and the associated optimal bayesian classifier  for classifying samples using sequencing data.
we demonstrate superior or equivalent classification performance compared to typical classifiers for two synthetic datasets and over a range of classification problem difficulties.
lacking closed-form solutions, we employ a monte carlo markov chain  approach to perform classification.
