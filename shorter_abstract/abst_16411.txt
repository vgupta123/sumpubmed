sros are present in all analyzed land plants and sequence analysis differentiates between two structurally distinct groups; cryptogams and monocots possess only group i sros whereas eudicots also contain group ii.
group i sros possess an n-terminal wwe domain  but the wwe domain is lacking in group ii sros.
however, bioinformatic analysis of the sro parp domain fold-structure and biochemical assays of atrcd <dig> suggested that sros do not possess adp-ribosyl transferase activity.
nevertheless, the function of sros is critical for plants and might be related to transcription factor regulation and complex formation.
we propose a unified nomenclature for the sro family.
they contain the catalytic core of the poly polymerase  domain and a c-terminal rst  domain.
the most conserved feature of the sros is the catalytic core of the poly polymerase  domain.
we suggest that, despite the presence of the catalytic core of the parp domain, the sros do not possess adp-ribosyl transferase activity.
in addition to these domains, several, but not all, sros contain an n-terminal wwe domain.
this might have implications for functional conservation.
the sros are able to interact with transcription factors through the c-terminal rst domain but themselves are generally not regulated at the transcriptional level.
the sros  are a group of plant-specific proteins which have important functions in stress adaptation and development.
