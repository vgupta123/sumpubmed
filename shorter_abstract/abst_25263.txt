as a consequence of evolution, dna sequences recognized by transcription factors are thought to be enriched in intergenic regions  and depleted from coding regions of prokaryotic genomes.
this strategy, which can easily be combined with other methodologies, allowed the identification of promoter sequences in ten species and can be used with any annotated bacterial genome, with results that rival with current methodologies.
considering that complete genomic sequences of over  <dig> bacteria will soon be available and that little transcriptional information is available for most of them, our algorithm constitutes a promising tool for the prediction of promoter sequences.
importantly, our methodology could also be adapted to identify dna sequences recognized by other regulatory proteins.
in this work, we report that genomic distribution of transcription factors binding sites is biased towards irs, and that this bias is conserved amongst bacterial species.
in bacteria, sigma factors and other transcriptional regulatory proteins recognize dna patterns upstream of their target genes and interact with rna polymerase to control transcription.
experimental validations of predicted promoters also support our approach.
