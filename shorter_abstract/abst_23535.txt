in this paper, we show how the structural uniqueness and identifiability of the models can be guaranteed by carefully adding extra constraints, and that these important properties can be checked through appropriate computation methods.
the inference of biological networks from high-throughput data has received huge attention during the last decade and can be considered an important problem class in systems biology.
the inference of biological networks can be an extremely challenging problem even in the utopian case of perfect experimental information.
using these new tools and also previously published ones to obtain the network structure of biological systems from the literature, we find that, often, a unique topology cannot be determined, even if the structure of the corresponding mathematical model is assumed to be known and all dynamical variables are measurable.
however, it has been recognized that reliable network inference remains an unsolved problem.
in other words, certain mechanisms may remain undetected  while the inferred model is fully consistent with the measured data.
it is also shown that sparsity enforcing approaches for determining 'true' reaction structures are generally not enough without additional prior information.
unfortunately, the practical situation is often more complex than that, since the measurements are typically incomplete, noisy and sometimes dynamically not rich enough, introducing further obstacles to the structure/parameter estimation process.
