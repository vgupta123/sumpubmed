the accuracy of the method is shown to be an improvement over the most widely used tools available and can be run in a constant amount of time when cluster resources are scaled linearly with the amount of input data.
we demonstrate that our implementation easily scales to billions of sequenced fragments, while providing the exact maximum likelihood assignment of ambiguous fragments.
thus, current approaches to fragment assignment rely on heuristics or approximations for tractability.
we present an implementation of a distributed em solution to the fragment assignment problem using spark, a data analytics framework that can scale by leveraging compute clusters within datacenters–“the cloud”.
