genetically diverse bacteria infect cassava whiteflies in africa with varied prevalence across different host populations, which may affect their whitefly biology.
in recent years, cassava has been affected by an epidemic of a virus disease called cassava brown streak disease  that is spreading in much of eastern and central africa, affecting food security and the economic development of the poor.
the main aim of this study was therefore to investigate the prevalence and diversity of the secondary endosymbiotic bacteria infecting cassava whiteflies with a view to better understand their role on insect population dynamics and virus disease epidemics.
multiple locus sequence typing identified four different strains of wolbachia infecting cassava whiteflies.
further studies are required to investigate the role of endosymbionts to better understand the whitefly population dynamics.
the genetic diversity of field-collected whitefly from tanzania, malawi, uganda and nigeria was determined by mitochondrial dna based phylogeny and restriction fragment length polymorphism.
wolbachia was the most predominant symbiont with infection levels varying from  <dig> to 97%.
infection levels of arsenophonus varied from  <dig> to 64% and that of rickettsia was  <dig> to 53%.
a common strain of wolbachia infected the whitefly population sub-saharan africa 1-subgroup  <dig>  and ssa1-sg <dig>  while others were infected with different strains.
strains of endosymbiotic bacteria infecting whiteflies have been reported to interact specifically with different whitefly populations with varied effects on its host biology and efficiency of virus transmission.
the viruses that cause cbsd are transmitted by the insect vector whitefly , which have increased to very high numbers in some african countries.
