a quantitative model of the sphigolipid pathway is developed by integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics data with legacy knowledge.
in this direction, the lipid maps consortium is developing methods to quantitate the sphingolipid metabolites in mammalian cells and is investigating their application to studies of the activation of the raw <dig>  macrophage cell by a chemically defined endotoxin, kdo2-lipid a. herein, we describe a model for the c16-branch of sphingolipid metabolism  integrating lipidomics and transcriptomics data and using a two-step matrix-based approach to estimate the rate constants from experimental data.
the rate constants obtained from the first step are further refined using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization.
sphingolipids play important roles in cell structure and function as well as in the pathophysiology of many diseases.
the resulting model fits the experimental data for all species.
the robustness of the model is validated through parametric sensitivity analysis.
