meloxicam oral suspension was able to significantly reduce the display of painful behaviors and physiological responses to pain in band castrated and surgical castrated calves for up to 72 h following a single oral treatment of 1 mg/kg body weight.
heart rates were significantly greater in control animals following band and surgical castration.
control animals had significantly greater vas scores.
the scrotal inflammation  was significantly decreased in the meloxicam treated animals compared to the control animals on day  <dig>  day  <dig> and  <dig>
meloxicam oral suspension was able to significantly reduce scrotal inflammation in band castrated and surgical castrated calves.
plasma cortisol and substance p were significantly reduced in animals receiving meloxicam oral suspension.
accelerometers showed that meloxicam treated animals had a significantly greater motion index and number of steps as well as less % time lying and number of lying bouts.
castration is one of the most common procedures performed on beef and dairy cattle.
animals received either meloxicam oral suspension at a dose of 1 mg/kg bw  or saline  2 h before castration.
the objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of meloxicam oral suspension in reducing pain and inflammation in calves following band or surgical castration.
physiological  and behavioral , accelerometers and tail pedometers) evaluations were conducted before  and after castration .
two identical trials with the exception of the method of castration  were conducted.
