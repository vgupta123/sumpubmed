this control must involve the integration of extracellular cues, such as those on the axon surface, with intrinsic developmental programmes.
myelination requires precise control of oligodendrocyte morphology and myelin generation at each of the axons contacted by an individual cell.
the balance of the equilibrium between active and inactive integrins regulates oligodendrocyte morphology, which is itself regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic cues so providing a mechanism of signal integration.
similar results were obtained when inside-out signalling was increased by the expression of a constitutively-active r-ras.
inhibiting inside-out signalling by using dominant-negative r-ras reduces processes and myelin sheets; importantly, this can be partially rescued by the co-stimulation of outside-in signalling using manganese.
increasing levels of outside-in signalling via the laminin receptor α6β <dig> integrin were found to promote oligodendrocyte processing and myelin sheet formation in culture.
