butyrophilin, lactadherin and fatty acid binding protein inhibited fimbriae-dependent adherence of e. coli to enterocytes in vitro, while xanthine dehydrogenase did not.
neonatal and post-weaning colibacillosis caused by enterotoxigenic e. coli is responsible for substantial economic losses encountered by the pork industry.

the results indicate that mfgm proteins may interfere with attachment of e. coli to porcine neonatal intestinal mucosa.
we tested the effect of porcine individual milk fat globule membrane  proteins on f4ac positive e. coli attachment to porcine enterocytes in vitro.
intestinal colonization of young piglets by e. coli depends on the efficiency of bacterial attachment to host gastrointestinal epithelium that is mediated by fimbriae.
