also, in ck <dig> negative or positive cells, parasites recruited host cells lysosomes and escaped from the parasitophorous vacuole equally as well.
simultaneous staining of parasites and ck <dig> showed that in hela cells infected with the y strain both co-localize.
after that, the growth of amastigotes of the y or cl-brener strains, was drastically arrested in ck <dig> rnai-treated cells.
cytokeratin  <dig>  is among the host molecules that have been suggested as a mediator of important events during t. cruzi-host cell interaction.
ck <dig> negative or positive hela cells were invaded equally as well by trypomastigotes of different t. cruzi strains.
the study demonstrates that silencing ck <dig> by transient rnai, inhibits intracellular multiplication of the y and cl strain of t. cruzi in hela cells, but not trypanosome binding and invasion.
hela cells transiently transfected with ck18-rnai had negligible levels of ck <dig> transcripts, and significantly reduced levels of ck <dig> protein expression as determined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence.
