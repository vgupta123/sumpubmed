the  <dig> ests/genes related to fiber quality traits were integrated with  <dig> previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative trait loci, which demonstrated the important roles in fiber quality of these genes.
a total of  <dig>  candidate unigenes from  <dig>  ests clusters and  <dig> bacs were mined for functional annotation and classification.
integration of high-density genetic maps with genomic sequence information will largely accelerate the process of whole-genome assembly in cotton.
higher-level sequence conservation between different cotton species and between the a- and d-subgenomes in tetraploid cotton was found, indicating a common evolutionary origin for orthologous and paralogous loci in gossypium.
three new marker types, indel  and snp  developed from gene information, and remap , were used to increase map density.
this study will serve as a valuable genomic resource for tetraploid cotton genome assembly, for cloning genes related to superior agronomic traits, and for further comparative genomic analyses in gossypium.
decoding cotton genomes will provide the ultimate reference and resource for research and utilization of the species.
cotton is the worldâ€™s most important natural textile fiber and a significant oilseed crop.
<dig> cm with an average inter-locus distance of  <dig>  cm.
of these,  <dig>  ests and  <dig> bacs from different species of gossypium were clustered and specifically anchored to the high-density genetic map.
