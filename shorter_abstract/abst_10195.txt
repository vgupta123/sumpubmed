in terms of known false positives and false negatives, the method outperforms all multiple-replicate methods except for the gamma-gamma ebarrays method to which it offers comparable results with the added advantages of greater simplicity, speed, fewer assumptions and applicability to the single replicate case.
an r package called nudge to implement the methods in this paper will be made available soon at .
we propose a simple method, normal uniform differential gene expression  detection for finding differentially expressed genes in cdna microarrays.
three datasets are analyzed using nudge, and the results are compared to those given by other popular methods: unadjusted and bonferroni-adjusted t tests, significance analysis of microarrays , and empirical bayes for microarrays  with both gamma-gamma and lognormal-normal models.
the method gives a high probability of differential expression to genes known/suspected a priori to be differentially expressed and a low probability to the others.
one of the primary tasks in analysing gene expression data is finding genes that are differentially expressed in different samples.
it takes account of multiple testing, and gives probabilities of differential expression as part of its output.
