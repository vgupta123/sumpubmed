the good performance of mir-kde encourages more efforts on the classification methodology as well as the feature extraction in mirna prediction.
however, there were fewer discussions on the associated classification mechanism in a mirna predictor.
the classification mechanism in mir-kde is the relaxed variable kernel density estimator  that we have recently proposed.
this study also provides a comprehensive analysis from the view of classification mechanism.
the experimental results show that mir-kde delivers favorable performance in predicting human pre-mirnas and has advantages for pre-mirnas from the genera taxonomically distant to humans.
this study focuses on the classification algorithm for mirna prediction.
we develop a novel ab initio method, mir-kde, in which most of the features are collected from previous works.
micrornas  are short non-coding rna molecules participating in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.
mir-kde is evaluated using a training set consisted of only human pre-mirnas to predict a benchmark collected from  <dig> species.
most ab initio approaches proposed novel features to characterize rna molecules.
when compared to the famous support vector machine , rvkde exploits more local information of the training dataset.
recently, ab initio approaches obtain more attention because that they can discover species-specific pre-mirnas.
we use a novel classifier of which the characteristic of exploiting local information is particularly suitable to predict species-specific pre-mirnas.
