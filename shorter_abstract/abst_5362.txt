six adult crossbred mares weighing 320–400 kg were anesthetized on three different occasions.
blood pressure, pao <dig> and paco <dig> increased and heart rate , respiratory rate , ph, total plasma protein and temperature decreased during anesthesia in all treatments.
at the highest dose administered  lidocaine cri during xylazine/ketamine anesthesia decreased bis and motor response to noxious stimulation, and prolonged recovery time without significant added cardiorespiratory depression.
sedation was performed with xylazine  and anesthetic induction with guaifenesin  and ketamine .
electrical noxious stimulation caused purposeful movement in all horses from ts, but no response in thl.
this study investigated the antinociceptive effects of a constant rate infusion  of lidocaine during xylazine and ketamine anesthesia in horses and aimed to correlate these effects with cardiorespiratory variables, bispectral index  and plasma lidocaine concentrations.
parametric and non-parametric data were compared using anova followed by student-newman-keuls and friedman tests, respectively.
plasma lidocaine concentrations peaked at the end of lidocaine loading dose and was greater in thl  vs tll .
