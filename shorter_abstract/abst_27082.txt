the sweetpotato gene index is a useful source for functionally annotated sweetpotato gene sequences that contains three times more gene sequence information for sweetpotato than previous est assemblies.
the availability of genomic resources for sweetpotato is in striking contrast to its importance for human nutrition.
on the basis of this gene index, we have identified  <dig>  gene-based microsatellite sequences, of which  <dig> were selected for testing and  <dig> were successfully amplified in a test panel of  <dig> hexaploid  and  <dig> diploid  accessions.
two quarter  <dig> pyrosequencing runs used two normalized cdna collections from stems and leaves from drought-stressed sweetpotato clone tanzania and yielded  <dig>  reads, which were assembled together with  <dig>  publically available expressed sequence tags into  <dig>  sets of overlapping dna segments and  <dig>  unassembled sequences.
a searchable version of the gene index, including a blastn function, is available at http://www.cipotato.org/sweetpotato_gene_index.
