this study shows that bacterial gbs markers are limited in number and located in the los biosynthesis genes, which corroborates the current consensus that los mimicry may be the prime etiologic determinant of gbs.
furthermore, our results demonstrate that htaflp, with its high reproducibility and resolution, is an effective technique for the detection and subsequent identification of putative bacterial disease markers.
comparison of nctc  <dig> with  <dig> gbs-associated strains revealed  <dig> potentially gbs-specific markers,  <dig> of which were identified by dna sequencing.
htaflp analysis of  <dig> highly clonal south african gbs/mfs-associated and enteritis control strains did not reveal gbs-specific markers.
gbs and mfs are probably induced by molecular mimicry between human gangliosides and bacterial lipo-oligosaccharides .
campylobacter jejuni is the predominant cause of antecedent infection in post-infectious neuropathies such as the guillain-barr√©  and miller fisher syndromes .
this study describes a new c. jejuni-specific high-throughput aflp  approach for detection and identification of dna polymorphism, in general, and of putative gbs/mfs-markers, in particular.
the dna polymorphisms could not be confirmed by pcr-rflp analysis, suggesting a baseline level of  <dig> % aflp artefacts.
we compared  <dig> different isolates of the "genome strain" nctc  <dig> obtained from different laboratories.
htaflp analysis generated approximately  <dig> markers per stain,  <dig> of which were polymorphic.
a collection of  <dig> gbs/mfs-associated and  <dig> enteritis control strains was analyzed with pcr-rflp tests based on  <dig> of these markers.
