after dosing, blood samples were collected during a 48-h time period at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. blood ciclosporin a concentrations were measured by using an hplc-ms/ms method.
a new 100 mg/ml oral solution formulation  was developed as a pharmaceutical equivalent to the marketed capsule formulations  containing  <dig>  50 mg, or 100 mg of ciclosporin a. the aim of this study was to assess and compare the pharmacokinetic profiles and bioequivalence of the two formulations following a single oral administration to dogs.
the two ciclosporin oral formulations demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic profiles and were found to be bioequivalent, and therefore, interchangeable.
ciclosporin is a selective immunomodulator used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs.
cmax, tmax, t1/ <dig>  auc0-t, auc0-∞ and kel were determined for the two ciclosporin formulations.
bioequivalence was to be concluded if the 90 % confidence intervals were within the range of 80 % to 125 % for cmax and auc0-t. dogs were monitored once daily throughout the study period for adverse effects.
the 90 % confidence intervals for cyclavance®/atopica® mean ratios of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic variables cmax and auc0-t were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80 % to 125 % .
