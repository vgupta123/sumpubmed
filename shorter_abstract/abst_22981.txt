β1-integrins were required for es cell survival in long-term cultures and for the maintenance of stem cell marker expression.
here we have studied the effects of different ecm substrates and integrins in mouse es cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor  using short-term assays as well as long-term cultures.
integrins, a central family of cellular ecm receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in es cell self-renewal remains unclear.
the growth properties and self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem  cells are regulated by their immediate microenvironment such as the extracellular matrix .

analysis of the stemness marker expression revealed subtle differences between α6- and αv-depleted es cells but the expression of both was required for optimal self-renewal in long-term es cell cultures.
removal of lif from es cell culture medium induced morphological differentiation of es cells into polarized epistem cell-like cells.
the specific functional roles of α6-, αv- and β1-integrin subunits were dissected using stable lentivirus-mediated rnai methodology.
