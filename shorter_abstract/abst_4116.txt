microarray probes were designed, one per gene, to the region closest to the 3' untranslated region  of each rhesus virtual transcript.
each probe was compared to a composite rhesus/human transcript database to test for cross-hybridization potential yielding a final probe set representing  <dig>  rhesus/human gene orthologs, including transcript variants, and over  <dig>  distinct genes.
the number of different genes represented on microarrays for unfinished genomes can be greatly increased by matching known gene transcript annotations from a closely related species with sequence data from the unfinished genome.
we constructed a database containing  <dig>  exon sequences from  <dig>  human refseq genes and compared each human exon with its best matching sequence in the january  <dig> version of the rhesus genome project list of  <dig>  dna contigs.
we hybridized mrna from rhesus brain and spleen to both the est- and genome-derived microarrays.
to address this need, we have constructed a macaque-specific high-density oligonucleotide microarray by using highly fragmented low-pass sequence contigs from the rhesus genome project together with the detailed sequence and exon structure of the human genome.
best matching rhesus exon sequences for each of the  <dig>  human genes were then concatenated in the proper order and orientation to produce a rhesus "virtual transcriptome."
signal intensity on both est- and genome-derived arrays was highly correlated with probe distance from the 3' utr, information often missing from ests yet present in early-stage genome projects.
