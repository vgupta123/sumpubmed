however, when the structures are averaged, artifacts can result in unrealistic local geometries, including unphysical bond lengths and angles.
consequently, averaging of 3d coordinates of molecular structures  is a frequent approach to obtain a consensus structure that is representative of the ensemble.
the average rmsd of the refined model from the native structure for the set becomes worse by a mere  <dig>  Å compared to the average rmsd of the averaged structures from the native structure .
the benchmarking results demonstrate that our approach for removing averaging artifacts can be very beneficial for the structural biology community.
to assess the performance of the algorithm, we applied our approach to cα models of  <dig> proteins generated by the tasser structure prediction algorithm.
herein, we describe a method to derive representative structures while limiting the number of artifacts.
