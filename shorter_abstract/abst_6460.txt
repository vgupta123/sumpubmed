the analyses addressed the carbapenemase activity of oxa- <dig>  caro expression and alterations in its primary structure.
the influence of caro on imipenem resistance was evaluated considering two aspects: the composition of the primary amino acid sequence; and the expression level of this porin.
however, it was possible to associate the caro alleles and their expression with imipenem resistance.
carbapenems are the antibiotics of choice to treat infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii, and resistance to this class can be determined by loss of membrane permeability and enzymatic mechanisms.
we concluded that, in general, for these brazilian isolates, the major carbapenem resistance mechanism was due to oxa- <dig> carbapenemase activity and that loss of caro porin plays a minor role in this phenotype.
the majority of strains  carried the carbapenemase blaoxa- <dig> gene associated with isaba <dig>  the hodge test indicated that these strains are carbapenemase producers.
here, we analyzed the basis of carbapenem resistance in clinical a. baumannii isolates from different brazilian regions.
therefore, these findings underline the complexity in addressing the role of different mechanisms in carbapenem resistance and highlight the possible influence of caro type in this phenotype.
