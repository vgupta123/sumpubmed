these analyses indicated that the high pka values, dianion dimerization constant and solubilities of ucb at various ph values, derived from our partition studies, along with literature-derived ph- and time-dependent supersaturation effects, were essential for constructing useful models that showed good qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, fits with the data.
its aqueous pka values affect many of its interactions, particularly their ph-dependence.
a companion paper shows that only our prior solvent partition studies, leading to pka values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , met all essential requirements for valid pka determinations.
in contrast, published pka values below  <dig>  were highly incompatible with the data for all systems considered.
unconjugated bilirubin  is an unstable substance with very low aqueous solubility.
