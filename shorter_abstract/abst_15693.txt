mast cell has been identified to be able to express pars and release an array of cytokines upon activation.
recently, it was reported that interleukin - <dig> could regulate the expression of pars in mast cells, and tryptase could induce il- <dig> and il- <dig> release from mast cells.
in conclusion, sirnas of pars can modulate par expression and par related cytokine production in mast cells, confirming that pars are likely to play a role in allergic reactions.
the results showed that sirnas for par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> significantly downregulated expression of par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> mrnas and proteins in p <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h following transfection.
sirna par- <dig>  and sirna par- <dig>  significantly reduced il- <dig> induced upregulation of par- <dig> and par- <dig> expression, respectively when p <dig> cells were transfected with them for  <dig> h. sirna par- <dig>  blocked il- <dig> induced downregulation of par- <dig> expression on both mrna and protein levels.
