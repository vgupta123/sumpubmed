in eukaryotic genomes, short non-autonomous transposable elements can have similar size and hairpin structures as non-coding precursor rnas.
we developed an automatic method called ncrnaclassifier to classify pre-ncrnas according to their relationship with transposable elements .
inverted repeat genes encode precursor rnas characterized by hairpin structures.
these rna hairpins are then metabolized by biosynthetic pathways to produce functional small rnas.
this resemblance leads to problems annotating small rnas.
