the present work extends the current understanding of in vitro virulence factors and antifungal susceptibility pattern of gastrointestinal yeast flora of g domesticus.
a total of  <dig> specimens of fresh droppings of broiler chickens  and domesticated chickens  were collected from the breeding sites.
till now, a detailed understanding about the gut colonisation of gallus gallus domesticus by yeasts and their virulence properties and drug resistance patterns in available literature remain sparse.
biofilm cells exhibited higher minimum inhibitory concentration  values  than planktonic cells against all antifungal compounds tested: .
virulence factors, measured among different yeast species, showed wide variability.
