afterwards, we “compiled” the transcriptional networks into nucleotide sequences to obtain the final genome sequence.
we used computational design techniques to design a rewired global transcriptional regulation of escherichia coli, yet showing a similar transcriptomic response than the wild-type.
this work provides the first algorithm for producing a genome sequence encoding a rewired transcriptional regulation with wild-type behavior under alternative environments.
how would we proceed to design a full nucleotide sequence for such genomes?
a second step would require providing evidence that it is possible to provide a nucleotide sequence for a genome encoding such transcriptional model.

our computational evolution procedure ensures that we can maintain the genotype-phenotype mapping during the rewiring of the regulatory network.
such refactored genomes are constituted by operons that contain sets of genes sharing around the 60% of their biological functions and, if evolved under highly variable environmental conditions, have regulatory networks, which turn out to respond more than 20% faster to multiple external perturbations.
