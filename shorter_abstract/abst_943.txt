under these conditions, mixed-strain infections are predicted to show lower virulence  than are single-clone infections, due to competition favouring non-contributing social 'cheats' whose presence will reduce within-host growth.
crucially, cheats were more successful in mixed infections compared with single-clone infections, while the opposite was true of cooperators.
we found that infection by siderophore-producing bacteria  results in more rapid host death than does infection by non-producers , and that mixtures of both result in intermediate levels of virulence.
