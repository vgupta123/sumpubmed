through a degenerate pcr approach aimed at identifying novel homeoproteins expressed in the male reproductive system, we have detected several homeoproteins most of which had never been described before in this tissue.
one of these homeoproteins is ladybird-like homeobox  <dig> , a homeobox factor mostly known to be expressed in the nervous system.
to better define the expression profile of lbx <dig> in the male reproductive system, we have performed in situ hybridization throughout testicular and epididymal development and into adulthood.
in the epididymis, a highly segmented tissue, lbx <dig> shows a regionalized expression profile, being more expressed in proximal segments of the caput epididymis than any other segment.
homeoproteins are a class of transcription factors that are well-known regulators of organogenesis and cell differentiation in numerous tissues, including the male reproductive system.
in the testis, we found that lbx <dig> is constitutively expressed at high levels in sertoli cells.
altogether, our data suggest that the homeoprotein lbx <dig> might be involved in the regulation of male reproductive system development and cell differentiation as well as in male epididymal segmentation.
finally, lbx <dig> can also be detected in a population of germ cells in adults.
in interstitial cells, lbx <dig> is weakly expressed during fetal and early postnatal life, highly expressed around p32-p <dig>  and absent in adult animals.
