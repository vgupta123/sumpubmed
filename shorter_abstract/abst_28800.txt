this information is expected to be of major value in future analysis of lysozyme function and in studies of the dynamics of evolution by gene duplication.
current data strongly suggests that genetic diversity translates into functional diversity.
whereas most organisms have only few lysozyme genes, nematodes of the genus caenorhabditis possess a surprisingly large repertoire of up to  <dig> genes.
their lysozymes fall into three distinct clades, one belonging to the invertebrate-type and the other two to the protist-type lysozymes.
their diversification is characterised by  ancestral gene duplications preceding species separation followed by maintenance of genes,  ancestral duplications followed by gene loss in some of the species, and  recent duplications after divergence of species.
both ancestral and recent gene duplications are associated in several cases with signatures of adaptive sequence evolution, indicating that diversifying selection contributed to lysozyme differentiation.
we used phylogenetic inference and sequence analysis tools to assess the evolution of lysozymes from three congeneric nematode species, caenorhabditis elegans, c. briggsae, and c. remanei.
our analysis provides an evolutionary framework for understanding the diversification of lysozymes through gene duplication and subsequent differentiation.
their main function appears to be defence against pathogens, although some of them have also been implicated in digestion.
gene duplications are a major source of evolutionary innovation.
