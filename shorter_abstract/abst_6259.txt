here, for the first time, we conducted comparative genomic analyses of two epidemiologically-unrelated porcine, disease-causing etec o157; e. coli o <dig> svetec and e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  and examined their phylogenetic relationship with ehec o157:h <dig>
o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> belong to a novel sequence type  that comprises part of the st <dig> complex and are genetically distinct from ehec o <dig>  comparative phylogenetic analysis using phylosift shows that e. coli o <dig> svetec and e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> group into a single clade and are most similar to the extraintestinal avian pathogenic escherichia coli  isolate o <dig> that clusters within the st <dig> complex.
both isolates harbor a large repertoire of antibiotic resistance genes but their association with mobile elements remains undetermined.
we present an analysis of the first draft genome sequences of two epidemiologically-unrelated, pathogenic etec o <dig>  e. coli o <dig> svetec and e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> belong to the st <dig> complex and are phylogenetically distinct to ehec o <dig> lineages that reside within the st <dig> complex.
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  are a major economic threat to pig production globally, with serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> implicated as the leading diarrhoeal pathogens affecting pigs below four weeks of age.
putative etec virulence factors, including the toxins stb and lt and the k <dig>  adhesin, were conserved between o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  the o <dig> svetec isolate also encoded the heat stable enterotoxin sta and a second allele of stb, whilst a prophage within o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> encoded the serum survival gene bor.
