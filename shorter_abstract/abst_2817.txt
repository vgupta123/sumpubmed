modern biology has shifted from "one gene" approaches to methods for genomic-scale analysis like microarray technology, which allow simultaneous measurement of thousands of genes.
as the first go tool, egon supports hypothesis testing for three different situations .
it allows a user to define and archive new go annotations and it supports hypothesis testing related to go category representations.
data submitted by the user are stored in the database, where it can easily be updated, shared between users and exported in various formats.
many gene-set testing methods and software packages are now available, most of which use a variety of statistical tests to assess the genes in a set for biological information.
genetools provides three different tools: i) nmc annotation tool, which offers annotations from several databases like unigene, entrez gene, swissprot and geneontology, in both single- and batch search mode.
the annotation data are updated weekly, guaranteeing that users get data most recently available.
genetools is the first "all in one" annotation tool, providing users with a rapid extraction of highly relevant gene annotation data for e.g.
ii) go annotator tool, where users can add new gene ontology  annotations to genes of interest.
however, such tools often leave the investigator with large volumes of apparently unorganized information.
iii) egon, a tool for visualization and statistical hypothesis testing of go category representation.
these user defined go annotations can be used in further analysis or exported for public distribution.
an important additional function is an evidence-code filter that allows users, to select the go annotations for the analysis.
