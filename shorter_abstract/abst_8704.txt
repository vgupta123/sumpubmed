the phytase was stable within a ph range of  <dig>  −  <dig>  and showed high substrate specificity for sodium phytate.
the homology analysis based on n-terminal amino acid and dna sequencing indicated that the purified phytase was different from other known phytases.
phytic acid and phytates can interact with biomolecules, such as proteins and carbohydrates, and are anti-nutritional factors found in food and feed.
seventy-three percent of the original activity of the phytase was maintained following incubation at 90°c for  <dig> min.
phytase can hydrolyze phytic acid and phytates to release a series of lower phosphate esters of myoinositol and orthophosphate.
thus, the purification and characterization of novel phytases that can be used in food and feed processing is of particular interest to the food and feed industries.
the phytase was found to be thermally stable over a wide temperature range at neutral ph.
a novel neutral and heat-tolerant phytase from a newly isolated strain bacillus nealsonii zj <dig> was purified to homogeneity with a yield of  <dig> % and a purification fold of  <dig>  the molecular weight of the purified phytase obtained by sds-page was  <dig> kda.
these properties suggest that this phytase is a suitable alternative to fungal phytases for the hydrolysis of phytic acid and phytates in food and feed processing industries.
