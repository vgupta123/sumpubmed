together, results support a function for pagr in the biosynthesis of rg-i arabinogalactans and illustrate the essential roles of these polysaccharides in vegetative and reproductive plant growth.
arabidopsis lines overexpressing pagr exhibit pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and the loss of apical dominance as well as an increase in rg-i type-ii arabinogalactan content.
nbpagr-silenced plants exhibited reduced internode and petiole expansion.
cell wall materials from nbpagr-silenced plants had reduced galactose content compared to the control.
here we report the identification of a highly conserved putative glycosyltransferase encoding gene, pectic arabinogalactan synthesis-related , affecting the biosynthesis of rg-i arabinogalactans and critical for pollen tube growth.
immunological and linkage analyses support that rg-i has reduced type-i arabinogalactan content and reduced branching of the rg-i backbone in nbpagr-silenced plants.
in vitro pollen germination assays revealed reduced rates of pollen tube formation in pollen from pagr heterozygotes.
t-dna insertions in pagr were identified in arabidopsis thaliana and were found to segregate at a 1: <dig> ratio of heterozygotes to wild type.
we were unable to isolate homozygous pagr mutants as pagr mutant alleles were not transmitted via pollen.
the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-i  has two types of arabinogalactan side chains, type-i and type-ii arabinogalactans.
