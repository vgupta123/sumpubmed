the complexes have been proposed to contain subunits formed by proteins common to all eukaryotes and additional subunits regarded as lineage specific.
the obtained results clearly demonstrate structural variability/diversity of these complexes in the amoebozoa lineage and the reduction of their complexity as compared with the same complexes of model organisms.
since amoebozoa is poorly sampled for the complexes we investigated the outer membrane complexes, namely tom, tob/sam and ermes complexes, using available genome and transcriptome sequences, including transcriptomes assembled by us.
the results indicate differences in the organization of the amoebozoa tom, tob/sam and ermes complexes, with the tom complex appearing to be the most diverse.
this is reflected by differences in the number of involved subunits and in similarities to the cognate proteins of representatives from different supergroups of eukaryotes.
proper functioning of mitochondria depends on the import of nearly all proteins that is performed by complexes located in both mitochondrial membranes.
