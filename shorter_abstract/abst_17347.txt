as an organism is made up of many different tissues and organs, each with its own genetic programme, it is pertinent to ask: how relevant is tissue in terms of total transcriptome variability?
in order to gain insight on these issues, we conducted microarray expression profiling of  <dig> different tissues from four animals of two extreme pig breeds, large white and iberian, two males and two females.
nevertheless, we were able to confidently identify genes with differential expression across tissues between breeds  and between sexes .
mixed model analysis and neighbor â€“ joining trees showed that tissues with similar developmental origin clustered closer than those with different embryonic origins.
artificial selection has resulted in animal breeds with extreme phenotypes.
embryonic development leaves an enduring footprint on the transcriptome.
often a sound biological interpretation was possible for overrepresented gene ontology categories within differentially expressed genes between groups of tissues.
interaction with tissue can be important for differentially expressed genes between breeds but not so much for genes whose expression differ between sexes.
