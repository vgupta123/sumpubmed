over  <dig>  individual abc transporter expression values were generated by taqman low density arrays  to obtain a sensitivity comparable with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions.
abc transporter expression profiles were determined in non-hematopoietic stem cells  from embryonic, neonatal and adult origin as well as in various mature blood cell types.
yet, sets of transporters characteristic for different stem cell types could be identified, suggesting restricted functions in stem cell physiology.
remarkably, in hscs we could not pinpoint any single transporter expressed at an evidently elevated level when compared to all the mature blood cell types studied.
the high expression of specific transporters in non-hscs and mature blood cells suggests a specialized, cell type dependent function and warrants further functional experiments to determine their exact roles in cellular physiology.
instead, a distinct abc transporter expression signature may be essential for stem cell function.
here we have studied whether non-hematopoietic stem cells  exhibit a similar abc transporter expression signature as hscs.
the abc transporter expression signature may guarantee lifelong protection of hscs but may also preserve stem cell integrity by extrusion of agents that trigger their differentiation.
atp-binding cassette  transporters protect cells against unrelated  substances by pumping them across cell membranes.
earlier we showed that many abc transporters are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells  compared to more committed progenitor cells.
these findings challenge the concept that individual abc transporters are implicated in maintaining stem cell integrity.
furthermore, regardless their origin, non-hscs exhibited strikingly similar abc transporter expression profiles that were distinct from those in hscs.
