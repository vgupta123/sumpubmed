the useful signal produced by wes data will be hindered by the intrinsic noise present in the data itself.
hmm is frequently used to identify cnv in data produced by various technologies including array comparative genomic hybridization  and wgs.
here, we propose a method that consists of discrete wavelet transform  to reduce noise.

here, we propose an hmm to detect cnv in cancer exome data.
whole exome sequenicng  is a popular alternative to whole genome sequencing  to study disease specific genomic variations.
we present a new method, called convex, to estimate copy number variation in whole exome sequencing data.
one of the main types of genetic variations in cancer is copy number variations .
however, finding cnv in cancer samples using wes data has not been fully explored.
the identification of copy number gains/losses of each targeted region is performed by a hidden markov model .
