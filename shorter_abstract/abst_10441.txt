the metal iron zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig>  real-time pcr analysis showed that heat and desiccation treatments resulted in a significant increase in sjgmd <dig> and sjgmd <dig> transcript abundance, suggesting that the sjgmds are directly involved in the acclimitisation of s. japonica to abiotic stresses.
our work identified two novel genes encoding gmd in s. japonica, comparatively characterized their structural characteristics and enzyme kinetics, and revealed the function of gmd in the stress adaptability of s. japonica.
saccharina japonica is an important commercial brown seaweed, its main product is alginate, which is used in food, textile and by the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.

kinetic analysis demonstrated the km values for the substrate gdp-mannose were 289 μm  and 177 μm , and the km values for the cofactor nad+ were 139 μm  and 195 μm .
however, little is known about gmd in s. japonica.
here we report comparative biochemical analysis of two gmd genes in s. japonica.
two gmd genes from s. japonica  were cloned.
the knowledge obtained here enriched our understanding of the alginate synthesis mechanism in s. japonica, and may promote further research on functional differences between gmd genes.
