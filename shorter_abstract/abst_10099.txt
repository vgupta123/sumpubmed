we also discovered that esirnas generated from retrotransposons and hairpins have distinct physical characteristics including a higher predominance of  <dig> nucleotide hairpin-derived esirnas and differences in 3' and 5' base preference.
additionally, proteins involved in 3’ end processing, such as symplekin, cpsf <dig> and cpsr <dig>  have been recently implicated in the esirna pathway.

endogenous small interfering rnas repress mrna levels and retrotransposon mobility in drosophila somatic cells by poorly understood mechanisms.
here we present evidence of overlap between two essential rna metabolic pathways: esirna biogenesis and mrna 3' end processing.
together, these observations support a novel mechanism in which differences in localization of esirna precursors impacts esirna biogenesis.
rnai-depletion of either cpsf <dig> or symplekin results in nuclear retention of both hairpin and retrotransposon precursors suggesting that polyadenylation indirectly affects cellular localization of dcr <dig> substrates.
we have identified a nucleus-specific interaction between the essential esirna cleavage enzyme dicer <dig>  and symplekin, a component of the core cleavage complex  required for 3' end processing of all eukaryotic mrnas.
rnai-depletion of ccc components symplekin and cpsf <dig> causes perturbations in esirna abundance that correlate with fluctuations in retrotransposon and hairpin esirna precursor levels.
<dig> nucleotide esirnas are primarily generated from retrotransposons and two inverted repeat  loci in drosophila culture cells in a dicer <dig> dependent manner.
