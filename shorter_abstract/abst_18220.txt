we demonstrate that das writeback is effective, usable and will provide the appropriate environment for the creation and evolution of community protein annotation.
we implemented this new specification as extensions of both a das server and a das client.
the architecture was designed with the involvement of the das community and it was improved after performing usability experiments emulating a real annotation task.
we designed and developed a collaborative annotation system for proteins called das writeback.
das writeback is a protocol extension of das to provide the functionalities of adding, editing and deleting annotations.
