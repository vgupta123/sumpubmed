this method doesn’t detect pseudo rabies, porcine parvovirus or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; moreover it can distinguish porcine circovirus type  <dig> from p <dig> by melting temperature analysis.
a pair of primers was designed and used to amplify a 119 bp dna fragment to generate a recombinant plasmid which was served as the standard.
a sybr i qpcr protocol was established using the p <dig> recombinant plasmid standard and the sensitivity, specificity and stability of this method was analyzed.
the results demonstrate a strong correlation with p <dig> recombinant plasmid titers when virus dna copy numbers fall in between 100 ~  <dig> copies/μl.
this study aims to develop a rapid, sensitive and specific method to detect p <dig>
the porcine circovirus-like agent p <dig> is a newly discovered dna virus with a single-stranded circular genome that is highly homologous to that of porcine circovirus type  <dig>  p <dig> infection can cause symptoms resembling postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
