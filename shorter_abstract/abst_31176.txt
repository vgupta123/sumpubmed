firstly, we established an efficient method to cluster a. thaliana and o. sativa full proteomes into gene families.
phylogenomic predictions for all validated gene families in both species were easily achieved and we can conclude that our methodology outperforms similarly based methods.
as gene functions change during evolution, reconstructing the evolutionary history of genes should be a more accurate way to differentiate orthologs from paralogs.
we developed a procedure for ortholog prediction between oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana.
we validated the full procedure using test sets of orthologs and paralogs to demonstrate that our method outperforms pairwise methods for ortholog predictions.
then, we developed an optimized phylogenomics pipeline for ortholog inference.
phylogenomics takes into account phylogenetic information from high-throughput genome annotation and is the most straightforward way to infer orthologs.
