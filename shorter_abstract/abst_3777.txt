this experimental design specifically addresses interactions between the selected climate change variables and any ecological consequences caused by changes in species composition or richness.
diversity effects were underpinned by strong species composition effects, illustrating the importance of individual species identity.
overall, our findings suggest that in natural systems, the complex interactions between changing environmental conditions and any associated changes in invertebrate assemblage structure are likely to reduce mpb biomass.
in this study, we examine the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric co <dig> concentrations , temperature  and invertebrate biodiversity on mpb biomass in experimental systems.
the effects of elevated co <dig> concentration, temperature and invertebrate diversity were not additive, rather they interacted to determine mpb biomass, and overall this effect was negative.
