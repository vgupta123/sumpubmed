the presented strategy is demonstrated to be an effective approach to identify genes that establish functional relationships.
this feature is important when considering a large set of samples characterised by heterogeneous experimental conditions where different pools of biological processes can be active across the samples.
the putative partners of the studied gene are then further characterised, analysing the distribution of the gene ontology terms and integrating the protein-protein interaction  data.
two genes among the predicted putative partners of tbx <dig>  were confirmed by in vivo binding assays  in which the putative dna enhancer sequence sites of gata <dig> and gli <dig> were found to be bound by the tbx <dig> protein.
the methodology identifies and characterises genes with a similar expression profile, through data mining and integrating data from publicly available resources, to contribute to a better understanding of gene regulation and cell function.
integration and analysis of ppi data confirmed the prediction of the methodology, since the genes identified to be functionally related were associated to proteins close in the ppi network.
the strategy relies on the analysis of gene expression profile similarity, considering large datasets of expression data.
the strategy was applied for the analysis of the functional relationships of a gene of known function, pyruvate kinase, and for the prediction of functional partners of the human transcription factor tbx <dig>  in both cases the analysis was done on a dataset composed by breast primary tumour expression data derived from the literature.
hence, the strategy enables the exclusion of samples that are not relevant for each gene pair analysed.
in this context, the mining and the integration of a large amount of publicly available data, regarding the transcriptome and the proteome states of a cell, are a useful resource to complement biological research.
