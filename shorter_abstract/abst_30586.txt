the present results revealed that gasoline inhalation induced significant fluctuations in the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters in the studied brain regions.
these physiological impairments were accompanied with a higher tendency towards aggressive behaviour as a consequence to gasoline inhalation.
the impacts of gasoline exposure on na+, k+-atpase, superoxide dismutase , acetylcholinesterase , total protein, reduced glutathione , and lipid peroxidation  in the cerebral cortex, and monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine , norepinephrine  and serotonin  in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and hypothalamus were evaluated.
moreover, the group exposed to the unleaded gasoline exhibited an increase in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in ache and superoxide dismutase activities.
this was concomitant with a decrease in na+, k+-atpase activity and total protein content.
it is concluded from the present work that chronic exposure to either the leaded or the unleaded gasoline vapours impaired the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and other biochemical parameters in different brain areas and modulated several behavioural aspects related to aggression in rats.
the effect of gasoline exposure on the aggressive behaviour tests was also studied.
