in this paper, we consider illuminaâ€™s sequencing-by-synthesis platform which relies on reversible terminator chemistry and describe the acquired signal by reformulating its mathematical model as a hidden markov model.
relying on this model and sequential monte carlo methods, we develop a parameter estimation and base calling scheme called particlecall.
the results show that the developed base calling scheme is significantly more computationally efficient than the best performing unsupervised method currently available, while achieving the same accuracy.
accuracy and lengths of their reads, however, are yet to surpass those provided by the conventional sanger sequencing method.
