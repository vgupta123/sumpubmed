with the number of known structures of unknown function expanding at a rapid pace, an urgent task is to provide reliable clues to their biological function on a large scale.
the 3dzd enables fast structure database searches, taking advantage of its rotation invariance and compact representation.
the three new surface representations of backbone atoms, originally devised all-atom-surface representation, and the combination of all-atom surface with the backbone representation are examined.
overall, the 3dzds representing backbone atoms show better retrieval performance than the original all-atom surface representation.
the search results of protein surface represented with the 3dzd has showngood agreement with the existing structure classifications, but some discrepancies were also observed.
moreover, a new challenge has arisen from recent techniques such as electron microscopy , which provide low-resolution structure data.
previously, we have introduced a method for protein surface shape representation using the 3d zernike descriptors .
moreover, we observed that the 3dzd is also powerful in comparing low-resolution structures obtained by electron microscopy.
the surface representations are evaluated on structure retrieval using two existing classifications, scop and the ce-based classification.
conventional approaches for structure comparison are not suitable for a real-time database search due to their slow speed.
