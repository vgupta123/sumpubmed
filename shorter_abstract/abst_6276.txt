accordingly, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of the benefit of different oral dosage forms  in pigs concerning the environmental pollution of sulfadiazine.
simultaneously, sedimentation and airborne dust were collected and plasma and urine levels were determined.
all formulations result in comparable plasma and urine levels, but massive differences in environmental pollution .
two subtherapeutic dosages were evaluated in powder mixtures to gain information about their potential to pollute the pig barn.
using pharmaceutical formulations like pellets or granula, the environmental pollution of sulfonamides can significantly be diminished due to massive dust reduction during feeding.

furthermore, a new group of pigs was kept in the stable after powder feeding of another pig group to determine the possible absorption of environmentally distributed antibiotics.
pigs were orally treated with three dosage forms.
