phosphorylation greatly enhanced the ability of smtnl <dig> to associate with tpm in vitro; surface plasmon resonance yielded a 10-fold enhancement in k
smtnl <dig> is phosphorylated at ser <dig> by protein kinase a during calcium desensitization in smooth muscle, yet the effect of smtnl <dig> phosphorylation on tpm- and cam-binding has yet to be investigated.
the smoothelin-like  <dig> protein  can associate with tropomyosin  and calmodulin , two proteins essential to the smooth muscle contractile process.
