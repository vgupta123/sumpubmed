here, we propose a simple model of antigenic evolution in the influenza virus that accounts for this apparent discrepancy.
we find that evolution away from existing human immunity results in rapid population turnover in the influenza virus and that this population turnover occurs primarily along a single antigenic axis.
this model displays rapid evolution but low standing diversity and simultaneously accounts for the epidemiological, genetic, antigenic, and geographical patterns displayed by the virus.
in the model, the influenza population shows a 1- to 2-year timescale of repeatability, suggesting a window in which evolutionary dynamics could be, in theory, predictable.
since its emergence in  <dig>  influenza a  has evolved extensively in genotype and antigenic phenotype.
however, despite strong pressure to evolve away from human immunity and to diversify in antigenic phenotype, h3n <dig> influenza shows paradoxically limited genetic and antigenic diversity present at any one time.
in this model, antigenic phenotype is represented by a n-dimensional vector, and virus mutations perturb phenotype within this continuous euclidean space.
selective dynamics induce a canalized evolutionary trajectory, in which the evolutionary fate of the influenza population is surprisingly repeatable.
