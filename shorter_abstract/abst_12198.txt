krab-zfps  are vertebrate-restricted transcriptional repressors encoded in the hundreds by the mouse and human genomes.
this system allowed us to tether krab/kap <dig> to hundreds of euchromatic sites within genes, and to record its impact on gene expression.
together, these data indicate that high levels of gene activity in the genomic environment and the pre-deposition of repressive histone marks within a gene increase its susceptibility to krab/kap1-mediated repression.
we found that genes that were susceptible to krab/kap1-mediated silencing carried higher levels of repressive histone marks both at the promoter and over the transcribed region than genes that were insensitive.
