we take advantage of the availability of sequenced fungal genomes and present an unbiased method for finding putative pathogen proteins and secreted effectors in a query genome via comparative hidden markov model analyses followed by unsupervised protein clustering.
secreted pathogen proteins are referred to as effectors and have thus far been identified by selecting small, cysteine-rich peptides from the secretome despite increasing evidence that not all effectors share these attributes.
our pipeline has successfully uncovered conservation patterns, putative effectors and motifs of fungal pathogens that would have been overlooked by existing approaches that identify effectors as small, secreted, cysteine-rich peptides.
three f. graminearum protein clusters are found with an enriched secretion signal.
our method returns experimentally validated fungal effectors in stagonospora nodorum and fusarium oxysporum as well as the n-terminal y/f/wxc-motif from the barley powdery mildew pathogen.
application to the cereal pathogen fusarium graminearum reveals a secreted phosphorylcholine phosphatase that is characteristic of hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic cereal pathogens and shares an ancient selection process with bacterial plant pathogens.
fungal pathogens cause devastating losses in economically important cereal crops by utilising pathogen proteins to infect host plants.
