the abs can be subsequently identified from an “improved” common logit model  by combining several sibling-like lms in a heuristic genetic algorithm selection process.
based on an unbiased reciprocal test, we demonstrate that each gene in a group of abs is required to maintain high cancer sample classification accuracy, and we observe that abs are not limited to genes common to all platforms.
investigating the abs using gene ontology  enrichment, literature survey, and network analyses indicated that our abs are not only strongly related to cancer development but also highly connected in a diverse network of biological interactions.
the proposed meta-analysis method called miningabs is able to efficiently identify abs from different independently performed array-based datasets, and we show its validity in cancer biology via go enrichment, literature survey and network analyses.
human disease often arises as a consequence of alterations in a set of associated genes rather than alterations to a set of unassociated individual genes.
