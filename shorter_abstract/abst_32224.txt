the phylochip was subsequently tested with environmental samples that were composed of ecm fungal dna from spruce and beech plantation fungal communities.
evaluation of the phylochip by hybridising environmental samples confirmed the possible application of this technology for detecting and monitoring ectomycorrhizal fungi at specific sites in a routine and reproducible manner.
ninety-nine percent of the tested oligonucleotides generated positive hybridisation signals with their corresponding amplicons.
for the first time, we developed a custom phylochip that is specific for several ectomycorrhizal fungi.
to understand their underlying dynamics, ecm communities have been surveyed with ribosomal dna-based sequencing methods.
in forest ecosystems, communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi  are influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors.
the results were in concordance with the its sequencing of morphotypes and the its clone library sequencing results that were obtained using the same pcr products.
we have constructed a custom ribosomal dna phylochip to identify ecm fungi.
cross-hybridisation was mainly restricted at the genus level, particularly for cortinarius and lactarius species.
the phylochip was first validated using pcr amplicons of reference species.
