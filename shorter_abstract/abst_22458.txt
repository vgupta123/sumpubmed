an analysis of the recently completed genome sequence of l. infantum, using this repeated sequence as bait, led to the identification of a new class of repeated elements that are interspersed along the different l. infantum chromosomes.
for comparative purposes, we have identified the sider <dig> elements existing in l. major and leishmania braziliensis chromosomes  <dig>  while sider <dig> elements are highly conserved both in number and location between l. infantum and l. major, no such conservation exists when comparing with sider2s in l. braziliensis chromosome  <dig>
the completion of the genome projects for three leishmania species has generated invaluable information enabling a direct analysis of genome structure and organization.
apart from a proved involvement in post-trancriptional mechanisms of gene regulation, sider <dig> elements could be involved in dna amplification processes and, perhaps, in chromosome segregation as centromeric sequences.
protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania are causative agents of a diverse spectrum of human diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis.
sequence characteristics, genomic distribution and evolutionarily conservation of sider2s are suggestive of relevant functions for these elements in leishmania.
sider <dig> elements constitute a relevant piece in the leishmania genome organization.
