the nmrstarlib package can be used as a library for accessing and manipulating data stored in nmr-star files and as a command-line tool to convert from nmr-star file format into its equivalent json file format and vice versa, and to visualize chemical shift values.
the nmrstarlib package is a simple, fast, and efficient library for accessing data from the bmrb.
while the format is human readable, the size of most bmrb entries makes computer readability and explicit representation a practical requirement for almost any rigorous systematic analysis.
we have tested this new library on all current bmrb entries: 100% of all entries are parsed without any errors for both nmr-star version  <dig>  and version  <dig>  formatted files.
the biological magnetic resonance data bank  is a public repository of nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopic data of biological macromolecules.
we also compared our software to three currently available python libraries for parsing nmr-star formatted files: pystarlib, nmrpystar, and pynmrstar.
the library provides an intuitive dictionary-based interface with which python programs can read, edit, and write nmr-star formatted files and their equivalent jsonized nmr-star files.
the library has facilities for reading and writing both nmr-star version  <dig>  and  <dig>  formatted files, parsing them into usable python dictionary- and list-based data structures, making access and manipulation of the experimental data very natural within python programs .
another major advantage of this design is that data stored in original nmr-star can be easily converted into its equivalent javascript object notation  format, a lightweight data interchange format, facilitating data access and manipulation using python and any other programming language that implements a json parser/generator .
