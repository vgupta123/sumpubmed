emerging infectious diseases threaten na√Øve host populations with extinction.
we monitored the prevalence of bd for four years in the northern leopard frog, rana pipiens, which is critically imperiled in british columbia , canada.
some individuals cleared their bd infections and the return rate between infected and uninfected individuals was not significantly different.
the bc population of r. pipiens appears to have evolved a level of resistance that allows it to co-exist with bd.
chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease of amphibians, is caused by the pathogenic fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis  and has been linked to global declines in amphibians.
however, this small population of r. pipiens remains vulnerable to extinction.
