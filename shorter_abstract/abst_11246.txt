this study supports the concept that the intestinal epithelium has evolved to maintain a physiological state of inflammation with respect to continuous microbial exposure, which serves to sustain a tight intestinal barrier while preventing overt inflammatory responses that would compromise barrier function.
specifically, gene network analysis revealed that microbial colonization activated both type i  and type ii  interferon receptor mediated signaling cascades leading to enhanced expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , stat <dig> and ifn regulatory factor  <dig>  transcription factors and the induction of ifn-inducible genes as a reflection of intestinal epithelial inflammation.
in addition, activated rna expression of nf-kappa-b inhibitor alpha  and toll interacting protein , both inhibitors of inflammation, along with downregulated expression of the immunoregulatory transcription factor gata binding protein- <dig>  is consistent with the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.
furthermore, differential expression of genes associated with antigen presentation  demonstrated that microbiota induced immune responses using a distinct regulatory mechanism common for these genes.
to gain insight into host-microbe interactions in a piglet model, a functional genomics approach was used to address the working hypothesis that transcriptionally regulated genes associated with promoting epithelial barrier function are activated as a defensive response to the intestinal microbiota.
consistent with our hypothesis, resident microbiota induced the expression of genes contributing to intestinal epithelial cell turnover, mucus biosynthesis, and priming of the immune system.
