here we report on an ethyl-methane sulfonate-mediated arabidopsis mutant that fails to induce cyt elevation in response to exudate preparations from the pathogenic mibrobes alternaria brassicae, rhizoctonia solani, phytophthora parasitica var.
we isolated an arabidopsis mutant which fails to induce cyt elevation in response to exudate preparations from various microbes.
it accumulates high levels of reactive oxygen species and contains elevated salicylic acid, abscisic acid and bioactive jasmonic acid iso-leucine levels.
furthermore, cycam <dig> shows altered responses to abscisic acid treatments: the hormone inhibits germination and growth of the mutant.
therefore, cycam <dig> couples cyt elevation to biotic, abiotic and oxidative stress responses.
the higher susceptibility of the mutant to pathogen infections correlates with the higher accumulation of defense-related compounds, such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen-species, defense-related mrna levels and secondary metabolites.
depending on the analysed response, the elevated levels of defense-related compounds are either caused by the cycam mutation and are promoted by the pathogen, or they are mainly due to the pathogen infection or application of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
ca2+, a versatile intracellular second messenger in various signaling pathways, initiates many responses involved in growth, defense and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress.
cytoplasmic ca2+elevation mutant <dig>  is susceptible to infections by a. brassicae, its toxin preparation and sensitive to abiotic stress such as drought and salt.
reactive oxygen species- and phytohormone-related genes are higher in a. brassicae-treated wild-type and mutant seedlings.
