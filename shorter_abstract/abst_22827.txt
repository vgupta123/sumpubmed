3- <dig> october  <dig> asia pacific bioinformatics network  eleventh international conference on bioinformatics  bangkok, thailand
a brief description of various modules, their scientific basis, validation, and how to use the server to develop in silico suggestions of lead molecules is provided.
computational methods utilizing the structural and functional information help to understand specific molecular recognition events between the target biomolecule and candidate hits and make it possible to design improved lead molecules for the target.
each of the modules is thoroughly validated on a large dataset of protein/dna drug targets.
sanjeevini represents a massive on-going scientific endeavor to provide to the user, a freely accessible state of the art software suite for protein and dna targeted lead molecule discovery.
the article presents sanjeevini, a freely accessible user friendly web-server, to aid in drug discovery.
