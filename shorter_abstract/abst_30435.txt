however, current alignment methods are generally insensitive to detect mis.
what makes mid different from other variant detection tools is that mid can handle small mis and multiple breakpoints within an unmapped read.
moreover, mid improves reliability in low coverage data by integrating multiple samples.
mid is reliable on low coverage data, which is suitable for large-scale projects such as the  <dig> genomes project .
here we develop a novel tool, mid , to identify mis in human genomes using next-generation sequencing reads.
mid identified previously unknown mis from the 1kgp that overlap with genes and regulatory elements in the human genome.
therefore our tool is expected to be useful to improve the study of mis as a type of genetic variant in the human genome.
to our knowledge, mid is the first method that can efficiently and reliably identify mis from unmapped short next-generation sequencing reads.
our evaluation demonstrated that mid outperforms gustaf, which can currently detect inversions from 30 bp to 500 bp.
