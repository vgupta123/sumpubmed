the n-terminal domain is a putative catalytic domain with significant similarity to known glycoside hydrolases, the c-terminal domain has a beta-sandwich fold typically found in c-terminal domains of other glycosyl hydrolases, however these domains are typically involved in substrate binding.
based on this we have renamed the pfam families representing the two domains found in the bt_ <dig> protein, pf <dig> and pf <dig>  as putative glycoside hydrolase and glycoside hydrolase-associated c-terminal domain respectively.
bt_ <dig> from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> is a protein of unknown function and a member of a large protein family consisting entirely of uncharacterized proteins.

a psi-blast search found over  <dig> full length and over  <dig> half size homologs consisting only of the n-terminal domain.
structural and sequence analyses of the bt_ <dig> protein identifies it as a glycosyl hydrolase, expanding an already impressive catalog of enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism in bacteroides spp.
