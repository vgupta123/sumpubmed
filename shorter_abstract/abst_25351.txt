all of the constructs were arrayed on glass slides and reverse transfected into hek293t cells for protein expression.
the cell array-based protein expression and detection approach is a cost-effective platform for large-scale functional analyses, including protein subcellular localization and cell phenotype screening.
open reading frames of these genes were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with an amino-terminal his <dig> tag.
molecular analysis of down's syndrome, however, poses a particular challenge, because the aneuploid region of chr <dig> contains many genes of unknown function.
furthermore, the alteration in cell morphology and growth as a result of protein over-expression for claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> genes has been characterized.
trisomy of human chromosome  <dig>  results in down's syndrome, a complex developmental and neurodegenerative disease.
we chose  <dig> genes that were distributed over the majority of 21q, ranging from rbm <dig>  to mcm3ap , with part of them expressed aberrantly in the down's syndrome mouse model.
the results from this study reveal novel functional features of human chr <dig> proteins, which should contribute to further understanding of the molecular pathology of down's syndrome.
subcellular localization of human chr <dig> proteins may contribute to further understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of the genes that code for these proteins.
here, we report the subcellular localization properties of  <dig> proteins.
