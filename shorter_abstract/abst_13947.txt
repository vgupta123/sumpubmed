this method relies on the combination of hopf bifurcation and routh-hurwitz stability criterion, which is widely applied in control system design.
a novel method for quantifying the robustness of oscillatory behavior to parameter perturbations is presented in this paper.
unfortunately, multiparameter robustness analysis suffers from computational limitations.
