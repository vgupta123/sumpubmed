the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likelihood method, generated by mega  <dig> ®.
our study suggests that recombination events between vaccine strains and field isolates may contribute to prrsv virulence in the field.
two atypical prrs cases were observed in  <dig> and  <dig> characterized by late-term abortion, fever and sudden increase in sow mortality which persisted for a prolonged period of time.
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most expensive diseases of modern swine production & results in annual economic losses and cost the industry over  <dig> million usd in u.s. alone and billions of dollars worldwide.
analysis of the orf <dig> and orf <dig> showed high degree of sequence homology to prrsv parent vaccine strain vr- <dig>  respprrsv and other mutant/chimeric virus strains.

sequencing of the viral envelope glycoprotein  and nucleocapsid protein  of prrsv was done using the bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit chemistry.
