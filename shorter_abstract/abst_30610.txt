the purified biohx protein displayed carboxylesterase activity, and it was most active on p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids substrate with a short acyl chain .
the biohx gene, encoding an enzyme that is capable of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids, was expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> using the pet expression system.
the biohx gene encodes a protein of  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, displaying 24-39% amino acid sequence identity to a few characterized bacterial bioh enzymes.
the results demonstrated that biohx is a novel carboxylesterase, displaying distinct biochemical properties with strong application potential in industry.
our results also provided the evidence for the effectiveness of functional metagenomic approach for identifying novel bioh genes from complex ecosystem.
comparing biohx with other known bioh proteins revealed interesting diversity in their sensitivity to ionic and nonionic detergents and organic solvents, and biohx exhibited exceptional resistance to organic solvents, being the most tolerant one amongst all known bioh enzymes.
to date, very few bioh genes have been characterized.
this ascribed biohx as a novel carboxylesterase with a strong potential in industrial applications.
it contains a pentapeptide motif  and a catalytic triad , both of which are characteristic for lipolytic enzymes.
screening of an unamplified metagenomic library with a tributyrin-containing medium led to the isolation of a clone exhibiting lipolytic activity.
in this study, we cloned and identified a novel bioh gene, biohx, from an environmental metagenome by a functional metagenomic approach.
the biochemical property of the purified biohx protein was also investigated.
this study constituted the first investigation of a novel biohx gene in a biotin biosynthetic gene cluster cloned from an environmental metagenome.
biohx was expressed as a recombinant protein and characterized.
