global plants, a collaborative between jstor and some  <dig> herbaria, now contains about  <dig>  million high-resolution images of plant specimens, a number that continues to grow, and collections that are digitizing their specimens at high resolution are allocating considerable recourses to the maintenance of computer hardware  and to acquiring digital storage space.
the results of this first application of a computer vision algorithm trained on images of herbarium specimens shows that despite the problem of overlapping leaves, leaf-architectural features can be used to categorize specimens to species with good accuracy.
we here apply machine learning, specifically the training of a support-vector-machine, to classify specimen images into categories, ideally at the species level, using the  <dig> most common tree species in germany as a test case.
computer vision is poised to play a significant role in future rapid identification at least for frequently collected genera or species in the european flora.
