due to the virus’ fast mutation rate, the world health organization  is constantly on alert to rapidly respond to emerging pandemic strains.
the majority of influenza vaccines on the market are produced in embryonic hen’s eggs and are composed of purified viral antigens from inactivated whole virus.
the proposed systems were assessed for their ability to produce influenza vlps composed of hemagglutinin , neuraminidase  and matrix protein  and compared through the lens of bioprocessing by highlighting baseline production yields and bioactivity.
cell culture produced vaccines have been proposed for their potential to overcome the problems associated with egg-based production.
this study highlights key production hurdles that must be overcome in both expression platforms, namely the presence of contaminants and the ensuing quantification challenges, and brings up the question of what truly constitutes an influenza vlp candidate vaccine.
vlps from both systems were characterized using available influenza quantification techniques, such as single radial immunodiffusion assay , ha assay, western blot and negative staining transmission electron microscopy  to quantify total particles.
virus-like particles  of influenza virus are promising candidate vaccines under consideration by both academic and industry researchers.
for the hek <dig> production system, vlps were found to be associated with the cell pellet in addition to those released in the supernatant.
