we present an r package, frmatools, that allows the user to quickly create his or her own frozen parameter vectors.
the frmatools package is freely available as part of the bioconductor project.
the frozen parameter estimates required by this algorithm are generated using a large database of publicly available arrays.
curation of such a database and creation of the frozen parameter estimates is time-consuming; therefore, frma has only been implemented on the most widely used affymetrix platforms.
we describe how this package fits into a preprocessing workflow and explore the size of the training dataset needed to generate reliable frozen parameter estimates.
this is followed by a discussion of specific situations in which one might wish to create one's own frma implementation.
by allowing the user to easily create his or her own frma implementation, the frmatools package greatly increases the applicability of the frma algorithm.
