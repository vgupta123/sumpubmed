moreover, metabolisms that show a higher biomass yield on c, and that are more complex, i.e., they harbor more metabolic reactions, are viable on a greater number of carbon sources c
an important class of exaptations are novel and useful traits with non-adaptive origins.
we here use this exhaustive genotype-phenotype map to ask whether a central carbon metabolism that is viable on a given, focal carbon source c – the equivalent of an adaptation in our framework – is usually or rarely viable on one or more other carbon sources c
the nature and number of these carbon sources depends on the focal carbon source c itself, and on the biochemical similarity between c and c
we show that most metabolic genotypes harbor potential exaptations, that is, they are viable on one or more carbon sources c
we here take a step towards answering this question by analyzing central carbon metabolism, and novel traits that allow an organism to survive on novel sources of carbon and energy.
a high potential for exaptation results from correlations between the phenotypes of different genotypes, and such correlations are frequent in central carbon metabolism.
