subspaces defined by the top eigenvectors are compared using several statistical metrics to quantify similarity/overlap of high dimensional vector spaces.
protein dynamics can be characterized in terms of cartesian coordinates or internal distance pairs.
for each protein, cartesian coordinates or internal distance pairs can be employed over the entire structure or user-selected parts to quantify similarity/differences in mobility and correlations in dynamics to develop insight into protein structure/function relationships.
pymol scripts together with pdb files allow movies of individual q- and r-cpca modes to be visualized, and the essential dynamics occurring within user-selected time scales.
essential dynamics  is a common application of principal component analysis  to extract biologically relevant motions from atomic trajectories of proteins.
we developed a java based essential dynamics toolkit called jed to compare the ed from multiple protein trajectories.
jed offers a convenient toolkit that encourages best practices in applying multivariate statistics methods to perform comparative studies of essential dynamics over multiple proteins.

trajectories from different simulations and different proteins can be pooled for comparative studies.
jed output results as text files that include transformed coordinates for aligned structures, several metrics that quantify protein mobility, pca modes with their eigenvalues, and displacement vector  projections onto the top principal modes.

comprehensive software is needed to facilitate comparative-analysis with user-friendly features that are rooted in best practices from multivariate statistics.
in understanding protein dynamics, a comparison of trajectories taken from a set of proteins for similarity assessment provides insight into conserved mechanisms.
