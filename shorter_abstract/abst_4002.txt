array comparative genomic hybridization  is a popular technique for detection of genomic copy number imbalances.
in general, acgh normalization approaches are similar to those used for gene expression data, albeit both data-types differ inherently.
results were compared to a conventional normalization approach and two more recent state-of-the-art acgh normalization strategies.
a particular problem with acgh data is that imbalanced copy numbers lead to improper normalization using conventional methods.
first, provisory balanced copy numbers are identified and subsequently used for normalization.
we tested our method on three well-studied tumor-related acgh datasets with experimentally confirmed copy numbers.
our findings show that, compared to these three methods, cghnormaliter yields a higher specificity and precision in terms of identifying the 'true' copy numbers.
we demonstrate that the normalization of acgh data can be significantly enhanced using an iterative procedure that effectively eliminates the effect of imbalanced copy numbers.
in the analysis of acgh data, normalization is deemed a critical pre-processing step.
