this map spanned  <dig> .98 cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
using restriction-site associated dna sequencing, a genetic map composed of  <dig>  loci, including  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms and  <dig> simple sequence repeat loci, was developed from ril population.
we developed an snp-based genetic map, and this map is the first high-density genetic map for short-season cotton and has the potential to provide deeper insights into earliness.

gossypium hirsutum l., or upland cotton, is an important renewable resource for textile fiber.
to enhance understanding of the genetic basis of cotton earliness, we constructed an intra-specific recombinant inbred line population  containing  <dig> lines, and performed linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus  mapping.
cotton earliness-related qtls and qtl coincidence regions will provide useful materials for qtl fine mapping, gene positional cloning and mas.
in addition,  <dig> qtl coincidence regions representing more than 60 % of total qtls were found on  <dig> chromosomes, which indicated that several earliness-related traits might be simultaneously improved.
one candidate gene  was predicted and validated by quantitative real-time pcr in early-, medium- and late-maturing cultivars from 3- to 6-leaf stages, with highest expression level in early-maturing cultivar, ccri <dig>  lowest expression level in late-maturing cultivar, bomian <dig>
fine-mapping of a 2-mb region on chromosome d <dig> associated with five stable qtls between marker <dig> and marker <dig> revealed that lines containing alleles derived from ccri <dig> in this region exhibited smaller phenotypes and earlier maturity.
