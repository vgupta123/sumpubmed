finally, the new assembly identifies the long-range structure of both a ~9mbp xy sex determination region on lg <dig> in o. niloticus, and a ~50mbp wz sex determination region on lg <dig> in the related species o. aureus.
comparison of the new assembly to the previous o. niloticus genome assembly reveals that recently duplicated portions of the genome are now well represented.
the overall number of genes in the new assembly increased by  <dig> %, including a 67% increase in pseudogenes.
dozens of candidate de novo assemblies were generated and an optimal assembly  was selected using principal component analysis of likelihood scores calculated from several paired-end sequencing libraries.
in this study, we developed a significantly improved assembly of the tilapia genome using the latest genome sequencing methods and show how it improves the characterization of two sex determination regions in two tilapia species.
the new tilapia genome assembly correctly represents two recent vasa gene duplication events that have been verified with bac sequencing.
a homozygous clonal xx female nile tilapia  was sequenced to 44x coverage using pacific biosciences  smrt sequencing.
