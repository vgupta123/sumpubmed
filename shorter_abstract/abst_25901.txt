ruthia magnifica , have small genomes  with low g+c contents  and are thought to be in an ongoing stage of reductive genome evolution .
using pcr with a newly designed primer set, intact reca or its remnant was detected in clade ii symbionts.
using pcr with newly designed primer sets, muty was not found in clade i symbionts but was found in clade ii symbionts.
to understand how these genes were lost from the symbiont genomes, we surveyed these genes in the genomes from  <dig> other calyptogena clam symbionts using the polymerase chain reaction .
the extant calyptogena clam symbionts in clade ii were shown to have reca and muty or their remnants, while those in clade i did not.
phylogenetic trees reconstructed using concatenated 16s and 23s rrna gene sequences showed that the symbionts formed two clades, clade i  and clade ii .
the present results indicate that the extant symbionts are losing these genes in rge, and that the loss of muty contributed to the gc bias of the genomes during their evolution.
reca was detected by pcr with consensus primers for reca in the symbiont of c. phaseoliformis.
a detailed homology search revealed a remnant reca in the rma genome.
in the rma genome, a pseudogene of muty was found.
they lack reca and some genes for dna repair, including muty.
the g+c content of 16s and 23s rrna genes in symbionts lacking muty was significantly lower than in those with muty.
in clade i symbionts, the reca coding region was found to be mostly deleted.
the loss of reca and muty is thought to contribute to the stabilization of their genome architectures and gc bias, respectively.
