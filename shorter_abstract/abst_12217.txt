fusion of mrna and mirna expression data into one prediction model improves clinical outcome prediction in terms of prediction error and stable feature selection.
the biochemical relapse was used as clinical endpoint.
it could be shown that the bipartite graph in combination with both data sets could improve prediction performance as well as the stability of the feature selection.
prediction models are trained to identify either mrna or mirna signatures for patient stratification.
with the increasing number of microarray studies collecting mrna and mirna from the same patient cohort there is a need for statistical methods to integrate or fuse both kinds of data into one prediction model in order to find a combined signature that improves the prediction.
here, we propose a new method to fuse mirna and mrna data into one prediction model.
the method is illustrated on a prostate cancer data set comprising  <dig> patient samples with mirna and mrna expression data.
one of the main goals in cancer studies including high-throughput microrna  and mrna data is to find and assess prognostic signatures capable of predicting clinical outcome.
since mirnas are known regulators of mrnas we used the correlations between them as well as the target prediction information to build a bipartite graph representing the relations between mirnas and mrnas.
the r source code of the proposed method is available in the supplement.
this graph was used to guide the feature selection in order to improve the prediction.
