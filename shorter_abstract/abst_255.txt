a multiplex pcr  assay was developed to detect s. flexneri 2a from rural regions of zhengding .
a clinical strain of s. flexneri 2a  <dig>  containing ipah and ial, but lacking set1b was found.
to investigate the role of pic in s. flexneri 2a infections, a pic knockout mutant  and two complementation strains, sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic, were created.
differences in virulence for sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic, sf301-∆ pic/ppic, sf51/ppic and s. flexneri 2a  <dig>  were compared.
the pic gene appears to be involved in an increase in pathogenicity of s. flexneri 2a.
compared with sf <dig>  both sf <dig> and sf301-∆ pic exhibited lower levels of hela cell invasion and resulted in reduced keratoconjunctivitis, with low levels of tissue damage seen in murine eye sections.
the virulence of sf301-∆ pic and sf <dig> was partially recovered in vitro and in vivo through the addition of a complementary pic gene.
this gene assists with bacterial invasion into host cells and alters inflammatory reactions.
we isolated and tested  <dig> strains using our mpcr assay, which targeted the ipah, ial and set1b genes.

shigella pathogenicity is a multi-gene phenomenon, involving the participation of genes on an unstable large virulence plasmid and chromosomal pathogenicity islands.
