peste des petits ruminants  is a contagious viral disease of small ruminants.
multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to the data to assess the relationship between the risk factors and pprv sero-positivity.
mixed-effect models using an administrative sub-location as a random effect were also fitted to adjust for possible clustering of pprv sero-positivity.
biological, spatial and socio-ecological factors are hypothesized as possible explanations for variation in pprv sero-positivity in the turkana pastoral ecosystem.
serum samples from sheep  and goats  of all ages were collected in a cross-sectional study in turkana county, kenya.
intra-cluster correlation coefficients  that described the degree of similarity among sero-positive responses for each species in each of the six administrative divisions were estimated.
combined sero-prevalence estimates were heterogeneous across administrative divisions   and even more across sub-locations  .
regression analysis returned significant risk factors across species: in sheep - vaccination status, age and administrative division; in goats - sex, age, administrative division and sex*age interaction.
pprv competitive enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay  analysed the presence of antibodies in the samples.
the objective was to estimate the sero-prevalence of ppr virus  infection and associated risk factors in both species.
assuming that pprv antibodies are protective of infection, a large pool of pprv susceptible middle age group  in both species was estimated.
