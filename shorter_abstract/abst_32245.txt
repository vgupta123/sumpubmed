the computational methods we have developed perform robustly and accurately, and yield results in accord with clinical knowledge: a z-score analysis of the genes most frequently selected identifies genes known to discriminate aml and pre-t all leukemia.
this study also confirms that significantly different sets of genes are found to be most discriminatory as the sample classes are refined.
in the absence of feature selection, classification accuracy on the training data is typically good, but not replicated on the testing data.
we apply an evolutionary algorithm to identify the near-optimal set of predictive genes that classify the data.
we also examine the initial gene selection step whereby the most informative genes are selected from the genes assayed.
the leukemia dataset of golub et al.
the evolutionary algorithm is shown to perform stably across the space of possible parameter settings â€“ indicating the robustness of the approach.
gene selection using the rankgene software  <cit>  is shown to significantly improve performance on the testing data.
