seven papers were included in the final analysis.
the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the methods that have been used for estimating the sizes of owned cat and dog populations and to assess the biases associated with those methods.
the main biases of the studies included selection bias, non-response bias, measurement bias and biases associated with length of sampling time.
there are a number of different methods that can be used when estimating the size of the owned cat and dog population in a region, leading to varying population estimates.
analytical and statistical methods used to estimate the pet population size were: mean number of dogs/cats per household multiplied by the number of households in an area, human density multiplied by number of dogs per human, and calculations using predictors of pet ownership.
collection methods used to select participants in the included studies were: mailed surveys using a commercial list of contacts, door to door surveys, random digit dialled telephone surveys, and randomised telephone surveys using a commercial list of numbers.
the inclusion criteria were that the studies had involved owned or pet domestic dogs and/or cats, provided an estimate of the size of the owned dog or cat population, collected raw data on dog and cat ownership, and analysed primary data.
careful design and planning of studies is a necessity before executing a study to estimate pet populations.
