a literature search was carried out on  <dig> out of  <dig> mtb's predicted exoproteins, looking for previous experimental evidence concerning their possible antigenicity.
there was no experimental evidence of antigenic or pathogenic contributions for three of the highest med-scored mtb proteins.
the software presented here offers a practical and accurate method to identify potential vaccine and diagnosis candidates against pathogenic bacteria by "reading" results from well-established reverse vaccinology software in a novel way, considering the epitope's concentration in the mature portion of the protein.
our online software implementation provides a computationally light and reliable analysis of bacterial exoproteins and their potential for vaccines or diagnosis projects against pathogenic organisms.
among the lowest scored proteins, ~13% were confirmed as not related to antigenicity or not contributing to the bacterial pathogenicity, and 70% of the highest scored proteins were confirmed as related.
however, currently available tools do not account for the concentration of epitope products in the mature protein product and its relation to the reliability of target selection.
