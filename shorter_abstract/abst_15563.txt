a complete process, from genotyping of a high density snp array on rh panels, to the construction of genome-wide high density rh maps, and finally their exploitation for validating and improving a genome assembly is presented here.
these two panels have been used extensively for the physical mapping of pig genes and markers prior to the availability of the pig genome sequence.
we then show how they were useful to identify problems in a draft of the pig genome assembly, and how the rh maps enabled the problems to be corrected in the porcine genome sequence.
finally, we used the rh maps to predict the position of  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  scaffolds currently unplaced on the porcine genome assembly.
several additional resources are also provided, in particular the predicted genomic location of currently unplaced snps and associated scaffolds summing up to a total of  <dig> megabases, that can be useful for the exploitation of the pig genome assembly.
in order to contribute to the assembly of the pig genome, we genotyped the two radiation hybrid  panels with a snp array  and produced high density physical rh maps for each pig autosome.
we first present the methods developed to obtain high density rh maps with  <dig>  snps from the snp array genotyping.
the study includes the cross-validation of rh based findings with independent information from genetic data and comparative mapping with the human genome.
