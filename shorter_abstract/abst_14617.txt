recent studies have shown that dna structural properties, such as curvature, stacking energy, and stress-induced duplex destabilization  are useful in promoter prediction, as well.
when compared to the sidd threshold prediction method, artificial neural networks showed noticeable improvements for precision, recall, and f-score over a range of values.
computational methods based on motif searching have been the traditional approach taken.
results using this technique were an improvement over the previous sidd threshold approach.
one of the major challenges in biology is the correct identification of promoter regions.
over a wide range of precision-recall values, artificial neural networks were more capable of identifying distinctive characteristics of promoter regions than threshold based methods.
the maximal f-score for the ann classifier was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the threshold-based classifier.
in this paper, the currently used sidd energy threshold method is compared to the proposed artificial neural network  approach for finding promoters based on sidd profile data.
artificial neural networks were used to predict promoters based on sidd profile data.
