rnase r has also been implicated in the trans-translation process.
in this work we study the expression of rnase r in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae and analyse the interplay of this enzyme with the main components of the trans-translation machinery .
we show that rnase r is induced after a 37°c to 15°c temperature downshift and that its levels are dependent on smpb.
on the other hand, our results revealed a strong accumulation of the smpb transcript in the absence of rnase r at 15°c.
this study unravels an additional contribution of rnase r to the trans-translation system by demonstrating that smpb is regulated by this exoribonuclease.
rnase r in turn, is shown to be under the control of smpb.
the data presented here shed light on the interactions between rnase r, trans-translation and cold-shock response in an important human pathogen.
it is a stress-induced protein shown to be important for the establishment of virulence in several pathogenic bacteria.
ribonuclease r  is an exoribonuclease that recognizes and degrades a wide range of rna molecules.
transcription of these genes is driven from a promoter upstream of secg and the transcript is processed to yield mature independent mrnas.
