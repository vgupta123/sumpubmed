seven of these actin-like proteins  are novel to apicomplexans.
the large diversity of actin-like proteins in apicomplexans suggests that the actin protein family has diverged to fulfill various roles in the unique biology of intracellular parasites.
consequently, we focused our efforts on identifying actin-related proteins in the recently completed genomes of toxoplasma gondii, plasmodium spp., cryptosporidium spp., and theileria spp.
comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies of apicomplexan genomes reveals that most contain only a single conventional actin and yet they each have 8â€“ <dig> additional actin-related proteins.
they show no phylogenetic associations to the known arp groups and likely serve functions specific to this important group of intracellular parasites.
conserved arps likely participate in vesicular transport and gene expression, while apicomplexan-specific alps may control unique biological traits such as actin-based gliding motility.
