second, that conformational changes from variation in a superfamily are larger and much simpler than those allowed by physical deformability.
in this contribution we have compared two different approaches to explore the flexibility space of protein domains: i) molecular dynamics , and ii) the study of the structural changes within superfamily .
we expect this fact to have application in fields as 3d-em/x-ray hybrid models or ab initio protein folding.
first, that function restricts the access to some flexibility patterns to evolution, as we observe that when a superfamily member changes to become another, the path does not completely overlap with the physical deformability.
methodologically, the conclusion is that both spaces studied are complementary, and have different size and complexity.
technically, protein flexibility exploration is an essential task in many applications, such as protein structure prediction and modeling.
our analysis indicates that the md-space and the sf-space display a significant overlap, but are still different enough to be considered as complementary.
