squad converts the network into a discrete dynamical system, and it uses a binary decision diagram algorithm to identify all the steady states of the system.
then, the software creates a continuous dynamical system and localizes its steady states which are located near the steady states of the discrete system.
we developed squad, a software for the dynamic simulation of signaling networks using the standardized qualitative dynamical systems approach.
unfortunately, most current computational models describe small networks due to the scarcity of kinetic data available.
squad provides a user-friendly graphical interface, accessible to both computational and experimental biologists for the fast qualitative simulation of large regulatory networks for which kinetic data is not necessarily available.
the simulation of regulatory networks aims at predicting the behavior of a whole system when subject to stimuli, such as drugs, or determine the role of specific components within the network.
to overcome this problem, we previously published a methodology to convert a signaling network into a dynamical system, even in the total absence of kinetic information.
the ambition of most molecular biologists is the understanding of the intricate network of molecular interactions that control biological systems.
