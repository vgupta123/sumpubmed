the exception is a clade of australasian individuals, which may reflect a bottleneck during their recent introduction to this region.
in contrast, geographic origin is a poor predictor of moth mtdna sequences, reflecting human activity in moving the insects around the globe.
these bacteria often alter host reproductive biology and can drive particular mtdna haplotypes through populations.
patterns of mtdna variation within a species reflect long-term population structure, but may also be influenced by maternally inherited endosymbionts, such as wolbachia.
we investigated the impacts of wolbachia infection and geography on mtdna variation in the diamondback moth, a major global pest whose geographic distribution reflects both natural processes and transport via human agricultural activities.
the main correlate of mtdna variation in p. xylostella is presence or absence of the plutwb <dig> infection.
within the uninfected group was a further clade containing all individuals from australasia and displaying very limited sequence variation.
only about 5%  of our global sample of individuals was infected with the plutwb <dig> isolate and even within infected local populations, many insects were uninfected.
comparisons of infected and uninfected isofemale lines revealed that plutwb <dig> is associated with sex ratio distortion.
this is associated with substantial sex ratio distortion and the underlying mechanisms deserve further study.
the mtdna phylogeny of  <dig> individuals sampled from  <dig> countries on four continents revealed two major clades.
