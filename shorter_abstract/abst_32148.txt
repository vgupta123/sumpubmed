we identified putative e. balteatus orthologues of 43% of all annotated d. melanogaster genes, including the genes of all bmp ligands and other bmp signaling components.
the dorsal blastoderm of e. balteatus gives rise to two extraembryonic tissues , whereas in d. melanogaster, the dorsal blastoderm differentiates into a single extraembryonic epithelium .
to search for bmp signaling components in e. balteatus, we generated and analyzed transcriptomes of freshly laid eggs  and late blastoderm to early germband extension stages  using roche/ <dig> sequencing.
recent studies indicate that several bmp signaling components of d. melanogaster, including the bmp ligand screw  and other extracellular regulators, evolved in the dipteran lineage through gene duplication and functional divergence.
the closest relatives of d. melanogaster with clearly distinct dv differentiation are hover flies .
the diversification of several bmp signaling components in the dipteran linage of d. melanogaster preceded the origin of the amnioserosa.
based on the extensive knowledge of bmp signaling in drosophila melanogaster, the morphological diversity of extraembryonic tissues in different fly species provides a comparative system to address this question.
