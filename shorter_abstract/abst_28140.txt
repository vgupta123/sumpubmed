the emergence of the pallial musculature and its neural innervation are crucial steps during bivalve larval development.
the first outgrowth process, which gives rise to the outer and inner folds, and the emergence of the pallial musculature and innervation occur during larval stages, highlighting the importance of the larval period for mantle margin morphogenesis in bivalvia.
bivalves from the family pectinidae  are particularly promising to cast some light on these issues, because they exhibit a complex mantle margin and their developmental stages are easily obtained from scallop farms.
after metamorphosis, a second outgrowth process is responsible for emergence of the middle mantle fold from the outer surface of the inner fold.
our data show that the middle mantle fold forms from the outer surface of the inner fold after metamorphosis and that the initial unfolded mantle margin may represent a common condition among bivalves.
we investigated the mantle margin of the scallop nodipecten nodosus  during larval and postmetamorphic development.
a thorough analysis of the mantle margin development in nodipecten nodosus, from veliger larvae to mature adults, was conducted by means of integrative microscopy techniques, i.e., light, electron, and confocal microscopy.
by the late pediveliger stage, the margin becomes folded, resulting in a bilobed condition , a periostracal groove, and the development of different types of cilia.

initially unfolded, the pallial margin is divided into distal and proximal regions by the periostracum-forming zone.
