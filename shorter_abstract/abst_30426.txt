to identify p. brasiliensis differentially expressed sequences during conversion we performed a large-scale comparative analysis between p. brasiliensis ests identified in the transition transcriptome and databases.
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a human pathogen with a broad distribution in latin america.
genes of primary metabolism, energy, protein synthesis and fate, cellular transport, biogenesis of cellular components were represented in the transition cdna library.
twelve genes encoding putative virulence factors manifested increased expression.
also, putative virulence factors are more expressed in the transition process suggesting adaptation to the host of the yeast incoming parasitic phase.
our analysis was based on  <dig> ests from a transition cdna library of p. brasiliensis.
those genes provide ideal candidates for further studies directed at understanding fungal morphogenesis and its regulation.
the developmental program of p. brasiliensis is characterized by significant differential positive modulation of the cell wall/membrane related transcripts, and signal transduction proteins, suggesting the related processes important contributors to dimorphism.
we describe expressed sequence tags  analysis to assess the expression profile of the mycelium to yeast transition.
a considerable number of genes  had not been previously reported for p. brasiliensis in public databases.
ten genes related to signal transduction were increased.
classes of differentially expressed sequences were selected for further analysis including: genes related to the synthesis/remodeling of the cell wall/membrane.
the in silico approach was validated by northern blot and semi-quantitative rt-pcr.
gene expression analysis using in silico est subtraction revealed that numerous genes were more expressed during the transition phase when compared to the mycelial ests  <cit> .
