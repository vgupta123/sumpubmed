in the mouse, cholesterol is required for pgc survival and motility.
primordial germ cells  are the embryonic precursors of the sperm and eggs.
it may act cell-autonomously by regulating clustering of growth factor receptors within pgcs or non cell-autonomously by controlling release of growth factors required for pgc guidance and survival.
cholesterol synthesis was blocked in culture by inhibiting the activity of hmg coa reductase  resulting in germ cell survival and migration defects.
environmental or genetic defects that alter pgc development can impair fertility or cause formation of germ cell tumors.
in contrast, loss of the last or penultimate enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis did not alter pgc numbers or position in vivo.
this demonstrates that during gestation, the cholesterol required for pgc migration can be supplied maternally.
