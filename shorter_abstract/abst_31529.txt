moreover,  <dig> ovary-specific,  <dig> testis-specific, and  <dig> gonad-differential transcripts were confirmed by semi-quantitative pcr and quantitative real-time pcr.
a large number of candidate ssrs and snps were detected, which could be used as genetic markers for population genetics and functional genomics in this species.
we have identified many important functional genes and made a preliminary attempt to construct the regulatory network involved in the gonadal development of crustaceans.
the molecular regulatory mechanism of sex determination and gonadal differentiation in this species has received considerable attention in recent years because of the huge differences—both biological and economic—between male and female crabs.
in this study, next-generation sequencing technology was used to develop deep-coverage transcriptomic sequencing data for the testis and ovary of s. paramamosain.
this is the first large-scale rna sequencing of s. paramamosain to be reported.
the annotated transcriptome data will provide fundamental support for future research into the reproduction biology of s. paramamosain.
using the blastx program,  <dig>  unique sequences  were annotated with known protein sequences from the ncbi non-redundant  protein sequence database.
a total of  <dig>  reads  with an average sequence length of 285 bp were produced from testis and ovary cdna libraries.
in addition,  <dig>  putative simple sequence repeats  and  <dig>  potential single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified.
after comparing the ovary and testis libraries,  <dig>  gonad-differentially,  <dig>  ovary-specifically, and  <dig>  testis-specifically expressed genes were identified.
the green mud crab  is the most prevalent crustacean on the southeast coast of china.
the gene ontology and kegg  analyses allowed the  <dig> unique sequences that were annotated with enzyme code  numbers to be mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways.
