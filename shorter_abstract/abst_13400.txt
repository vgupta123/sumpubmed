while these phosphorylation events do not change the intrinsic stability of ngn <dig>  phosphorylation on multiple sites acts to limit its ability to drive neuronal differentiation in vivo.
phosphorylation of ngn <dig> occurs in both the n- and c-terminal regions, either side of the conserved basic helix-loop-helix domain.
we also provide structural evidence that ngn <dig> contains large, intrinsically disordered regions that undergo phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases .
of particular interest is the bhlh proneural factor neurogenin <dig> , which orchestrates progression from neural progenitor to differentiated neuron in several regions of the central nervous system.
here we characterise the role of phosphorylation of specific regions of ngn <dig> on the stability of ngn <dig> protein and on its neuronal differentiation activity in vivo in the developing embryo, demonstrating clearly that the location of sp sites is less important than the number of sp sites available for control of ngn <dig> activity in vivo.
previous studies have demonstrated a key role for cell cycle-dependent multi-site phosphorylation of ngn <dig> protein at serine-proline  sites for regulation of its neuronal differentiation activity, although the potential structural and functional consequences of phosphorylation at different regions of the protein are unclear.
neuronal differentiation is largely under the control of basic helix-loop-helix  proneural transcription factors that play key roles during development of the embryonic nervous system.
