a preliminary implementation of the predictor of protein cα traces featured among the top  <dig> novel fold predictors at the last casp <dig> experiment as group distill .
together with structural feature predictions, distill includes a server for prediction of cα traces for short proteins .
we describe distill, a suite of servers for the prediction of protein structural features: secondary structure; relative solvent accessibility; contact density; backbone structural motifs; residue contact maps at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> angstrom; coarse protein topology.
the servers are state-of-the-art, with secondary structure predicted correctly for nearly 80% of residues , 2-class solvent accessibility nearly 80% correct, and contact maps exceeding 50% precision on the top non-diagonal contacts.
all predictions are freely available through a simple joint web interface and the results are returned by email.
the servers are based on large-scale ensembles of recursive neural networks and trained on large, up-to-date, non-redundant subsets of the protein data bank.
in a single submission the user can send protein sequences for a total of up to 32k residues to all or a selection of the servers.
