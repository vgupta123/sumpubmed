structure prediction of membrane proteins is still a challenging computational problem.
we show that pv decoding performs better than other algorithms when tested on the problem of the prediction of the topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins.
the former is very efficient when one path dominates, while the latter, even though does not guarantee to preserve the hmm grammar, is more effective when several concurring paths have similar probabilities.
in this paper we introduce the posterior-viterbi  a new decoding which combines the posterior and viterbi algorithms.
pv is a two step process: first the posterior probability of each state is computed and then the best posterior allowed path through the model is evaluated by a viterbi algorithm.
hidden markov models  have been successfully applied to the problem of predicting membrane protein topology.
