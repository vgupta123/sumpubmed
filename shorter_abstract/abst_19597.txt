during the clinical treatment of the brachial plexus root avulsion , reimplantation surgery can not completely repair the motor function of the hand because the axonal growth velocity of the spinal motoneurons  is too slow to re-innervate the intrinsic hand muscles before muscle atrophy.
these results suggest that immediate administration of lithium could be used to assist reimplantation surgery in repairing bpra injuries in clinical treatment.
here, we investigated whether lithium can enhance the regenerative capacity of the spinal mns in a rat model of bpra.
our present data proved that lithium can enhance the regenerative capacity of spinal mns.
the number and diameter of the nerve fibers in the median nerve were assessed by toluidine blue staining.
lithium plus reimplantation allowed  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of chat-positive mns to survive the injury and increased the number and diameter of nerve fibers in the median nerve.
after a 20 week long-term rehabilitation, the motor function recovery of the injured forepaw was studied by a grasping test.
our results showed that lithium plus reimplantation therapy resulted in a significantly higher grasping strength of the digits of the injured forepaw.
the survival and regeneration of mns were checked by choline acetyltransferase  immunofluorescence and by fluoro-gold  retrograde labeling through the median and ulnar nerves of the ventral horn mns.
the number of fg-labeled regenerative mns was significantly elevated in all of the reimplantation animals.
