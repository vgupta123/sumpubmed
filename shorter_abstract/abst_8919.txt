our data imply that dysregulation of pirna expression may be associated with development of melanoma.
furthermore, cluster analysis revealed a clear distinction between testes, low-grade and high-grade malignant melanoma in medaka.
to identify pirna clusters that might be involved in melanoma pathogenesis, we use several transgenic lines of medaka, and platyfish/swordtail hybrids, which develop various types of melanoma.
our results also reinforce the importance of fish as a suitable model system to study the role of pirnas in tumorigenesis.
