besides gene duplication and de novo gene generation, horizontal gene transfer  is another important way of acquiring new genes.

the expression of the foreign ssl genes in these two parasitic plants was detected in multiple development stages and tissues, and the foreign ssl gene was induced after wounding treatment in c. australis stems.
our study strongly supports that parasitic plants can gain novel nuclear genes from distantly related host species by hgt and the foreign genes may execute certain functions in the new hosts.
intriguingly, the nucleus-located ssl genes in brassicaceae belonged to a new member of ssl gene family, which were originated from gene duplication.
parasitic systems expectedly allow the occurrence of hgt at relatively high frequencies due to their long-term physical contact.
furthermore, positive selection was detected in the foreign ssl gene in o. aegyptiaca but not in c. australis.
a thorough transcriptome screening revealed that a strictosidine synthase-like  gene in the root parasitic plant orobanche aegyptiaca and the shoot parasitic plant cuscuta australis showed much higher sequence similarities with those in brassicaceae than with those in their close relatives, suggesting independent gene horizontal transfer events from brassicaceae to these parasites.
in plants, a number of hgt events have been reported between the organelles of parasites and the hosts, but hgt between host and parasite nuclear genomes has rarely been found.
these data imply that the foreign genes may still retain certain functions in the recipient species.
these findings were strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis and their identical unique amino acid residues and deletions.
