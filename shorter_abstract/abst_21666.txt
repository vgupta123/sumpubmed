the fully susceptible e. coli population was a much more diverse group than the resistant and esbl-producing e. coli populations.
we studied the populations by use of multi-locus sequence typing  and abbreviated-multi locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis .
we characterized three different uropathogenic e. coli populations, from non-hospitalized patients to describe the genetic kinship between resistant and susceptible isolates.
in the susceptible population more sts and a-mlva codes were identified compared to the other groups and st <dig> and st <dig> were found as the only clusters with 16 % and 6 %, respectively.
overall, these findings suggest that dominant esbl-producing lineages are derived from upec lineages already established in the general upec population.
the esbl population was dominated vastly by st <dig> , st <dig>  and st <dig> .
of clinical microbiology at hvidovre hospital, denmark, from oct.  <dig> to july  <dig>  we included  <dig> fully susceptible,  <dig> resistant  and  <dig> extended spectrum beta-lactamases- -producing e. coli isolates.
ninety-eight per cent of the esbl-producing e. coli isolates were ctx-m-producers.
st <dig> dominated the population of community-associated uropathogenic esbl-producing e. coli, but was less frequent among non-esbl-producing e. coli.
escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection .
