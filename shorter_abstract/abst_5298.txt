apart from the configuration of a flexible hairpin loop, which is partly stabilized upon binding, the solution structure confirms the crystal structure.
the search for a novel drug against legionnaires' disease may therefore benefit from the large variety of known fkbp <dig> inhibitors.
we have solved the solution structure of free mip77– <dig> and the mip77–213-rapamycin complex by nmr spectroscopy.
a major virulence factor of the pathogen is the homodimeric surface protein mip.
the structural similarity of the mip-rapamycin and fkbp12-rapamycin complexes suggests that fkbp <dig> ligands may be promising starting points for the design of novel mip inhibitors.
