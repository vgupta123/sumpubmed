quantitative immunostaining revealed the need for a high multiplicity of infection for optimal infection.
use of inhibitors revealed an anti-apoptotic function of nf-kappa b and pi <dig> kinase in p. gingivalis-infected hgf cells.
however, the mechanisms of bacterial invasion and the resultant destruction of the gingival tissue remain largely undefined.
the pathology of the gingival fibroblast in p. gingivalis infection is affected by a temporal shift from cellular survival response to apoptosis, regulated by a number of anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules.
porphyromonas gingivalis is the foremost oral pathogen of adult periodontitis in humans.
late in infection  the anti-apoptotic genes largely shut down and the pro-apoptotic genes, including nip <dig>  hrk, bak, bik, bok, bax, bad, bim and moap- <dig>  were activated.
early in infection , p. gingivalis activated the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-kappa b, partly via the pi <dig> kinase/akt pathway.
this was accompanied by the induction of cellular anti-apoptotic genes, including bfl- <dig>  boo, bcl-xl, bcl <dig>  mcl- <dig>  bcl-w and survivin.
use of a triple protease mutant p. gingivalis lacking three major gingipains  suggested a role of some or all these proteases in myriad aspects of bacteria-gingival interaction.
we report host-p. gingivalis interactions in primary human gingival fibroblast  cells.
