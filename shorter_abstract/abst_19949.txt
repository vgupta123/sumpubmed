despite of being recognized to harbour causal variants, these regions are usually ignored by current analysis pipelines.
however, considerable time and labour is needed for careful investigation of candidate variants.
we also applied glints in two real exome sequencing and demonstrated its effectiveness for uncovering disease-causing snvs.
specifically, glints integrates  <dig> types of functional scores, including predictions for both coding and noncoding variants, and  <dig> types of association scores, which help identifying disease relevant genes.
the principle behind glints is that disease-causing variants should manifest their effect at both variant and gene levels.
we conducted a large-scale simulation studies based on  <dig> genomes project data and demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in both coding and flanking noncoding regions.
whole exome sequencing  has recently emerged as an effective approach for identifying genetic variants underlying human diseases.
in addition, current wes platforms also provide variant information in flanking noncoding regions, such as promoters, introns and splice sites.
we present a novel computational method, called glints, to overcome the above limitations.
although filtration based on population frequencies and functional prediction scores could effectively remove common and neutral variants, hundreds or even thousands of rare deleterious variants still remain.
glints is expected to be a useful tool for human genetics research based on exome sequencing data.
