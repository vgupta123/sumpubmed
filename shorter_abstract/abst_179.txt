modeling under such conditions suggests that subfunctionalization plays an important role, but as a transition state to neofunctionalization rather than as a terminal fate of duplicated genes.
more recently, subfunctionalization, as a neutral process where the two copies partition the ancestral function, has been proposed as an alternative mechanism driving duplicate gene retention in organisms with small effective population sizes.
subfunctionalization results in an increase in the preservation of duplicated gene copies, including those that are neofunctionalized, but never represents a substantial fraction of duplicate gene copies at any evolutionary time point and ultimately leads to neofunctionalization of those preserved copies.
gene duplication has been suggested to be an important process in the generation of evolutionary novelty.
