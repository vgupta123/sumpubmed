the model proposed here offers a variety of uses for both marine turtles and also other taxa when individuals are observed in a particular location for only part of the year.
we detected  <dig> primary components in the nest distribution of leatherbacks: an overall shape that corresponds to the arrival and departure of leatherback females in the guianas region, a sinusoidal pattern with a period of approximately  <dig> days that is related to physiological constraints of nesting female leatherbacks, and a sinusoidal pattern with a period of approximately  <dig> days that likely reflects the influence of spring high tides on nesting female turtles.
in the case of leatherback sea turtles nesting in french guiana, we developed a mathematical model to explore the phenology of their nesting season, derived from an incomplete nest count dataset.
marine turtles deposit their eggs on tropical or subtropical beaches during discrete nesting seasons that span several months.
