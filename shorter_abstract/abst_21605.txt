poor activity alleles of cyp2c <dig> are very frequent worldwide, particularly in asia, raising the possibility that reduced metabolism could be advantageous in some circumstances.
one possible explanation is that early humans were exposed to a ubiquitous novel toxin activated by cyp2c <dig>  the genetic adaptation took place within the last  <dig>  years which coincides with the development of systematic agricultural practices.
cytochrome p <dig> cyp2c <dig> metabolizes a wide range of pharmacologically active substances and a relatively small number of naturally occurring environmental toxins.
the biological factors responsible for these selective pressures are currently unknown.
haplotype breakdown was explored using bifurcation plots and relative extended haplotype homozygosity .

bifurcation plots suggested conservation of alleles conferring slow metabolism .
allele frequency differentiation across populations was estimated using the fixation index  and haplotype diversity with coalescent models.
cyp2c19* <dig> was an fst outlier in asians , cyp2c <dig> haplotype diversity < =  <dig> , p < <dig> .
