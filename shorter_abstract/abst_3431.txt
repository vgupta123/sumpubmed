a unigene assembly was created from over  <dig>  globe artichoke est sequences, containing  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
the globe artichoke  is a significant crop in the mediterranean basin.
they are thus well suited as assays for phylogenetic analysis, the construction of genetic maps, marker-assisted breeding, transcript mapping and other genomic applications in the species.
microsatellite markers have become a key tool in genetic and genomic analysis, and we have exploited recently acquired est  sequence data  to develop an extensive set of microsatellite markers.
a total of  <dig>  perfect repeats, located within  <dig>  unigenes was identified and the gene ontology  analysis highlighted some go term's enrichments among different classes of microsatellites with respect to their position.
their polymorphic information content  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .
