here we describe the purification and characterization of recombinant human renin for x-ray crystallization studies.
this present work describes a simple and efficient method for the generation and purification of active human renin.
the protein is highly pure and is suitable for supporting structural biology efforts.
a clonal cell line expressing prorenin was generated and grown under serum free conditions in a hollow fiber bioreactor.
prorenin was converted to active renin by trypsin digestion to remove the propeptide.
active renin was further purified using a cation exchange column followed by a gel filtration column.
biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed both binding and catalytic properties were essentially identical to previously reported activities for purified renin.
although inhibitors of various components of this cascade have been developed successfully, development of renin inhibitors has proven to be problematic.
however, despite the challenges of designing renin inhibitors, the enzyme remains a promising target for the development of novel treatments for hypertension.
