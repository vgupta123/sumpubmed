these trends were also observed when examining the metagenomes for gene function and assembly performance, although the latter more closely aligned to sequencing effort and read length than preparation steps tested.
among illumina library preparation options, transposon-based libraries diverged from all others and adaptor ligation was a critical step for optimizing sequencing yields.
using %g + c content to compare metagenomes, we find that  metagenomes are highly replicable,  some treatment effects are minimal, e.g., sequencing technology choice has 6-fold less impact than varying input dna amount, and  when restricted to a limited dna concentration , changing the amount of amplification produces little variation.
one way forward are culture-independent metagenomic approaches, but these novel methods are rarely rigorously tested, especially for studies of environmental viruses, air microbiomes, extreme environment microbiology and other areas with constrained sample amounts.
