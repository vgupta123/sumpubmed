yet little is understood about its genes involved in development, insecticide resistance, host range plasticity and virus transmission.
we obtained a sequencing depth of over  <dig>  million tags per sample and identified a large number of genes associated with specific developmental stages and insecticide resistance.
based on similarity search with known proteins, these analyses identified  <dig>  sequences with a cut-off e-value above 10- <dig>  assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology and clusters of orthologous group terms.
our data provides the most comprehensive sequence resource available for whitefly study and demonstrates that the illumina sequencing allows de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis in a species lacking genome information.
to facilitate research on whitefly, we present a method for de novo assembly of whitefly transcriptome using short read sequencing technology .
these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences  which represent more than 10-fold of all the whitefly sequences deposited in the genbank .
