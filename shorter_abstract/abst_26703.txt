mapsembler checks for the presence of given regions of interest that can be constructed from reads and builds a short assembly around it, either as a plain sequence or as a graph, showing contextual structure.
many basic biological questions could be answered targeting specific information in the reads, thus avoiding complete assembly.

among other results presented in this paper, mapsembler enabled to retrieve previously described human breast cancer candidate fusion genes, and to detect new ones not previously known.
mapsembler is the first software that enables de novo discovery around a region of interest of repeats, snps, exon skipping, gene fusion, as well as other structural events, directly from raw sequencing reads.
we introduce new algorithms to retrieve approximate occurrences of a sequence from reads and construct an extension graph.
however, these methods require large memory resources and computation time.
