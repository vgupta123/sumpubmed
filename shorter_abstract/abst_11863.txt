a major constraint affecting the quality and productivity of chrysanthemum is the unusual period of low temperature occurring during early spring, late autumn, and winter.
herein, we used rna-seq platform to characterize the transcriptomic response to low temperature by comparing different transcriptome of chrysanthemum nankingense plants and subjecting them to a period of sub-zero temperature, with or without a prior low temperature acclimation.
the large number of dtgs identified in this study, confirmed the complexity of the regulatory machinery involved in the processes of low temperature acclimation and low temperature/freezing tolerance.
the differential transcription of  <dig> dtgs was validated using quantitative rt-pcr.
the differentially transcribed genes  were identified as low temperature sensing and signalling genes, transcription factors, functional proteins associated with the abiotic response, and low temperature-responsive genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation.
six separate rna-seq libraries were generated from the rna samples of leaves and stems from six different temperature treatments, including one cold acclimation , two freezing treatments without prior ca, two freezing treatments with prior ca and the control.
yet, there has been no systematic investigation on the genes underlying the response to low temperature in chrysanthemum.
