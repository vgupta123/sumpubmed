netgem represents an optimal trade-off between model complexity and data requirement.
given that the inputs to netgem are only the network and the temporal variation of the nodes, this algorithm promises to have widespread applications, beyond biological systems.
using temporal gene expression data, netgem was successful in identifying  temporal interactions and determining their strength,  functional categories of the actively interacting partners and  dynamics of interactions in perturbed networks.
temporal analysis of gene expression data has been limited to identifying genes whose expression varies with time and/or correlation between genes that have similar temporal profiles.
it was able to deduce actively interacting genes and functional categories from temporal gene expression data.
information on interaction dynamics would open up possibilities for discovering new mechanisms of regulation by providing valuable insight into identifying time-sensitive interactions as well as permit studies on the effect of a genetic perturbation.
the model treats the interaction strengths as random variables which are modulated by suitable priors.
thus far, there is no systematic method to relate the temporal changes in gene expression to the dynamics of interactions between them.
this approach is necessitated by the extremely small sample size of the datasets, relative to the number of interactions.
