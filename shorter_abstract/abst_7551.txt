the cotton aquaporins consist of  <dig> pip and  <dig> tip members with high sequence similarity.
the plant aquaporins belong to the large major intrinsic protein  family.
together with expression and bioinformatic analyses, our results support the idea that the genes identified in this study represent an important genetic resource providing potential targets to modify the water use properties of cotton.
phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences divided the large and highly similar multi-gene family into the known  <dig> aquaporin subfamilies.
our results suggest that many cotton aquaporin genes have high sequence similarity and diverse roles as evidenced by analysis of sequences and their expression.
aquaporin proteins are present as diverse forms in plants, where they function as transport systems for water and other small molecules.
a major facilitator of water movement through cell membranes of cotton and other plants are the aquaporin proteins.
in higher plants, they consist of five subfamilies including plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , nod26-like intrinsic proteins , small basic intrinsic proteins , and the recently discovered x intrinsic proteins .
one of the primary factors affecting both the quantity and quality of cotton production is water.
from a molecular cloning effort, together with a bioinformatic homology search,  <dig> upland cotton  aquaporin genes were identified.
to explore the physiological roles of these aquaporin genes in cotton, expression analyses were performed for a select set of aquaporin genes from each subfamily using semi-quantitative reverse transcription -pcr.
this study presents a comprehensive identification of  <dig> cotton aquaporin genes.
