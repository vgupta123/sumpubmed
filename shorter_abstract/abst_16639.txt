highly polygenic traits such as fruit weight, sugar content and acidity strongly influence the agroeconomic value of peach varieties.
considered traits were average fruit weight , sugar content  and titratable acidity .

results differed by populations and traits, but predictive abilities were in general high .
all together, these results are very promising for the application of genomic selection to peach breeding programmes.
the accuracy of imputing missing genotypes was as high as 96%, and the genomic predictive ability was on average  <dig> , but could be as high as  <dig>  for fruit weight or  <dig>  for titratable acidity.
genomic selection  can accelerate peach yield and quality gain if predictions show higher levels of accuracy compared to phenotypic selection.
this study assessed the feasibility of genomic selection in peach for highly polygenic traits linked to yield and fruit quality.
the estimated repeatability may prove very useful in the management of the typical long cycles involved in peach productions.

a repeatability model  for genome-enabled predictions in eleven european peach populations is presented.
predictive ability was estimated in a five-fold cross validation scheme within population as the correlation of true and predicted phenotypes.
an analysis of imputation accuracy of missing genotypic data was conducted using the software beagle, showing that two of the eleven populations were highly sensitive to increasing levels of missing data.
