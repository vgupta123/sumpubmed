this work provided insights into the hard-to-sequence phage pap <dig> genome and discovered a new mechanism of bacterial immunity.
the methylome of phage pap <dig> is responsible for the failure of shotgun sequencing and for bacterial immunity mediated by enzyme endo v activity; this methylome also provides a valuable resource for future studies on pap <dig> genome replication and modification, as well as on gene regulation and host interaction.
this problem was resolved using the nfi- mutant of escherichia coli dh5α as a host bacterium to construct a shotgun library.
single-molecule real-time sequencing results revealed that this genome contains 51 n-6-methyladenines and 152 n-4-methylcytosines.
further investigations revealed a novel immune mechanism of bacteria, in which host bacteria can recognise and repel modified bases containing inserts in a large scale.
this mechanism could be accounted for the failure of the shotgun method in pap <dig> genome sequencing.
sequencing large genomes is very simple at present.
however, we encountered a hard-to-sequence genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa phage pap <dig>  shotgun sequencing method failed to complete the sequence of this genome.
whole-genome sequencing is an important method to understand the genetic information, gene function, biological characteristics and survival mechanisms of organisms.
