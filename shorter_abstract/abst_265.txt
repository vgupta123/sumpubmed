we present a structure-based approach to the design of peptide libraries that mimic the whole surface or a particular region of a protein.
to this end, we have developed superficial, a program that uses protein structures as input and generates library proposals consisting of linear and non-linear peptides.
neighbouring sequence segments are linked by short spacers to conserve local conformation.
the determination of protein surfaces and the detection of binding sites are essential to our understanding of protein-protein interactions.
