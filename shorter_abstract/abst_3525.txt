here we examined whether eye development, which is abnormal in mice lacking functional gli <dig>  is defective in gli3+/- mice.
we then generated mice compound heterozygous for mutations in both gli <dig> and pax <dig>  which encodes another developmentally important transcription factor known to be crucial for eye development.
these findings indicate that heterozygous mutations of gli <dig> can impact on eye development.
we showed that gli <dig> is expressed in the developing eye but that gli3+/- mice have only very subtle eye defects.
humans heterozygous for mutations in this gene suffer greig cephalopolysyndactyly or pallister-hall syndromes, in which limb defects are prominent, and mice heterozygous for similar mutations have extra digits.
pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes were compared to the eyes of wild-type, pax6+/- or gli3+/- siblings.
the importance of a normal gli <dig> gene dosage becomes greater in the absence of a normal pax <dig> gene dosage, suggesting that the two genes co-operate during eye morphogenesis.
they exhibited a range of abnormalities of the retina, iris, lens and cornea that was more extensive than in single gli3+/- or pax6+/- mutants or than would be predicted by addition of their phenotypes.
