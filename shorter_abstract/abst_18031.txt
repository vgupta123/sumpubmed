first, the bacterial growth rates at each antimicrobial concentration were estimated with linear regression.
second, we fitted the model to the growth rates, resulting in four parameters that describe the pharmacodynamic properties of each antimicrobial.
we also tested ciprofloxacin resistant strains and found higher pharmacodynamic mics  in the resistant strains and attenuated bactericidal effects at concentrations above the zmic.
pharmacodynamic models describing the relationship between the concentration of antimicrobials and the minimum growth rate of the bacteria provide more detailed information than the mic only.
then the activity of nine antimicrobials with different target mechanisms was examined against a highly antimicrobial susceptible clinical strain isolated in  <dig>  the experimental time-kill curves were analysed and quantified with a previously established pharmacodynamic model.
n. gonorrhoeae time-kill curve experiments analysed with a pharmacodynamic model have potential for in vitro evaluation of new and existing antimicrobials.
in this study, a novel standardised in vitro time-kill curve assay was developed.
the pharmacodynamic parameters based on a wide range of concentrations below and above the mic provide information that could support improving future dosing strategies to treat gonorrhoea.
the assay was validated using five world health organization n. gonorrhoeae reference strains and a range of ciprofloxacin concentrations below and above the mic.
