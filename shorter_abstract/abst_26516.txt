we successfully apply our approach to data on parkinson disease and heroin addiction.
our method is based on finding differences of genotype pattern frequencies between case and control individuals.
for a logistic regression model comprising three disease variants exerting main and epistatic interaction effects, we demonstrate that our method is vastly superior to the traditional approach of looking for single-locus effects.
however, for the very large numbers of genetic markers currently in use, it has proven difficult to develop suitable and efficient approaches for detecting effects other than main effects due to single variants.
it can be applied to large numbers of genetic markers.
in addition to single-locus  effects of disease variants, there is a growing consensus that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may play important roles in disease etiology.
in addition, our method is suitable for estimating the number of disease variants in a dataset.
our approach is suitable and powerful for detecting disease susceptibility variants with potentially small main effects and strong interaction effects.
