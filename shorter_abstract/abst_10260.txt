while some general drawing conventions exist for biological networks, arbitrary graphical representations are very common.
here we describe a methodology for automatic translation of kegg metabolic pathways into the sbgn format.
biologists make frequent use of databases containing large and complex biological networks.
unfortunately, this is non‚Äêtrivial, since converting between notations may add, remove or otherwise alter map elements so that the existing layout cannot be simply reused.
we infer important properties of the kegg layout and treat these as layout constraints that are maintained during the conversion to sbgn maps.
this allows for the drawing and layout conventions of sbgn to be followed while creating maps that are still recognizably the original kegg pathways.
one popular database is the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  which uses its own graphical representation and manual layout for pathways.
ideally, online repositories such as kegg would automatically provide networks in a variety of notations including sbgn.
recently, a new standard has been established for displaying biological processes, the systems biology graphical notation , which aims to unify the look of such maps.
