to determine the exact process which blocks the apoplastic ros signaling, double and triple mutants involved in various signaling pathway were generated in dnd <dig> background.
treatment with ozone  leads to a ros burst in the apoplast and induces extensive changes in gene expression and elevation of defense hormones.
simultaneous elimination of sa-dependent and sa-independent signaling components from dnd <dig> restored its responsiveness to o <dig>  conversely, pre-treatment of plants with sa or using mutants that constitutively activate sa signaling led to an attenuation of changes in gene expression elicited by o <dig>

until recently, most studies on signal interactions have focused on phytohormone interaction, such as the antagonistic relationship between salicylic acid -jasmonic acid and cytokinin-auxin.
in this study, we report an antagonistic interaction between sa signaling and apoplastic ros signaling.
based upon these findings, we conclude that plants are able to prioritize the response between ros and sa via an antagonistic action of sa and sa signaling on apoplastic ros signaling.
however, arabidopsis thaliana dnd <dig>  exhibited an attenuated response to o <dig>  in addition, the dnd <dig> mutant displayed constitutive expression of defense genes and spontaneous cell death.
