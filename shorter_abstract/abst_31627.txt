the zebra finch mhc includes multiple class i and class ii genes, some of which appear to be pseudogenes, and spans a much more extensive genomic region than the chicken mhc, as evidenced by the presence of mhc genes on each of seven bacs spanning  <dig> kb.
cytogenetic  evidence and the genome assembly itself place core mhc genes on as many as four chromosomes with tap and class i genes mapping to different chromosomes.
it remains unclear the extent to which this organization describes the situation in other birds and whether it represents a derived or ancestral condition.
the zebra finch mhc exhibits a complex structure and history involving gene duplication and fragmentation.
avian mhc organization is of particular interest because the chicken gallus gallus, the avian species with the best characterized mhc, possesses a highly streamlined minimal essential mhc, which is linked to resistance against specific pathogens.
our analyses of the zebra finch mhc suggest a complex history involving chromosomal fission, gene duplication and translocation in the history of the mhc in birds, and highlight striking differences in mhc structure and organization among avian lineages.
lastly, we find strong evidence of selection acting on sites within passerine mhc class i and class ii genes.
the zebra finch mhc differs markedly from that of the chicken, the only other bird species with a complete genome sequence.
due to its high polymorphism and importance for disease resistance, the major histocompatibility complex  has been an important focus of many vertebrate genome projects.
