the β-galactoside α- <dig> -sialyltransferase i  protein is encoded by the st6gal <dig> gene and is responsible for the addition of α- <dig>  linked sa to the galβ1-4glcnac disaccharide of glycans and glycoproteins found on the cellular surface.
we used specific small interfering rnas  to block expression of st6gal <dig> and limit distribution of sa receptors on the surface of airway epithelial cells.
the sirna duplexes we used inhibited st6gal <dig> mrna expression and subsequent expression of the encoding protein.
