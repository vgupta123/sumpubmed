additionally, we also found clusters of genes differentially expressed between genders and between developmental stages that suggest a role involved in sex differentiation.
male flowers show a reduced pistil without style or stigma and female flowers present reflexed stamens with infertile pollen.
we showed that sex determination is a late event during flower development and that the expression of genes from the abcde model is not directly correlated with the establishment of sexual dimorphism.
for the first time a full transcriptomic analysis was performed in different flower developmental stages in the same individual.
there is no evidence of differences of expression levels in genes from the abcde model that could explain the shift from hermaphroditism to dioecy.
v. v. vinifera is hermaphrodite whereas v. v. sylvestris is a dioecious species.
we propose that sex specification occurs after floral organ identity has been established and therefore, sex determination genes might be having an effect downstream of the abcde model genes.
to understand which genes are involved during the establishment of male, female and complete flowers, we analysed and compared the transcription profiles of four developmental stages of the three genders.
our experimental approach enabled us to create a comprehensive catalogue of transcribed genes across developmental stages and genders that will contribute for future work in sex determination in seed plants.
the mechanism for flower sex determination and specification in grapevine is still unknown.
we propose a temporal comprehensive model in which two mutations in two linked genes could be players in sex determination and indirectly establish the vitis domestication process.
v. vinifera produce perfect flowers with all functional structures.
