however, no native igf- <dig> gene  product was detected in the western blots in e. coli.
igg-sepharose affinity column chromatographic separation of z domain containing chloroplast derived igf- <dig> protein, single and two dimensional electrophoresis methods and mass spectrometer analysis confirmed the identity of human igf- <dig> in transgenic chloroplasts.
the ability to use plant chloroplasts as bioreactors to generate proteins of great economic value that retain their biological activity is an exciting and achievable goal that appears to be within our grasp.
expression of the synthetic insulin like growth factor  <dig> gene  was observed in transformed e. coli.
the igf-1n plants contained  <dig> % tsp as igf-1n, suggesting that the chloroplast translation machinery is more flexible than e. coli in codon preference and usage.
southern blot analysis confirmed that the transgenic lines were homoplasmic.
production of therapeutic proteins in leaves provides transgene containment by elimination of reproductive structures.
cell proliferation assays in human hu- <dig> cells demonstrated the biological activity of chloroplast derived igf- <dig> even in the presence of the s. aureus z tag.
transgenic chloroplasts are potential bioreactors for recombinant protein production, especially for achievement of high levels of protein expression and proper folding.
therefore, in this study, human insulin like growth factor- <dig> is expressed in transgenic chloroplasts for evaluation of structural identity and function.
this study demonstrates that the human insulin like growth factor- <dig> expressed in transgenic chloroplasts is identical to the native protein and is fully functional.
site-specific integration of the transgenes into the tobacco chloroplast genome was confirmed after transformation using pcr.
the expression of igf- <dig> was increased up to 32% tsp under continuous illumination by the chloroplast light regulatory elements.
the transgenic plant lines had igf-1s expression levels of  <dig> % of total soluble protein .
