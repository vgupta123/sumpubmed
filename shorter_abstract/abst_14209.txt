the mitogenome sequences reported will be valuable resources for further genetic studies with c. gloeosporioides s.l.
species lineages , and evaluated the usefulness of mitogenome sequence in complementing prevailing nuclear markers for species delimitation.
mitogenomes and demonstrates that mitogenome sequence can complement prevailing nuclear markers in improving species delimitation accuracy.
the fungal species complex colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato contains over  <dig> plant-interacting species.
compared with nuclear dna markers commonly used in phylogeny, the mitogenome nucleotide diversity was extremely low, yet the mitogenome alignment contained the highest number of parsimony informative sites, which allowed the generation of a high-resolution phylogeny recognizing all taxonomic lineages, including ones belonging to the very nascent c. siamense s.l.
the tree topology was highly congruent with the phylogeny based on nuclear marker concatenation except for lineages within c. siamense s.l.
accurate species delimitation in c. gloeosporioides s.l.
compared with previously reported colletotrichum mitogenomes, these mitogenomes were uniquely featured by:  significantly larger genome size due to richer intron content and longer intergenic region;  striking gc content elevation at the intergenic region; and  considerable intron content variation among different species lineages.
further comparative phylogenetic analysis indicated that lineage-specific rapid divergence of gs and sod <dig> markers confounded concatenation-based species relationship inference.
in this study, we first sequenced and compared nine mitogenomes belonging to four c. gloeosporioides s.l.
this study sheds light on the evolution of c. gloeosporioides s.l.
