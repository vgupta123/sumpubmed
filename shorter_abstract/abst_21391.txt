the aim of this study was to analyze the significance of leucine to proline substitution at position  <dig> on the hydrolysis of penicillin and ampicillin that we identified in the blashv gene of clinical escherichia coli swine isolate.
kinetic analysis of the mutant proteins showed that km value of the purified l138p mutant was comparatively higher than shv- <dig>  shv- <dig> and shv- <dig> enzyme for penicillin and ampicillin.
these naturally occurring mutations rendering reduced function of the existing protein could trigger the emergence or acquisition of more effective alternative mechanisms for β-lactam hydrolysis.
our result demonstrated that l138p has a reduced role in penicillin and ampicillin hydrolyzing properties of shv β-lactamases.
