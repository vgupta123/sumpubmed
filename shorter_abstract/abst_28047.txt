we mined the recently published genomes of the two mycoparasitic biocontrol agents trichoderma atroviride and trichoderma virens and compared the identified gpcr-like proteins to those of the saprophyte trichoderma reesei.
furthermore, the class of receptors with a duf <dig> domain was expanded in t. atroviride, and t. virens showed an expansion of pth11-like receptors compared to t. atroviride and t. reesei.
the expansion of certain classes in the mycoparasites t. atroviride and t. virens is likely to reflect the capability of these fungi to establish various ecological niches and interactions with other organisms such as fungi and plants.
gpcrs react to a variety of extracellular cues and are considered to play central roles in the signal transduction in fungi.
phylogenetic analyses resulted in  <dig> classes and revealed differences not only among the three trichoderma species but also between trichoderma and other fungi.
expression analysis of the paqr-encoding genes of the three trichoderma species revealed that all except one were actually transcribed.
comparative genome analyses of three trichoderma species revealed a great diversity of putative gpcrs with genus- and species- specific differences.
these gpcrs consequently represent interesting candidates for future research on the mechanisms underlying mycoparasitism and biocontrol.
the class comprising proteins of the paqr family was significantly expanded both in trichoderma compared to other fungi as well as in the two mycoparasites compared to t. reesei.
the identification and characterization of gpcrs will provide insights into how trichoderma communicates with its environment and senses the presence of host fungi.
