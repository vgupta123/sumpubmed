the evaluation of the system with  <dig>  references not used for training, containing  <dig> articles relevant to stem cells according to a human expert, indicated a recall of 65% for a precision of 65%.
the medline database contains over  <dig> million references to scientific literature, with about 3/ <dig> of recent articles including an abstract of the publication.
however, particular analyses of the literature or database developments may need the complete ranking of all the references in the medline database as to their relevance to a topic of interest.
a training set of  <dig>  references was constructed by selecting entries annotated with the mesh term stem cells or some child in its sub tree.
we tested the capabilities of our system to retrieve medline references which are relevant to the subject of stem cells.
this strategy appears to be useful for predicting the relevance of medline references to a given concept.
this report describes a method that does this ranking using the differences in word content between medline entries related to a topic and the whole of medline, in a computational time appropriate for an article search query engine.
