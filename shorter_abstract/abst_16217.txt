phylogenetic results obtained from the samples showed that posav sequences were genetically related to the currently described genogroup iii, to the proposed genogroup vii and also to the mi-qw <dig> sequence .
in this study, we report the development of a rapid real time qrt-pcr based on sybr green chemistry for the diagnosis of porcine sapovirus infection in swine.
the virus is detected in different species including the human and the porcine species as an enteric pathogen causing asymptomatic to symptomatic enteritis.
sapoviruses are single stranded positive sense rna viruses belonging to the family caliciviridae.
during its development, the diagnostic tool showed good correlation compared with the gold standard conventional rt-pcr and was ten-fold more sensitive.
it correlated with the gold standard conventional rt-pcr.
the method was also applied to swine samples from the netherlands that were positive for posav infection.
as a first line screening diagnosis method, it allows a quicker and easier decision on doubtful samples.
the method allows the detection of porcine sapoviruses and the quantification of the genomic copies present in stool samples.
