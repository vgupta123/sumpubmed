here, we report on the development and evaluation of the first sexing strains of c. hominivorax that produce only males when raised on diet without tetracycline.
we conclude that the promising characteristics of the selected sexing strains may contribute to reduce production costs for the existing eradication program and provide more efficient population suppression, which should make a genetic control program more economical in regions were c. hominivorax remains endemic.
transgenic lines have been developed that possess a tetracycline repressible female-lethal genetic system.
the new world screwworm, cochliomyia hominivorax, is a devastating pest of livestock endemic to subtropical and tropical regions of the western hemisphere.
over 60 years ago, the sterile insect technique  was developed with the aim of eradicating this pest, initially from florida but subsequently from all of north and central america.
most of the lines were comparable to the wild type parental strain in several fitness parameters that are relevant to mass rearing in a production facility.
consequently, one transgenic line has been selected by the new world screwworm program for evaluation under mass rearing conditions.

ten of these lines show high female lethality at the late larval/pupal stages and three of them present dominant female lethality.
from the outset it was appreciated that sit would be more efficient if only sterile males were released in the field, but this was not possible until now.
