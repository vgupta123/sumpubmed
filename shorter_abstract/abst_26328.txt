similar to a Δacsa mutant, strains carrying deletions either in acsr or acss grew slowly than wild type in a minimal medium with acetate as a sole carbon source.
growth defect of the Δacsr strain in acetate-minimal medium was restored by complementation.
transcriptomic analysis of the mutant deficient in this luxr-type regulator showed that the acsa gene encoding acetyl-coa synthetase was down-regulated.
to investigate if acsr directly regulates acsa expression, in vitro-gel shift assays were performed using the recombinant acsr and the regulatory region of the acsa gene, showing that acsr specifically bound the upstream region of the acsa orf.
an experiment to identify the vars/vara-regulon in v. vulnificus revealed that a putative luxr-type transcriptional regulator was down-regulated in Δvara mutant.
this study indicates that the vars/vara system plays a role in v. vulnificus metabolism via regulating acsr, which in turn controls acetate metabolism by activating the transcription of the acetyl-coa synthetase gene.
a putative histidine kinase gene, acss, was located five orfs downstream of the acsr gene.

thus, this regulator was named acsr for “regulator of acetyl-coa synthetase”.
to investigate the roles of this regulatory cascade, the target gene regulated by a luxr-regulator was identified and its expression was characterized.
