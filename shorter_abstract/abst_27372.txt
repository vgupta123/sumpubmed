several stimulation protocols were used to induce long-term potentiation  of synaptic responses in the ca <dig> area recorded following excitation of sch√§ffer collateral/commissural fibres.
in all cases, we observed a clear spatial plasticity gradient with maximum ltp levels detected in proximal apical dendrites of pyramidal neurones.
using 3d meas, we were able to record larger fepsps compared to signals measured by planar meas.
multi-electrode arrays  have become popular tools for recording spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of excitable tissues.
the majority of previous studies of synaptic transmission in brain slices employed meas with planar electrodes that had limited ability to detect signals coming from deeper, healthier layers of the slice.
no significant differences in the manifestation of ltp were observed between 129s5/svevbrd and c57bl/6j-tyrc-brd mice with the three protocols used.
to overcome this limitation, we used three-dimensional  meas with tip-shaped electrodes to probe plasticity of field excitatory synaptic potentials  in the ca <dig> area of hippocampal slices of 129s5/svevbrd and c57bl/6j-tyrc-brd mice.
principal features of ltp  recorded in the hippocampal slices using meas were very similar to those seen in conventional glass electrode experiments.
