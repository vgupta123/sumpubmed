however, since disease-associated genes tend to interact, one solution is to arrange them in modules based on co-expression data and known gene interactions.
this module was validated in an independent material, by replicating the expression changes in allergen-challenged cd4+ cells.
this suggested an inhibitory role, which was confirmed by functional studies.
this led to the identification of an experimentally validated reference gene that was used to construct a module of co-expressed and interacting genes.
the hypothesis of this study was that such a module could be a) found and validated in allergic disease and b) used to find and validate one ore more novel disease-associated genes.
the identification of novel genes by high-throughput studies of complex diseases is complicated by the large number of potential genes.
we propose that a module-based analytical strategy is generally applicable to find novel genes in complex diseases.
to test these hypotheses integrated analysis of a large number of gene expression microarray experiments from different forms of allergy was performed.
the expression levels of il7r in allergen challenged cd4+ cells decreased following challenge but increased after treatment.
the module contained several novel disease-associated genes, of which the one with the highest number of interactions with known disease genes, il7r, was selected for further validation.
