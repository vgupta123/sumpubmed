for most of the infecting parasite species, no molecular data had been available previously, and some of the datasets contain sequences representing large amounts of the parasiteâ€™s gene repertoire.
we analysed  <dig> assemblies and found  <dig>  contigs of apicomplexan origin in  <dig> of the datasets.
the contaminating species were identified as members of the apicomplexan taxa gregarinasina, coccidia, piroplasmida, and haemosporida.
here we show that sequences deriving from apicomplexan parasites can be found in many animal genome and transcriptome projects, which in most cases derived from an infection of the sequenced host specimen.
the apicomplexan sequences were extracted from the sequence assemblies using a newly developed bioinformatic pipeline  and tentatively assigned to distinct taxa employing phylogenetic methods.
for example, in the platypus genome assembly, we found a high number of contigs derived from a piroplasmid parasite .
contaminations from various exogenous sources are a common problem in next-generation sequencing.
our study suggests that parasite-derived contaminations represent a valuable source of information that can help to discover and identify new parasites, and provide information on previously unknown host-parasite interactions.
