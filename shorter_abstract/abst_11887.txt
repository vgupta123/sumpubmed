protoplasts derived from calli of bupleurum scorzonerifolium and s. mussotii were fused to produce  <dig> putative hybrid cell lines, of which three  later differentiated into green plants.
some of the hybrid calli contained smg10h from donor, and produced swertiamarin, mangiferin and certain volatile compounds characteristic of s. mussotii.
somatic hybrids between b. scorzonerifolium and s. mussotii were obtained, hybrids selected all contained introgressed nuclear and cytoplasmic dna from s. mussotii; and some produced more mangiferin than the donor itself.
rflp analysis of organellar dna revealed that mitochondrial and chloroplast dna of both parents coexisted and recombined in some hybrid cell lines.
somatic hybridization represents a novel approach for introgressing swertia mussotii genes into a less endangered species.
the hybrid calli genomes were predominantly b. scorzonerifolium.
gish analysis of mitotic chromosomes confirmed that the irradiation of donor protoplasts increased the frequency of chromosome elimination and fragmentation.
