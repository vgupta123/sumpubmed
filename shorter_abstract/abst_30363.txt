the best explanation for this is that some loci associated with the distinguishing morphological characters are under strong selection, but exchange of neutral loci is occurring freely between the two species.
gene flow is traditionally considered a limitation to speciation because selection is required to counter the homogenising effect of allele exchange.
although it is easier to define species as requiring a barrier between them, a dynamic model that accommodates gene flow is a biologically more reasonable explanation for these grasshoppers.
here we report on two sympatric short-horned grasshoppers species in the south island of new zealand; one  widespread and the other  a narrow endemic.
