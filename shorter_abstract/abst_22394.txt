phenotypic studies have shown that mfe <dig> has antibacterial activity against a wide range of competitor bacteria, including rhizobacteria and clinically relevant bacteria.
mutagenesis of the hcp <dig> gene abolishes or reduces, depending on the target strain, mfe <dig> antibacterial activity.
with this work, we illustrate the importance and versatility of type  <dig> secretion systems in bacterial adaptation and fitness.
hcp <dig>  encoded by hcp <dig>  may also be involved in bacterial competition.
it affected mucoidy of the strain and its motility and was associated with the loss of flagella, which were restored by introduction of plasmid expressing hcp <dig>  the hcp <dig> mutation had no effect on bacterial competition during incubation in solid medium.
pseudomonas fluorescens strain mfe <dig> secretes in abundance two hcp proteins  hcp <dig> and hcp <dig>  characteristic of a functional type  <dig> secretion system.
hcp <dig> also appears to contribute to limiting the motility of prey cells to facilitate killing mediated by hcp <dig>  inhibition of motility associated with an hcp protein has never been described.
