listeria monocytogenes has been implicated in several food borne outbreaks as well as sporadic cases of disease.
oral dosage of guinea pigs with listeria resulted in a significantly higher prevalence  of these bacteria in jejunum, liver and spleen four and seven days after challenge, when the bacterial cultures had been grown under oxygen-restricted conditions prior to dosage.
fluorescent protein labels were applied to allow certain identification of listeria cells from untagged bacteria in in vivo samples, and to distinguish between cells grown under different conditions in mixed infection experiments.
our results show for the first time that the environmental conditions to which l. monocytogenes is exposed prior to ingestion are decisive for its in vivo infective potential in the gastrointestinal tract after passage of the gastric barrier.
the infectivity of listeria monocytogenes scotta, cultivated with and without oxygen restriction, was compared in vitro and in vivo.
infection of caco- <dig> cells revealed that listeria cultivated under oxygen-restricted conditions were approximately  <dig> fold more invasive than similar cultures grown without oxygen restriction.
these differences were seen after challenge with single listeria cultures, as well as with a mixture of two cultures grown with and without oxygen restriction.
