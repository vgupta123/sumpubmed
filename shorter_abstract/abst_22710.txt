this lands further support on our general rules of gene regulation network in ipsc reprogramming.
we calculated the reprogramming rate and showed that it would increase in the condition of knockdown of somatic transcription factors or inhibition of dna methylation globally, consistent with the real reprogramming experiments.
somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced-pluripotent stem cells  by introducing few reprogramming factors, which challenges the long held view that cell differentiation is irreversible.
the gene expression data at several stages in reprogramming and the reprogramming rate under several typically experiment conditions coincided with our simulation results.
this model may help uncover the basic mechanism of reprogramming and improve the efficiency of converting somatic cells to ipscs.
furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of our model by testing it with the real dynamic gene expression data spanning across different intermediate stages in the ips reprogramming process.
the function of reprogramming factors and gene expression change during reprogramming could be partly explained by our model reasonably well.
inspired by the phenomenological reprogramming model of artyomov et al , we proposed a novel markov model, stepwise reprogramming markov  model, with simpler gene regulation rules and explored various properties of the model with monte carlo simulation.
