we demonstrated that de novo assembly, using trinity and later annotation with blast using different databases, were complementary to alignment to the reference sequence using soapaligner/soap <dig>  the fragaria reference genome belongs to a species in the same family as blackberry  but to a different genus.
for protein prediction analysis, the number of coding dna sequences  that mapped to the protein database was  <dig> .
non redundant , annotation showed that  <dig>  genes  has the highest similarity with fragaria vesca subspecies vesca.
primers designed to the assembled sequences accurately distinguished different contigs, at least for chalcone synthase genes.
for functional annotation,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   consensus sequences were annotated using different databases; in total  <dig>  annotated sequences were identified.
reanalysis was undertaken by aligning the reads with this reference genome for a deeper analysis of the transcriptome.
this new sequence information will improve the knowledge of this important and healthy fruit, providing an invaluable new tool for biological research.
a broad range of genomic tools are available for other rosaceae species but these tools are still lacking in the rubus genus, thus limiting gene discovery and the breeding of improved varieties.
we prepared and analysed transcriptome data from ripe blackberries, for which prior genomic information was limited.
since blackberries are tetraploids, the possibility of artefactual gene chimeras resulting from mis-assembly was tested with one of the genes sequenced by rnaseq, chalcone synthase .
