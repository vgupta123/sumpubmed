we expect that streaming read compressors such as oculus could become a standard addition to existing rna-seq and chip-seq alignment pipelines, and potentially other applications in the future as throughput increases.
here we present oculus, a software package that attaches to standard aligners and exploits read redundancy by performing streaming compression, alignment, and decompression of input sequences.
