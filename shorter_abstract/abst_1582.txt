research on the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds on a sub-cellular level has been more intensively studied in gram-negative organisms than in gram-positive bacteria.
eleven genes are co-transcribed in one polycistronic mrna as shown by reverse transcription-pcr.
fifteen open reading frames residing on a low-copy megaplasmid were identified.
a dna fragment encoding a phenol hydroxylase catalyzing the first step in the meta-pathway has been isolated previously.
the deduced amino acid sequences display similarities to a two-component phenol hydroxylase, a catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase, a 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, a 2-oxopent-4-dienoate hydratase, a 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase, a 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, a plant-type ferredoxin involved in the reactivation of extradiol dioxygenases and a novel regulatory protein.
this is a first step to elucidate regulatory mechanisms that are likely to be distinct from modes described for gram-negative bacteria.
moreover, the first transcriptional regulator of the phenol metabolism in gram-positive bacteria was identified.
geobacillus stearothermophilus is able to utilize phenol as a sole carbon source.
a  <dig>  kb dna fragment was isolated as a result of the dna walk.
the only enzymes missing for the complete mineralization of phenol are a 2-hydroxymuconic acid-6-semialdehyde hydrolase and/or 2-hydroxymuconic acid-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
we isolated the first complete sequence of an operon from a thermophilic bacterium encoding the meta-pathway genes and analyzed the genetic organization.
based on these findings a pcr-based dna walk was performed initially to isolate a catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase for biosensoric applications but was continued to elucidate the organisation of the genes encoding the proteins for the metabolization of phenol.
