several photosynthetic promoters have been shown to be strong regulators of expression of transgenes in light-responsive tissues and would be good candidates for leaf and immature fruit tissue-specificity, if expression in the mature fruit were minimized.
two different orientations of the cab19::gus fusion relative to the left t-dna border of the binary vector were transformed into tomato.
the minimal cab <dig> promoter retains both tissue-specificity and light regulation and can be used to drive expression of foreign genes with minimal activity in mature, edible fruit.
ten independent regenerants of each construct and an untransformed control line were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively for gus expression in leaves, fruit and flowers, and quantitatively in roots.
in addition, the light-inducibility of the cab19::gus constructs indicated that all the requisite cis-elements for light responsiveness were contained on the cab <dig> fragment.
the minimal cab <dig> promoter conferred gus activity primarily in leaves and green fruit, as well as in response to light.
surprisingly, gus activity in transgenic green fruit was considerably higher than leaves for all promoter constructs; however, in red, ripe fruit activities were much lower for the cab <dig> promoter constructs than the mas35s::gus.
gus activity in the leaves of both cab <dig> constructs averaged about 2/ <dig> that observed with mas35s::gus controls.
although gus activity was readily detectable in flowers and roots of mas35s::gustransgenic plants, little activity was observed in plants carrying the cab <dig> promoter constructs.
