an ant algorithm is a biology-inspired computational technique, through which a combinatorial problem is solved by mimicking the behavior of social insects such as ants.
identification of transcription-factor binding motifs  can be formulated as a combinatorial problem, where an efficient algorithm is indispensable to predict the role of multiple binding motifs.
the results revealed that the ant algorithm was able to identify biologically known binding motifs in chondrogenesis such as ap- <dig>  nfÎºb, and sox <dig>  some of the predicted motifs were identical to those previously derived with the genetic algorithm.
unlike the genetic algorithm, however, the ant algorithm was able to evaluate a contribution of individual binding motifs as a spectrum of distributed information and predict core consensus motifs from a wider dna pool.
we developed a unique version of ant algorithms to select a set of binding motifs by considering a potential contribution of each of all random dna sequences of 4- to 7-bp in length.
human chondrogenesis was used as a model system.
the ant algorithm offers an efficient, reproducible procedure to predict a role of individual transcription-factor binding motifs using a unique definition of artificial ants.
