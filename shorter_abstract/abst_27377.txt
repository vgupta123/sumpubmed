we conducted a systematic analysis of trs of unit lengths 2– <dig> nucleotides in whole genome shotgun  sequences to define the extent of variation of  <dig>  unique repeat loci throughout the genome.
this revealed a deficit of variant repeats in chromosomes  <dig> and y – likely to reflect a reduction in 2-mer repeats in the former and a reduced level of recombination in the latter – and excesses in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>
predicted heterozygosity correlated with heterozygosity in the ceph polymorphism database  better than the correlation between the ceph and wgs data , presumably because the model smoothes noise from small sample sizes.
variability among 2–12-mer trs in the genome can be modeled by a few parameters, which do not markedly differ according to unit length, consistent with a common mechanism for the generation of variability among such trs.
a multivariate logistic model of  <dig> parameters accounted for 36% of the variation in the wgs data.
we applied a multivariate statistical model to predict tr variability.
