we propose a supervised group lasso approach that takes into account the cluster structure in gene expression data for gene selection and predictive model building.
for gene expression data without biological cluster information, we first divide genes into clusters using the k-means approach and determine the optimal number of clusters using the gap method.
it has been demonstrated that gene expression data have cluster structure, where the clusters consist of co-regulated genes which tend to have coordinated functions.
however, most available statistical methods for gene selection do not take into consideration the cluster structure.
a tremendous amount of efforts have been devoted to identifying genes for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases using microarray gene expression data.
we apply the proposed method to disease classification and survival analysis with microarray data.
we analyze four microarray data sets using the proposed approach: two cancer data sets with binary cancer occurrence as outcomes and two lymphoma data sets with survival outcomes.
prediction performance is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation.
in the first step, we identify important genes within each cluster using the lasso method.
the results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying a small number of influential gene clusters and important genes within those clusters, and has better prediction performance than existing methods.
