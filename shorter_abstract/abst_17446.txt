cellpd is an open source tool that can be used by scientists  to quantify key aspects of cell phenotypes .
existing tools for quantitative analysis generally require expert knowledge.
we validated cellpd’s estimates by comparing it with a previously published tool  and with microsoft excel’s built-in functions.
furthermore, cellpd’s estimates quantify and distinguish between the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of both drugs—analyses that cannot readily be performed with spreadsheet software such as microsoft excel or without specialized computational expertise and programming environments.
to demonstrate cellpd’s ability to aid in the analysis of high throughput data, we created a synthetic high content screening  data set, where a simulated cell line is exposed to two hypothetical drug compounds at several doses.
early applications of cellpd may include drug effect quantification, functional analysis of gene knockout experiments, data quality control, minable big data generation, and integration of biological data with computational models.
cellpd  facilitates quantitative phenotype analysis, allowing users to fit mathematical models of cell population dynamics without specialized training.

cellpd correctly estimates the net growth rate of cell cultures and is more robust to data sparsity than cellgrowth.
cellpd requires one input  and generates multiple outputs including parameter estimation reports, high-quality plots, and minable xml files.
cellpd correctly estimates the drug-dependent birth, death, and net growth rates.
