importantly,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of monoallelic expression genes contained the h3k36me <dig> modification.
for heterozygous genes, alleles on the chromatin from two different parents exhibit histone modification variations known as allele-specific histone modifications .

our results demonstrate that epialleles from parents can be inherited by the f <dig> to produce ashms in the f <dig> hybrid.
further studies demonstrated a significant positive correlation of ase with allele-specific h3k36me <dig> but not with h3k27me <dig>  indicating that ashm-h3k36me <dig> primarily regulates ase in this study.
our findings indicate that ashm-h3k36me <dig>  rather than h3k27me <dig>  mainly regulates ase in hybrid rice.
however, to date, the regulation of ase by ashm genes remains poorly understood in higher plants.
further analysis indicated that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the epialleles were faithfully inherited by the f <dig> hybrid and contributed to  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the ashm genes.
we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing  to investigate the global ashm profiles of trimethylation on histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  and histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  in two rice f <dig> hybrids.
