the system is a support vector machine  classifier trained with  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative mirna:target interaction pairs, all experimentally validated.
bioinformatics investigations on mirna target have resulted in a number of target prediction tools.
we present a mirna target filtering system named mirtif .
the identification of microrna targets has become one of the major challenges of mirna research.
once trained with experimentally validated true and false targets, machine learning methods appear to be ideal approaches to distinguish the true targets from the false ones.
prediction accuracies are assessed using 10-fold cross-validation experiments.
the encoded feature vector contains various k-gram frequencies in the seed, the non-seed and the entire regions.
more importantly, the system correctly predicts majority of the false positive mirna:target interactions .
mirtif is designed as a post-processing filter that takes mirna:target interactions predicted by other target prediction softwares such as targetscans, pictar and miranda as inputs, and determines how likely the given interaction is a real or a pseudo one.
