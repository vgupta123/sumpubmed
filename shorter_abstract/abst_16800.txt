simulated sequences were aligned with standard protocols and then regression trees were built up to identify the most reliable parameters and cutoff values to discriminate true and false variant calls.
moreover, we analyzed flanking sequences of region presenting a high rate of false positive calls observing that such sequences present a low complexity make up.
this was pursued by using classification trees on true and false variants from simulated sequences of a real dataset data.
our results showed that gatk hard filtering parameter values can be tailored through a simulation study based-on the dna region of interest to ameliorate the accuracy of the variant calling.
we simulated two datasets, with different coverages, including all the sequence alterations identified in a real dataset according to their observed frequencies.

the aim of the present paper was to set up a procedure to assess the best parameters to be used in the hard filtering of gatk.
