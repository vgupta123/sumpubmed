a previous multi-locus lineage  analysis of ssr-microsatellite data of old olive trees in the southeast mediterranean area had shown the predominance of the souri cultivar  among grafted trees.
our results thus suggest that mll1/mll <dig> and mll1/mll <dig> combinations were selected by growers in traditional rain-fed cultivation under mediterranean climate conditions in the southeast mediterranean area.
the decreasing number of mll1/mll <dig> trees along an aridity gradient suggests that use of this genotype combination in arid sites was not favoured because of sensitivity of mll <dig> to drought.
these results suggest that in certain environments grafting of the local souri cultivar on mll <dig> rootstocks and the mll1/mll <dig> combination result in improved oil quality.
the most parsimonious models indicated differential influences of environmental conditions on parameters of olive oil quality in trees belonging to the mll1/mll <dig> and mll1/mll <dig> combinations, but a similar influence on fruit characteristics and oil content.

hypothesizing that grafting on mll <dig> provides an advantage under certain conditions, akaike information criterion  model selection procedure was used to assess the influence of different environmental conditions on phenotypic characteristics of the fruits and oil of the two mll combinations.
we here present a comparison of the mll combinations mll <dig> /mll <dig>  and mll1/mll <dig> in order to investigate the possible influence of rootstock on scion phenotype.
a linear regression analysis demonstrated that the abundance of mll1/mll <dig> trees decreases and of mll1/mll <dig> trees increases along a gradient of increasing aridity.
