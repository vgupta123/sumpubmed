we, and others, have shown that g-csf is effective in treating cerebral ischemia in rodents, both relating to infarct size as well as functional recovery.
here, we have further delayed treatment and studied effects of g-csf on infarct volume in the middle cerebral artery occlusion  model and functional outcome in the cortical photothrombotic model.
in addition to these trophic effects, g-csf is a potent neuroprotective factor reliably reducing infarct size in different stroke models.
in the rat photothrombotic model, we applied  <dig> Î¼g/kg bodyweight g-csf daily for a period of  <dig> days starting either  <dig> or  <dig> h after induction of ischemia.
g-csf both decreased acute infarct volume in the mcao model, and improved recovery in the photothrombotic model at delayed timepoints.
infarct volume was determined  <dig> h after onset of ischemia.
