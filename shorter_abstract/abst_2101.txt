gene duplications were widespread throughout b. distachyon genome.
in addition, multiple stresses expression profile demonstrated that bdbzips exhibited significant expression patterns responding to  <dig> stresses, and those responding to heavy metal treatments showed opposite expression pattern comparing to the treatments of environmental factors and phytohormones.
we also screened certain up- and down-regulated bdbzip genes with fold changes ≥ <dig>  which were more sensitive to abiotic stress conditions.
bdbzip genes behaved diverse functional characters and showed discrepant and some regular expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses.

the exon splicing in bdbzip motifs were more complex and diverse than those in other plant species.
plant basic leucine zipper  transcription factors are one of the largest and most diverse gene families and play key roles in regulating diverse stress processes.
evolutionary comparisons suggested b. distachyon and rice’s bzips had the similar evolutionary patterns.
brachypodium distachyon is emerging as a widely recognized model plant for the temperate grass family and the herbaceous energy crops, however there is no comprehensive analysis of bzips in b. distachyon, especially those involved in stress tolerances.
it is possible that our findings are crucial for revealing the potentialities of utilizing these candidate bdbzips to improve productivity of grass plants and cereal crops.
in this study,  <dig> bzip genes  were identified distributing unevenly on each chromosome of b. distachyon, and most of them were scattered in the low cpg content regions.
