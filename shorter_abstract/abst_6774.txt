analysis of dna fragments, cell oxidative factors and the lengths of leaf scars after grazing provided physiological and morphological evidence that bsa deposition during grazing alters the oxidative and apoptotic status of cells.
enrichment analysis of gene ontology , eukaryotic orthologous groups  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways revealed that the effects of grazing and bsa deposition involved more apoptosis and cell oxidative changes compared to defoliation.
sheepgrass  is an important perennial forage grass across the eurasian steppe and is adaptable to various environmental conditions, but little is known about its molecular mechanism responding to grazing and bsa deposition.
in this study, ngs technology was employed to characterize de novo the transcriptome of sheepgrass after defoliation and grazing treatments and to identify differentially expressed genes  responding to grazing and bsa deposition.
based on the assembled transcriptome, we detected  <dig>  degs responding to bsa deposition during grazing.

this research greatly enriches sheepgrass transcriptome resources and grazing-stress-related genes, helping us to better understand the molecular mechanism of grazing in sheepgrass.
