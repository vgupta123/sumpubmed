clustalw and bl2seq sequence analysis showed that latrf shared sequence identity with the trypanosoma brucei trf  protein and had the same degree of sequence similarities with the dimerization  and the canonical dna-binding myb-like domains of both mammalian trfs.
in addition, trf <dig> can modulate the activity of several enzymes and influence the conformation of telomeric dna.
native and full length latrf and a mutant bearing the putative myb-like domain expressed in bacteria bound double-stranded telomeric dna in vitro.
telomeres are specialized structures at the end of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability and cell viability.
western blot and indirect immunofluorescence combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that latrf, similarly to htrf <dig>  is a nuclear protein that also associates with parasite telomeres.
the importance of telomeric proteins for telomere maintenance has increased our interest in the identification of homologues within the genus leishmania.
the nuclear localization of latrf, its association and co-localization with parasite telomeres and its high identity with tbtrf protein, support the hypothesis that latrf is a leishmania telomeric protein.
