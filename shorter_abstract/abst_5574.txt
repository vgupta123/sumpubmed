in this study, we investigated the impact of the microbiota on gene coexpression in drosophila.
furthermore, gene coexpression was uniformly stronger in these microbiota-dependent modules than in both the microbiota-independent modules in gnotobiotic flies and all modules in axenic flies, indicating that the presence of the microbiota directs gene regulation in a subset of the transcriptome.
our system-wide analysis demonstrates that the presence of microbiota enhances gene coexpression, thereby structuring the transcriptional network in the animal host.
the genes constituting the microbiota-dependent transcriptional modules include regulators of growth, metabolism and neurophysiology, previously implicated in mediating phenotypic effects of microbiota on drosophila phenotype.
for seven of these modules, the strength of the transcriptional network  differed significantly between flies bearing a defined gut microbiota  and flies reared under microbiologically sterile conditions .
together these results provide the first evidence that the microbiota enhances the coexpression of specific and functionally-related genes relative to the animal’s intrinsic baseline level of coexpression.
a full understanding of microbiota-dependent gene regulation requires analysis of the overall architecture of the host transcriptome, by identifying suites of genes that are expressed synchronously.
resident microorganisms  have far-reaching effects on the biology of their animal hosts, with major consequences for the host’s health and fitness.
