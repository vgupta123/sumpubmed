consequently, the visual pigments of many reef fish are matched to shorter wavelengths, which are transmitted better by water.
however, previous studies ignore the fact that several marine organisms, including deep sea fish, produce their own red luminescence and are capable of seeing it.
finally, microspectrometry in one fluorescent goby, eviota pellucida, showed a long-wave sensitivity that overlapped with its own red fluorescence, indicating that this species is capable of seeing its own fluorescence.
we here report that at least  <dig> reef fishes from  <dig> genera and  <dig> families show pronounced red fluorescence under natural, daytime conditions at depths where downwelling red light is virtually absent.
our data indicate that red fluorescence may function in a context of intraspecific communication.
moreover red fluorescence was particularly strong in fins that are involved in intraspecific signalling.
we show that red fluorescence is widespread among marine fishes.
high inter-specific variation in red fluorescence and its association with structures used in intra-specific signalling further corroborate this view.
combining the typically poor long-wavelength sensitivity of fish eyes with the presumed lack of ambient red light, red light is currently considered irrelevant for reef fish.
our findings challenge the notion that red light is of no importance to marine fish, calling for a reassessment of its role in fish visual ecology in subsurface marine environments.
many of these species show quite cryptic colouration in other parts of the visible spectrum.
in most cases peak emission was around  <dig> nm and fluorescence was associated with guanine crystals, which thus far were known for their light reflecting properties only.
