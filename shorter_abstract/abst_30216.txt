a major characteristic of tetraspanins is their ability to interact with each other and other transmembrane proteins to build tetraspanin-enriched microdomains .
furthermore, cholesterol depletion, which inhibits hcv infection and reduces total cell surface expression of cd <dig>  did not affect tem-associated cd <dig> levels.
in contrast to plasmodium infection, our data show that association of cd <dig> with tem is not essential for the early steps of hcv life cycle, indicating that these two pathogens, while using the same molecules, invade their host by different mechanisms.
importantly, mt81w antibody, which only recognizes tem-associated mcd <dig>  did not strongly affect hcv infection.
although precise mechanisms regulating hcv entry into hepatic cells are still unknown, several cell surface proteins have been identified as entry factors for this virus.
among these molecules, the tetraspanin cd <dig> is essential for hcv entry.
in addition, sphingomyelinase treatment, which also reduces hcv infection and cell surface expression of total cd <dig>  raised tem-associated cd <dig> levels.
we took advantage of these permissive cells expressing mcd <dig> and the previously described mt81/mt81w mabs to analyze the role of tem-associated cd <dig> in hcv infection.
