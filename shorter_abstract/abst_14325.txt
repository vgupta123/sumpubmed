in this report, we present several simplification and robotisation options for an assay of bacteria-induced biofilm formation by the freshwater diatom achnanthidium minutissimum.
our workflow lead to a substantial reduction of the measurement and data processing workload, while still reproducing previously obtained results in the a. minutissimum biofilm assay.
we also tested several proof-of-concept robotisation methods for pipetting, as well as for measuring the biofilm absorbance directly in the multi-well plates.
furthermore, we exemplify the implementation of an improved data processing workflow for this assay using the konstanz information miner , a free and open source data analysis environment.
