future research will focus on validating the effects of these candidate genes and their functional variants using genetic transformation and transferred dna insertion mutant screens, to verify that these genes engender resistance to blast disease in rice.
the genes, os12g <dig> and os12g <dig>  both described as kinase-like domain containing protein, were presumed to be required for the full function of this locus.
a subset of true associations would be weakly associated with outcome in any given gwas; therefore, large-scale replication is necessary to confirm our results.
in addition, we identified novel functional candidate genes, which might participate in the resistance regulation.
this work provides the basis of further study of the potential function of these candidate genes.
rice blast disease is one of the most serious and recurrent problems in rice-growing regions worldwide.
we extensively examined  <dig> rice blast strains and a further genome-wide association study based on genotyping  <dig>  million single nucleotide polymorphism variants across  <dig> diverse indica accessions.

the strongest signal  was located within the gene os11g <dig>  one of the rice pia-blast resistance gene.
in order to explore the potential mechanism underlying the blast resistance, we further examined a locus in chromosome  <dig>  which was associated with ch <dig> .
furthermore, we found some association on chromosome  <dig>  in which it has not been reported any loci associated with rice blast resistance.
our study identified the gene os11g <dig>  a disease resistance protein containing nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat domain, as the main candidate gene of pif.
most resistance genes were identified by linkage mapping using genetic populations.
