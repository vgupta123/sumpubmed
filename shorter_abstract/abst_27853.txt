as a test implementation their  secondary structure and the presence of disulfide bridges are used as constraints.
notwithstanding its importance, the problem has very seldom been tackled by constraint logic programming, a declarative programming paradigm suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
constraint logic programming techniques have been applied to the protein structure prediction problem on the face-centered cube lattice model.
even using a very simplified model, constraint logic programming on the face-centered cube lattice model allowed us to obtain acceptable results for a few small proteins.
the results obtained on small proteins show that constraint logic programming techniques can be employed for studying protein simplified models, which can be converted into realistic all atom models.
the advantage of constraint logic programming over other, much more explored, methodologies, resides in the rapid software prototyping, in the easy way of encoding heuristics, and in exploiting all the advances made in this research area, e.g.
the protein structure prediction problem can be cast in the form of an optimization problem.
results have been compared with a similar approach using a well-established technique as molecular dynamics.
the protein structure prediction problem is one of the most challenging problems in biological sciences.
in constraint propagation and its use for pruning the huge search space.
molecular dynamics techniques, endowed with the notion of constraint, have been also exploited.
