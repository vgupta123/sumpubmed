genetic diversity of citrus includes intrageneric hybrids, cultivars arising from cross-pollination and/or somatic mutations with particular biochemical compounds such as sugar, acids and secondary metabolite composition.
to facilitate interpretation, metabolites were represented as flow charts depicting biosynthetic pathways.
mandarins ‘fortune’ and ‘hernandina’ along with oranges showed higher aba contents and aba degradation products were present as glycosylated forms in oranges and certain mandarins.
the unbiased classification provided by hca was used for pls-da to find the potential variables  responsible for the classification.
all orange and grapefruit varieties showed high limonin contents and its glycosylated form, that was only absent in lemons.
