to find overrepresented gene ontologies, the gene lists obtained can be analysed further using a modified version of the genemerge program.
the genemerge analysis of the search results allows the user to identify statistically overrepresented gene ontology terms that might provide a clue on the function of the motifs and genes.
the comparative genomic analysis of a large number of orthologous promoter regions of the chordate and plant genes from the doop databases shows thousands of conserved motifs.
we have developed a new tool called doopsearch  for the analysis of the conserved motifs in the promoter regions of chordate or plant genes.
the doopsearch tool allows the users to search these motif collections or the promoter regions of doop with user supplied query sequences or any of the conserved motifs from the doop database.
we present here a comparative genomics based promoter analysis tool.
these can be either short promoter sequences or consensus sequences of known transcription factor binding sites.
we used the orthologous promoters of the doop database to extract thousands of conserved motifs from different taxonomic groups.
we offer both a command line and a web-based tool for searching in these motif collections using user specified queries.
most of these motifs differ from any known transcription factor binding site .
since conserved motifs from the doop databases are linked to genes, the result of such a search can give a list of genes that are potentially regulated by the same transcription factor.
our system is based on a unique collection of conserved promoter motifs characteristic of different taxonomic groups.
