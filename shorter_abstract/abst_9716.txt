the human genome carries a high load of proviral-like sequences, called human endogenous retroviruses , which are the genomic traces of ancient infections by active retroviruses.
altogether, the present study strongly suggests that some but not all envelope encoding sequences are bona fide genes.
moreover, the sequence conservation analysis of the orthologous genes that can be found in primates shows that three env genes have been maintained in a fully coding state throughout evolution including envw and envfrd.
it also provides new tools to elucidate the possible role of endogenous envelope proteins as susceptibility factors in a number of pathologies where hervs have been suspected to be involved.
these elements are in most cases defective, but open reading frames can still be found for the retroviral envelope gene, with sixteen such genes identified so far.
we further show – using an ex vivo fusion assay for each allelic form – that none of these snps impairs the fusogenic function.
several of them are conserved during primate evolution, having possibly been co-opted by their host for a physiological role.
