naturally occurring tetrahymena amicronucleates have multiple origins, arising from numerous species.
some amicronucleate species were clustered on the ssu phylogenetic tree and had longer branch lengths, indicating more ancient origin.
sixty percent originated from  <dig> named species or barcoded strains, including the model tetrahymena thermophila, while the remaining 40% represent  <dig> putative new species, eight of which have micronucleate counterparts and  <dig> of which are known only as amicronucleates.
as such, tetrahymena amicronucleates have the potential to be very old.
phylogenetic analysis showed that most amicronucleates belong to the “borealis” clade in which mating type is determined by gene rearrangement.
the inability of amicronucleates to mate may be the result of error in mating type gene rearrangement.
the apparent success of amicronucleate tetrahymena may be because macronuclear assortment and recombination allow them to avoid muller’s ratchet, incorporate beneficial mutations, and evolve independently of sex.

likely many more new species remain to be discovered.
a possible reason for their abundance is that the tetrahymena macronucleus does not accumulate mutations as proposed by muller’s ratchet.
shared haplotypes indicate that some are of contemporary origin, while phylogeny indicates that others may be millions of years old.
the exceptional tetrahymena has abandoned sex through loss of the micronucleus; its amicronucleates are abundant in nature where they reproduce by binary fission but never form conjugating pairs.
amicronucleates constituted 25% of tetrahymena-like wild isolates.
