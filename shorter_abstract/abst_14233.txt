ankplex achieved superior efficiency with ≥ <dig> near-native complexes in the  <dig> top-rankings for nine x-ray complexes compared to zdock, which only obtained six x-ray complexes.
computational analysis of protein-protein interaction provided the crucial information to increase the binding affinity without a change in basic conformation.
the dataset was composed of  <dig> and  <dig>  near-native and non-near-native poses, respectively, and it was used to generate eleven informative features.
a dataset of apks was generated from seven x-ray apks, which consisted of  <dig> internal domains, using the reliable docking tool zdock.
subsequently, a re-scoring rank was generated by ankplex using a combination of a decision tree algorithm and logistic regression.

the universal criteria for discriminating the near-native pose are not available since there are several classes of recognition protein.
several docking programs were used to predict the near-native poses of the protein-protein complex in  <dig> top-rankings.
our computational study could be useful for predicting the near-native poses of binding proteins and desired targets, especially for ankyrin-protein complexes.
currently, the explicit criteria for identifying the near-native pose of ankyrin-protein complexes  have not been reported yet.
in addition, feature analysis demonstrated that the van der waals feature was the dominant near-native pose out of the potential ankyrin-protein docking poses.
in this study, we established an ensemble computational model for discriminating the near-native docking pose of apks named “ankplex”.
the ankplex model achieved a success at predicting near-native docking poses and led to the discovery of informative characteristics that could further improve our understanding of the ankyrin-protein complex.
