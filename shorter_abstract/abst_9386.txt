we found evidence for pam depletion in streptococcus phages infecting hosts with crispr type i-c, in vibrio phages infecting hosts with crispr type i-e and in streptococcus thermopilus phages infecting hosts with type ii-a, known as crispr <dig>
here, we investigate whether pams are depleted in phage genomes due to selection pressure to escape recognition.
we use two different measures of motif underrepresentation that control for codon bias and the frequency of submotifs.
phages infecting all bacterial hosts were analyzed first, followed by a detailed analysis of phages infecting the genus streptococcus, where pams are best understood.
the system also requires protospacer associated motifs , short motifs close to the target sequence that are required for interference in crispr types i and ii.
since only known pams were investigated, the analysis is restricted to crispr types i-c and i-e and in streptococcus to types i-c and ii.
the observed motif depletion in phages with hosts having crispr can be attributed to selection rather than to mutational bias, as mutational bias should affect the phages of all hosts.
this observation implies that the crispr system has been efficient in the groups discussed here.
