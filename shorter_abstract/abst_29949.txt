up to  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> was produced from  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig> and a. niger Δgaac produced  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> from  <dig> g polygalacturonate l- <dig>  at yields of  <dig>  to  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate - <dig>  keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated to concentrations of  <dig> to  <dig> g l- <dig> intracellularly in both producing organisms.
this intracellular concentration was sustained throughout production in a. niger Δgaac, but decreased in t. reesei.
bioconversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was achieved with both a. niger Δgaac and t. reesei Δlga <dig>  although production  was better with a. niger than t. reesei.
a. niger was also able to produce keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from pectin or polygalacturonate demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneous hydrolysis and bioconversion.
the keto-deoxy sugars have been found to be useful precursors for producing further derivatives.
among these is the deoxy-keto acid derived from l-galactonic acid, keto-deoxy-l-galactonic acid or 3-deoxy-l-threo-hex-2-ulosonic acid.
keto-deoxy-l-galactonate  accumulated in the culture supernatant when trichoderma reesei Δlga <dig> and aspergillus niger Δgaac were grown in the presence of d-galacturonate.
keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated even if no metabolisable carbon source was present in the culture supernatant, but was enhanced when d-xylose was provided as a carbon and energy source.
although keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated intracellularly, concentrations above ~ <dig> g l- <dig> were exported to the culture supernatant.
lysis may have contributed to the release of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from t. reesei mycelia.
the d-galacturonic acid derived from plant pectin can be converted into a variety of other chemicals which have potential use as chelators, clarifiers, preservatives and plastic precursors.
