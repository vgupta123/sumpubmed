both social parasitism and fungiculture evolved twice in lasius, once in each major lineage, which opens up new opportunities for comparative analyses.
possible causes for previous problems with reconstructing the lasius phylogeny include use of other reconstruction techniques, possibly more prone to instabilities in some instances, and the inclusion of phylogenetically distorting characters.
one includes acanthomyops, austrolasius, chthonolasius, and lasius pallitarsis, which we confirm to represent a seventh subgenus, the other clade contains dendrolasius, and lasius sensu stricto.
the subgenus cautolasius, displaying neither social parasitism nor fungiculture, probably belongs to the second clade, but its phylogenetic position is not resolved at the cutoff values of node support we apply.
here we employed two mitochondrial genes , comprising  <dig>  bp, together with  <dig> morphological characters, to recover the phylogeny of lasius by bayesian and maximum parsimony inference after exploration of potential causes of phylogenetic distortion.
by establishing an updated phylogenetic framework, our study provides the basis for a later formal taxonomic revision of subgenera and for studying the evolution of various ecologically and sociobiologically relevant traits of lasius, although there is need for future studies to include nuclear genes and additional samples from the nearctic.
the repeated evolution of social parasitism has been established for other groups of ants, though not for temporary social parasitism as found in lasius.
ants of the genus lasius are ecologically important and an important system for evolutionary research.
we use the resulting framework to infer evolutionary pathways for social parasitism and fungiculture.
we recovered two well supported major lineages.
