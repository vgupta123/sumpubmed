four sets of residue features  used in different combinations together with three definitions of residue environment  have been analyzed in order to maximize the performance of the method.
protein binding site prediction by computational means can yield valuable information that complements and guides experimental approaches to determine the structure of protein complexes.
the integration of different forms information such as structural features, energy term, evolutionary conservation and crystallographic b-factors, improves the performance of binding site prediction.
here we present vorffip, a novel method for protein binding site prediction.
the method makes use of broad set of heterogeneous data and defined of residue environment, by means of voronoi diagrams that are integrated by a two-steps random forest ensemble classifier.
proteins interact through exposed residues that present differential physicochemical properties, and these can be exploited to identify protein interfaces.
including the information of neighbouring residues also improves the prediction of protein interfaces.
among the different approaches that can be used to define the environment of exposed residues, voronoi diagrams provide the most accurate description.
