the link between enzyme parameters and experimental outcome was demonstrated by showing that the sequenced portion of the genome was adaptable by selecting enzymes based on motif length, complexity, and methylation sensitivity.
quality of the data was demonstrated by identifying that the vast majority of reads from each enzyme aligned to restriction sites predicted in silico.
since many restriction sites are conserved across a species, the sequenced portion of the genome is highly consistent within a population.
custom, enzyme specific adaptors have been replaced with standard illumina adaptors compatible with blunt-end restriction enzymes.
this makes the gbs protocol highly suited for experiments that require surveying large numbers of markers within a population, such as those involving genetic mapping, breeding, and population genomics.

in the gbs protocol, genomic dna is fractionated via restriction digest, then reduced representation is achieved through size selection.
multiplexing is achieved through a dual barcoding system, and bead-based library preparation protocols allows for in-solution size selection and eliminates the need for columns and gels.
a panel of eight restriction enzymes was selected for testing on b <dig> maize and nipponbare rice genomic dna.
this technology is readily adaptable to different genomes, highly amenable to multiplexing and compatible with over forty commercially available restriction enzymes.
the utility of the new gbs protocol was demonstrated by correctly mapping several in a maize f <dig> population resulting from a b <dig> × country gentleman test cross.
