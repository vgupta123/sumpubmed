together, these data indicate that maladaptive combinations of oviposition traits in hybrids contribute to extrinsic postzygotic isolation between n. lecontei and n. pinetum, suggesting that oviposition traits may be an important driver of divergence in phytophagous insects.
compared to n. lecontei, n. pinetum females preferred p. strobus more strongly, had smaller ovipositors, and laid fewer eggs per needle.
to test this hypothesis, we assayed ovipositor morphology, oviposition behavior, and host-dependent oviposition success in both species and in f <dig> and backcross females.
hybrid females that had pinetum-like host preference  and lecontei-like oviposition traits  fared especially poorly.
although empirical data indicate that ecological speciation is prevalent in nature, the relative importance of different forms of reproductive isolation and the traits generating reproductive isolation remain unclear.
additionally, we observed host- and trait-dependent reductions in oviposition success in f <dig> and backcross females.
to address these questions, we examined a pair of ecologically divergent pine-sawfly species: while neodiprion pinetum specializes on a thin-needled pine , n. lecontei utilizes thicker-needled pines.
we hypothesized that extrinsic postzygotic isolation is generated by oviposition traits.
