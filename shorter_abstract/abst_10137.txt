the reduction of adipogenesis by mechanical strain was loading-magnitude dependent: loading with 2% strain only resulted in a partial inhibition, and loading with  <dig> % strain could not inhibit adipogenesis in adscs.
pre-strain significantly reduced the number of oil droplets and the expression of adipogenic marker genes in adult and old adscs.
although the number of osteogenic colonies with calcium deposition was increased in adscs subjected to pre-strain, it resulted from an increase in colony number rather than from an increase in osteogenic potential after strain.
in this report, we used stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue  of young , adult , and old  mice to test the hypothesis that mechanical loading modifies aging-related changes in the self-renewal and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of these cells.
we show that aging significantly reduced the proliferation and increased the adipogenesis of adscs, while the osteogenic potential is not significantly reduced by aging.
simultaneously subjecting adscs to mechanical loading and adipogenic induction resulted in a stronger inhibition of adipogenesis than that caused by pre-strain.
previous studies on the effects of aging in human and mouse mesenchymal stem cells suggest that a decline in the number and differentiation potential of stem cells may contribute to aging and aging-related diseases.
