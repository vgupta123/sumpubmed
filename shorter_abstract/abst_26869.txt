the purposes of this study were to characterize the proportion of transcribed dna sequences containing simple sequence repeats  by length and motif for wheat, barley and rice and to determine in-silico rice genome locations for primer sets developed for wheat and barley expressed sequence tags.
genomic microsatellites were found to be primarily located in gene-rich regions of the rice genome.
higher density comparative maps using pcr-based anchor markers are necessary to better estimate the conservation of colinearity among cereal genomes.
the proportions of ssr types  and motifs varied with the length of the ssrs within and among the three species, with trinucleotide ssrs being the most frequent.
trinucleotide ssrs were the most common type in each of the species; however, the relative proportions of ssr types and motifs differed among rice, wheat, and barley.
distributions of genomic microsatellites , est-derived microsatellites , and transcribed regions in the contiguous sequence of rice chromosome  <dig> were highly correlated.
microsatellite markers derived from the use of non-redundant est-ssrs are an economic and efficient alternative to rflp for comparative mapping in cereals.
earlier comparative maps between the genomes of rice , barley  and wheat  were linkage maps based on cdna-rflp markers.
the low number of polymorphic rflp markers has limited the development of dense genetic maps in wheat and the number of available anchor points in comparative maps.
