while a substantial number of tools for mapping and assembling rep-seq data were published recently, the field still lacks an intuitive and flexible tool that can be used by researchers with little or no computational background for in-depth analysis of immune repertoire profiles.
we also demonstrate the utility of vdjviz in detection of critical rep-seq biases such as artificial repertoire diversity and cross-sample contamination.
here we report vdjviz, a web tool that can be used to browse, analyze and perform quality control of rep-seq results generated by various pre-processing software.
the repertoire of t- and b-cell receptor sequences encodes the antigen specificity of adaptive immunity system, determines its present state and guides its ability to mount effective response against encountered antigens in future.
vdjviz is a versatile and lightweight tool that can be easily employed by biologists, immunologists and immunogeneticists for routine analysis and quality control of rep-seq data.
