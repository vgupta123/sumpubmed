the effects of off-target hybridization on expression correlation coefficients can be substantial, and can be alleviated by more accurate mapping between microarray reporters and the target transcriptome.
we demonstrate a positive relation between off-target reporter alignment strength and expression correlation in data from oligonucleotide genechips.
we recommend attention to the mapping for any microarray analysis of gene expression patterns.
