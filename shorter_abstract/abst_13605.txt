our results indicate that acute pressure applied to the sciatic nerve exerts a rapid inhibitory effect on the wdr response to both noxious and innocuous stimuli.
our results may partially explain the rapid analgesic effect of acute sciatic nerve pressure noted in clinical studies, and also suggest a new model for the study of pain.
in the present study, we examined the effect of a 2-min application of sciatic nerve pressure on wdr neuronal activity in anesthetized male spragueâ€“dawley rats.
the responses of wdr neurons to three mechanical stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field were recorded before, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min after cessation of the 2-min pressure application on the sciatic nerve.
maximal attenuation of the wdr response to pinching and pressure was noted  <dig> min after release of the 2-min pressure on the sciatic nerve.
dorsal horn wdr neurons were identified on the basis of characteristic responses to mechanical stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field.
acute pressure on the sciatic nerve has recently been reported to provide rapid short-term relief of pain in patients with various pathologies.
acute pressure was applied for  <dig> min to the sciatic nerve using a small vascular clip.
two-min pressure applied to the sciatic nerve caused rapid attenuation of the wdr response to pinching, pressure and brushing stimuli applied to the cutaneous receptive field.
