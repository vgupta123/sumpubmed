current large-scale genomic projects provide high throughput genomic data in a large number of well-characterized tumor samples.
thus, the algorithm  seeks focal copy number alterations and recurrent point mutations within high throughput data from large panels of tumor samples.
we define a bayesian approach designed to identify candidate cancer genes by integrating copy number and point mutation information.
we apply mutcomfocal to diffuse large b-cell lymphoma  data from four different high throughput studies, totaling  <dig> samples assessed for copy number alterations by single nucleotide polymorphism  array analysis and  <dig> samples assayed for protein changing point mutations by whole exome/whole transcriptome sequencing.
most tumors are the result of accumulated genomic alterations in somatic cells.
the application of mutcomfocal to large-scale cancer data provides the opportunity to pinpoint the key functional genomic alterations in tumors.
in addition to recapitulating known alterations, mutcomfocal identifies arid1b, robo <dig> and mrs <dig> as candidate tumor suppressors and klhl <dig>  il <dig> and lrp <dig> as putative oncogenes in dlbcl.
we present a bayesian approach for the identification of candidate cancer genes by integrating data collected in large number of cancer patients, across different studies.
point mutations, on the other hand, provide exquisite information about amino acid changes that could be implicated in the oncogenic process.
