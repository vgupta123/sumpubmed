yet experimental confirmation is difficult since mirna expression is often specific to particular tissues and developmental stages.
four sage tags detected in human embryonic stem cells specifically match a cluster of four human mirnas  known to be expressed in embryonic stem cells.
the observation that some orphan longsage tags uniquely match mirna precursors provides information about the expression of some known and predicted mirnas.
longsage data also suggest the existence of a mouse homolog of human and rat mir- <dig>
micrornas  have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression.
