our identification of embryo-lethal mutant alleles in the arabidopsis elongation factor g indicates that sco <dig> is essential for plant growth, consistent with its predicted role in chloroplast protein translation.
we have identified arabidopsis thaliana mutants in a gene that encodes a plastid-targeted elongation factor g  that is essential for plastid development during embryogenesis since two t-dna insertion mutations in the coding sequence  result in an embryo-lethal phenotype.
the developmental stage-specific phenotype of the conditional-lethal sco <dig> alleles reveals differences in chloroplast formation during seedling germination compared to chloroplast differentiation in cells derived from the shoot apical meristem.
seedlings of these alleles exhibit cotyledon and hypocotyl albinism due to improper chloroplast development, and normally die shortly after germination.
proper development of plastids in embryo and seedling tissues is critical for plant development.
however, when germinated on media supplemented with sucrose, the mutant plants can produce photosynthetically-active green leaves from the apical meristem.
