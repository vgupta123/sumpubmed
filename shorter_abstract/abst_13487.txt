no significant difference in intensity of gst-μ staining was observed between these two groups.
glutathione s-transferases  play an important role in metabolizing anti-epileptic drugs  in liver.
fifty percent  of the control patients and 66% of the epileptic patients were gst-π positive.
the grading of epileptic patients was significantly higher than that of control patients .
sixty three percent  of control and 53% of intractible epileptic specimens showed gst-μ immunoreactivity.
using clinical cortex specimen from  <dig> intractable epileptic subjects and  <dig> non-epileptic controls, the present study investigated the correlation between gsts and intractable epilepsy.
high levels of gst-π in endothelial cells and glial cells/astrocyte correlate to medical intractable epilepsy, suggesting that gst-π contributes to resistance to aed treatment.
gst-π expression was found in endothelial cells and glial cells/astrocytes.
