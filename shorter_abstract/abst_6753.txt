but what is the origin of the peculiar frequency multiples k/ <dig> which were reported for a tiny section of chromosome  <dig> in p. falciparum?
we applied the binary indicator power spectrum to all chromosomes of p. falciparum, and found that the frequency overtones k/ <dig> are present only in non-coding sections.
however, in the case of p. falciparum the frequency aliases are particularly strong and can mask the 1/ <dig> frequency which is used for gene detecting.
we did not find such frequency overtones in any other related genomes.
furthermore, the frequency overtones were identified as artifacts of the way the genome is encoded into a numerical sequence, that is, they are frequency aliases.
in view of these results, we revisited early applications of this technique to proteins where frequency overtones were reported.
and how should we interpret fractional periodicities in genomes?
fourier transforms and their associated power spectra are used for detecting periodicities and protein-coding genes and is generally regarded as a well established technique.
some authors hinted recently at the possibility of mapping artifacts and frequency aliases in power spectra.
this shows that albeit being a well known technique, with a long history of application in proteins, few researchers seem to be aware of the problems represented by frequency aliases.
