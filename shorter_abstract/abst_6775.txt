we designed the software pi with the novel and effective algorithms which made a good use of intensity property of the spectrum.
in practice, however, an experimental spectrum is usually not similar to its sequest -predicted theoretical one, and as a result, incorrect identifications are often generated.
experiments have shown that pi was able to validate and improve the results of sequest to a more satisfactory degree.
it utilizes a simplified fragmentation model that assigns a fixed and identical intensity for all major ions and fixed and lower intensity for their neutral losses.
here, we designed the software pi of novel and exquisite algorithms that make a good use of intensity property of a spectrum.
the popular sequest algorithm relies on the cross-correlation between the experimental mass spectrum and the theoretical spectrum of a peptide.
