furthermore, the function of genes seems to have an important role in the evolution of these lengths.
these results indicate that genome architecture has a significant role in regulating gene expression, and in shaping the characteristics and functionality of proteins.
in this work we perform the first large scale analysis of the length distribution of untranslated regions  in the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
notably, genes that are related to rna metabolism tend to have shorter untranslated regions and thus tend to be closer to their neighbouring genes while genes coding for cell wall proteins tend to be isolated in the genome.
our analysis shows that the length of each open reading frame  and that of its associated regulatory and untranslated regions significantly correlate with each other.
the distribution of genes along chromosomes and the length of intragenic regions are basic genomic features known to play a major role in the regulation of gene transcription and translation.
moreover, significant correlations with other features related to gene expression and evolution  were observed.
