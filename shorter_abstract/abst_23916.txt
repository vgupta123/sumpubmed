the one turn Î±-helix chain  of the sars covmpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex.
sars coronavirus main proteinase  is an important enzyme for the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus.
md simulations were carried out on the sars covmpro-octapeptide complex.
the active site region of sars covmpro is divided into  <dig> subsites.
understanding the binding mode of sars covmpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design.
the s <dig> subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of glu <dig>  during md simulations, glu <dig> of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the p3lys of the octapeptide.
the purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the sars covmpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the s <dig> subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics  simulation approach.
the hypothesis proposed that glu <dig> of sars covmpro is an important residue in the s <dig> subsite and is involved in binding with p3lys of the octapeptide.
