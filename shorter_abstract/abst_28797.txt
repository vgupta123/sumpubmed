initially, we extracted five evolutionarily conserved mirnas  among five diverse bilaterian animals.
as a result, we extracted  <dig> orthologous mirna/target-gene pairs that were conserved among at least four diverse bilaterian animals; the prediction set showed prominent enrichment of orthologous mirna/target-gene pairs that were verified experimentally.
in conclusion, our study identified potentially important mirna-target pairs that were evolutionarily conserved throughout diverse bilaterian animals and that may provide new insights into early-stage mirna functions.
the downregulation of all six candidate pairs suggests that orthologous information contributed to the elucidation of the primordial set of genes that has been regulated by mirnas; it was also an efficient tool for the elimination of false positives from the predicted candidates.
we used a reporter gene assay to experimentally verify the downregulation of six candidate pairs  in hela cells.
approximately 84% of the target genes were regulated by three mirnas  and their function was classified mainly into the following categories: development, muscle formation, cell adhesion, and gene regulation.
we sought to elucidate a set of conserved mirna/target-gene pairs and to analyse the mechanism underlying mirna-mediated gene regulation in the early stage of bilaterian evolution.
subsequently, we designed a procedure to predict evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs by introducing orthologous gene information.
the application of our new method enables the identification of  <dig> mirna/target-gene pairs that were expected to have been regulated from the era of the common bilaterian ancestor.
recent studies have revealed that many mirnas are evolutionarily conserved; however, the evolution of their target genes has yet to be systematically characterized.
