as part of our ongoing efforts to sequence the pumpkin genome, high-density genetic map is essential for anchoring and orienting the assembled scaffolds.
in addition, a saturated genetic map can facilitate quantitative trait locus  mapping.
using the snps we identified, a high-density genetic map containing  <dig> bin-markers was constructed, spanning a total genetic distance of  <dig> .8 cm across the  <dig> linkage groups of c. maxima with a mean marker density of  <dig>  cm.
furthermore, the high-density genetic map was used to identify genomic regions highly associated with an important agronomic trait, dwarf vine.
a high-density pumpkin genetic map was constructed, which was used to successfully anchor and orient the assembled genome scaffolds, and to identify qtls highly associated with pumpkin vine length.

however, very few genomic and genetic resources are available for this species.
using this map we were able to anchor  <dig> assembled scaffolds that covered about  <dig>  mb  of the  <dig>  mb assembled pumpkin genome, of which  <dig>  were oriented.
within qcmb <dig>  one gene, cma_ <dig>  encoding the gibberellin  20-oxidase in the ga biosynthesis pathway, had a 1249-bp deletion in its promoter in bush type lines, and its expression level was significantly increased during the vine growth and higher in vine type lines than bush type lines, supporting cma_ <dig> as a possible candidate gene controlling vine growth in pumpkin.
