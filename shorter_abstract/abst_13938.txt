even if mascot also correctly includes in the candidates list the "true" proteins nine times over ten, it provides longer candidate lists, therefore increasing the number of false positives when the molecular weight of the proteins in the sample is approximatively known .
however, the scoring methods and mainly the statistical evaluation of the results can be significantly improved.
to this aim, several algorithms and software tools have been proposed.
results obtained by mspi on a dataset of  <dig> protein samples were compared with those achieved using two other software tools, i.e.
piums implements one of the scoring methods available in mspi, while mascot is one of the most frequently used software tools in the protein identification field.
mspi scripts are available for downloading on the web site .
one of them, called peptide mass fingerprinting , combines mass spectrometry  data with searching strategies in a suitable database of known protein to provide a list of candidate proteins ranked by a score.
in fact, on the considered dataset, mspi includes in its candidate proteins list, the "true" proteins nine times over ten, whereas piums includes in its list the "true" proteins only four time over ten.
in this work, a perl procedure for protein identification by pmf, called mspi , is presented.
moreover, mspi includes a statistical method to assign to each candidate protein, in addition to the scoring value, a p-value.
protein identification can be achieved by analyzing the mass spectrum of a protein sample through different approaches.
mspi implements a strategy to remove the contaminant masses present in the acquired spectra.
one of the topics of major interest in proteomics is protein identification.
