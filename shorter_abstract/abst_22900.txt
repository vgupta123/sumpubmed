this technique comprises a one-step procedure with a purification level in the order of several thousand-fold, adaptable for various proteins, differentiated in their size, shape, charge, and other properties.
here we propose a new method of t <dig> phage purification by affinity chromatography after its modification with affinity tags  by in vivo phage display.
affinity tags can be successfully incorporated into the t <dig> phage capsid by the in vivo phage display technique and they strongly elevate bacteriophage affinity to a specific resin.
t <dig> is a large, icosahedral phage that may serve as an efficient display platform for foreign peptides or proteins.
the phage was propagated in bacteria expressing fusions of the phage protein hoc with affinity tags from bacterial plasmids, independently from the phage expression system.
elution profiles of phages modified with the specific affinity motifs  document their binding to the affinity resins and effective elution with standard competitive agents.
affinity chromatography is one of the most efficient protein purification strategies.
the aim of this work was to verify the possibility of applying affinity chromatography in bacteriophage purification, with the perspective of therapeutic purposes.
affinity chromatography can be considered as a new phage purification method, appropriate for further investigations and development.
as any permanent introduction of extraneous dna into a phage genome is strongly unfavourable for medical purposes, integration of foreign motifs with the phage genome was not applied.
the possibility of proteolytic release was designed at the stage of expression vector construction.
gst-modified bacteriophages were also effectively released from glutathione sepharose by proteolytic cleavage.
