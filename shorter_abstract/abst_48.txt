the meca gene, class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons were detected by pcr.
integrase positive strains were further analysed for the presence of resistance gene cassettes using specific primers and were sequenced.
twelve distinct cassette arrays were found, containing genes encoding resistance to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, streptothricin, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol,a putative glucose dehydrogenase precursor and a protein with unknown function.
among 139 s.aureus isolates,  <dig>  and  <dig>  strains were considered as multidrug resistant and meca positive, respectively.
gene cassette arrays aadb, aada <dig> and dhfra1-sat2-aada <dig> were common in s.aureus isolates.
this is the first study to report carriage of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons and associated gene cassettes among in s.aureus isolates from iran.
the isolates were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
we detected a completely new gene cassettes which contained aadb, oxa <dig>  aaca <dig>  orfd-aaca4-catb <dig>  aadb-catb <dig>  orfd-aaca <dig> and aadb-aada1-cmla <dig> of class  <dig> and dhfra1-sat2-aada <dig>  dhfra <dig>  dhfra1-sat <dig> of class  <dig> integrons.

to investigate antibiotic resistance, the occurrence and distribution of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons in multidrug- resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospitals in tehran, iran.
class  <dig> integrons and internal variable regions were found in  <dig>  %  and 97 %  and class  <dig> integrons and variable regions also in  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of s.aureus clinical isolates, respectively.
