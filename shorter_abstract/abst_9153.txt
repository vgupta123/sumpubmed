loss of k <dig> increases the functional availability of lrp <dig> to erα and promotes the proliferation of erα-positive breast tumor cells.
however, the regulation of the functional availability of this coactivator protein is not yet clear.
lrp <dig> is both an erα target gene and an erα coactivator, and plays a crucial role in erα activation and proliferation of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.
coip failed to detect any interaction between k <dig> and erα, but ectopic expression of k <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells significantly blunted the association of lrp <dig> with erα, attenuated erα-activated reporter gene activity, and decreased estrogen-stimulated target gene expression by inhibiting erα recruitment to dna.
k <dig> can effectively associate with and sequester lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm, thus attenuating the final output of erα-mediated signaling and estrogen-stimulated cell cycle progression of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.
oncogenesis in breast cancer is often associated with excess estrogen receptor α activation and overexpression of its coactivators.
furthermore, brdu incorporation assays revealed that k <dig> overexpression blunted the estrogen-stimulated increase of s-phase entry of mcf- <dig> cells.
immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the amount of cytoplasmic lrp <dig> was markedly increased in cells overexpressing k <dig> whereas nuclear levels were depressed.
yeast two-hybrid screening, gst pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation  identified the cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein keratin  <dig>  as a novel lrp16-interacting protein.
by contrast, knockdown of k <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells significantly increased erα-mediated signaling and promoted cell cycle progression.
