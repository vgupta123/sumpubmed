in a c3h/hej mouse model of intraperitoneal vaccination, the fusion protein elicited significant and robust ha1-2-specific serum igg titers, maintaining high levels for at least 3 months in the vaccinated animals, and induced similar levels of ha1-2-specific igg <dig> and igg2a that were detectable 12 days after the third immunization.
the resulting fusion protein, ha1-2-flic, was efficiently expressed in an escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system, and western blotting and tlr5-stimulating activity analysis confirmed that the ha1-2-flic moiety could be faithfully refolded to take on the native ha and flic conformations.
in this study, we used overlap-pcr to generate an h7n <dig> influenza recombinant subunit vaccine that fused the globular head domain  of the protective hemagglutinin  antigen with the potent tlr <dig> ligand, salmonella typhimurium flagellin .
we conclude that immunization with ha1-2-flic induces potent ha1-2-specific responses, offering significant promise for the development of a successful recombinant subunit vaccine for avian influenza a .
ha1-2-flic was also found to be capable of triggering the production of neutralizing antibodies, as assessed by measuring hemagglutination inhibition titers.
a novel influenza virus, subtype h7n <dig>  circulated through china in 2013– <dig>  its higher rates of human infection in a wide range of locations within china and the associated increased likelihood of human-to-human transmission have caused global concern.
