it may be possible to improve epitope prediction methods through training on datasets which include only immune epitopes and through utilizing more features characterizing epitopes, for example, the evolutionary conservation score.
as the number of structures of antibody-protein complexes grows, further interest in prediction methods using 3d structure is anticipated.
two b-cell epitope benchmark datasets inferred from the 3d structures of antibody-protein complexes were defined.
the second is a dataset of  <dig> structures of antibody-protein complexes containing different structural epitopes.
the first is a dataset of  <dig> representative 3d structures of protein antigens with inferred structural epitopes.
this work aims to establish a benchmark for 3d structure-based epitope prediction methods.
using these experimental data computational methods exist for b-cell epitope prediction.
the benchmark datasets are included as a supplement to this paper.
the values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the evaluated methods were about  <dig>  for consurf, discotope, and ppi-pred methods and above  <dig>  but not exceeding  <dig>  for protein-protein docking methods when the best of the top ten models for the bound docking were considered; the remaining methods performed close to random.
