this study presents one of the first within-family comparisons of mt genome diversity, and is the first to report complete mt genomes for the family hydrodictyaceae .
sequenced mt genomes from the chlorophycean orders volvocales and sphaeropleales exhibit considerable variation in size, content, and structure, even among closely related genera.
however, sampling of mt genomes on a within-family scale is still poor and the sparsity of information precludes a thorough understanding of genome evolution in the green algae.
four complete mt genomes representing three taxa and four phylogenetic groups, stauridium tetras, pseudopediastrum boryanum, and pediastrum duplex, range in size from  <dig>  to  <dig> Â bp.
the size variability is primarily due to intergenic region expansion, and intron content is generally low compared with other mt genomes of sphaeropleales.
<dig>  phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> protein-coding mitochondrial genes spanning the sphaeropleales was performed.
the variability in gene organization and architecture of green algal mitochondrial genomes is only recently being studied on a finer taxonomic scale.
genomic dna of representative taxa were sequenced on an illumina hiseq <dig> to produce 2x <dig> bp paired reads, and mitochondrial genomes were assembled and annotated using geneious v. <dig> .
