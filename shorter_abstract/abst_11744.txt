in addition, a significant number of other nmr-missing genes enriched in several cancer-related pathways have been known to be related to a variety of cancers, implying that many of them may be also related to tumorigenesis in mammals.
finally, investigation of sequence variations among orthologous proteins between rat and nmr revealed that significant fragment insertions/deletions within important functional domains were present in some nmr proteins, which might lead to expressional and/or functional changes of these genes in different species.

these genes were significantly enriched in two rat cancer pathways, "pathway in cancer" and "bladder cancer".
the expanded and contracted numbers of protein families in nmr were also analyzed when compared to rat.
seven cancer-related protein families appeared to be significantly expanded, whereas several receptor families were found to be contracted in nmr.
the naked mole rats  are small-sized underground rodents with plenty of unusual traits.
furthermore, they are resistant to both congenital and experimentally induced cancer genesis.
their life expectancy can be up to thirty years, more than seven times longer than laboratory rat.
