the cgs method may be an improvement over existing surrogate methods to detect genes of foreign origin.
the ability of octamer frequency comparisons to detect genes artificially seeded in cyanobacterial genomes was markedly increased by using as a training set those genes that are highly conserved over all bacteria.
the presence of high frequency octamers and the gc content of the contaminating genes were important considerations.
using a subset of octamer frequencies in such tests also increased effectiveness, but this depended on the specific target genome and the source of the contaminating genes.
a method comprising best practices from these tests was devised, the core gene similarity  method, and it performed better than simple octamer frequency analysis, codon bias, or gc contrasts in detecting seeded genes or naturally occurring transposons.
however, different compositional methods produce different predictions, and the effectiveness of any method is not well established.
from a comparison of predictions with phylogenetic trees, it appears that the effectiveness of the method is confined to horizontal transfer events that have occurred recently in evolutionary time.
