due to their generality, we believe that they can be used to coarse grain and identify hierarchical organization in a broad range of other biological systems and processes, such as protein interaction networks, genetic regulatory networks and food webs.
ideally, one would instead like to analyze the substitution process in terms of raw dynamics, independently of underlying system specifics.
in this paper we propose a method for doing this by identifying groups of codons and amino acids such that these groups imply closed dynamics.
we have applied the techniques on an empirically derived markov model of the codon substitution process that is provided in the literature.
without system specific knowledge of the substitution process, the techniques manage to "blindly" identify multiple levels of dynamics; from amino acid substitutions  to higher order dynamics on the level of amino acid groups.
the results demonstrate the applicability of the techniques.
we hypothesize that the acquired groups reflect earlier versions of the genetic code.
