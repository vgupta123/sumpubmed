interactive browsing of arbitrary sections through large biomedical-image volumes is made possible by use of an extended internet protocol and efficient server-based image tiling.
this is aggravated when users need to access tens or hundreds of such images from an archive.
the tools open the possibility of enabling fast access to large image archives without the requirement of whole image download and client computers with very large memory configurations.
the standard internet imaging protocol  has been extended to enable arbitrary 2d sectioning of 3d data as well a multi-layered images and indexed overlays.
here we solve the problem for 2d section views through archive data delivering compressed tiled images enabling users to browse through very-large volume data in the context of a standard web-browser.
we have tested the server software on a low-cost linux-based server for image volumes up to 135gb and  <dig> simultaneous users.
the extended protocol is termed iip3d and we have implemented a matching server to deliver the protocol and a series of ajax/javascript client codes that will run in an internet browser.
