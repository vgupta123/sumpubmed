the reference proteins detected by our server will lend insight into proteins of unknown function and provide extensive information to develop in-depth understanding of uncharacterized proteins.
instead of such error-prone automatic annotations, functional interpretation should rely on annotations of ‘reference proteins’ that have been experimentally characterized or manually curated.
the seq2ref server uses blast to detect proteins homologous to a query sequence and identifies the reference proteins among them.
seq2ref then reports publications with experimental characterizations of the identified reference proteins that might be relevant to the query.
furthermore, a plurality-based rating system is developed to evaluate the homologous relationships and rank the reference proteins by their relevance to the query.
however, experimentally characterized proteins only constitute a small portion of the database, such that the majority of sequences have been annotated by computational approaches.
