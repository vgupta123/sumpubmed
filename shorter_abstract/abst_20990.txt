expression of the key developmental genes brachyury, chordin and forkhead was investigated, allowing comparison to that of their orthologs in acropora, nematostella and bilaterians and demonstrating that even within the anthozoa there are significant differences in expression patterns.
illumina sequencing of mixed age embryos was carried out, resulting in embryonic transcriptomes consisting of  <dig> contigs for c.echinata  and  <dig> contigs for f.lizardensis .
embryonic transcriptomes were assembled for the brain coral favia lizardensis and the solitary coral ctenactis echinata.
the present paper describes the embryonic development of two previously uncharacterized robust corals, favia lizardensis  and ctenactis echinata  and compares it to that of the previously characterized complex coral, acropora millepora, both morphologically and in terms of the expression of a set of key developmental genes.
the expression of brachyury and forkhead was consistent with that previously reported for acropora and allowed us to confirm that the pseudo-blastopore sometimes seen in robust corals such as favia spp.
in situ hybridization was used to examine the expression of the developmentally important genes brachyury, chordin and forkhead.
