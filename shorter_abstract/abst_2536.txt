using promoter sequences from human genes is a useful approach when studying gene expression in species with limited or non-existing genomic sequence.
gene expression is in part regulated by sequences in promoters that bind transcription factors.
a set of common motifs were discovered in these promoters.
however, the most common motifs could be detected in both sets.
an independent analysis of the equivalent bovine genomic sequences was also done, this gave less detailed results than the human analysis due to both the quality of orthologue prediction and assembly in promoter regions.
as the bovine genome becomes better annotated it can in turn serve as the reference genome for other agriculturally important ruminants, such as sheep, goat and deer.
however, for agriculturally important animals the genomic sequence is often incomplete.
the more complete human genome may be able to be used for this prediction by taking advantage of the expected evolutionary conservation in tfbss between the species.
