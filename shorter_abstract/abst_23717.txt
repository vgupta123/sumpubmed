the "pairwise repeat homology diagram" visualizes sequence repeats detected by a profile hmm in a pair of sequences and highlights their homology relations inferred by a phylogenetic tree.
although pairwise repeat homology diagrams do not carry all the information provided by the phylogenetic tree, they allow a rapid and intuitive assessment of repeat evolution.
we have developed a novel rapid visual approach to study repeat evolution, that takes into account the exact repeat position in a sequence.
the method is implemented in a perl script  available for downloading at  and is also accessible as an online tool at .
this method can be particularly useful in cases of large datasets , as the command line interface makes it possible to automate the generation of pairwise repeat homology diagrams with the aid of scripts.
phylogenetic reconstruction is the method of choice to study the evolution of gene families and also sequence repeats in the light of these models.
the models developed to characterize the evolution of multigene families  have also been applied on the level of sequence repeats inside a gene/protein.
we believe, that t2prhd is a helpful tool with which to study the pattern of repeat evolution.
as the locus represents positional information, it is straightforward that in the case of the repeats the exact position in the sequence should be used, as the simple numbering according to repeat order can be misleading.
