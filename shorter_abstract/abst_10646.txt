the aim of this in-vitro study was to develop octenidine-dihydrochloride  coated polymer tracheotomy tubes and investigate any effects on staphylococcus  aureus and pseudomonas  aeruginosa colonization.
contamination with p. aeruginosa: before reprocessing, oct coated tubes were colonized with  <dig> cfu/ml and uncoated tubes with  <dig> cfu/ml .
oct coating initially inhibits s. aureus and p. aeruginosa colonisation on tracheotomy tubes.
the surface of polymeric tracheotomy tubes is a favourable environment for biofilm formation and therefore represents a potential risk factor for the development of pneumonia after tracheotomy.
after reprocessing, no significant differences were observed.
this effect, however, vanishes quickly after reprocessing of the tubes due to poor adhesive properties of the antimicrobial compound.
contamination with s. aureus: before any reprocessing, oct coated tracheotomy tubes were colonized with  <dig> cfu/ml and uncoated tracheotomy tubes with  <dig> cfu/ml .
despite the known antimicrobial effect of oct, its use for antimicrobial coating of tracheotomy tubes is limited unless methods are developed to allow sustained attachment to the tube.
