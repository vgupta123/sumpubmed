we present a black widow venom specific exome that uncovers a trove of diverse toxins and associated proteins, suggesting a dynamic evolutionary history.
this justifies a reevaluation of the functional activities of black widow venom in light of its emerging complexity.
we combined multi-tissue rna-seq with mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses to determine venom gland specific transcripts and venom proteins from the western black widow spider  and investigated their evolution.
we estimated expression of  <dig>  l. hesperus transcripts in venom glands relative to silk and cephalothorax tissues.
we identified  <dig> venom gland specific transcripts , many of which blast and go term analyses indicate may function as toxins or their delivery agents.
we discovered ≥  <dig> divergent latrotoxin paralogs expressed in l. hesperus venom glands, significantly increasing this biomedically important family.
phylogenetic analyses showed venom gland specific gene family expansions and shifts in tissue expression.
quantitative expression analyses comparing multiple tissues are necessary to identify venom gland specific transcripts.
next-generation transcriptomics and proteomics provide unparalleled, but underexploited, capabilities for venom characterization.
~38% of vsts had blast hits, including latrotoxins, inhibitor cystine knot toxins, crisps, hyaluronidases, chitinase, and proteases, and 59% of vsts had predicted protein domains.
mass spectrometry of l. hesperus venom identified  <dig> proteins from vsts,  <dig> of which blast to toxins.
latrotoxins are venom toxins that cause massive neurotransmitter release from vertebrate or invertebrate neurons.
