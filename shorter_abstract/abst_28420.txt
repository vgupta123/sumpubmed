we discuss these findings in relation to the motion dazzle hypothesis and how capture rates may be affected more generally by pattern type.
we show that key factors in making capture easier are a lack of average background luminance matching and having trackable ‘features’ on the target body.
we also show differences in capture attempt rates between different target types, but we find no differences in learning rates between target types.
several target types, including background sampled targets and targets with a ‘spot’ on were significantly easier to capture than striped targets.
we conclude that striped targets are effective in preventing capture, but are not uniquely difficult to catch, with luminance matched grey targets also showing a similar capture rate.
stripes and other high contrast patterns found on animals have been hypothesised to cause “motion dazzle”, a type of defensive coloration that operates when in motion, causing predators to misjudge the speed and direction of object movement.
