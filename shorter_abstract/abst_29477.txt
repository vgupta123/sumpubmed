the support vector machine  algorithm was used for model development, and stratified ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of each classifier.
the best results were obtained using the radial basis function kernel.
the svm method achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % on an independent test set.
at present however, there are only three major classes of drugs for treating human nematode infections.
using the model developed above, we were able to indentify novel compounds with potential anthelmintic activity.
in this study, we successfully present the svm approach for predicting compounds active against parasitic nematodes which suggests the effectiveness of computational approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery.
although, the accuracy obtained is lower than the previously reported in a similar study but we believe that our model is more robust because we intentionally employed stringent criteria to select inactive dataset thus making it difficult for the model to classify compounds.
infections due to parasitic nematodes are common causes of morbidity and fatality around the world especially in developing nations.
in this study we propose to build robust machine learning model to classify and screen compounds active against parasitic nematodes.
a set of compounds active against parasitic nematodes were collated from various literature sources including pubchem while the inactive set was derived from drugbank database.
the method presents an alternative approach to the existing traditional methods and may be useful for predicting hitherto novel anthelmintic compounds.
