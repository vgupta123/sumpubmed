despite the limitations of whole genome analytical methods, it is tempting to speculate that mobile genetic elements might have been a driving force behind the compositional bias of the p. falciparum genome.
whole genome analysis was performed using bioinformatic methods.
forty potential protein encoding sequences with features of transposable elements were identified in p. vivax, eight in p. y. yoelii and only six in p. falciparum.
mobile genetic elements have a considerable impact on genome evolution but a thorough investigation of these elements in plasmodium has not been undertaken.
the completed genome sequences of the malaria parasites p. falciparum, p. y. yoelii and p. vivax have revealed some unusual features.
in comparison, p. y. yoelii is ~77% and p. vivax is ~55% at rich.
one of the p. vivax open reading frames identified in this study demonstrates similarity to telomerase reverse transcriptase and we conclude it to be the orthologue of this gene.
p. falciparum contains the most at rich genome sequenced so far â€“ over 90% in some regions.
further investigation of the six open reading frames in p. falciparum revealed that only one is potentially an active mobile genetic element.
some represent annotated host proteins such as the putative telomerase reverse transcriptase genes in p. y. yoelii and p. falciparum.
we therefore performed a comprehensive genome analysis of these elements and their derivatives in the three plasmodium species.
there is a divergence in the frequencies of mobile genetic elements in the three plasmodium species investigated.
