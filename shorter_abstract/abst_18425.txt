this paper integrates dynamic population strategy and shuffled frog-leaping algorithm into biclustering of microarray data, and proposes a novel multi-objective dynamic population shuffled frog-leaping biclustering  algorithm to mine maximum bicluesters from microarray data.
the proposed modpsflb algorithm has good diversity and fast convergence of pareto solutions and will become a powerful systematic functional analysis in genome research.
experimental results show that the proposed modpsflb algorithm can effectively find significant biological structures in terms of related biological processes, components and molecular functions.
the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm  is a population-based cooperative search metaphor combining the benefits of the local search of pso and the global shuffled of information of the complex evolution technique.
as a heuristics-based optimization approach, the particle swarm optimization  simulate the movements of a bird flock finding food.
newly dna microarray technology may study the transcriptional response of a complete genome to different experimental conditions and yield a lot of large-scale datasets.
multi-objective optimization  involves optimization problems with multiple objectives.
sfl is used to solve the optimization problems of the large-scale datasets.
