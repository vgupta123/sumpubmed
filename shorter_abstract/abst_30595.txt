in live experiments, no fusion events were observed between the mitosomes in g. intestinalis.
during the segregation of the divided mitosomes, the subset of the organelles between two g. intestinalis nuclei had a prominent role.
we show that together with the loss of metabolic complexity of mitochondria, mitosomes of g. intestinalis have uniquely streamlined their dynamics by harmonizing their division with mitosis.
we propose that this might be a strategy of g. intestinalis to maintain a stable number of organelles during cell propagation.
here, we investigated the dynamics of the mitosomes, the simplest forms of mitochondria, in the anaerobic protist parasite giardia intestinalis, a member of the excavata supergroup of eukaryotes.
however, as there are currently no reports on mitochondrial fusion in the whole excavata supergroup, it is possible that the absence of mitochondrial fusion is an ancestral trait common to all excavates.
the mitosomes have abandoned typical mitochondrial traits such as the mitochondrial genome and aerobic respiration and their single role known to date is the formation of ironâ€“sulfur clusters.
however, throughout the cell cycle, mitosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum , although none of the known er-tethering complexes was present.
mitochondria of opisthokonts undergo permanent fission and fusion throughout the cell cycle.
the association of the nuclear and the mitosomal division persisted during the encystation of the parasite.
surprisingly, the sole dynamin-related protein of the parasite seemed not to be involved in mitosomal division.
the lack of mitosomal fusion may also be related to the secondary reduction of the organelles.
