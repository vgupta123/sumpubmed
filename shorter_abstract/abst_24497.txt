notable exceptions to the general pattern of conservation are the testis and the olfactory bulb.
several recent studies reported some evidence in favor of such conservation.
the degree of conservation of gene expression between homologous organs largely remains an open question.
moreover, their zebrafish orthologs also tend to be expressed in the corresponding homologous organs.
for instance, amygdala, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and spinal cord form a clearly discernible unit of expression, both in mouse and human.
most studies compute organs' similarity across all orthologous genes, whereas the expression level of many genes are not informative about organ specificity.
