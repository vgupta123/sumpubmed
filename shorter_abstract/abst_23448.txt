we provide a genomic resource for an important mammalian organism and our study sheds new light on the possible functions and evolution of bear genes.
species of the bear family  are important organisms for research in molecular evolution, comparative physiology and conservation biology, but relatively little genetic sequence information is available for this group.
we identified  <dig> genes, involved in functions such as lipid catabolism, cell cycle, and vesicle-mediated transport, that are showing rapid evolution in the bear lineage three genes, phospholamban , cysteine glycine-rich protein  <dig>  and troponin i type  <dig> , are related to heart contraction, and defects in these genes in humans lead to heart disease.
comprehensive analyses of molecular functions, alternative splicing, and tissue-specific expression of  <dig>  black bear est sequences were conducted using the dog genome as a reference.
two genes, biphenyl hydrolase-like  and csrp <dig>  contain positively selected sites in bear.
