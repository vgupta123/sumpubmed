this work has examined effects of purinergic stimulation to alter levels of intracellular ca2+ in adult human astrocytes.
ca2+-sensitive spectrofluorometry was carried out to determine mobilization of intracellular ca2+ following adenosine triphosphate  or 3′-o-benzoyl-atp  stimulation of adult human astrocytes.
the properties of ca2+ signaling mediated by purinergic receptors are intrinsically linked with functional activity of astrocytes.
this prolonged phase of decay was also attenuated with the store-operated channel  inhibitor gadolinium  added to standard pss, suggesting this component was mediated by soc activation.
these results suggest that activation of metabotropic p2yr  and ionotropic p2x7r could mediate purinergic responses in adult human astrocytes.
in the presence of ca2+-free solution, the secondary phase of decay was absent indicating this prolonged component was due to influx of ca2+.
these results are consistent with atp activation of p2y receptor  in adult human astrocytes leading to respective rapid i mobilization from intracellular stores followed by ca2+ entry through soc.
at present little is known concerning ca2+-dependent purinergic responses in adult human astrocytes.
rt-pcr analysis showed that adult human astrocytes in vitro constitutively express mrna for p2y1r, p2y2r and p2x7r.

the bzatp-induced increase in i was not enhanced with lipopolysaccharide pre-treatment of cells as previously found for p2x7r mediated response in human microglia.
