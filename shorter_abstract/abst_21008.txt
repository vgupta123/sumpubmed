the levels of the third tg-lipoprotein fraction from the positive pole  were significantly higher in aged dogs than in young dogs .
hyperlipidemia has been regarded as a common characteristic for obese animals and hyperlipidemic condition may be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid composition changes.
although there were no significant differences statistically, aged dogs showed significantly higher plasma alpha1- acid glycoprotein  levels compared to those in young dogs.
plasma adiponectin  concentrations were significantly lower in aged dogs than those in young dogs .
plasma cholesterol lipoprotein and tg lipoprotein were divided into four fractions by biphasic agarose gel electrophoresis technique.
moderate negative correlations were seen the age and total cholesterol  fraction  <dig> , glucose , adn , respectively.
present data suggest biochemical characteristics of lipid metabolism disorder may be affected by aging in dogs.
on the correlation coefficient analysis by peasonâ€™s method, moderate positive correlations were seen between the age and tg , tg fraction  <dig> , malondialdehyde , alpha- <dig> ag  levels, respectively.
