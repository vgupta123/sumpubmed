a sub-set of the strain specific genes showed significant differences in terms of their codon usage and gc composition from the native genes suggesting their xenologous origin.
results of this analysis are publicly available in the form of a web database.
the mutation frequency, primarily in the form of external indels was the main type of sequence variation.
the average snp frequency was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base pair of dna and the average indel frequency was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per base pair of dna.
about 60% of the x. fastidiosa unique sequences exist as tandem gene clusters of  <dig> or more genes.
based on these genome comparisons, it appears that the pierce's disease strain temecula- <dig> genome represents the ancestral genome of the x. fastidiosa.
there are  <dig>  genes and  <dig> non-coding homologous sequences present in the genomes of all four strains, representing a  <dig>  2% conservation of the sequenced genome.
the gram-negative, xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium xylella fastidiosa is responsible for causing economically important diseases in grapevine, citrus and many other plant species.
despite its economic impact, relatively little is known about the genomic variations among strains isolated from different hosts and their influence on the population genetics of this pathogen.
indels and strain specific genes have been identified as the main source of variations among strains, with individual strains showing different rates of genome evolution.
multiple alignments identified  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels in the  <dig> common genes and  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels in the  <dig> non-coding sequences.
