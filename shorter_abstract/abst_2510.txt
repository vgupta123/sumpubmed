the acute meth injection caused similar increases in h4k5ac binding in meth-pretreated rats, without affecting gene expression to the same degree.
acute meth injections caused increased gene expression of genes that showed increased h4k5ac binding near their transcription start sites.
we therefore used microarray analysis and genome-scale approaches to examine potential relationships between the effects of meth on gene expression and on dna binding of histone h <dig> acetylated at lysine  <dig>  in the rat dorsal striatum of meth-na√Øve and meth-pretreated rats.
we found a positive correlation between gene expression and h4k5ac binding in the striatum of control rats.
acute and chronic meth administration caused differential changes in striatal gene expression.
in order to relate gene expression to histone acetylation, we binned genes of similar expression into groups of  <dig> genes and proceeded to relate gene expression to h4k5ac binding.
meth is an illicit drug of abuse that influences gene expression in the rat striatum.
meth also increased h4k5ac binding around the transcriptional start sites  of genes in the rat striatum.
