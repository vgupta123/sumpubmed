the broad articulation between the propodeum and metasoma in basal ephialtitidae, likely passed on from a still more basal family karatavitidae, suggests three separate pathways of the transformation of the “wasp waist” in three different derived lineages leading from ephialtitidae to:  kuafuidae and further to the remaining apocrita,  stephanidae, and  evanioidea.
nov., collected respectively from the early cretaceous yixian formation at liutiaogou and the middle jurassic jiulongshan formation at daohugou, both in inner mongolia, china.
in addition, the demise of ephialtitid wasps lagging behind the flourishing of angiosperms suggests that ephialtitid extinction might have been mainly driven by competition with numerous new taxa  appeared just before or/and soon after the j/k boundary.
the remaining abdomen, metasoma, is connected to this hybrid region via a narrow propodeal-metasomal articulation forming a “wasp waist”, which serves an important function of providing maneuverability, flexibility and posture for oviposition.
however, the origin and transformation of the propodeal-metasomal articulation are still vague.
ephialtitidae, as the basal group of apocrita from the early jurassic to the early cretaceous, have shown various types of propodeal-metasomal articulations.
these new fossil ephialtitids have well-preserved propodeal-metasomal articulations indicating metasoma is broadly attached to propodeum.
apocrita has a special structure that its first abdominal segment has been incorporated into the thorax as the propodeum.
