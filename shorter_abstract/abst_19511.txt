we generated four small rna libraries from bottle gourd , cucurbita moschata, cucurbita pepo, and, watermelon  in order to identify conserved and novel lineage specific mirnas in these cucurbits.
deep sequencing of small rna libraries from these species resulted in  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique srna reads from bottle gourd, moschata, pepo and watermelon, respectively.
high-throughput sequencing of small rna libraries from four cucurbit species has provided a glimpse of small rna component in their transcriptomes.
we also identified  <dig> putative novel mirnas in these plant species.
target genes for the most conserved mirnas are also predicted.
partial draft genome sequence became available recently for cucumber and watermelon facilitating investigation of the small rna component of the transcriptomes in cucurbits.
the analysis also showed considerable variation within four cucurbit species with regards to expression of individual mirnas.
micrornas  are a class of non-coding small rnas involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression critical for plant growth and development, stress responses and other diverse biological processes in plants.
small rna blot analysis or q-pcr analyses of leaf and fruit tissues of these cucurbits showed differential expression of several conserved mirnas.
interestingly, the abundance of several mirnas in leaves and fruits of closely related c. moschata and c. pepo was also distinctly different.
sequence analysis of these four libraries resulted in identification of  <dig> mirna families that are highly conserved and  <dig> mirna families that are moderately conserved in diverse dicots.
