we found two experimentally validated microrna targets and  <dig>  mirna-target gene pairs in our datasets which were predicted by miranda algorithm,  <dig> of the target genes were tumor suppressor genes and  <dig> were oncogenes.
further function analysis of target genes suggested that micrornas most frequently targeted genes associated with cell signalling and nervous system.
<dig> of which have been reported to affect glioblastoma and  <dig> of which were implicated in other cancers and brain diseases.
we regressed gene expression on microrna expression in  <dig> tumor tissues and  <dig> normal tissues comprehensively.
