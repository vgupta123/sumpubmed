we demonstrate that although the transformation of paleoap <dig> into euap <dig> was due to a frameshift mutation, this was the result of a single nucleotide deletion.
given that the existing data on the function of such c-terminal motifs are somewhat disparate and contradictory, we have sought to synthesize previous findings within the context of the current analysis and thereby highlight specific hypotheses that require further investigation before the significance of the euap <dig> frameshift event can be fully understood.
it has been suggested that the new motif was created by an eight-nucleotide insertion that produced a translational frameshift.
the evolution of type ii mads box genes has been extensively studied in angiosperms.
the use of ancestral character state reconstructions has allowed us to demonstrate that the frameshift was accompanied by few other nucleotide changes.
phylogenetic analysis indicates that the euap3/tm <dig> duplication maps very close to the base of the core eudicots, associated with the families trochodendraceae and buxaceae.
moreover, such a novel protein motif can become conserved almost immediately on the basis of what appears to be a rapidly generated new function.
this study demonstrates that the simplest of genetic changes can result in the remodeling of protein sequence to produce a kind of molecular 'hopeful monster.'
previous work has demonstrated that the ancestral paleoap <dig> lineage was duplicated at some point within the basal eudicots to give rise to the paralogous tm <dig> and euap <dig> lineages.
