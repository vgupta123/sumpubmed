in an exploratory gene set enrichment analysis, the top terms for the controller genes in these triplets with large la values are involved in some of the most fundamental processes in yeast such as energy regulation, transportation, and sporulation.
on a test subset of the data, the fast screening algorithm achieved > <dig> % agreement with the exhaustive search of la values, while reduced run time by 81– <dig> %.

using a well-known yeast cell-cycle data set with  <dig>  genes, we identified triplet combinations with significantly large la values.
in summary, in this paper we propose a novel, efficient algorithm to explore la on a genome-wide scale and identified triplets of interest in cell cycle pathways using the proposed method in a yeast data set.
we propose a new screening algorithm for more efficient processing of la estimation on a genome-wide scale and apply its use to a saccharomyces cerevisiae data set.
