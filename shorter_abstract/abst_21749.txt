the favr methods use these signatures to facilitate filtering of  platform and/or mapping-specific artefacts,  common genetic variants, and, where relevant,  artefacts derived from imbalanced paired-end sequencing, as well as annotation of genetic variants based on evidence of co-occurrence in individuals.
we applied conventional variant calling applied to whole-exome sequencing datasets, produced using both solid and truseq chemistries, with or without downstream processing by favr methods.
the principles described herein were applied in our recent publication identifying xrcc <dig> as a new breast cancer risk gene and have been made publically available as a suite of software tools.
favr is a suite of new methods designed to work with commonly used mps analysis pipelines to assist in the resolution of some of the issues related to the analysis of the vast amount of resulting data, with a focus on relatively rare genetic variants.
favr is a platform-agnostic suite of methods that significantly enhances the analysis of large volumes of sequencing data for the study of rare genetic variants and their influence on phenotypes.
great challenges remain in resolving genetic variants that are genuine from the millions of artefactual signals.
