modern technology such as computed electroencephalography  that is used to detect signs of brain damage could also be used to determine the advantages and disadvantages of various surgical myocardial revascularization methods in certain categories of patients.
careful preoperative assessment, preparation, and more effective intraoperative brain protection are essential for this category of coronary heart disease  patients.
the severity of angiographically assessed coronary artery disease may be the factor that influences the degree of brain damage during on-pump surgery.
at 7–10 days after cabg, all patients showed theta type  <dig> rhythm power higher than that seen preoperatively, possibly indicating that brain damage occurred during bypass.
syntax scores ≥  <dig> are associated with eeg markers of perioperative brain damage during cabg.

the present study investigated eeg power dynamics for  <dig> postoperative month in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting  who were divided into two groups: those with moderate coronary lesions  and those with severe coronary lesions .
