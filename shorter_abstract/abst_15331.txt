polymorphisms affecting mirna biogenesis, dosage and target recognition may represent potentially functional variants.
in this study, we analyzed the co-localization of all mirna loci with known cnv regions.
using bioinformatic tools we identified and validated  <dig> copy number variable mirna genes  in cnv regions deposited in database of genomic variations  and  <dig> cnv-mirnas in two sets of cnvs defined as highly polymorphic.
we also showed that, consistent with their essential biological functions, mirna loci are underrepresented in highly polymorphic and well-validated cnv regions.
we propose potential mechanisms of cnv-mediated variation of functional copies of mirnas  for different types of cnvs overlapping mirna genes.
we postulate that cnv-mirnas are potential functional variants and should be considered high priority candidate variants in genotype-phenotype association studies.
however, little is known about how copy number variations  affect mirna genes.
the functional consequences of single nucleotide polymorphisms  within critical mirna sequences and outside of mirna genes were previously demonstrated using both experimental and computational methods.
