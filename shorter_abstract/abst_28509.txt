this physical map will greatly facilitate the detailed study of many different genomic regions in channel catfish, and the positional cloning of genes controlling economically important production traits.
the clones were assembled into contigs with fpc software.
a physical map is needed to integrate the genetic map with the karyotype and to support fine mapping of phenotypic trait alleles such as quantitative trait loci  and the effective positional cloning of genes.
a genome-wide physical map of the channel catfish was constructed by high-information-content fingerprinting  of  <dig>  bacterial artificial chromosomes  clones using the snapshot technique.
this is the first physical map for channel catfish.
channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus, is the leading species in north american aquaculture.
the hicf technique allowed the project to be finished with a limited amount of human resource in a high throughput manner.
