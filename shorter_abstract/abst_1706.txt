microarray is a high-throughput technology to study expression of thousands of genes in parallel.
we have developed a software called 'arrayd' that offers various alternative design solutions for an array given a set of user requirements.
the choice of a design solution to be used will be governed by the spotting chemistry to be used and the accuracy of the robot.
a critical aspect of microarray production is the design aimed at space optimization while maximizing the number of gene probes and their replicates to be spotted.
the solutions are stored in a text file.
the user feeds the following inputs: type of source plates to be used, number of gene probes to be printed, number of replicates and number of pins to be used for printing.
