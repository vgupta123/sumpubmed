the aim of this study was to empirically model the variance versus mean dependence in microarray data to improve the performance of existing methods for identifying deg.
the new method provides a control of the false positive rate, a good sensitivity vs. specificity trade-off and consistent results with varying number of replicates and even using single samples.
in the present work we used data generated by our lab as well as publicly available data sets to show that dispersion of repeated measures depends on location of the measures themselves following a power law.
this enables us to construct a power law global error model  that is applicable to various affymetrix genechip data sets.
