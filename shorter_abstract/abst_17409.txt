removal of kif <dig>  significantly impairs the rate of cell growth and, when combined with a previously characterized dynein inhibition, results in dramatic defects in mitotic spindle assembly.
our work underscores the functional redundancy of motor isoforms in basal organisms while highlighting motor specificity in more complex metazoans.
the results reported here extend the number of kinesin gene disruptions in dictyostelium, to now total  <dig>  among the  <dig> isoforms.
we performed individual disruptions of the kinesin genes, kif <dig>  kif <dig>  kif <dig>  and kif <dig>  none of the motors encoded by these genes are essential for development or viability of dictyostelium.
using a gene knockout strategy, we address here the individual function of four of the  <dig> kinesin proteins in dictyostelium.
kinesin and dynein are the two families of microtubule-based motors that drive much of the intracellular movements in eukaryotic cells.
since motor disruption in dictyostelium can readily be combined with other motility insults and stresses, this organism offers an excellent system to investigate functional interactions among the kinesin motor family.
