to study the organization and interaction with the fusion domain  of the transmembrane domain  of influenza virus envelope glycoprotein for its role in membrane fusion which is also essential in the cellular trafficking of biomolecules and sperm-egg fusion.
the results presented in the work characterize the nature of the interaction of tmd with the membrane and tmd in a complex with fp in the steps leading to pore initiation and dilation during virus-induced fusion.
a model was built to illustrate the role of tmd in the late stages of influenza virus-mediated membrane fusion reaction.
the fluorescence and gel electrophoresis experiments revealed a tight self-assembly of tmd in the model membrane.
our data and proposed fusion model highlight the key role of tmd-fp interaction and have implications on the fusion reaction mediated by other type i viral fusion proteins.
an infrared study exhibited an enhanced membrane perturbation by the complex formation.
this effect is likely to contribute to the complete membrane fusion during the late phase of fusion protein-induced fusion cascade.
understanding the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion may assist in the design of anti-viral drugs.
upon associating with fp, the complex exerts a synergistic effect on the membrane perturbation.
the tmd oligomer anchors the fusion protein in the membrane with minimal destabilization to the membrane.
