the primary objectives of this trial were to  describe the compartmental pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in calves after iv administration at  <dig>  mg/kg and  to determine the effect of meloxicam  or placebo  treatment on serum cortisol response, plasma substance p  concentrations, heart rate , activity and weight gain in calves after scoop dehorning and thermocautery without local anesthesia.
to our knowledge, this is the first published report examining the effects of meloxicam without local anesthesia on sp, activity and performance of calves post-dehorning.
mean plasma sp concentrations were lower in meloxicam treated calves  compared with control calves  .
furthermore, the change in plasma sp from baseline was inversely proportional to corresponding plasma meloxicam concentrations .
dehorning caused a significant increase in serum cortisol concentrations and hr .
plasma meloxicam concentrations were detectable for 50 h post-administration and fit a 2-compartment model with a rapid distribution phase  and a slower elimination phase .
dehorning is a common practice involving calves on dairy operations in the united states.
administration of a systemic analgesic drug at the time of dehorning may be attractive to dairy producers since cornual nerve blocks require  <dig> – 15 min to take effect and only provide pain relief for a few hours.
