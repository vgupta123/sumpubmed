thus, we propose to rename yfhq as trmet according to the recently proposed, uniform nomenclature for all rna modification enzymes, or trmj, according to the traditional nomenclature for bacterial trna mtases.
our results reveal that methylation at position  <dig> is carried out by completely unrelated trmet enzymes in eukaryota and prokaryota , mirroring the scenario observed in the case of the m1g <dig> modification .
interestingly, it was found that trna methylation, one of the most common modifications, can be introduced by s-adenosyl-l-methionine -dependent methyltransferases  that belong to two structurally and phylogenetically unrelated protein superfamilies: rfm and spout.
in model organisms escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae most enzymes involved in this process have been identified.
as a part of a large-scale project aiming at characterization of a complete set of rna modification enzymes of model organisms, we have studied the escherichia coli proteins yibk, last, yfhq, and ybea for their ability to introduce the last unassigned methylations of ribose at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the trna anticodon loop.
