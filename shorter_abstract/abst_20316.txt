these studies document the creation of a novel cpp consisting of a glutamate peptide coupled to the n-terminus of the oct <dig> nls; the novel cpp exhibited nuclear colocalization as well as uptake by prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines.
live-cell imaging and analysis by imaging flow cytometry revealed that the novel cpp accumulated in nuclei.
uptake of the novel peptide glu-oct <dig> by cancer cell lines was rapid , complete , concentration-dependent, temperature-dependent, and inhibited by sodium azide .
finally, the novel cpp was coupled to a carboxyfluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide, to see if the peptide could ferry a therapeutic payload into cells.
it was observed that adding a glutamate peptide to the n-terminus of the nuclear localization signal  of the oct <dig> transcription factor resulted in a novel cpp with better uptake and better nuclear colocalization than any other peptide tested.
substitution of phe, tyr, or asn moieties for the glutamate portion of the novel peptide resulted in abrogation of novel cpp uptake; however none of the substituted peptides inhibited uptake of the novel cpp when coincubated with cells.
the novel peptides were based on taking advantage of the nuclear localization properties of transcription factors in combination with a peptide that would bind putatively to cell surfaces.
