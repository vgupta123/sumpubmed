automatic quantification of neuronal morphology from images of fluorescence microscopy plays an increasingly important role in high-content screenings.
this study proposes an effective quantification method, called neurphologyj, capable of automatically quantifying neuronal morphologies such as soma number and size, neurite length, and neurite branching complexity .
neurphologyj can accurately measure neurite length, soma number, neurite attachment points, and neurite ending points from a single image.
however, there exist very few freeware tools and methods which provide automatic neuronal morphology quantification for pharmacological discovery.
our results reveal that neurphologyj is comparable to neuronj, that the coefficient correlation between the estimated neurite lengths is as high as  <dig> .
the imagej plugin with supports of batch processing is easily customized for dealing with high-content screening applications.
neurphologyj is implemented as a plugin to imagej, an open-source java-based image processing and analysis platform.
consequently, some morphology operations of image processing can be efficiently applied.
this reveals that neurphologyj is effective enough to be utilized in applications of pharmacological discoveries.
the source codes of neurphologyj  and the images used for testing are freely available .
the high performance of neurphologyj arises mainly from an elegant image enhancement method.
we evaluated neurphologyj by comparing it with both the computer-aided manual tracing method neuronj and an existing imagej-based plugin method neuritetracer.
furthermore, the quantification result of nocodazole perturbation is consistent with its known inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth.
