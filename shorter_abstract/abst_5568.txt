sox <dig> is a key gene implicated in maintaining the stemness of embryonic and adult stem cells.
the insights gained from our integrated analysis further our understanding of the potential actions of sox <dig> in carcinogenesis and serves as a useful resource for the research community.
using next generation sequencing, we identified  <dig> precursor micrornas  regulated by sox <dig>  including down regulation of mir- <dig>  - <dig>  -253-5p and mir- <dig>  we also show that mir- <dig> and sox <dig> form a double negative feedback loop in gbm cells, potentially creating a bistable system in gbm cells.
sox <dig> appears to re-activate in several human cancers including glioblastoma multiforme , however, the detailed response program of sox <dig> in gbm has not yet been defined.
microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes whose expression altered in response to sox <dig> knockdown.
using chip-seq technology, we identified  <dig> sox <dig> binding regions in the gbm cancer genome.
sox <dig> binding regions contain the consensus sequence wwtgnwtw that occurred  <dig> instances in  <dig> sox <dig> binding regions.
we show that knockdown of the sox <dig> gene in ln <dig> gbm cells reduces cell proliferation and colony formation.
we present an integrated dataset of chip-seq, expression microarrays and microrna sequencing representing the sox <dig> response program in ln <dig> gbm cells.
