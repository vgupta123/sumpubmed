metazoan viruses such as the poxviruses show a predominant acquisition of host genes.
surprisingly, several core genes believed to be ancestral in the family appear to have undergone lateral gene transfers, suggesting that the ncldv ancestor might have had a smaller genome than previously believed.
viruses which infect protists directly  or algae which exist as intracellular protists symbionts  acquire genes from a bacterial source.
nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna viruses , a diverse group that infects a wide range of eukaryotic hosts, exhibit a large heterogeneity in genome size  but have been suggested to form a monophyletic group on the basis of a small subset of approximately  <dig> conserved genes.
this pattern is incompatible with a genome reduction from a cellular ancestor.
ncldv were proposed to have evolved by simplification from cellular organism although some of the giant ncldv have clearly grown by gene accretion from a bacterial origin.
in both cases, the laterally acquired genes show a strong tendency to be positioned at the tip of the genome.
we demonstrate here that many ncldv lineages appear to have undergone frequent gene exchange in two different ways.
we propose that the ncldv viruses have evolved by significant growth of a simple dna virus by gene acquisition from cellular sources.
