six samples were derived from whole blood, negative for cmv dna and antibody, and spiked with cell-grown cmv towne in various concentrations , one was a cmv positive clinical specimen , and two samples were cmv-negative whole blood.
testing for viral dna in neonatal blood dried on paper  has proved a valid means of diagnosing congenital cmv infection with both clinical and epidemiological relevance.
false positive results were reported by 9% of laboratories and in 11% of datasets.
these results indicate a clear need for improvement of methods as sensitivity and false-positivity still appear to be a major problem in a considerable number of laboratories.
a correct positive result was reported in at least 91% of datasets in samples with a viral load of  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> copies/ml or higher.
to assess the quality of the detection of cmv-dna on dbs in laboratories performing this test a proficiency panel consisting of nine samples with two blood spots on each filter paper was produced and distributed.
the  <dig> responding laboratories from  <dig> countries submitted  <dig> datasets obtained by means of conventional pcr  or real-time pcr  technologies.
