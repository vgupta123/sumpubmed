a leaf and a nodule libraries were also obtained for comparison.
average inulin chain length is a critical parameter that is genotype and temperature dependent.
the industrial chicory, cichorium intybus, is a member of the asteraceae family that accumulates fructan of the inulin type in its root.
in the context of the study of carbohydrate metabolism and to get insight into the transcriptome of chicory root and to visualize temporal changes of gene expression during the growing season, we obtained and characterized  <dig> cdna libraries from chicory roots regularly sampled in field during a growing season.
season wide evolution of functional classes was evaluated by comparing libraries at the level of functional categories and unigenes distribution.
approximately  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were obtained from each of twelve cdna libraries resulting in a  <dig>  est dataset.
the dataset contains more than  <dig> sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism and  <dig>  new ests when compared to other recently released chicory est datasets, probably because of the season wide coverage of the root samples.
we believe that these sequences will contribute to accelerate research and breeding of the industrial chicory as well as of closely related species.
data were specifically searched for sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism.
