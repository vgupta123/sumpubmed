gene ontology assignments indicate that sequences obtained cover a broad range of go categories.
we describe an efficient method to identify thousands of snps distributed throughout the alfalfa genome covering a broad range of go categories.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common type of sequence variation among plants and are often functionally important.
validated snps represent valuable molecular marker resources that can be used to enhance marker density in linkage maps, identify potential factors involved in heterosis and genetic variation, and as tools for association mapping and genomic selection in alfalfa.
we describe the use of  <dig> technology and high resolution melting analysis  for high throughput snp discovery in tetraploid alfalfa , a species with high economic value but limited genomic resources.
based on  <dig>  mb of raw sequence, a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were obtained including  <dig>  tentative consensus  sequences and  <dig>  singletons, ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp in length, with an average length of  <dig> bp.
the alfalfa genotypes selected from m. sativa subsp.
we identified  <dig>  candidate snps distributed throughout the genome.
a sample of candidate snps were evaluated and validated using high resolution melting  analysis.
a total of  <dig>  tcs harboring  <dig>  candidate snps were located on the m. truncatula  chromosomes.
