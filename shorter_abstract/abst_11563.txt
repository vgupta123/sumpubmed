while there have been methods recently proposed for assignment of y haplogroups on the basis of high-coverage sequence data, assignment on the basis of low-coverage data remains challenging.
we developed a new algorithm, yhap, which uses an imputation framework to jointly predict y chromosome genotypes and assign y haplogroups using low coverage population sequence data.
y haplogroup analyses are an important component of genealogical reconstruction, population genetic analyses, medical genetics and forensics.
borrowing information across multiple samples within a population using an imputation framework enables accurate y haplogroup assignment.
