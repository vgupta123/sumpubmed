our results are consistent with the ethylene receptors acting as redundant negative regulators of ethylene signaling, but with subfamily  <dig> receptors playing the predominant role.
loss of a single member of subfamily  <dig> is largely compensated for by the activity of the other member, but loss of both subfamily members results in a strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotype.
single mutants show an ethylene response similar to wild type, although both mutants are slightly hypersensitive to ethylene.
a reduced level of ethylene response was still uncovered in the double mutants, indicating that subfamily  <dig> receptors can independently contribute to signaling, with evidence suggesting that this is due to their interaction with the raf-like kinase ctr <dig>
the ethylene receptor family of arabidopsis consists of five members, falling into two subfamilies.
double mutants of ers1- <dig> with etr1- <dig>  as well as with the previously isolated etr1- <dig>  display a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype more pronounced than that observed with any previously characterized combination of ethylene receptor mutations.
the purpose of this study was to determine the extent of signaling mediated by subfamily- <dig> ethylene receptors through isolation and characterization of null mutations.
