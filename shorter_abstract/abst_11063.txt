our results show that the efficiency of protein synthesis peaks at approximately 3Â·10- <dig> l  with a poisson distribution of solutes, while a relative optimum is found at around 10- <dig> l  for the power-law statistics.
our simulation clearly shows that the wet-lab measurement of an effective protein synthesis at smaller volumes than 10- <dig> l would rule out, according to our models, a poisson distribution of solutes.
the protein synthesis inside the liposomes has been studied in both cases, with the aim to highlight experimental observables that could be measured to assess which model gives a better representation of the real process.
firstly, a minimal model for in vitro protein synthesis, based on the pure system molecular composition, has been formalized.
the course of the protein synthesis within each vesicle has been consequently calculated, as a function of vesicle size.
here we present an in silico stochastic simulation of the encapsulation of a cell-free molecular translation system , obtained following two different entrapment models: a pure poisson process, and a power-law.
to this end,  <dig> solutes, which represent the pure system components, have been stochastically distributed among vesicles by following either a poisson or a power-law distribution.
but very recent experimental findings show that, for small liposomes , the distribution of entrapped molecules is best described by a power-law function.
our study can predict translation yield in a population of small liposomes down to the attoliter  range.
theoretically, when no interactions are supposed among the chemical species to be entrapped, the entrapment is described by a standard poisson process.
