the synergistic activation by nrl/lnrl-crx/otx <dig> also occurred when xop was stably integrated into the genome.
the xenopus rhodopsin promoter  has a bipartite structure, with ~200 bp proximal to the start site  coordinating cooperative activation by nrl/lnrl-crx/otx <dig> and the adjacent 5300 bp upstream sequence increasing the overall expression level.
further, we have shown that rax genes act in cooperation with crx/otx <dig> with nrl/lnrl as co-activators of rhodopsin transcription.
we have provided a quantitative model of cooperative transcriptional activation of the rhodopsin promoter through interaction of crx/otx <dig> with nrl/lnrl at two paired-like cis-elements proximal to the nre and tata binding site.
