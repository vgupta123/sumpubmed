the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the three recombinant proteins  were investigated in mouse model.
three recombinant proteins with amount of  <dig> to  <dig> mg/l were produced.
the three recombinant proteins induced both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.
our results indicated that the recombinant proteins still retain their immunological properties and highlighted the potential of the recombinant proteins for the future development of the b. pertussis vaccines.
pertactin , fimbriae  <dig>  and fimbriae  <dig>  of b. pertussis are important virulence factors and immunogens which have been included in some acellular pertussis vaccines.
immunization with rprn, but not with rfim <dig> or rfim <dig>  significantly enhanced clearance of bacteria in the lungs of mice after intranasal challenge with b. pertussis .
we have developed an efficient method to produce large amounts of rprn, rfim <dig>  and rfim <dig> from b. pertussis.
compared to the control mice only immunized with adjuvant, serum igg antibody responses were significantly induced in the mice immunized with rprn, rfim <dig> or rfim <dig> .
immunization with rprn also conferred protection against pertussis in mouse infection models.
when tested in a lethal intracerebral infection model, certain protection was observed in mice immunized with rprn.
in this present study, we cloned, expressed and purified prn, fim <dig> and fim <dig>  respectively.
