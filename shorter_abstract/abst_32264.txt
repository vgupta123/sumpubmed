the median causative gene rank was  <dig> for the optimal and noise cases,  <dig> for the imprecision case, and  <dig> for the imprecision with noise case.
the clinical case results suggest that phenotype rank combined with variant analysis provides significant improvement over the individual approaches.
model validation was performed via simulation and with clinical data.
the disease gene median rank was  <dig>  however, when also considering the patient’s exome data and filtering non-exomic and common variants, the median rank improved to  <dig>
semantic similarity can rank a causative gene highly within a gene list relative to patient phenotype characteristics, provided that imprecision is mitigated.
each patient’s sequence reveals many possibly damaging variants that must be individually assessed to establish clear association with patient phenotype.
however, variant interpretation relative to patient phenotype can be challenging in some scenarios, particularly clinical assessment of rare complex phenotypes.
the algorithm orders genes by the semantic similarity computed between phenotypic descriptors associated with each gene and those describing the patient.
phenotypic descriptor terms are taken from the human phenotype ontology  and semantic similarity is derived from each term’s information content.
to assist interpretation, we implemented an algorithm that ranks a given set of genes relative to patient phenotype.
we ranked the causative gene against all  <dig> hpo annotated genes.
