since under physiological conditions cytokine concentrations normally are low or undetectable we spiked cytokines in the various plasma and serum samples.
all together we show parameters which are essential for measurement of cytokines in the context of clinical trials.
after  <dig> years several cytokines  degraded up to 75% or less of baseline values.
growing knowledge about cellular interactions in the immune system, including the central role of cytokine networks, has lead to new treatments using monoclonal antibodies that block specific components of the immune system.
we also demonstrate implementation of an internal control for multiplex cytokine immunoassays.
however, apparently trivial underappreciated processes,  can greatly impact the reliability and reproducibility of cytokine detection.
this is now possible due to novel technologies such as multiplex immunoassays  that allows detection of multiple cytokines in a single sample.
therefore we set out to investigate several processes that might impact cytokine profiles such as blood collecting tubes, duration of storage, and number of freeze thawing cycles.
long time storage showed cytokines are stable for a period up to  <dig> years of storage at -80Â°c.
