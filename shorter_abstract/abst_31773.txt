the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of p. gingivalis infection on gene and protein expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells  and its relation to cellular function.
aosmcs were exposed to viable p. gingivalis for 24 h, whereafter confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to study p. gingivalis invasion of aosmcs.
human genome microarray, western blot and elisa were used to investigate how p. gingivalis changes the gene and protein expression of aosmcs.
we found that viable p. gingivalis invades aosmcs, disrupts stress fiber structures and significantly increases cell proliferation.
the results from pathway analysis revealed that all the genes belonging to these two categories induced by p. gingivalis were enriched in  <dig> pathways, including genes of notch and tgf-beta pathways.
this study demonstrates that p. gingivalis is able to invade aosmcs and stimulate their proliferation.
using bioinformatic data mining, we demonstrated that up-regulated genes are enriched in gene ontology function of positive control of cell proliferation and down-regulated genes are enriched in the function of negative control of cell proliferation.

microarray results showed that, a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed with the threshold log <dig> fold change > |1| .
porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes destructive chronic periodontitis.
in addition, this bacterium is also involved in the development of cardiovascular disease.
these findings further support the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases.
aosmcs proliferation was evaluated by neutral red assay.
