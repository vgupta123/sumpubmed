in this work we have conducted a proteomic analysis of mature leaves of two citrus genotypes with well-known differing tolerances to hlb: navel orange  and volkameriana .
although there is not any resistance source in the citrus germplasm, a certain level of moderated tolerance is present.
pathway enrichment analysis showed that amino acid degradation processes occurred to a larger degree in the navel orange.
