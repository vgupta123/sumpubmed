the transit peptide of ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase was fused to either the n- or c-terminal end of glutathione s-transferase.
both atclpc <dig> and atclpd interacted with the transit peptides when they were located at the n-terminal position of a protein, but not when they were allocated to the c-terminal end or at the interior of a polypeptide.
clp chaperones from plant chloroplasts have been also implicated in the process of precursor import, along with hsp <dig> chaperones.
how clp chaperones identify their substrates and engage in their processing is not known.
we tested the influence of the position of the transit peptide on the interaction with two chloroplastic clp chaperones, clpc <dig> and clpd from arabidopsis thaliana .
our results have implications for the understanding of protein quality control and precursor import in chloroplasts.
they are thought to pull the precursors in as the transit peptides enter the organelle.
clp/hsp <dig> chaperones are involved in protein quality control.
another fusion with the transit peptide interleaved between two folded proteins was used to probe if atclpc <dig> and atclpd could recognize tags located in the interior of a polypeptide.
we also used a mutated transit peptide that is not targeted by hsp <dig> chaperones , yet it is imported at a normal rate.
atclpc <dig> and atclpd have a positional preference for interacting with a transit peptide.
in particular, the localization of the signal sequence at the n-terminal end of a protein seems mandatory for interaction to take place.
