the echinocandin susceptibilities were assessed on the basis of the species-specific clinical breakpoints proposed by the eucast version  <dig>  and clsi m27-s <dig> documents.
the overall ea was 93 % for micafungin, 92 % for anidulafungin, and 90 % for caspofungin.
collected from patients admitted to an italian university hospital between  <dig> and  <dig>  the susceptibility was evaluated using the broth microdilution method according to both the european committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing  and the clinical laboratory standards institute .
we investigated the antifungal susceptibility of anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin against  <dig> isolates of candida spp.
candida glabrata complex was the least susceptible to all three echinocandins, and the percentages of resistant isolates by eucast/clsi were as follows: anidulafungin,  <dig> / <dig>  %; caspofungin, breakpoint not available/ <dig>  %; micafungin,  <dig> / <dig>  %.
the two methods were comparable by assessing essential agreement , categorical agreement , and spearman’s correlation analysis .
the modal minimum inhibitory concentrations  values by both methods  for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin for each species were, respectively, as follows: c. albicans,  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> ; c. parapsilosis complex, 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  and 2/1; c. tropicalis,  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> ; c. glabrata complex,  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> ; c. guilliermondii, 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  and 2/2; and c. krusei,  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> .
the ca was >90 % for all organism-drug combinations with the exception of c. glabrata and anidulafungin .
independent of the procedure applied, no alarming resistance to the tested agents was found, although a reduced susceptibility was detected for c. glabrata complex.
the overall resistance rates for eucast/clsi were as follows: anidulafungin,  <dig> / <dig>  %; caspofungin, breakpoint not available/ <dig>  %; micafungin,  <dig> / <dig>  %.
the eucast and clsi methods produce similar mics, indicating that using one method or the other should not result in susceptibilities different enough to affect treatment decisions.
