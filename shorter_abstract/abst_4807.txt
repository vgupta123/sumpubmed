the crux spectral-counts command, implemented as part of the crux software toolkit, implements four previously reported spectral counting methods, the spectral index , the exponentially modified protein abundance index , the normalized spectral abundance factor , and the distributed normalized spectral abundance factor .
our analysis suggests that nsaf yields the most reproducible counts across technical and biological replicates, and both sin and nsaf achieve the best linearity.
with the crux spectral-counts command, crux provides open-source modular methods to analyze mass spectrometry data for identifying and now quantifying peptides and proteins.
