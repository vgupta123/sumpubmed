it can be applied either to the primary set of pubmed search results or to the subsets of these results identified through key terms from controlled biomedical vocabularies and ontologies.
pubfocus analytics can be adapted for input sources of biomedical citations other than pubmed.
automation of citation analytics can be very useful and timesaving for both novices and experts.
pubfocus web server automates analysis of medline/pubmed search queries by enriching them with two widely used human factor-based bibliometric indicators of publication quality: journal impact factor and volume of forward references.
we have developed citations' prioritisation algorithm based on journal impact factor, forward referencing volume, referencing dynamics, and author's contribution level.
