nestedmica was also tested using a biologically-authentic test set, where we evaluated its performance with respect to varying sequence length.
discovering overrepresented patterns in amino acid sequences is an important step in protein functional element identification.
it uses multi-class sequence background models to represent different "uninteresting" parts of sequences that do not contain motifs of interest.
in order to assess nestedmica as a protein motif finder, we have tested it on synthetic datasets produced by spiking instances of known motifs into a randomly selected set of protein sequences.
we showed that it can be used to find multiple motifs at the same time, too.
generally nestedmica recovered most of the short  test protein motifs spiked into a test set of sequences at different frequencies.
