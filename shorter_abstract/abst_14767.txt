next-generation sequencing techniques such as chip-seq allow researchers to investigate the genomic position of nuclear components and events.
users submit genomic regions of interest, for example, a set of locations from a chip-seq analysis.
to facilitate comparisons among various genomic features, the output consists of both graphical representations and quantitative measures of the degree of colocalization between userâ€™s genomic regions and selected features.
coloweb is a biologist-friendly web service that can quickly provide an assessment of thousands of genomic regions to identify colocated genomic features.
coloweb compares the submitted regions of interest to the location of other genomic features such as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers.
