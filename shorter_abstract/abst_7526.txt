systematic evaluations using in silico variations of these data as well as fully simulated data, revealed complex interplay between the sequencing parameters and analysis tools, and indicated clear advantages of paired-end designs in several aspects such as alignment accuracy, peak resolution, and most notably, allele-specific binding detection.
although maturing sequencing technologies allow these experiments to be carried out with short , long , single-end, or paired-end reads, the impact of these read parameters on the downstream data analysis are not well understood.
we present the first systematic evaluation of the impact of chip-seq designs on allele-specific binding detection and highlights the power of pair-end designs in such studies.
our work elucidates the effect of design on the downstream analysis and provides insights to investigators in deciding sequencing parameters in chip-seq experiments.
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  experiments revolutionized genome-wide profiling of transcription factors and histone modifications.
we generated  <dig> bps paired-end chip-seq data for many transcription factors from human gm <dig> and mcf <dig> cell lines.
