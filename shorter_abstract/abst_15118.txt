the three competing tests were applied to analyse simulated datasets containing different types of systematic error, and to a real hts dataset.
a successful assessment of the presence of systematic error in experimental hts assays is possible when the appropriate statistical methodology is used.
several error correction methods and software have been developed to address this issue in the context of experimental hts  <cit> .
hence, we need first to assess the presence of systematic error in a given hts assay and then carry out systematic error correction method if and only if the presence of systematic error has been confirmed by statistical tests.
namely, the t-test should be carried out by researchers to determine whether systematic error is present in their hts data prior to applying any error correction method.
such systematic error has the potential to critically affect the hit selection process.
we applied these procedures to raw hts measurements, first, and to estimated hit distribution surfaces, second.
we tested three statistical procedures to assess the presence of systematic error in experimental hts data, including the Ï‡ <dig> goodness-of-fit test, student's t-test and kolmogorov-smirnov test  <cit>  preceded by the discrete fourier transform  method  <cit> .
