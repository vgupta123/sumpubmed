the redox metabolism around glutathione reductase serves as an illustration example.
proteomics or gene expression data give a rough indication of some individual enzyme activities, whereas the complete flux distribution in the network is often not known.
of these, elementary mode analysis  has proven especially useful.
moreover, a dissection algorithm, a centralization algorithm, and an average diameter routine can be used to simplify and analyze complex networks.
further, yana calculates expected flux distributions for a given elementary mode  activity pattern and vice versa.
as such data are noisy, yana features a fast evolutionary algorithm  for the prediction of em activities with minimum error, including alerts for inconsistent experimental data.
analysis routines for expression levels and the most central, well connected metabolites and their metabolic connections are of particular interest.
yana features a platform-independent, dedicated toolbox for metabolic networks with a graphical user interface to calculate , edit , visualize, centralize, and compare elementary flux modes.
a number of algorithms for steady state analysis of metabolic networks have been developed over the years.
as reported here, the analysis of metabolic networks has been improved by an editor and analyzer of metabolic flux modes.
