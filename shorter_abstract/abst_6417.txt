computational methods have been developed to identify functionally similar genes.
without a graphical visualization interface, it is difficult for result interpretation.

with it, researchers can measure gene or gene product functional similarity conveniently, and visualize the network of functional interactions in a graphical interface.
similarly, using these existing methods, web-based applications have been constructed to compute gene functional similarities, and to provide pure text-based outputs.
we present intego <dig>  a web tool that allows researchers to calculate the go-based gene semantic similarities using seven widely used go-based similarity measurements.
intego <dig> is an easy-to-use html <dig> based web tool.
using html <dig> and cytoscape.js, we provide a graphical interface in intego <dig> to visualize the resulting gene functional association networks.
the hierarchical structure of go provides users a convenient platform for biological information abstraction and hypothesis testing.
the gene ontology  has been used in high-throughput omics research as a major bioinformatics resource.
also, we provide an integrative measurement that synergistically integrates all the individual measurements to improve the overall performance.
however, none of the existing measurements take into account all the rich information in go.
