while the majority of these changes occur during transition from rapid exponential growth to the stationary phase, several transient physiological states were detected beyond what has been previously observed.
therefore, a relatively quick and inexpensive strategy for observing changes in large fractions of the genetic elements is highly desirable.
simple laboratory culturing in complex medium can be enormously informative regarding the activities of and interrelationships among a large fraction of all genes in an organism.
