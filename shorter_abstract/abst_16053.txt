the different prevalence of reactions against tested antigens in rabbit, mouse and human sera may indicate significant differences in immune system and commensal cross-talk in these groups.
to evaluate the potential immunoreactive properties of proteins isolated from four lactobacillus strains: l. johnsonii  <dig> and l. johnsonii  <dig>  l. rhamnosus lock  <dig> and l. casei lock  <dig>  the polyclonal sera obtained from mouse and human have been tested as well as with sera from rabbits immunized with whole lactobacilli cells.
the use of lactobacillus as probiotic requires a comprehensive understanding of its effect on host immune system.
strain variations may be related to diversity of the cell surface architecture of bacteria and the ability to express specific antigens or secrete compounds.
the proteins with the highest immunoreactivity were isolated, purified and sequenced, in particular the fractions were identified as phosphoglycerate kinase , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , hypothetic protein jdm1_ <dig>  and fructose/tagatose-bisphosphate-aldolase .
the reactivity of isolated proteins detected by sds-page and western blotting was heterogeneous and varied between different serum samples.
