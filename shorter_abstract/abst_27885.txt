a substantial number of asrnas significantly changed their expression under osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress, suggesting that asrnas may play regulatory roles during these conditions.
in this study we used rna-seq to identify  <dig> antisense rnas  in the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa grown under  <dig> different conditions.
it is necessary to address how reproducibility of these kind of studies should be reported in order to avoid misleading conclusions when comparing data generated by non-identical methods.
the comparison between independent studies that used rna-seq to detect novel asrnas in p. aeruginosa shows that the overlap between the results reported is very narrow.
we found a significant overrepresentation of asrnas that are transcribed opposite to genes involved in cell division and in cell wall, lipopolysaccharide , and capsule biosynthesis, most likely reflecting the conditions used in this study.
the conditions studied include exponential and stationary growth as well as osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress.
rna-seq experiments are revealing hundreds of novel transcripts in all bacterial genomes investigated.
