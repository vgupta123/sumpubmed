correlation in movement of prominent loops seen from molecular dynamics may explain the adaptability and diversity of the predominantly eukaryotic subfamily ii idhs.
isocitrate dehydrogenases  are important enzymes present in all living cells.
we have used phylogeny, structural comparisons and molecular dynamics simulations to highlight the similarity and differences between nadp-dependent dimeric idhs with an emphasis on regulation.
subfamily i are well-studied bacterial idhs, like that of escherischia coli.
three subfamilies of functionally dimeric idhs  are known.
variation in sequence and structure in an aligned region may indicate functional importance concerning regulation in bacterial subfamily i idhs.

this study discusses possible regulatory mechanisms operating in various idhs and implications for regulation of eukaryotic-like bacterial idhs such as that of m. tuberculosis, which may provide avenues for intervention in disease.
yet they are structurally different from idhs of subfamily i, such as the e. coli idh.
subfamily ii has predominantly eukaryotic members, but it also has several bacterial members, many being pathogens or endosymbionts.
