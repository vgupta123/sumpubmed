we cloned small rna sequences from 0â€“ <dig> days post anthesis  developing cotton ovules.
taken together, the results of this initial small rna screen of developing cotton ovules is most consistent with a model, proposed by baulcombe, that there are networks of small rnas that are induced in a cascade fashion by the action of mirnas and that the nature of these cascades can change from tissue to tissue and developmental stage to developmental stage.
of these, only five were present in more than two dpa periods.
sequences occurring only once were far more likely to be seen in the  <dig> to  <dig> dpa periods while those occurring five or more times were the majority in later periods.
the objective of this work was to directly clone, annotate, and analyze small rnas of developing ovules to reveal the candidate small interfering rna/micrornas involved in cotton ovule and fiber development.
among all small rna sequence signatures only three mirbase-confirmed plant micrornas  were identified and only two mirna-containing clones were recovered beyond  <dig> dpa.
the involvement of small rnas in cotton fiber development is under explored.
a total of  <dig> individual colonies were sequenced from  <dig> ovule small rna libraries that yielded  <dig> candidate small rnas with a total of  <dig> unique sequence signatures.
further, among all of the small rna sequences obtained from the small rna pools in developing ovules, only  <dig> groups of sequences were observed in more than one dpa period.
this initial survey of small rna sequences present in developing ovules in cotton indicates that fiber development is under complex small rna regulation.
thus, the vast majority of sequence signatures were expressed in only one dpa period and this included nearly all of the  <dig> nt sequences.
