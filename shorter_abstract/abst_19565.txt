nucleotide changes that occurred independently on separate branches of the phylogenetic tree,  <dig> were not homoplasic in humans.
we identified three major clades among bonobos that separated approximately  <dig>  years ago, as suggested by bayesian analysis.
a comparison of the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes  among polymorphic positions in bonobos and in  <dig> homo sapiens mitochondrial genomes revealed a remarkable difference in the strength of purifying selection in the mitochondrial genes of the f0f1-atpase complex.
we have analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> pan paniscus  individuals to assess the detailed mitochondrial dna  phylogeny of this close relative of homo sapiens.
while in bonobos this complex showed a similar low value as complexes i and iv, human haplogroups displayed  <dig>  to  <dig>  times increased dn/ds ratios when compared to bonobos.
incidentally, we discovered that the current reference sequence for bonobo likely is a hybrid of the mitochondrial genomes of two distant individuals.
this indicates that at least a part of the unstable sites of the mitochondrial genome is species-specific and difficult to be explained on the basis of a mutational hotspot concept.
thus, we hypothesize that the species-specific release of evolutionary constraints for the mitochondrial genes of the proton-translocating atpase is a consequence of altered heat homeostasis in modern humans.
