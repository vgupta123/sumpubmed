most importantly, examination of three different cell types revealed that noise levels differed across tissues.
although numerous investigations have compared gene expression microarray platforms, preprocessing methods and batch correction algorithms using constructed spike-in or dilution datasets, there remains a paucity of studies examining the properties of microarray data using diverse biological samples.
most microarray experiments seek to identify subtle differences between samples with variable background noise, a scenario poorly represented by constructed datasets.
using a set of human leukocyte subset rna samples, we compared previously acquired microarray expression values with rna molecule counts determined by the ncounter analysis system  in selected genes.
confirming previous findings from spike-in and dilution datasets, this “gold-standard” comparison demonstrated signal compression that varied dramatically by expression level and, to a lesser extent, by dataset.
microarray measurements generally correlate with relative rna molecule counts within optimal ranges but suffer from expression-dependent accuracy bias and precision that varies across datasets.
