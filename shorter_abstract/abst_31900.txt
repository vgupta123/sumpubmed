high-throughput experimental approaches have accumulated large amount of information on protein-protein interactions in human and other model organisms.
to address this issue, we used phylogenetic profile method to filter false positives in interologs based on the notion that evolutionary conserved interactions show similar patterns of occurrence along the genomes.
the data supports the notion that phylogenetic profile helps to reduce the number of false positives in interologs.
we then filtered possible false-positives in the predicted interactions using the phylogenetic profiles.
we first inferred the protein-protein interactions in mus musculus by using two approaches: i) identifying mouse orthologs of interacting proteins  based on the experimental protein-protein interaction data from other organisms; and ii) analyzing frequency of mouse ortholog co-occurrence in predicted operons of bacteria.
identification of protein-protein interactions is an important first step to understand living systems.
the approach was applied to mus musculus, in which the experimentally identified interactions are limited.
however, the annotation transfer method could yield false positive interologs due to the lack of conservation of interactions when applied to phylogenetically distant organisms.
such interaction information has been successfully transferred to other species, in which the experimental data are limited.
we have also developed a web interface to facilitate the use of database .
