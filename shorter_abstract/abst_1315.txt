using tipi-gtow, we successfully constructed a strain in which gfp-tdegfade <dig> was expressed at the lower limit, just sufficient to support cellular growth under the -ade condition by accelerating degradation by tev protease.
in this study, we used the tev protease-mediated induction of protein instability  in combination with the genetic tug-of-war  to develop a method to measure the lower limit of protein level.
tipi-gtow is useful for estimating changes in the lower limit of a protein under different conditions, such as different genetic backgrounds and environments.
comparison of the experimental data with predictions of a mathematical model revealed some interactions that were not implemented into the current model.
identifying permissible limits of intracellular parameters such as protein expression provides important information for examining robustness.
tipi-gtow is also useful for analyzing genetic interactions of essential genes whose deletion mutants cannot be obtained.
we first tested the feasibility of this method using ade <dig> as a marker and then analyzed some cell cycle regulators to reveal genetic interactions.
using this strain, we studied genetic interactions between cell cycle regulators and cdc <dig>  and the result was highly consistent with the previously identified interactions.
we also succeeded in constructing a strain in which the minimal level of gfp-tdegfcdc <dig> was expressed by tipi-gtow.
