in contrast the chromosomal region containing trm is not well conserved across mammals.
there is a high degree of conserved synteny in the genomic regions encoding the conventional tcr across mammals and birds.
the organization of the conventional tcr loci, encoding the tra, trb, trg and trd chains, in the opossum monodelphis domestica are highly conserved with and of similar complexity to that of eutherians .
none of the conventional tcr loci contain variable region gene segments with homology to those found in trm; rather trm variable genes are most similar to that of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes.
none of the conventional tcr loci contain evidence that such a recombination event occurred, rather they demonstrate a high degree of stability across distantly related mammals.
the evolutionary origin of trm and its relationship to other tcr remain obscure, and is confounded by previous results that support trm being a hybrid between a tcr and immunoglobulin locus.
these analyses provide the first genomic scale structural detail of marsupial tcr genes, a lineage of mammals used as models of early development and human disease.
