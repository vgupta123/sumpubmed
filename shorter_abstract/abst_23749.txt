experimental results on gene sequences in the tigr database show that our algorithm is optimal and much more efficient than other leading lcs algorithms.
experimental results support our analysis by showing significant improvement of the proposed method over other leading lcs algorithms.
it then obtains the lcs by tracing back from the identical character pairs at the last level.
for two sequences x and y with lengths n and m, respectively, the memory required is max{4*+4*, l}, where l is the number of identical character pairs.
the time complexity is o for sequential execution, and o|) for parallel execution, where |lcs| is the length of the lcs of x and y. for n sequences x <dig>  x <dig>  ..., xn, the time complexity is o for sequential execution, and o|) for parallel execution.
searching for the longest common sequence  of multiple biosequences is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics.
we have developed one of the fastest parallel lcs algorithms on an mpp parallel computing model.
the algorithm first constructs a novel successor table to obtain all the identical pairs and their levels.
in this paper, we present a parallel algorithm named fast_lcs to speedup the computation for finding lcs.
a fast parallel algorithm for lcs is presented.
