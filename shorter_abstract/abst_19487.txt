ten cell strains with different genotypes were used as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer, which produced three cloned kids .
the mutated somatic cells could be used to produce mstn-site mutated goats without developmental disruption.
in this study, we aimed to test whether targeted mstn editing, mediated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases , is a viable approach to create myostatin-modified goats .
fibroblasts from pedigreed goats were co-transfected with mtal- <dig>  and  <dig> monoclonal cell strains were confirmed to have mono- or bi-allelic mutations in mstn.
the results suggested that the mtal- <dig> could disrupt mstn efficiently in the goat genome.
we obtained a pair of talens  that could recognize and cut the targeted mstn site in the goat genome.
