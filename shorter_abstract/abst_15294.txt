furthermore, we show that b <dig>  robustly complements the temperature-sensitive growth defect of a yeast cdc26Î” mutant.
although similarity searches did not reveal any obvious homologue of b <dig>  in the non-redundant protein database, we found that the n-terminus shares a conserved sequence pattern with the n-terminus of the small budding yeast apc/c subunit cdc <dig> and its orthologues from a variety of other organisms.
rna interference coupled with videorecording of c. elegans embryos is a powerful method for identifying genes involved in cell division processes.
