we identified orthologs and homologs of human perforin in all but one species analysed from euteleostomi, and present evidence for an earlier ortholog in gnathostomata but not in more primitive chordates.
we also present evidence that perforin arose from duplication of the ancient mpeg <dig> gene, and that it shares a common ancestor with the functionally related complement proteins.
in placental mammals perforin is a single copy gene, but there are multiple perforin genes in all lineages predating marsupials, except birds.
the pore-forming protein perforin is central to the granule-exocytosis pathway used by cytotoxic lymphocytes to kill abnormal cells.
our comparisons of these many-to-one homologs of human perforin show that they mainly arose from lineage-specific gene duplications in multiple taxa, suggesting acquisition of new roles or different modes of regulation.
although this mechanism of killing is conserved in bony vertebrates, cytotoxic cells are present in other chordates and invertebrates, and their cytotoxic mechanism has not been elucidated.
as it is absent from primitive chordates and invertebrates, cytotoxic cells from these lineages must possess a different effector molecule or cytotoxic mechanism.
