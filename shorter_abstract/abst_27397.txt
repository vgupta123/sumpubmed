genomic dna and total rna was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
real-time pcr was performed with specific primers for transcript i  and ii .
the expression of cyslt <dig> transcript i and ii in asthma did not differ from its expression in healthy control group.
however, in major alleles homozygotic caac/caac women with asthma we found significantly higher expression of transcript i as compared to heterozygous caac/tcgc women in that loci.
cyslt <dig> transcript i expression tended to negative correlation with episodes of acute respiratory infection in our asthmatic population.
moreover, expression of cyslt <dig> transcript ii in caac/caac homozygotic women with asthma was significantly lower than in caac/caac healthy control females.
the goal of our study was to investigate cyslt <dig> alternative transcripts expression in asthmatic patients with different cysltr <dig> promoter haplotypes.
genetic variants of cysltr <dig> promoter might be associated with gender specific expression of cyslt <dig> alternative transcripts in patients with asthma.
fragments of the cysltr <dig> promoter were amplified by pcr and sequenced directly to identify four single nucleotide polymorphisms: c/t , a/c , a/g  and c/t .
cyslt <dig> splice variants expression might also correlate with the susceptibility to infection in asthmatic population.
cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent inflammatory mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma.
