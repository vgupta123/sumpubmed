analysis of phylogenetic relationships and variability of sequence conservation as implemented in the e2e spikes method may lead to improved identification of esrs.
the majority of these genes have been shown to have regulated spatiotemporal expression.
a putative esr motif, gatgcag, was identified in the me-13b but not in the me-13a of drosophila n-cadherin, a gene that has been shown to have a distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern of spliced isoforms in a recent study.
several drosophila genes with spatiotemporal expression patterns were identified to contain putative esrs located in one exon of the me exon pairs but not in the other.
<dig> genes were identified with highly significant motifs in one me exon but not in the other, suggesting regulation of me exon splicing through these highly conserved hexamers.
we found that approximately half of the putative esrs in common between insects and mammals have a high statistical support .
our method, ests-to-esrs , uses graph analysis of est splicing graphs to identify mutually exclusive  exons and combines phylogenetic measures, a sliding window approach along the multiple alignment and the welch's t statistic to extract conserved esr motifs.
in this paper, we describe an in silico analysis pipeline to extract putative exonic splicing regulatory sequences from a multiple alignment of  <dig> species of insects.

a recent study suggested that the regulatory codes of individual rna-binding proteins may be nearly immutable between very diverse species such as mammals and insects.
during alternative splicing, the inclusion of an exon in the final mrna molecule is determined by nuclear proteins that bind cis-regulatory sequences in a target pre-mrna molecule.
