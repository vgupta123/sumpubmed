to speed current gene functional similarity calculation methods, a novel two-step computing strategy is proposed:  establish a hash table for each method to store essential information obtained from the gene ontology  graph and  measure gene functional similarity based on the corresponding hash table.
the proposed strategy is successful in speeding current gene functional similarity calculation methods.
therefore, the efficient measurement of gene functional similarity remains a challenging problem.
however, a common problem with these methods is their time consumption, especially when measuring the gene functional similarities of a large number of gene pairs.

these methods are mainly divided into two categories: pairwise approaches and group-wise approaches.
in recent years, many measures of gene functional similarity have been proposed and widely used in all kinds of essential research.
there is no need to traverse the go graph repeatedly for each method with the help of the hash table.
the problem of computational efficiency for pairwise approaches is even more prominent because they are dependent on the combination of semantic similarity.
the analysis of time complexity shows that the computational efficiency of these methods is significantly improved.
further experiments show the great advantage of sgfsc in measuring gene functional similarity on the whole genomic scale.
we also implement a novel speeding gene functional similarity calculation tool, namely sgfsc, which is bundled with seven typical measures using our proposed strategy.
