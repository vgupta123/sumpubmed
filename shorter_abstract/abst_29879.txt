the 16s rdna sequence from isolate p <dig> identified this organism as a strain of arthrobacter aurescens, a species that has not previously been shown to be capable of low temperature cr reduction.
a. aurescens, indigenous to the subsurface, has the potential to be a predominant metal reducer in enhanced, in situ subsurface bioremediation efforts involving cr and possibly other heavy metals and radionuclides.
the extent of cr reduction was evaluated using the diphenyl carbazide assay.
lyophilized consortium cells did not demonstrate adsorption of cr over a  <dig> hour period.
chromium is a transition metal most commonly found in the environment in its trivalent  and hexavalent  forms.
average time to complete reduction of cr in the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr cultures of the consortium was  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively at  <dig> centigrade.
average time to complete reduction of cr at  <dig> centigrade in the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr cultures of the isolate p <dig> was  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively.
many water sources, especially underground sources, are at low temperatures  year round.
