we filtered the immunome interactome to identify core components of the t cell ppi network .
modeling the dynamics of very large ppi networks is computationally costly.
the interconnectedness of the major pathways for t cell survival and response, including the t cell receptor, mapk and jak-stat pathways, are maintained in the tppin network.
this network reveals the most central and crucial network in t cells.
the obtained tppin network is supported both by gene ontology term enrichment analysis along with study of essential genes enrichment.
data-driven studies on the dynamics of reconstructed protein-protein interaction  networks facilitate investigation and identification of proteins important for particular processes or diseases and reduces time and costs of experimental verification.
statistical significance of the links was computed using the global statistical significance  filtering algorithm.
to circumvent this problem, we created a link-weighted human immunome interactome and performed filtering.
we reconstructed the immunome interactome and weighed the links using jackknife gene expression correlation of integrated, time course gene expression data.
by integrating gene expression data to the immunome interactome and using a weighted network filtering method, we identified the t cell ppi immune response network.
