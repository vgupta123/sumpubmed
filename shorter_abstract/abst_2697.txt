using modified nuclear receptors in a two hybrid format and a synthetic ligand, the rheoswitch system allows rapid and reversible induction of mrna expression.
methods for cell delivery of sirnas include transient transfection of synthetic sirnas and expression of sirnas in the form of short hairpins using constitutive rna polymerase iii promoters.
stable cell lines were obtained, resulting in heritable, consistent and reversible expression of mir- <dig>  a significant advantage over transient transfection.
based on these results, obtained with a microrna we adapted the method to produce a desired sirna by designing short hairpins that can be accurately and efficiently processed.
a short hairpin encoding mir- <dig> cloned into the expression vector was correctly processed to yield mature mirna upon induction with ligand and the amount of mirna produced was commensurate with the concentration of ligand.
we present an inducible mammalian expression system that allows for the conditional expression of short hairpin rnas that are processed in vivo to generate mirnas or sirnas.
to study the biological function of mirnas, and to achieve sustained or conditional gene silencing with sirnas, systems that allow controlled expression of these small rnas are desirable.
