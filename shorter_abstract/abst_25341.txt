such proteins contribute to cell wall synthesis and maintenance and are important for interactions between the bacterial cell and the human host.
using methods based on proteolytic "shaving" of bacterial cells and subsequent mass spectrometry-based protein identification, we have identified surface-located proteins in enterococcus faecalis v <dig>  in total  <dig> unique proteins were identified, few of which have been identified and characterized previously.
the  <dig> identified secreted  and surface  proteins included several proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, pheromone-regulated processes, and transport of solutes, as well as proteins with unknown function.
the seemingly most abundant surface proteins included a membrane protein with a potentially shedded extracellular sulfatase domain that could act on the sulfate groups in mucin and a lipid-anchored fumarate reductase that could contribute to generation of reactive oxygen species.
surface proteins are a key to a deeper understanding of the behaviour of gram-positive bacteria interacting with the human gastro-intestinal tract.
since they are exposed and may play roles in pathogenicity, surface proteins are interesting targets for drug design.
lipid-anchored proteins were the most dominant among the identified surface proteins.
these proteins stand out as interesting targets for further investigation of the interaction between e. faecalis and its environment.
the present proteome analysis gives an experimental impression of the protein landscape on the cell surface of the pathogenic bacterium e. faecalis.
