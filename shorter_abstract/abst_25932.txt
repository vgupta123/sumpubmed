here we provide proof of concept of this risk by describing a novel means for recovering pedv-contaminated complete feed material from commercial swine sites and conducting an in vivo experiment to prove its infectivity.
clinical signs of pedv infection  and viral shedding were observed in both the positive control and treatment group’ post-consumption with virus and microscopic lesions detected in intestinal samples no evidence of infection was observed in the negative controls.
these data provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for pedv infection of naïve pigs using natural feeding behavior.
to test infectivity, this material was pooled  and a treatment group of 3-week old pedv-naïve piglets were allowed to consume it via natural feeding behavior.
for the purpose of a positive control, piglets were allowed to ingest feed spiked with stock pedv  while the negative control group received pedv-free feed.
for on-farm detection of pedv rna in feed, paint rollers were used to collect material from at-risk feed bins from  <dig> clinically affected breeding herds.
initially, contaminated feed was proposed as a risk factor for pedv; however, data were not available to support this theory.
