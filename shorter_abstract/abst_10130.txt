here we describe the development of an artificial microrna -mediated gene silencing system for m. truncatula roots.
most importantly, we applied the novel amir system to shed light on the function of a putative transcription factor, mterf <dig>  which was strongly induced in arbuscule-containing cells during mycorrhizal symbiosis.
amir-mediated silencing of a visible marker was also effective after root transformation of m. truncatula constitutively expressing the visible marker.
legumes have the unique capacity to undergo two important root endosymbioses: the root nodule symbiosis and the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.
the endogenous amir system demonstrated here presents a novel and highly efficient tool to unravel gene functions during root endosymbioses.
mtpt <dig> promoter driven amir-silencing led to strongly decreased transcript levels and deformed, non-fully truncated arbuscules indicating that mterf <dig> is required for arbuscule development.
the endogenous microrna  mtr-mir159b was selected as a backbone molecule for driving amir expression.
