genes associated with growth control/neuroplasticity, signal transduction, cell death/survival, cytoskeleton, and immunity were generally upregulated.
the majority of the genes associated with ionic homeostasis, neurotransmission, signal transduction and lipid metabolism were differentially regulated specifically in the hippocampus.
in contrast, genes related to neurotransmission and lipid metabolism were transiently downregulated on the whole.
temporal and spatial analysis of gene expression in experimental pneumococcal meningitis identified potential targets for therapy.
despite this significant disease burden, the genetic program that regulates the host response leading to brain damage as a consequence of bacterial meningitis is largely unknown.
to analyze the biological significance of the data generated by affymetrix dna microarrays, a bioinformatics pipeline was used combining  a literature-profiling algorithm to cluster genes based on the vocabulary of abstracts indexed in medline  and  the self-organizing map , a clustering technique based on covariance in gene expression kinetics.
we used an infant rat model of pneumococcal meningitis to assess gene expression profiles in cortex and hippocampus at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after infection and in controls at  <dig> h after mock-infection with saline.
pneumococcal meningitis is associated with high mortality  and morbidity.
among  <dig> genes differentially regulated , 77% were automatically assigned to one of  <dig> functional groups with 94% accuracy.
up to 50% of survivors are affected by neurological sequelae due to a wide spectrum of brain injury mainly affecting the cortex and hippocampus.
som disclosed six patterns of expression kinetics.
of the cell death/survival genes found to be continuously upregulated only in hippocampus, the majority are pro-apoptotic, while those continuously upregulated only in cortex are anti-apoptotic.
