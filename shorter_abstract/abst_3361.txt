the structural properties of the fs domain revealed in this study pave the way for further exploration into the functions of f-spondin.
we present the crystal structure of human f-spondin fs domain at  <dig> Ã… resolution.
the reelin_n domain and the f-spondin domain  comprise a proteolytic fragment that interacts with the cell membrane and guides the projection of commissural axons to floor plate.
the unique feature of f-spondin fs domain is the presence of three disulfide bonds associated with the n- and c-termini of the domain and a highly conserved n-linked glycosylation site.
the fs domain is found in f-spondins, mindins, m-spondin and amphif-spondin.
though the primary sequences of the fs domains of f-spondin and mindin are less than 36% identical, their overall structures are very similar.
the integrin-binding motif found in mindin is not conserved in the f-spondin fs domain.
the structure of the f-spondin fs domain completes the structural studies of the multiple-domain ecm molecule.
the homology of its core structure to a common ca2+- and lipid-binding c <dig> domain suggests that the f-spondin fs domain may be responsible for part of the membrane targeting of f-spondin in its regulation of axon development.
