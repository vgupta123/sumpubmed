genetic difference existed in degs between xz <dig> and xz <dig>  including transporters, transcription factors , kinases, antioxidant stress and hormone signaling related genes.
xz <dig> had a higher capability of n absorption and use efficiency under ln stress than xz <dig>  the higher expression of nitrate transporters and energy-saving assimilation pattern could be attributed to its more n uptake and higher ln tolerance.
the identified candidate genes related to ln tolerance may provide new insights into comprehensive understanding of the genotypic difference in n utilization and ln tolerance.
up to date, no study has been done to illustrate the mechanism of ln tolerance underlying the wild barley at transcriptional level.
the responses of xz <dig> and xz <dig> to ln stress differed dramatically at transcriptional level.

an effective approach to solve n deficiency is to develop low n  tolerant crop cultivars.
tibetan annual wild barley is well-known for its wide genetic diversity and high tolerance to poor soil fertility.
in this study, we employed illumina rna-sequencing to determine the genotypic difference in transcriptome profile using two tibetan wild barley genotypes differing in ln tolerance .
in addition, auxin  and ethylene  response pathways may be also related to the genotypic difference in ln tolerance.
meanwhile,  <dig> ln tolerance-associated degs were mainly mapped to amino acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and secondary metabolism, and involved in transporter activity, antioxidant activities, and other gene ontology .
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in the two genotypes at 6 h and 48 h after ln treatment.
