the estimates with our model assumptions indicated that the average ages at infection ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  days and that the basic reproduction number, r <dig>  was in the order of  <dig> – <dig> .
if the force of infection started to decline, it might be necessary to implement radical countermeasures  to minimize the number of virus-positive pigs at the finishing stage.
clarifying the detailed mechanisms of transmission within farms is required in order to facilitate an understanding of the age-specific patterns of infection, especially just prior to slaughter.
although our estimates imply that more than 95% of pigs are infected before the age of  <dig> days, the model shows that a decline in the force of infection could increase the risk of pig-to-human transmission.
sensitivity analyses of age-specific incidence at different forces of infection revealed that a decline in the force of infection would elevate the age at infection and could increase the number of virus-excreting pigs at the age of  <dig> days.
the forces of infection of swine hev were estimated to be  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>    in hokkaido, honshu and kyushu, respectively.
