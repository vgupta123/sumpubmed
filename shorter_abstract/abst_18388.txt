most ctg species also contain a fungal phzf homolog.
there is evidence that schizosaccharomyces pombe and basidiomycotina also obtained a phzf homolog through hgt.
an analysis of synteny suggests that c. parapsilosis has lost the endogenous fungal form of phzf, and subsequently reacquired it from a proteobacterial source.
here, we used the emerging genome sequences of candida albicans wo- <dig>  candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, clavispora lusitaniae, pichia guilliermondii, and lodderomyces elongisporus to identify recent interdomain hgt events.
therefore, while recent interkingdom gene transfer has taken place in the ctg lineage, its occurrence is rare.
phylogenetic analysis also infers that there were independent transfers of bacterial pr enzymes into members of the pezizomycotina, and protists.
we refer to these as ctg species because they translate the ctg codon as serine rather than leucine, and share a recent common ancestor.
however, our analysis will not detect ancient gene transfers, and we may have underestimated the global extent of hgt into ctg species.
the second hgt gene in c. parapsilosis belongs to the phenazine f  superfamily.
phylogenetic and syntenic information infer that two c. parapsilosis genes originate from bacterial sources.
our search revealed two instances of well-supported hgt from bacteria into the ctg clade, both specific to c. parapsilosis.
one encodes a putative proline racemase .
our phylogeny suggests that the ctg homolog originated from an ancient hgt event, from a member of the proteobacteria.
