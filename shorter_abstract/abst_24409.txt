here we have introduced data for three genes  with a wide taxonomic sampling of fornicata, including ten isolates of enteromonads, representing the genera trimitus and enteromonas, and a new undescribed enteromonad genus.
furthermore, our analyses suggested that enteromonads do not constitute a monophyletic group, and enteromonad monophyly was statistically rejected in 'approximately unbiased' tests of the combined gene data.
the monophyly of the group was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic studies, but neither the internal phylogeny nor its position on the eukaryotic tree has been clearly resolved.
the diplomonad sequences formed two main clades in individual gene and combined gene analyses, with giardia  on one side of the basal divergence and spironucleus, hexamita and trepomonas on the other.
our result suggests either that the diplokaryotic condition characteristic of diplomonads arose several times independently, or that the monokaryotic cell of enteromonads originated several times independently by secondary reduction from the diplokaryotic state.
we suggest that all higher taxa intended to unite multiple enteromonad genera be abandoned, that trimitus and enteromonas be considered as part of hexamitinae, and that the term 'enteromonads' be used in a strictly utilitarian sense.
