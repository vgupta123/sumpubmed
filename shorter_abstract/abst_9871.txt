in terms of stability, it was shown that the high level of expression was kept consistence for more than four months in these cells whereas the expression titers were reduced in the other ucoe pools.
here we investigate the impact of having these elements as part of the light chain, heavy chain or both genes during cell line development.
expression analysis revealed that all ucoe cell pools had higher antibody yields compared to non-ucoe cells, moreover the most optimal expression was obtained by cells containing just the ucoe on heavy chain.
in conclusion, ucoe significantly enhanced the level and stability of antibody expression and the use of this element with heavy chain provided more stable cell lines with higher production level.
there are reports on improved antibody expression in ubiquitous chromatin opening element  containing both heavy and light chain gene constructs.
transcriptional gene silencing is a common phenomenon in recombinant cell lines which leads to expression reduction and instability.
in this regard, non-ucoe and ucoe vectors were constructed and stable chinese hamster ovary  cell pools were generated by different vector combinations.
