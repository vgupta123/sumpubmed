subsequent alkylation of the thiophosphorylated amino acid residue allows immunodetection using thiophosphate ester-specific antibodies.
our work demonstrates that the in vitro-labeling assay represents an effective, specific and highly sensitive test for determining kinase-substrate relationships.
site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids confirmed the protein substrates’ site-specific phosphorylation by mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  a combined assay with mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> revealed substrate specificity of the individual kinases.
using mass spectrometry, we previously identified many in vivo mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> substrates in arabidopsis thaliana, and we disclosed their phosphorylation sites.
