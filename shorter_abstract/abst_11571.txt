collectively, our data show that the secretory pathway in hyperactive neuroendocrine secretory cells lacks the capacity to fully comply with the high demands for complex glycosylation and sulphation of the overload of secretory cargo.
here we explored in the hyperactive and basally active melanotrope cells the capacity for posttranslational pomc processing events in the secretory pathway.
when the cargo load in the secretory pathway of the hyperactive cells was pharmacologically reduced, the relative amount of complex glycosylated pomc markedly increased.
in black-background-adapted xenopus laevis, the intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells are hyperactive, producing large amounts of their major secretory cargo proopiomelanocortin , whereas in white-adapted frogs these cells are only basally active.
we found that the hyperactive cells produced mainly non-complex n-glycosylated pomc, whereas in the basally active cells pomc was mostly complex n-glycosylated.
