the expression of some transcription factors and protein kinases, especially myb <dig>  wrky <dig>  mpkk <dig> and mapk <dig>  was also induced by mj and coordinated with ass expression, suggesting they maybe positive regulators of ass.
being endangered and listed in the appendix ii of the cites .
owing to a lack of genomic information, the molecular basis of wound-induced sesquiterpenes biosynthesis and agarwood formation remains unknown.
to identify the primary genes that maybe related to agarwood formation, we sequenced  <dig> cdna libraries generated from healthy and wounded a. sinensis  gilg.
of those associated with agarwood formation,  <dig> putatively encoded enzymes in the sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway, and a handful of transcription factors and protein kinases were related to wound signal transduction.
a total of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp were obtained, and they were annotated in detail at bioinformatics levels.
three full-length cdnas of sesquiterpene synthases  were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and enzyme assays revealed that they are active enzymes, with the major products being δ-guaiene.
and valuable clues for elucidating the mechanism of wound-induced agarwood sesquiterpenes biosynthesis and their regulation.
only wounded trees can produce agarwood, and the huge demand for the agarwood products has led all aquilaria spp.
this study provides extensive transcriptome information for aquilaria spp.
agarwood is an expensive resinous heartwood derived from aquilaria plants that is widely used in traditional medicines, incense and perfume.
