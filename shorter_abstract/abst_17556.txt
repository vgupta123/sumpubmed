<dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of contigs were annotated with ncbi nr, go, and kegg database, respectively.
in addition, the genes involved in the copper ion binding or transporting and antioxidant systems were identified.
however, antioxidant systems resistant to cuso <dig> caused stress; mitochondrion may compensate for photosynthesis efficiency decreasing caused energy deficiency.
furthermore, gene translation and transcription processes may be disrupted, inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, and possibly accelerating cell death.
however, molecular mechanisms of cuso <dig> effect on the c. polykrikoides, even other hab species, have not been investigated.
harmful algal blooms  caused by the dinoflagellate cochlodinium polykrikoides lead to severe environmental impacts in oceans worldwide followed by huge economic losses.
kegg pathway analysis of eukaryotic homologous genes revealed the differentially expressed genes  were involved in diverse pathway; amongst, the genes involved in the translation, spliceosome, and/or signal transduction genes were highly regulated.
algicide agent copper sulfate  is regard as an economical and effective agent for habs mitigation; its biochemical and physiological effects were revealed in c. polykrikoides.
the present study investigated the transcriptional response of c. polykrikoides against cuso <dig> treatments, with the aim of providing certain molecular mechanism of cuso <dig> effect on the c. polykrikoides blooms.
this study reported the first transcriptome of the c. polykrikoides.
in addition, various signal transduction pathways may be involved in the cuso <dig> induced regulation network in the c. polykrikoides.
these data provide the potential transcriptomic mechanism to explain the algicide cuso <dig> effect on the harmful dinoflagellate c. polykrikoides.
the widely differential expressed photosystem genes suggested photosynthetic machinery were severely affected, and may further contribute to the cell death.

transcriptomic analysis revealed  <dig>  % differential expressed contigs, which grouped into  <dig> clusters according to k-means clustering analysis, responding to cuso4;  <dig> contigs were up-regulated and  <dig> contigs were down-regulated more than 2-fold changes from 12 h to 48 h exposure.
