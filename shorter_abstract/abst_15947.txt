nov., from the early cretaceous yixian formation of duolun county, inner mongolia, china.
this study describes and illustrates a new genus and species from the family xyelydidae, rectilyda sticta gen. et sp.
however, because nygmata are rarely preserved in compression fossils, their early development and evolution are still enigmatic.
this genus has 1-rs reclival and linearly aligned with 1-m, which is different from all other genera in the xyelydidae.
nov. has clearly preserved nygmata: four symmetrical nygmata on each forewing and two on each hind wing.
previous reports of nygmata on the forewings of triassic xyelids and extant sawflies, together with this new fossil record of nygmata, provide rare insights into their developmental trends, as well as into the evolution of hymenopterans and insects in general.
for example, the only documented nygmata in the hymenoptera are on the forewings of the triassic xyelids asioxyela paurura and madygenius primitives.
in addition, r. sticta gen. et sp.
