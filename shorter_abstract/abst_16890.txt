we obtained population size estimates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  chimpanzees using capture-with-replacement and spatially explicit capture–recapture models, respectively.
in uganda, the mostly unprotected forest fragment landscape between the budongo and bugoma forests is a potential corridor for chimpanzees, yet little is known about the status of chimpanzee populations in these fragments.
our findings demonstrate that, despite extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, chimpanzees remain widely distributed and exhibit distinct community home ranges.
their long-term persistence is unlikely, however, if protection is not afforded to them and habitat loss continues unabated.
our results further imply that elusive and rare species may adapt to degraded habitats more successfully than previously believed.
the distribution of genotype clusters and y-chromosome haplotypes together indicate the presence of numerous male philopatric chimpanzee communities throughout the corridor habitat.
these census figures are more than three times greater than a previous estimate based on an extrapolation from small-scale nest count surveys that tend to underestimate population size.
putative community distributions defined by the locations of associated genotypes correspond well with the distribution of  <dig> y-chromosome haplotypes.
the spatial clustering of associated genotypes suggests the presence of at least nine communities containing a minimum of 8– <dig> individuals each.
