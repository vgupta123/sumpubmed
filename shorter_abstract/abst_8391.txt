our results provide new insights into mechanisms of pcb  <dig> induced toxicity.
polychlorinated biphenyls  are persistent organic pollutants  with harmful effects in animals and humans.
transcriptional up-regulation of marker genes for lipid biosynthesis resembles lipogenic effects previously reported for persistent organic pollutants  and other environmental chemicals.
particularly, genes coding for proteins in dna replication/cell cycle pathways and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis were up-regulated suggesting increased cell proliferation and lipogenesis, respectively.
functional enrichment, interactome, network and gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially regulated genes suggested that pathways associated with cell cycle, lipid metabolism, immune response, apoptosis and stress response were among the top significantly enriched.
pcb  <dig> appears to activate cell proliferation and lipogenic genes in cod liver.
to obtain better insights into toxicity mechanisms, we treated juvenile atlantic cod  with pcb  <dig>  for 2Â weeks and performed gene expression analysis in the liver using oligonucleotide arrays.
whole-genome gene expression analysis detected about  <dig> differentially regulated genes.
only few studies have been conducted to explore genes and pathways affected by pcb  <dig> by using high throughput transcriptomics approaches.
