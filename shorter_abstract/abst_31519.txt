here, we have used an inter-species compared genomics approach on this locus in order to try to identify conserved features or motifs indicative of a putative function.
this inter-specific comparative study, the first of its kind,  allowed to reveal a novel genus-specific gene and  identified a conserved poly tract in the otherwise highly polymorphic region containing the putative transcription initiation site.
as regards its intrachromosomal position, size and at content, the general structure of this ssr appears extremely stable among species, which is another demonstration of the remarkable structural stability of these genomes at the evolutionary level.
trypanosomatids exhibit a unique gene organization into large directional gene clusters  in opposite directions.
we cloned this novel gene and expressed it as a recombinant green fluorescent protein-fused version, which showed its localisation to the endoplasmic reticulum.
the transcription "strand switch region"  separating the two large dgcs that constitute chromosome  <dig> of leishmania major has been the subject of several studies and speculations.
we isolated, and compared the structure and nucleotide sequence of, this ssr in  <dig> widely divergent species of leishmania and sauroleishmania.
overall, only 30% of nucleotide positions were conserved in the ssr among the  <dig> species, versus 74% and 62% in the 5' parts of the adjacent xpp and paxp genes, respectively.
sequence alignments showed several interesting features.
thus, a central fragment of approximately  <dig> bp exhibited 54% of identity among the  <dig> species.
this allows hypothesising an intervention of poly-binding proteins known elsewhere to be involved in transcriptional control.
the encoded protein comprises two trans-membrane domains and is classified in the "structural protein" go category.
