we sampled four mitogenomes from three species of fire ants, genus solenopsis, which represent various evolutionary depths.
overall, ant mitogenomes appear to be typical of hymenopteran mitogenomes, displaying a general a+t-bias.
we also discuss ways that may help improve the use of mitogenomes in phylogenetic analyses by accounting for non-stationary and non-homogeneous evolution among branches.
we provide further evidence that the sampling across many taxonomic levels  is useful and important to gain detailed insights into mitogenome evolution.
the solenopsis mitogenomes are slightly more compact than other hymentoperan mitogenomes , retaining all protein coding genes, ribosomal, and transfer rnas.
we also present evidence of recombination between the mitogenomes of the two conspecific solenopsis mitogenomes.
despite the rapid increase in available mitogenomes, the taxonomic sampling often poorly reflects phylogenetic diversity and is often also biased to represent deeper  evolutionary relationships.
