while endocytosis has traditionally been considered a principal mechanism for receptor down-regulation and termination of signaling pathways, we demonstrate that interfering with clathrin-mediated endocytosis actually blocks wnt signaling at the level of Î²-catenin accumulation and target gene expression.
the wnt signaling pathway regulates many processes during embryonic development, including axis specification, organogenesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell proliferation.
while numerous wnts, their cognate receptors of the frizzled and arrow/lrp5/ <dig> families and downstream pathway components have been identified, little is known about the initial events occurring directly after receptor activation.
we show here that wnt proteins are rapidly endocytosed by a clathrin- and dynamin-mediated process.
a necessary component of wnt signaling occurs in a subcellular compartment distinct from the plasma membrane.
wnt signaling has also been implicated in a number of cancers, bone density maintenance, and neurological conditions during adulthood.
