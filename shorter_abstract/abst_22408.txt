we added these to a broader sample of lion sequences, resulting in a data set spanning the historical range of lions.
using a molecular clock, we estimated that recent lion lineages began to diverge in the late pleistocene.
west african lions then expanded into central africa during periods of rainforest contraction.
we have identified deep, well-supported splits within the mitochondrial phylogeny of african lions, arguing for recognition of some regional populations as worthy of independent conservation.
this is particularly true for the lion which as a consequence of millennia of human persecution, has large gaps in its natural distribution and several recently extinct populations.
we sequenced mitochondrial dna from museum-preserved individuals, including the extinct barbary lion  and iranian lion , as well as lions from west and central africa.
for many tropical large mammals, however, this aim is confounded by the absence of fossil material and by the misleading signal obtained from genetic data of recently fragmented and isolated populations.
understanding the demographic history of a population is critical to conservation and to our broader understanding of evolutionary processes.
