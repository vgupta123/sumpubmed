finally significant associations need to be prioritised using functional and biological interpretation methods, browsing available biological annotation, pathway information and patterns of linkage disequilibrium .
evaluation of results may involve further statistical analysis, such as permutation testing, or further qc of associated markers, for example, reviewing raw genotyping intensities.
we have developed an interactive and user-friendly graphical application to be used in all steps in gwa projects from initial data qc and analysis to biological evaluation and validation of results.
there are a number of important steps during the analysis of such data, many of which may present severe bottlenecks.
the data need to be imported and reviewed to perform initial quality control  before proceeding to association testing.
