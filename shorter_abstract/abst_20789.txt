this mutant, in contrast to the wild-type bacterium, was shown both to have impaired the ability to replicate within macrophages and to have prevented phagosome/lysosome fusion.
the transcriptional profile of macrophages infected with the wild-type bacterium and the mutant were examined using dna microarray, which showed that the two bacteria interact uniquely with mononuclear phagocytes.
based on the results, it was hypothesized that the phagosome environment and vacuole membrane of the wild-type bacterium might differ from the mutant.
wild-type bacterium phagosomes expressed a number of proteins different from those infected with the mutant.
the results suggest that the mav_ <dig> gene/operon might participate in the establishment of bacterial intracellular environment in macrophages.
mycobacterium hominissuis infects and replicates within mononuclear phagocytes.
mycobacterium avium subsp hominissuis  is an environmental organism associated with opportunistic infections in humans.
proteins on the phagosomes were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and western blot.
