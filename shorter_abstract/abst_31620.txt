using multiple genes and explicit hypothesis testing, we show that echiura, siboglinidae, and clitellata are derived annelids with polychaete sister taxa, and that sipuncula should be included within annelids.
for the first time, these findings are substantiated using approximately unbiased tests and non-scaled bootstrap probability tests that compare alternative hypotheses.
sipuncula, echiura, siboglinidae, and clitellata are all nested within polychaete annelids according to phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear genes  for  <dig> taxa, and  <dig> nuclear and mitochondrial genes for  <dig> taxa .
none of our analyses support the major polychaete clades reflected in the current classification scheme of annelids, and hypothesis testing significantly rejects monophyly of scolecida, palpata, canalipalpata, and aciculata.
for echiurans, the polychaete group capitellidae is corroborated as the sister taxon; while the exact placement of sipuncula within annelida is still uncertain, our analyses suggest an affiliation with terebellimorphs.
recent analyses of molecular data suggest that annelida may include other taxa once considered separate phyla  and that clitellata are derived annelids, thus rendering "polychaeta" paraphyletic; however, this contradicts classification schemes of annelids developed from recent analyses of morphological characters.
given that deep-level evolutionary relationships of annelida are poorly understood, we have analyzed comprehensive datasets based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and have applied rigorous testing of alternative hypotheses so that we can move towards the robust reconstruction of annelid history needed to interpret animal body plan evolution.
relationships within annelida based on our analyses of multiple genes challenge the current classification scheme, and some alternative hypotheses are provided.
annelida comprises an ancient and ecologically important animal phylum with over  <dig>  described species and members are the dominant macrofauna of the deep sea.
