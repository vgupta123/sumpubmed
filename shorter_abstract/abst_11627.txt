the efficient lignin oxidation system of this fungus requires cyclic redox reactions involving the reduction of aryl-aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols by aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase.
we report here the cloning of an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase cdna from the white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium, its expression in escherichia coli and the biochemical characterization of the encoded gst and his <dig> tagged protein.
in this work, we have characterized the biochemical properties of an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase from the white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium.
the white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium is among the small group of fungi that can degrade lignin to carbon dioxide while leaving the crystalline cellulose untouched.
we show that this enzyme functions in the reductive sense under physiological conditions and that it displays relatively large substrate specificity with highest activity towards the natural compound veratraldehyde.
nadh could also be the electron donor, while having a higher km  compared to that of nadph .
the purified recombinant enzyme showed optimal activity at 37Â°c and at ph  <dig>  for the reduction of aryl- and linear aldehydes with nadph as coenzyme.
the purified recombinant enzyme was found to be active in the reduction of more than  <dig> different aryl- and linear aldehydes showing highest specificity for mono- and dimethoxylated benzaldehyde at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .
however, the biochemical properties of this enzyme have not been extensively studied.
these are of most interest for the design of metabolic engineering/synthetic biology strategies in the field of biotechnological applications of this enzyme.
