in vitro analyses of bmmcs revealed no difference in fcεri and c-kit expression, however, 129s <dig> bmmcs possessed greater proliferative capacity and reduced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.
experimental analyses have identified strain-dependent factors that regulate susceptibility to anaphylaxis in mice.
given the wide spread usage of the 129svevbrd strain of mice in experimental gene targeting methodology, these data have important implications for studying ige-reactions in mouse systems.
tissue mast cell, plasma histamine, total ige and ova-specific ige levels and susceptibility to histamine i.v infusion were assessed.
bone marrow mast cell s were examined for fcεri, c-kit, degranulation efficiency, proliferation, apoptosis and cytokine profile.
ige-bmmc degranulation assays demonstrated no difference in degranulation efficiency.
mice were subjected to passive and oral ovalbumin -induced active anaphylaxis.
129s <dig> mice had significantly increased susceptibility to passive and oral ova-induced active anaphylaxis.
