our results demonstrate that lab animals can quickly evolve domesticated behaviors via unconscious selection by humans early on a broad pool of disproportionately large neurogenetic targets followed by the fixation of accumulated deleterious mutations on functionally similar targets.
from reassembled genomes of common lab strains, we identify unique, derived variants not present in global populations .
however, high-frequency lab snps found in most or all lab strains reveal an enrichment of x-linked loci and neuro-sensory genes across large extended haplotypes.
among random mutations that continuously accumulate in the laboratory, we detect common adaptive signatures in domesticated lab strains of fruit flies.
decreased selective constraints across low frequency snps  are different from patterns found in the wild and more similar to neutral expectations, suggesting an overall accumulation of deleterious mutations.
yet whether this divergence is due to inadvertent selection in the lab or the fixation of deleterious mutations remains unknown.
model organisms reared for prolonged periods in the laboratory also exhibit similar shifts towards these domesticated behaviors.
