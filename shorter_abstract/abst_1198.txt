the presence of some of the identified serovars suggests that wildlife may play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis to domesticated pigs in vietnam.
the main objective of this study was to evaluate the sero-prevalence and incidence of presumptive infective leptospira serovars in fattening pigs from  <dig> provinces in vietnam.
therefore, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems are needed to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and prevent or reduce infection in humans and animals.
blood samples from fattening pigs were randomly collected at slaughterhouses.
leptospirosis in pigs may be a useful indicator of the human/animal burden in vietnam and a risk assessment tool.
the sero-prevalence among female pigs  was slightly higher than among male pigs , but this difference was not statistically significant.
leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease with a worldwide distribution.
we collected  <dig> sera samples from  <dig> provinces  between january and early june  <dig>  the microscopic agglutination test  was used to identify the serogroups/serovars.

overall, the sero-prevalence was  <dig> %  and serovar tarassovi mitis  had the highest prevalence followed by australis , javanica  and autumnalis  using a cutoff .
in pigs, leptospirosis can result in reproductive problems  which lead to economic loss.
