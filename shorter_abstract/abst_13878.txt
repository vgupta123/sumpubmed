it is well suited to both individual research programs and core facilities.
processing raw dna sequence data is an especially challenging task for relatively small laboratories and core facilities that produce as many as  <dig> or more dna sequences per week from multiple projects in widely differing species.
the database not only serves as a data repository, but also controls processing of trace files.
magic-spp is a dna sequence processing package consisting of an oracle 9i relational database, a perl pipeline, and user interfaces implemented either as javaserver pages  or as a java graphical user interface .
it offers a unique combination of features that permit administration by a biologist with little or no informatics background.
in the sequence trimming algorithm it employs new features designed to improve performance with respect to concerns such as concatenated linkers, identification of the expected start position of a vector insert, and extending the useful length of trimmed sequences by bridging short regions of low quality when the following high quality segment is sufficiently long to justify doing so.
magic-spp includes an administrative interface, a laboratory information management system, and interfaces for exploring sequences, monitoring quality control, and troubleshooting problems related to sequencing activities.
