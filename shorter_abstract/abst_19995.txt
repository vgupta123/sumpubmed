lasting memory, however, is thought to also require recapitulation of recent memory traces during subsequent rest – a phenomenon, termed memory trace reactivation, which is compromised in hippocampal ca <dig> with progressive age.
consistent with the observation of memory trace reactivation in dg, the probability that an individual granule cell transcribes zif <dig> during rest in the animal’s home cage is increased by recent experience in a novel environment.
surprisingly, a comparable increase was observed in the probability of granule cells in the aged dg expressing zif <dig> during rest.
moreover, no significant age-related difference was observed in the number of granule cells expressing zif <dig> during rest.
aging is typically accompanied by memory decline and changes in hippocampal function.
using zif <dig> transcription to measure granule cell recruitment, dg activity in adult and aged animals was assessed both during spatial exploration and as animals remained at rest in the home cage in order to detect potential memory-related replay.
these data lead to the hypothesis that the input the aged dg receives from backprojections from ca <dig>  remains functionally intact despite loss of innervation from the perforant path.
among these changes is a decline in the activity of the dentate gyrus  during behavior.
