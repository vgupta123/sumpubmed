the genes were split into  <dig>  that were clearly expressed  and  <dig>  that had expression levels in the background range .
gender differences in gene expression were estimated in liver samples from  <dig> males and  <dig> females.
the study tested  <dig>  genes for a gender difference using a design that adjusted for sources of variation associated with cdna arrays, normalization, hybridizations and processing conditions.
the distribution of p-values from the 'not expressed' group was consistent with no gender differences.
observed gender differences in gene expression were small.
when selecting genes with gender differences based upon their p-values, false discovery rates exceed  <dig> % for any set of genes, essentially making it impossible to identify any specific genes with a gender difference.
