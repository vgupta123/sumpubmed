the differential ability of the eef1a isoforms to interact with signaling molecules discovered in this study could be associated with cancer-related properties of eef1a <dig>
it has been determined by multiple md simulation that eef1a <dig> shows increased reciprocal flexibility of structural domains i and ii and less average distance between the domains, while increased non-correlated diffusive atom motions within protein domains characterize eef1a <dig>  the divergence in the dynamic properties of eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> is caused by interactions of amino acid residues that differ between the two variants with neighboring residues and water environment.
this finding is in line with our earlier experimental observation that the transition between "open" and "closed" conformations of eef1a could be essential for binding of trna and/or other biological ligands.
we reasoned that the background for the functional difference of eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> might lie in changes of dynamics of the isoforms.
importantly, the appearance of eef1a <dig> in tissues in which the variant is not normally expressed can be coupled to cancer development.
despite the strong similarity, the isoforms differ in some properties.
the main correlated motion of both protein isoforms is the change in proximity of domains i and ii which can lead to disappearance of the gap between the domains and transition of the protein into a "closed" conformation.
we have found that reversible transitions between "open" and "close" conformations of eef1a provide a molecular background for the earlier observation that the eef1a molecule is able to change the shape upon interaction with trna.
in addition, eef1a is involved in carcinogenesis and apoptosis and can interact with large number of non-translational ligands.
eukaryotic translation elongation factor eef1a directs the correct aminoacyl-trna to ribosomal a-site.
