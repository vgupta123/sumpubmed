this study aimed at fully characterizing the structure of the wdr <dig> transcript, detecting the possible transcript variants and revealing its expression profile in zebrafish, a powerful model organism for studying development and disease.
we observed that zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one open reading frame while the transcript has one 5′ untranslated region  and the prediction of the 3′ utr was mainly confirmed along with a detected insertion site in the embryo and adult brain.
as expected in human and mouse orthologous proteins, zebrafish wdr <dig> is predicted to possess a beach  domain, a major facilitator superfamily domain and wd40-repeats, which indicates a conserved function in these species.
finally, expression of wdr <dig> was detected in the adult brain and eye tissues, including but not restricted to photoreceptors of the retina, presumptive purkinje cells and some neurogenic brains regions.
taken together these data emphasize the importance of this gene during neurodevelopment and a possible role for neuronal proliferation.
wdr <dig>  is associated with cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation and disequilibrium syndrome .
the  <dig> and 18 hpf were critical timepoints of development regarding wdr <dig> expression.
this insertion site was also found in testis, heart, liver, eye, tail and muscle, however, there was no amplicon in kidney, intestine and gills, which might be the result of possible alternative polyadenylation processes among tissues.
