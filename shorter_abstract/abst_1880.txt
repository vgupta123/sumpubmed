the results of this study provide comprehensive knowledge on global gene expression, and biological functionalities of differentially expressed genes in chicken embryo lung cells in response to iltv infections.
a bioinformatics tool  used to analyze biological functions and pathways on the group of  <dig> differentially expressed genes revealed that  <dig> possible gene networks with intermolecular connections among  <dig> functionally identified genes.
results showed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to iltv infection that include genes involved in the immune system , cell cycle regulation , matrix metalloproteinases  and cellular metabolism.
to better understand host-iltv interactions at the host transcriptional level, a microarray analysis was performed using  <dig> Ã—  <dig> k agilent chicken custom oligo microarrays.
differential expression for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr .
microarrays were hybridized using the two color hybridization method with total rna extracted from iltv infected chicken embryo lung cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days post infection .
these  <dig> genes were classified into a number of functional groups that included cancer, genetic disorder, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell death.
infection by infectious laryngotracheitis virus  causes acute respiratory diseases in chickens often with high mortality.
