transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing atapy <dig> fused to the snap--tag were used for indirect immunofluorescence and atapy <dig> was detected in punctate structures within the cell.
in order to identify the nature of the atapy1-positive structures, atapy1-gfp expressing seedlings were treated with the endocytic marker stain fm4- <dig> -4--pyridinium dibromide) and crossed with a transgenic line expressing the trans-golgi marker rab e1d.
neither fm4- <dig> nor rab e1d co-localized with atapy <dig>  however, live imaging of transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing atapy1-gfp and either the fluorescent protein-tagged golgi marker membrin  <dig>  syntaxin of plants  <dig> or golgi transport  <dig> protein homolog showed co-localization.
the subcellular localization of atapy <dig> was investigated to corroborate an extracellular function.
the golgi localization was confirmed by immunogold labeling of atapy1-gfp.
atapy <dig> is an integral golgi protein with the substrate specificity typical for golgi apyrases.

to determine if atapy <dig> is a soluble or membrane protein, microsomal membranes were isolated and treated with various solubilizing agents.
only sds and urea  were able to release the atapy <dig> protein from microsomal membranes.
the same signal pattern was found in seedlings stably overexpressing atapy1-gfp by indirect immunofluorescence and live imaging.
there was no indication of extracellular atapy <dig> by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against snap and gfp, live imaging of atapy1-gfp and immunogold labeling of atapy1-gfp.
the two highly similar arabidopsis apyrases atapy <dig> and atapy <dig> were previously shown to be involved in plant growth and development, evidently by regulating extracellular atp signals.
