a preliminary trial allowed discovery of the whole set of putative alleles/paralogs corresponding to  <dig> previously identified apomixis-associated candidate genes.
gene ontology  analyses of this set of transcripts indicated that the main molecular pathways altered in the apomictic genotype correspond to specific biological processes, like biotic and abiotic stress responses, growth, development, cell death and senescence.
the use of the 454/roche flx+ transcriptome database will allow the detailed characterization of floral alleles/paralogs of apomixis candidate genes identified in prior and future work.
moreover, it was used to reveal additional candidate genes differentially represented in apomictic and sexual flowers.
we used a long-read 454/roche flx+ sequencing strategy to produce robust reference transcriptome datasets from florets of sexual and apomictic paspalum notatum genotypes and delivered a list of transcripts showing differential representation in both reproductive types.
a group of physically-supported paspalum mrna and est sequences matched with high level of confidence to both sexual and apomictic libraries.
