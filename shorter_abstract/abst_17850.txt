these proteins were mapped to gene symbols and compared with gene sets representing canonical pathways, more than  <dig>  genes were extracted from the enriched gene sets.
proteomics research is enabled with the high-throughput technologies, but our ability to identify expressed proteome is limited in small samples.
approximately  <dig>  proteins were detected in each run of the small sample proteomics.
of identified pathways  <dig> were shared between three individual small sample runs.
current technologies enable us to directly detect 10% of expressed proteomes from small sample comprising as few as  <dig> cells.
genes present in both the enriched gene sets  and in small sample proteomics data correspond to approximately 50% of expressed proteomes in larger sample proteomics data.
the comparison of proteomics and transcriptomics data, suggests that highly expressed transcripts have high probability of protein expression.
here, we propose pathway analysis and combination of microproteomics and transcriptomics analyses to improve mass-spectrometry protein identification from small size samples.
this knowledge-based approach includes pathway analysis and combination of gene expression and protein expression data for target prioritization.
the identified canonical pathways were largely overlapping between individual runs.
in addition, 90% of targets from canonical pathways were estimated to be expressed.
