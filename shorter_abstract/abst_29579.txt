comparison of murf <dig> profile hidden markov model  against function-known profile hmms in pfam, panther and tigr shows that murf <dig> is a complex i protein, but without specifying the exact subunit.
therefore, we constructed profile hmms for each individual subunit, using all available sequences clustered at various identity thresholds.
in the present study, we test this assignment by using bioinformatics methods that are highly sensitive in identifying remote homologs and confront the prediction with available biological knowledge.
this hypothetical gene occurs in the mitochondrial genome of kinetoplastids, a group of unicellular eukaryotes including the causative agents of african sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis.
