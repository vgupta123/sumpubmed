we therefore aimed to develop a cytokine release assay to measure antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses of meerkats.
ongoing longitudinal studies aim to evaluate the value of the ipra as a diagnostic test of m. suricattae infection in individual animals.
an ip- <dig> elisa was selected to measure the release of this cytokine in whole blood in response to bovigam® pc-hp stimulating antigen, a commercial peptide pool of m. bovis antigens.
this ip- <dig> release assay  was then evaluated in free-living meerkats with known m. suricattae exposure, categorized as having either a low, moderate or high risk of infection with this pathogen.
the odds of an animal testing positive was  <dig>  times greater for animals with a high risk of m. suricattae infection compared to animals with a low risk.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  were evaluated for the detection of interferon-gamma  and ifn-γ inducible protein  <dig>  in meerkat plasma.
using this protocol, captive meerkats with no known m. suricattae exposure  were tested and results were used to define a diagnostic cut off value .
these results support the use of this assay as a measure of m. suricattae exposure in meerkat populations.
