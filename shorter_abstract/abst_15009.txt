kcnq1ot <dig> expression can be abolished on the paternal chromosome by deleting ic <dig> .
the corresponding paternal alleles of these genes are silenced in cis by an incompletely understood mechanism involving the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment mediated by the long non-coding rna kcnq1ot <dig> initiated from imprinting centre  <dig> .
taken together, our results demonstrate that all the distal chromosome  <dig> imprinted genes implicated in placental function are silenced by ic <dig> and kcnq1ot <dig> on the paternal allele.
we have previously reported that maternal inheritance of a large truncation of chr <dig> encompassing the entire ic2-regulated domain  leads to embryonic lethality at mid-gestation accompanied by severe placental abnormalities.
imprinted expression of several of the ic2-regulated genes critical to placentation is also faithfully recapitulated in deltel7/ic2ko placentae.
furthermore, our results demonstrate that the methylated maternal ic <dig> is not required for the regulation of nearby genes.
the results show the potential for fully rescuing trans placental abnormalities that are caused by imprinting defects.
when the ic2ko mutation is paternally inherited, epigenetic silencing is lost in the region and the deltel <dig> lethality is rescued in compound heterozygotes, leading to viable deltel7/ic2ko mice.
