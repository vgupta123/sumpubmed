light microscopy has shown that the rn contains specific extracellular matrix  proteins, which are putative molecular "footholds" for migration, and are known ligands for lymphocyte integrin adhesion receptors.
the lymph node  is a crossroads of blood and lymphatic vessels allowing circulating lymphocytes to efficiently recognize foreign molecules displayed on antigen presenting cells.
these findings suggest a molecular basis for how the rn functions as a pathway for lymphocyte migration within the lymph node.
to investigate whether ecm proteins of the rn are present on the outer surface of the frc and are thus accessible to migrating lymphocytes, ultrastructural immunohistochemical staining of cynomolgus monkey ln was performed using antibodies to human ecm proteins that were successfully employed at the light microscopic level.
in contrast, the matrix proteins laminin, fibronectin, collagen iv, and tenascin were observed within the reticular fibers and also on the outer membrane surface of the frc.
increasing evidence indicates that after crossing high endothelial venules, lymphocytes migrate within the node along the reticular network , a scaffold of fibers enwrapped by fibroblastic reticular cells .
the fibrillar collagens i and iii were observed primarily within the reticular network fibers themselves.
