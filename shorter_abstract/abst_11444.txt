this provides a research opportunity to identify and study co-expressed gene modules whose transcription is controlled by shared gene regulatory networks.
we developed and integrated a set of computational methods of differential gene expression analysis, gene clustering, gene network inference, gene function prediction, and dna motif identification to automatically identify differentially co-expressed gene modules, reconstruct their regulatory networks, and validate their correctness.
our methods were able to identify  <dig> coherent gene modules within which average gene expression correlation coefficients are greater than  <dig>  and reconstruct their putative regulatory networks.
a total of  <dig> modules and their regulatory networks were further validated by the coherence of predicted gene functions and the consistency of putative transcription factor binding motifs.
the same automated method can also be applied to reconstruct differentially co-expressed gene modules and their regulatory networks from gene expression data of any other transcriptome.
the bioinformatics methods and genome-wide data sources for gene expression, clustering, regulation, and function analysis were integrated seamlessly into one modular protocol to systematically analyze and infer modules and networks from only differential expression genes in soybean cells grown under stress conditions.
approximately half of the  <dig> modules were partially supported by the literature, which demonstrates that the bioinformatic methods used can help elucidate the molecular responses of soybean cells upon various environmental stresses.
we tested the methods using microarray data derived from soybean cells grown under various stress conditions.
