this platform can simulate heterogeneous populations with various known and controllable structures under the continuous migration model or the discrete model.
hapsimu provides a common genetic simulation platform to evaluate the impact of population structure on pbas, and compare the relative performance of various population structure identification and pbas methods.
population structure is an important cause leading to inconsistent results in population-based association studies  of human diseases.
moreover, both qualitative and quantitative traits can be simulated using additive genetic model with various genetic parameters designated by users.
due to lack of structural information in real populations, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of population structure on pbas in real populations.
we developed a genetic simulation platform, hapsimu, based on real haplotype data from the hapmap encode project.
various statistical methods have been proposed to reduce the negative impact of population structure on pbas.
