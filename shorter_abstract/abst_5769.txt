subscreening of the library pools that were identified in the primary screen identified several potential novel regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig>  we also tested whether the human orthologues of the medaka genes regulate p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance.
more than one hundred hits that altered the abundance of either p <dig>  mdm <dig>  or both were identified in the primary screen.
the results from this large-scale screening method will contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of these important proteins.
this cross-species approach to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators demonstrates that our medaka unigene cdna library represents a powerful tool to screen for these novel regulators of the p53/mdm <dig> pathway.
here we describe a cell culture based overexpression screen to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators of the p53/mdm <dig> circuit.
all human orthologues regulated p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance in the same manner as the proteins from medaka, which underscores the suitability of this screening methodology for the identification of new modifiers of p <dig> and mdm <dig>
