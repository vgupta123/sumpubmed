the high quality normalized cdna library was constructed from developing seeds of j. curcas for the first time and  <dig> unigenes coding for diverse biological functions including oil biosynthesis were identified.
functional classification revealed unigenes related to broad range of cellular, molecular and biological functions.
genetic improvement in jatropha is needed to increase the seed yield, oil content, drought and pest resistance, and to modify oil composition so that it becomes a technically and economically preferred source for biodiesel production.
these genes will serve as invaluable genetic resource for crop improvement in jatropha to make it an ideal and profitable crop for biodiesel production.
the cdna library contained about  <dig> Ã—  <dig> clones and average insert size of the clones was  <dig>  kb.
however, genetic improvement efforts in jatropha could not take advantage of genetic engineering methods due to lack of cloned genes from this species.
jatropha curcas l. is promoted as an important non-edible biodiesel crop worldwide.
a normalized and full-length enriched cdna library was constructed from developing seeds of j. curcas.
contig size ranged from 2- <dig> and there were  <dig> ests in the contigs.
the remaining  <dig> unigenes which did not show similarity with any genes in the public database may encode for unique genes.
to overcome this hurdle, the current gene discovery project was initiated with an objective of isolating as many functional genes as possible from j. curcas by large scale sequencing of expressed sequence tags .
it showed  <dig> unigenes with significant similarity to known genes and  <dig> unigenes with significant similarity to genes of unknown, hypothetical and putative proteins.
jatropha oil, which is a triacylglycerol, can be directly blended with petro-diesel or transesterified with methanol and used as biodiesel.
