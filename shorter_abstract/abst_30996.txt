extensive database searches were carried out to identify orthologs and close paralogs of hen <dig>  based on the multiple sequence alignment a phylogenetic tree of the hen <dig> family was constructed.
additionally, we identified a la-like predicted rna binding domain located c-terminally to the dsrm domain and a domain with a peptide prolyl cis/trans isomerase  fold, but without the conserved ppiase active site, located n-terminally to the catalytic domain.
the structural model was used as a platform to identify the putative active site and substrate-binding residues of hen and to propose its mechanism of action.
the fold-recognition approach was used to identify related methyltransferases with experimentally solved structures and to guide the homology modeling of the hen <dig> catalytic domain.
the bioinformatics analysis revealed that the catalytic domain of hen <dig> is not closely related to any known rna:2'-oh methyltransferases , but rather to small-molecule methyltransferases.
however, little is known about the details of the structure and the mechanism of action of this enzyme, and about its phylogenetic origin.
