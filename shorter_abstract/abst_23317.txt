using recombinant plasmids, the rep gene homologous to the pcp <dig> gene on pcp <dig> appeared to be functional.
comparative genomics indicated that the identified rep gene homologs were found on two additional toxin plasmids, pcp-os <dig> and pcp-ts <dig>  while functional analysis using recombinant plasmids indicated that pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig> are likely to be incompatible, the plasmid replication and partitioning region of pbcnf <dig> alone was insufficient for stable maintenance of this plasmid.
in addition, the bcn-encoding plasmid, pbcnf <dig>  is likely to be included in the inc family, which includes pcp <dig> and two variant iota-encoding plasmids.
this plasmid has some homology with two previously sequenced c. perfringens plasmids, namely, pcp <dig> carrying a cpb <dig> gene and pip <dig> carrying a bcn gene.
furthermore, the bcn gene on pbcnf <dig> could contribute to gastrointestinal disease induced by enterotoxigenic c. perfringens.
these findings suggest that pbcnf <dig> evolved from recombination events between c. perfringens plasmids and inter-species mobile genetic element.
