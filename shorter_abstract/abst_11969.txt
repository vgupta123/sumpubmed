the results confirmed that some of the naturally occurring ndv virulent strains can cause the disease in ducks, and that ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of nd.
most deaths occurred in 15- and 30-day-old ducklings infected im.
ducks infected in and io sometimes exhibited clinical signs, but seldom died.
newcastle disease  caused by virulent newcastle disease virus  is an acute, highly contagious and fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds.
ducks are generally considered to be natural reservoirs or carriers of ndv while being resistant to ndv strains, even those most virulent for chickens; however, natural nd cases in ducks have been gradually increasing in recent years.
infected ducks could excrete infectious virus from the pharynx and/or cloaca for a short period, which varied with bird age or inoculation route; the longest period was about 7 days.
the rate of virus isolation in tissues from infected ducks was generally low, even in those from dead birds, and it appeared to be unrelated to bird age and infection route.
six breeds  were infected intramuscularly  with jsd <dig> strain at the dose of 5 ×  <dig> eld <dig>  susceptibility to ndv infection among breeds varied, per morbidity and mortality.
the susceptibility of ducks to ndv infection decreased with age.
in the present study, ducks of different breeds and ages were experimentally infected with duck origin virulent ndv strain duck/jiangsu/jsd0812/ <dig>  by various routes to investigate the pathogenicity of ndv in ducks.
