fast methods for evaluating admet properties of small molecules often involve applying a set of simple empirical rules  and as such, compound collections' property profiling can be performed in silico.
this paper presents faf-drugs <dig>  a free adaptable tool for admet filtering of electronic compound collections.
we have developed faf-drugs <dig> to facilitate compound collection preparation, prior to  experimental screening or virtual screening computations.
clearly, these rules cannot assess the full complexity of the human body but can provide valuable information and assist decision-making.
faf-drugs <dig> is a command line utility program  based on the open source chemistry toolkit openbabel, which performs various physicochemical calculations, identifies key functional groups, some toxic and unstable molecules/functional groups.
drug discovery and chemical biology are exceedingly complex and demanding enterprises.
in addition to filtered collections, faf-drugs <dig> can provide, via gnuplot, several distribution diagrams of major physicochemical properties of the screened compound libraries.
