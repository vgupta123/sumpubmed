however, the fact that bhrf <dig> is highly conserved not only in all ebv isolates studied to date but also in the analogous viruses herpesvirus papio and herpesvirus pan that infect baboons and chimpanzees respectively, suggests bhrf <dig> may play an important role in vivo.
we also map the amino acid changes onto the recently solved structure of the ebv bhrf <dig> and reveal that these changes are unlikely to alter the 3d structure of the protein.
in this study we show that the heterologous expression of the previously uncharacterised herpesvirus pan bhrf <dig> in the human burkitt's lymphoma cell line ramos-bl provides similar anti-apoptotic functions to that of ebv bhrf <dig> in response to apoptosis triggered by serum withdrawal, etoposide treatment and ultraviolet  radiation.
these findings show that the functional conservation of bhrf <dig> extends to a lymphoid background, suggesting that the primate virus proteins interact with cellular proteins that are themselves highly conserved across the higher primates.
epstein-barr virus  latently infects about 90% of the human population and is associated with benign and malignant diseases of lymphoid and epithelial origin.
further weight is added to this suggestion when we show that the difference in amino acid sequences map to regions on the 3d structure of ebv bhrf <dig> that are unlikely to change the conformation of the protein.
