the purpose of this study is to evaluate the putative presence of divergences in ole e  <dig> sequences from different olive cultivars.
varietal origin of olive pollen is a major factor determining the diversity of ole e  <dig> variants.
numerous nucleotide substitutions were detected throughout the sequences, many of which resulted in amino acid substitutions in the deduced protein sequences.
key amino acid changes in comparison with "canonical" sequences previously described in the literature included: a) the substitution of c19-relevant to the disulphide bond structure of the protein-, b) the presence of an additional n-glycosylation motif, and c) point substitutions affecting regions of ole e  <dig> already described like relevant for the immunogenicity/allergenicity of the protein.
we consider this information of capital importance for the optimal design of efficient and safe allergen formulations, and useful for the genetic engineering of modified forms of the allergen among other applications.
