here, we use computational modelling to correlate the structure of the stressosome with the efficiency of the phosphorylation reactions that occur upon activation by stress.
we compare different hypotheses about stressosome activation and find that only the model representing the allosteric activation of the kinase rsbt, by phosphorylated rsbr, qualitatively reproduces the experimental data.
our simulations and the associated analysis of published data support the following hypotheses:  a simple boolean model is capable of reproducing stressosome dynamics,  different stressors induce identical stressosome activation patterns, and we also confirm that  phosphorylated rsbr activates rsbt, and  the main purpose of rsbx is to dephosphorylate rsbs-p.
the stressosome is a bacterial signalling complex that responds to environmental changes by initiating a protein partner switching cascade, which leads to the release of the alternative sigma factor, Ïƒb.
stress perception increases the phosphorylation of the stressosome sensor protein, rsbr, and the scaffold protein, rsbs, by the protein kinase, rsbt.
in our model, the phosphorylation of any stressosome protein is dependent upon its nearest neighbours and their phosphorylation status.
