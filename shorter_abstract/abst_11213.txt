based on homology with recently identified udp-galf-transporters in a. fumigatus and a. nidulans, two putative udp-galf-transporters in a. niger were found.
the two putative udp-galf-transporters in a. niger are homologous to each other and are predicted to contain eleven transmembrane domains  or ten transmembrane domains  due to a reduced length of the c-terminal part of the ugtb protein.
the presence of two putative udp-galf-transporters in the genome was not unique for a. niger.
deletion analysis of the single and double mutants in a. niger indicated that the two putative udp-galf-transporters  have a redundant function in udp-galf-transport as only the double mutant displayed a galf-negative phenotype.
a. niger contains two genes encoding udp-galf-transporters.
galactofuranose -containing glycoconjugates are present in numerous microbes, including filamentous fungi where they are important for morphology, virulence and maintaining cell wall integrity.
three of the nine species were outside the aspergillus section nigri, indication an early duplication of udp-galf-transporters and subsequent loss of the ugtb copy in several aspergilli.
from the twenty aspergillus species analysed, nine species contained two additional putative udp-galf-transporters.
deletion and localization studies indicate that ugta and ugtb have redundant functions in the biosynthesis of galf-containing glycoconjugates.
both ugt proteins co-localize with each other as well as with the gdp-mannose nucleotide transporter, as was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, thereby confirming their predicted localization in the golgi.
