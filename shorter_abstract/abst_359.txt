amorphophallus is a genus of perennial plants widely distributed in the tropics or subtropics of west africa and south asia.
a large number of molecular markers are required for genetic diversity study and improving disease resistance in amorphophallus.
genetic diversity analysis was done using  <dig> highly polymorphic ssr markers.
the large number of genetic markers developed in the present study should contribute greatly to research into genetic diversity and germplasm characterization in amorphophallus.
its corms contain a high level of water-soluble glucomannan; therefore, it has long been used as a medicinal herb and food source.
cdnas of a. konjac and a. bulbifer were sequenced using illumina hiseqâ„¢  <dig> sequencing technology.
here, we report large scale of transcriptome sequencing of two species: amorphophallus konjac and amorphophallus bulbifer using deep sequencing technology, and microsatellite  markers were identified based on these transcriptome sequences.
of these,  <dig> primers were synthesized and used for validation of amplification and assessment of polymorphisms in  <dig> individual plants.
