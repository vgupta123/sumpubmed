transcription factor analysis of all up-regulated genes confirmed the importance of p <dig> in the early post-irradiation phase.
integrating mirna and target gene expression data, we found a significant negative correlation between mirna-mrna and identified hepatic leukemia factor  as a transcription factor down-regulated in the response to ir.
using a large dataset of mrna and mirna expression profiles, we describe the interplay of mrnas and mirnas in the regulation of gene expression in response to ir at a posttranscriptional level and their involvement in the modulation of radiation-induced biological pathways.
ir-induced modulations in multiple biological processes have been proposed to be partly regulated by radiosensitive microrna .
in order to gain new insights into the role of mirnas in the regulation of biological processes after ir, we have investigated changes in mrna and mirna expression after high dose ir.
when analyzing mirna expression, we found  <dig> mirnas that were significantly regulated in the late post-irradiation phase.
ir induced changes in the mrna and mirna profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
when comparing non-irradiated and irradiated samples, we detected a time-dependent increase in differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas, with the highest differences detectable 20Â hours after exposure.
