dynamic optimization addresses this class of systems, seeking the computation of the optimal time-varying conditions  to minimize or maximize a certain performance index.
dynamic optimization can solve many important problems in systems biology, including optimal control for obtaining a desired biological performance, the analysis of network designs and computer aided design of biological units.
here, we present a software toolbox, dotcvpsb, which uses a rich ensemble of state-of-the-art numerical methods for solving continuous and mixed-integer dynamic optimization  problems.
the results illustrate how the suite of solvers available allows the efficient solution of a wide class of dynamic optimization problems, including challenging multimodal ones.
the toolbox also offers the possibility of importing sbml models, thus enabling it as a powerful optimization companion to modelling packages in systems biology.
most models in systems biology have a dynamic nature, usually described by sets of differential equations.
the toolbox has been written in matlab and provides an easy and user friendly environment, including a graphical user interface, while ensuring a good numerical performance.
