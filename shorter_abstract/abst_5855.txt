based on a functional genomics analysis, we revealed the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the traits of the chinese maotai-flavored yeast mt <dig>  this work provides new insights for the genetic breeding of yeast and also enriches the genetic resources of yeast.
compared with the type strain s288c, mt <dig> can tolerate high acidity , high ethanol levels  and high temperatures .
revealing genetic mechanisms behind specific physiological characteristics of saccharomyces cerevisiae from specific environments is important for industrial applications and requires precise understanding.
maotai strain mt <dig> was isolated from the complicated chinese maotai-flavored liquor-making environment with extremely high temperatures, and acidic and ethanol stresses.
in addition, mt <dig> can simultaneously utilize various sugars, including glucose, sucrose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose and turanose.
