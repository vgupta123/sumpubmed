after filtering with circular consensus  reads, the mean read length was  <dig> nucleotides .
coverage within gc rich regions  was achieved by capturing long genomic dna  fragments and reading into regions that flank the capture regions.
secondary analysis was conducted using the genome analysis toolkit for snp discovery l and wannovar for functional analysis of variants.
target enrichment was carried out using droplet-base multiplex polymerase chain reaction  technology  designed to yield amplicons averaging 1 kb fragment size from candidate  <dig> loci .
targeted capture enrichment of longer fragments using single molecule sequencing  is expected to improve both sequence assembly and base-call accuracy but, at present, there are very few examples of successful application of these technologic advances in translational research and clinical testing.
filtered functional variants  <dig> of  <dig>  were further confirmed using conventional sanger sequencing.
we developed a targeted single molecule sequencing  panel for genes implicated in ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation  for infertility.

combining emulsion pcr-generated 1 kb amplicons and smrt dna sequencing permitted greater depth of coverage for t-sms and facilitated easier sequence assembly.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report combining emulsion pcr and t-sms for long reads using human dna samples, and ngs panel designed for biomarker discovery in ohss.
