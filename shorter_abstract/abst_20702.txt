fermentative bacteria offer the potential to convert lignocellulosic waste-streams into biofuels such as hydrogen  and ethanol.
we performed a comparative meta-analysis of  reported end-product yields, and  genes encoding pyruvate metabolism and end-product synthesis pathways to identify suitable biomarkers for screening a microorganismâ€™s potential of h <dig> and/or ethanol production, and to identify targets for metabolic engineering to improve biofuel yields.
by linking genome content, reaction thermodynamics, and end-product yields, we offer potential targets for optimization of either ethanol or h <dig> yields through metabolic engineering.
lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate:formate lyase are not conducive for ethanol and/or h <dig> production.
our interest in h <dig> and/or ethanol optimization restricted our meta-analysis to organisms with sequenced genomes and limited branched end-product pathways.
bioinformatic analysis revealed that the absence of genes encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase  in caldicellulosiruptor, thermococcus, pyrococcus, and thermotoga species coincide with high h <dig> yields and low ethanol production.
current fermentative h <dig> and ethanol yields, however, are below theoretical maxima, vary greatly among organisms, and depend on the extent of metabolic pathways utilized.
here we show that composition of genes encoding pathways involved in pyruvate catabolism and end-product synthesis pathways can be used to approximate potential end-product distribution patterns.
this may be attributed to the presence of genes encoding proteins that promote nadh production.
for fermentative h <dig> and/or ethanol production to become practical, biofuel yields must be increased.
the absence of hydrogenases in geobacillus and bacillus species did not confer high ethanol production, but rather high lactate production.
we have identified a number of genetic biomarkers for streamlining ethanol and h <dig> producing capabilities.
only thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus produced relatively high ethanol and low h <dig> yields.
while the type of encoded hydrogenases appear to have little impact on h <dig> production in organisms that do not encode ethanol producing pathways, they do influence reduced end-product yields in those that do.
