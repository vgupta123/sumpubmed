human anthrax has also been frequently reported in guizhou in recent year.
the results will provide important information for prevention of anthrax and also enhances our understanding of genetic characteristics of b. anthracis in china.
cluster tree based on  <dig> isolates from guizhou province and  <dig> worldwide distributed isolates  showed they were divided into three clusters, designated a, b and c. all the  <dig> isolates were distributed in cluster a, which were further grouped into a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> sub-clusters.
however, there is limited information on the genetic background of local b. anthracis isolates in guizhou province.
in the present study, we employed multiple locus variable number tandem repeats  analysis  assay to analyze the genetic characteristics of b. anthracis strains isolated in guizhou province and their relationships to worldwide distributed isolates.
a total of  <dig> isolates of b. anthracis from soil, human, cattle, dog and water of different anthrax epidemics in guizhou province from  <dig> to  <dig> were confirmed with phage lysis test, penicillin inhibition test and pcr.
<dig> novel mts of b. anthracis from guizhou were revealed and their relationships to worldwide isolates were showed.
guizhou province is an old foci of anthrax in the southwest of china.
mlva- <dig> discriminated them into  <dig> unique mlva types , which were novel mts compared with the previous reports.
minimum spanning tree  based on the mlva data showed that the  <dig> mlva profiles of isolates from guizhou province and  <dig> mlva profiles of worldwide distributed isolates formed three clonal complexes  and ten singletons.
<dig> isolates from guizhou province were closely grouped in each of the sub-clusters, respectively.
