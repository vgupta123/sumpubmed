we addressed this challenge by using custom probes for multiplexed hybrid capture to enrich for and sequence  <dig> borrelia burgdorferi genomes from field samples of its arthropod vector.
hybrid capture enabled sequencing of nearly the complete genome  of the borrelia burgdorferi pathogen with 132-fold coverage, and identification of up to  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms per genome.
the proprosed culture-independent method enables efficient whole genome capture and sequencing of pathogens directly from arthropod vectors, thus making population genomic study of vector-borne and zoonotic infectious diseases economically feasible and scalable.
furthermore, given the similarities of invertebrate field specimens to other mixed dna templates characterized by a high ratio of host to pathogen dna, we discuss the potential applicabilty of hybrid capture for genomic study across diverse study systems.
however, next generation sequencing technologies have not yet been fully harnessed for the study of vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens, due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality pathogen sequence data directly from field specimens with a high ratio of host to pathogen dna.
