ksrepo successfully predicted significance for five frontline prostate cancer therapies, representing a significant enrichment from over  <dig> ctd compounds, and achieved specificity similar to other repositioning methods.
we tested ksrepoâ€™s performance on a set of five prostate cancer datasets using the comparative toxicogenomics database  as our database of gene-compound interactions.
a number of promising computational techniques have been developed to aid in repositioning, however, the majority of available methodologies require highly specific data inputs that preclude the use of many datasets and databases.
we present ksrepo, which enables investigators to use any data inputs for computational drug repositioning.
ksrepo eliminates the need for a single microarray platform as input and allows for the use of a variety of drug and chemical exposure databases.
