capromorelin oral solution  was tested in healthy adult male and female beagle dogs  for its effect on food consumption and body weight.
capromorelin treated dogs had increased mean  food consumption compared to placebo treated dogs .
treatment with the oral solution resulted in dramatic increases in appetite, as measured by food consumption, of over 60% compared to placebo.
capromorelin is the first ghrelin receptor agonist developed for appetite stimulation in any species, and represents a novel mechanism of action for this clinical use.

dogs were observed for clinical signs, physical examinations were completed prior to and at the end of treatment, and blood was drawn before and after treatment for evaluation of serum chemistry and hematology parameters.
capromorelin was well-tolerated, with no abnormalities seen on physical examination or clinical pathology.
treated dogs also had increased mean body weights compared to placebo treated dogs .
dogs can suffer from inappetence caused by a variety of medical conditions.
this study supports the effectiveness of capromorelin oral solution as an appetite stimulant in dogs.
a drug with a new mechanism of action, capromorelin, has potential to stimulate appetite in dogs.
capromorelin is a ghrelin receptor agonist, which mimics the action of endogenous ghrelin.
