in this study, we examined  <dig>  previously generated peptide mass spectra from  <dig>  saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins for the presence of arginine and lysine methylation.
functionally, methylated proteins were significantly enriched for protein translation, ribosomal biogenesis and assembly and organellar organisation and were predominantly found in the cytoplasm and ribosome.
this was done using the findmod tool and  <dig> filters that took advantage of the high number of replicate analysis per protein and the presence of overlapping peptides.
some 43% of methylated lysine sites were predicted to be amenable to ubiquitination, suggesting methyl-lysine might block the action of ubiquitin ligase.
a total of  <dig> high-confidence lysine and arginine methylation sites were found in  <dig> proteins.
