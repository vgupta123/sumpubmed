genes involved in lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, and cell wall modifications were highly modified in the affected inner cortex, while energy-related and stress-related genes were mostly altered in the outer cortex.
over  <dig> million short single-end reads were mapped onto the malus consensus coding sequence set, and differences in the expression profiles between healthy and affected tissues were assessed to identify candidate genes associated with internal browning in a tissue-specific manner.
the expression levels of several of them were confirmed using qrt-pcr.
additionally, a set of novel browning-specific differentially expressed genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, was validated in apples stored for various periods at different controlled atmosphere conditions, giving rise to potential biomarkers associated with high risk of browning development.
based on a visual browning index, the inner and outer cortex of the stored apples was classified as healthy or affected tissue.
a conceptual model, including energy-related  and lipid-related genes , for browning development in apple is proposed, which may be relevant for future studies towards improving the postharvest life of apple.
