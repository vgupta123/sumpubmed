enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  is a major cause of diarrhea in inhabitants from low-income countries and in visitors to these countries.
we used 16s rrna  gene sequencing to study changes in the fecal microbiota of  <dig> volunteers during a human challenge study with etec  and subsequent treatment with ciprofloxacin.
diarrheal symptoms were associated with high concentrations of fecal e. coli as measured by quantitative culture, quantitative pcr, and normalized number of 16s rrna gene sequences.
ciprofloxacin treatment reorganized microbiota populations; however, the original structure was largely restored at one and three month follow-up visits.
both infection and ciprofloxacin treatment caused variable changes in other bacteria that generally reverted to baseline levels after three months.
the impact of the human intestinal microbiota on the initiation and progression of etec diarrhea is not yet well understood.
symptomatic etec infections, but not asymptomatic infections, were associated with high fecal concentrations of e. coli.

five subjects developed severe diarrhea and seven experienced few or no symptoms.
