our results provide, for the first time, a plausible regulatory link between the nutritional status of the cell and cell replication mediated by pdhr.
this augments our knowledge of the functions of the pdhr-regulon and demonstrates its central importance for further cellular processes in e. coli.
<dig> new genes contained in two operons controlled by pdhr  were identified by analysing a large-scale dataset of e. coli from the many microbes microarray database and novel expression data from a pdhr knockout strain, as well as a pdhr overproducing strain.
we extended the pdhr regulon by  <dig> new genes contained in two operons and validated the regulation of the glcdefgba operon for glycolate utilisation and the dcw-cluster for cell division proteins experimentally.
however, the complete pdhr regulon has not yet been uncovered.
to achieve an extended understanding of its gene regulatory network, we combined large-scale network inference and experimental verification of results obtained by a systems biology approach.
the pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator protein  of escherichia coli acts as a transcriptional regulator in a pyruvate dependent manner to control central metabolic fluxes.
we identified a regulation of the glycolate utilization operon glcdefgba using chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays.
