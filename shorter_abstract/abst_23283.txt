judging by the profiled size classes, all cotton dcls might be working to silence the virus.
deep sequencing of small rnas  from leaves of clrdv-infected cotton plants revealed that the vsrnas were 21- to 24-nucleotides  long and that their sequences matched the viral genome, with higher frequencies of matches in the 3- region.
there were equivalent amounts of sense and antisense vsrnas, and the 22-nt class of small rnas was predominant.
our sequence data strongly suggest that virus-derived double-stranded rna functions as one of the main precursors of vsrnas.
here, we report the characterization of a population of vsrnas from cotton plants infected with cotton leafroll dwarf virus , a member of the genus polerovirus, family luteoviridae.
clrdv is the causal agent of cotton blue disease, which occurs worldwide.
our results are an important contribution for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in this and related diseases.
however, nothing is known about the vsrnas produced during infections of members of the economically important family luteoviridae, a group of phloem-restricted viruses.
this is the first report on the profile of srnas in a plant infected with a virus from the family luteoviridae.
in response to infection, viral genomes are processed by dicer-like  ribonuclease proteins into viral small rnas  of discrete sizes.
vsrnas are then used as guides for silencing the viral genome.
the possible causes for the unexpectedly high accumulation of 22-nt vsrnas are discussed.
the profile of vsrnas produced during the infection process has been extensively studied for some groups of viruses.
