gene expression arrays are valuable and widely used tools for biomedical research.
although major array manufacturers provide annotations of their gene expression arrays, the methods used by various manufacturers are different and the annotations are difficult to keep up to date in the rapidly changing world of biological sequence databases.
our annotations facilitate accurate biological interpretation of gene expression profiles.
effectively translating the results from the microarray into a biological interpretation requires an accurate mapping between the probesets on the array and the genes that they are targeting.
