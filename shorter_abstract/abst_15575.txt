in the wild type, the etpr gene appears to be constitutively expressed and its expression level not to be modulated upon effector presence.
in the present study, a molecular genetic approach was used to study the predicted function of eba <dig>
growth similar to the wild type was restored in the Δetpr mutant background by in trans expression of plasmid-born etpr.
this study provides experimental evidence for the genome predicted σ54-dependent regulator etpr  of "a. aromaticum" ebn <dig> to be responsive to p-ethylphenol, as well as its degradation intermediate p-hydroxyacetophenone, and to control the expression of genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of these two aromatic growth substrates.
comparison with the regulatory domains of known phenol- and alkylbenzene-responsive ntrc-type regulators of pseudomonas spp.
in case of the recently elucidated p-ethylphenol/p-hydroxyacetophenone pathway, the highly substrate-specific regulation was implicated to involve the predicted σ54-dependent, ntrc-type regulator eba <dig>  the latter was suggested to control the expression of the two neighboring gene clusters encoding the catabolic enzymes as well as a corresponding putative solvent efflux system.
furthermore, expression of the "p-ethylphenol" gene clusters as well as corresponding protein formation was shown to depend on the presence of both, etpr and either p-ethylphenol or p-hydroxyacetophenone.
the denitrifying betaproteobacterium "aromatoleum aromaticum" ebn <dig> anaerobically utilizes a multitude of aromatic compounds via specific peripheral degradation routes.
