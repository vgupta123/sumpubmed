our evaluations show that it can detect weak periodic patterns which are not easily discovered using a sequential approach, i.e.
due to the turning of the dna helix, a small modification of the distance between a pair of sites may sometimes drastically disrupt function, while insertion of a full helical turn of dna  between cis elements may cause functionality to be restored.
helicis provides simple and efficient de novo discovery of colocalized dna motif pairs, with or without periodic spacing.
correct temporal and spatial gene expression during metazoan development relies on combinatorial interactions between different transcription factors.
as a consequence, cis-regulatory elements often colocalize in clusters termed cis-regulatory modules.
we have developed a web based motif discovery tool, helicis, which features a flexible model which allows de novo detection of motifs with periodic spacing.
depending on the parameter settings it may also be used for discovering colocalized motifs without periodicity or motifs separated by a fixed gap of known or unknown length.
recently, de novo motif discovery methods which incorporate organizational properties such as colocalization and order preferences have been developed, but there are no tools which incorporate periodic spacing into the model.
it provides a simple to use web interface which interactively visualizes the current settings and thereby makes it easy to understand the parameters and the model structure.
