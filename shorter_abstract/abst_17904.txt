based on several filtering criteria, a final set of  <dig>  putative sequence variants with characteristics favorable for illumina infinium genotyping technology  were mined from the sequence data generated across six diverse sunflower lines.
snp calling was performed by aligning sequencing data from the six sunflower lines to the assembled reference rha  <dig>  on average,  <dig> snp was located every 143 bp of the sunflower genome sequence.
about  <dig>  mb of sunflower genome distributed over  <dig>  contigs were obtained upon assembly of rha  <dig> sequencing data, the contig lengths ranged from  <dig> to 950 bp with an n <dig> length of 393 bp.
through a national sunflower association  funded initiative, we report on the process of snp discovery through reductive genome sequencing and local assembly of six diverse sunflower inbred lines that represent oil as well as confection types.
