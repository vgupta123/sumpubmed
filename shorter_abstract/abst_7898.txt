the expression of osteocalcin mrna was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction .
treatment of lm <dig> cells with genistein induced morphological changes, markedly decreased the formation of multilayer masses of cells, and markedly increased the expression of osteocalcin mrna.
β-catenin in untreated cells was located in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus, while in genistein-treated cells it was translocated near to the plasma membrane.
the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of genistein, an isoflavone found in soy, on the invasive and motile potential of osteosarcoma cells.
in japan, soy is consumed in a wide variety of forms, such as miso soup and soy sauce.
the subcellular localization and cellular level of β-catenin were determined by immunofluorescence and western blot.
therefore, the prevention of pulmonary metastases during the early stage of tumor development is critical for the improvement of the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients.
the effect of genistein on cell proliferation was determined by dna measurement in the cultures and 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine  incorporation study.
genistein may be useful as an anti-metastatic drug for osteosarcoma through its differentiation-inducing effects.
the assays of cell invasion and motility were performed using the cell culture inserts with either matrigel-coated membranes or uncoated membranes in the invasion chambers.
genistein decreased invasive and motile potential by inducing cell differentiation in lm <dig> cells.
for examining cell morphology, the ethanol-fixed cells were stained with hematoxylin-eosin .
the expression and secretion of mmp- <dig> were determined by immunohistochemistry and gelatin zymography.
