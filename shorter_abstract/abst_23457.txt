the dominant-negative form of mutant pkc-δ  reduced the ifn-α-induced jnk <dig> activation, trail promoter activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , and increase in propidium iodide  positive cells.
moreover, a constitutively active form of mutant pkc-δ enhanced the ifn-α-induced trail promoter activity and loss of ΔΨm in daudi b lymphoma cells.
in the present study, we explored upstream component of the prolonged ifn-α-initiated activation of jnk <dig>
the interaction of the consequent enhanced trail expression with trail-receptor results in a loss of ΔΨm and increase in pi positive cells.
the ifn-α-induced activation of jnk <dig> and the trail promoter was also attenuated by the pkc-δ inhibitor rottlerin.
ifn-α caused activation of pkc-δ in daudi b lymphoma cells and myeloma u <dig> cells, as detected by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of pkc-δ.
