here, we report a user-friendly strategy based on the extrinsic apoptosis pathway that allows enrichment of a polyclonal gene-edited cell population, by selecting cas9-transfected cells that co-express dominant-negative mutants of death receptors.
stringent assessment of our advanced selection strategy via sanger sequencing, t <dig> endonuclease i  assay and direct phenotyping confirmed a strong and rapid enrichment of cas9-expressing cell populations, in some cases reaching up to 100Â % within one hour.
however, the phenotyping of the knock-out effect requires a high dna editing efficiency.
moreover, our data emphasize that the insertion and deletion pattern induced by a specific grna is reproducible across different cell lines.
