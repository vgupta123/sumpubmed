characteristics of conserved poly sites such as processing efficiency and tissue-specificity were analyzed.
conserved sites show a higher processing efficiency but no difference in tissular distribution when compared to non-conserved sites.
alternative polyadenylation is a widespread mechanism contributing to transcript diversity in eukaryotes.
this analysis allows us to identify potential functional alternative poly sites and provides clues on the selective mechanisms at play in the appearance of multiple poly sites and their maintenance in the 3' utrs of genes.
