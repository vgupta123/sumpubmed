whether this relates to an exposure to carcinogenic metals remains unclear.
the detection and quantification of metallothioneins in bladder tissue of both cases and controls was performed by immunohistochemistry.
increased expression of metallothioneins was associated with bladder tumors when compared with non-tumoral bladder tissue .
however, as for the concentration of metals in bladder tissue, the differences were not significant.
in order to examine the association between the expression of metallothioneins and bladder tumors, and to compare the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in animals with bladder tumors and animals without bladder tumors,  <dig> cases of bovine bladder tumors and  <dig> controls were collected.
though the sample size was small, the present study shows an association between bladder tumors and metallothioneins.
