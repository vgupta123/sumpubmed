drought is a major constraint for plant growth and crop productivity that is receiving an increased attention due to global climate changes.
proteomics revealed that water deficit deeply affects chloroplast protein repertoire , mainly involving energy-related functional species.
under stress conditions, tomato plants showed stunted growth, and elevated levels of proline, abscisic acid  and late embryogenesis abundant gene transcript.

although our data suggest the activation of a specific retrograde signaling pathway and interconnection with aba signaling network in tomato, the involvement and fine regulation of such pathway need to be further investigated through the development and characterization of ad hoc designed plant mutants.
following the rewatering cycle, physiological parameters and metabolite levels indicated a recovery of tomato plant functions, while proteomics revealed a still ongoing adjustment of the chloroplast protein repertoire, which was even wider than during the drought phase .
here, we investigated the chloroplast response to a severe drought treatment and a subsequent recovery cycle in tomato through physiological, metabolite and proteomic analyses.
changes in gene expression of candidate genes and accumulation of aba suggested the activation under stress of a specific chloroplast-to-nucleus  signaling pathway and interconnection with the aba-dependent network.
our results give an original overview on the role of chloroplast as enviromental sensor by both coordinating the expression of nuclear-encoded plastid-localised proteins and mediating plant stress response.
