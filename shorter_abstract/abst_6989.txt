we sequenced the leaf transcriptome of c. pictus using illumina reversible dye terminator sequencing technology and used combination of bioinformatics tools for identifying transcripts related to anti-diabetic properties of c. pictus.
sequential extraction and high performance liquid chromatography  confirmed the presence of bixin in c. pictus methanolic extracts.
we also report many other transcripts for the biosynthesis of antitumor, anti-oxidant and antimicrobial metabolites of c. pictus leaves.
solid molecular signatures  for the anti-diabetic properties of c. pictus leaves and vital clues related to the other phytochemical functions like antitumor, anti-oxidant, immuno-modulatory, anti-microbial and anti-malarial properties through the secondary metabolite pathway annotations are reported.
we identified transcripts related to pathways of bixin biosynthesis and geraniol and geranial biosynthesis as major transcripts from the class of isoprenoid secondary metabolites and validated the presence of putative norbixin methyltransferase, a precursor of bixin.
the data provided will be of immense help to researchers working in the treatment of dm using herbal therapies.
costus pictus d. don is popularly known as “insulin plant” in southern india whose leaves have been reported to increase insulin pools in blood plasma.
a number of plant species are known to possess diabetic control properties.
the transcripts encoding these terpenoids are known to be peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  agonists and anti-glycation agents.
next generation sequencing is employed as a powerful tool for identifying molecular signatures in the transcriptome related to physiological functions of plant tissues.
