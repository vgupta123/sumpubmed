it forms part of a three-domain form of rbbp <dig> containing the dwnn domain, a zinc knuckle and a ring finger domain, which is found in all eukaryotic genomes so far examined, in the majority of cases at single copy number.
in humans and mice it interacts with both p <dig> and rb, and plays a role in the induction of apoptosis and regulation of the cell cycle.
we show here using heteronuclear nmr that the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of rbbp <dig> constitute a novel ubiquitin-like domain, which we have called the dwnn domain.
furthermore, the fact that the dwnn domain is independently expressed in higher vertebrates leads us to propose that the domain may itself function as a novel ubiquitin-like modifier of other proteins.
the di-glycine motif that is characteristic of proteins involved in ubiquitination is found in the human and mouse form of the domain, although it is not present in all organisms.
rbbp <dig> is a  <dig> kda splicing-associated protein that has been identified as an e <dig> ligase due to the presence of a ring finger domain.
the ubiquitin-like structure of the domain greatly increases the likelihood that rbbp <dig> functions through some form of ubiquitin-like modification.
dwnn is a novel ubiquitin-like domain found only at the n-terminus of the rbbp <dig> family of splicing-associated proteins.
the domain is also independently expressed in vertebrates as a single domain protein.
