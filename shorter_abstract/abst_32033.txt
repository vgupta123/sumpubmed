the classical mspi/hpaii combination of restriction enzymes targeted cpg islands whereas the other methods covered 5mc and 5hmc sites outside of these regions.
the output of the three methods differed in genomic coverage as well as in the nature of the identified sites.
these results support the hypothesis of a regulatory phase of hypomethylation in repeat sequences during early embryogenesis.
we therefore sought to obtain a representation of differentially 5mc or 5hmc loci during bovine early embryo stages through the use of three complementary methods, based on selective methyl-sensitive restriction and enrichment by ligation-mediated pcr or on subtractive hybridization.
yet, which genomic sites are changing and what are the contributions of methylation  and hydroxymethylation  to this epigenetic remodeling is still unknown.
when studying early development, options for methylation profiling are limited by the unavailability of sufficient dna material from these scarce samples and limitations are aggravated in non-model species due to the lack of technological platforms.
