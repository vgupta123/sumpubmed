this revealed relatively small differences in gene expression.
we have found very extensive differences in gene expression between first-stage larvae  passed in faeces and infective l3s preparing to infect hosts.
we have constructed an s. ratti cdna microarray and used it to interrogate changes in gene expression during the free-living phase of the s. ratti life-cycle.
we find little evidence for the conservation of transcription profiles between s. ratti and s. stercoralis or c. elegans.
this is the first multi-gene study of gene expression in s. ratti.
this highlights the forthcoming challenge in actually determining the role of these genes in the life of s. ratti.
we have also compared gene expression in l <dig> stages destined to develop directly into infective l3s with those destined to develop indirectly into free-living adults.
we find inconsistencies between est representation data and microarray hybridization data in the identification of genes with stage-specific expression and highly expressed genes.
this has shown that robust data can be generated, with consistent measures of expression within computationally determined clusters and contigs.
