the best designed structure  contained a polar, histidine-rich pore, forming an extensive hydrogen bonding network.
we gained novel insights into tim barrel folding mechanisms from studying natural tim barrel structures, and from analyzing previous tim barrel design attempts.
computational protein design is a rapidly maturing field within structural biology, with the goal of designing proteins with custom structures and functions.
computational protein design and analysis was performed using the rosetta software suite and custom scripts.
here, we have adapted algorithms from the rosetta software suite to design much larger proteins, based on ideal geometric and topological criteria.
despite the detection of molten characteristics, the creation of a soluble, cooperatively folding protein represents an advancement over previous attempts at tim barrel design.
our techniques may be used to create other large, internally symmetric proteins.
extensive protein design simulations coupled with ab initio modeling yielded several all-atom models of ideal, 4-fold symmetric tim barrels.
for our first design attempt, we targeted the  <dig> tim barrel scaffold.
symmetrin- <dig> adopted a monomeric conformation, with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and displayed well resolved 1d-nmr spectra.
it showed circular dichroism spectra characteristic of well-folded alpha/beta proteins.
temperature melting experiments revealed cooperative and reversible unfolding, with a tm of 44 °c and a gibbs free energy of unfolding  of  <dig>  kj/mol.
1d nmr and 2d hsqc experiments were performed to determine protein structural characteristics.
