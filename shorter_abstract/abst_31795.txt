however, no mirna to date has been reported to modulate adipogenesis and lipid deposition in beef cattle.
the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas including four bovine specific mirnas in subcutaneous adipose tissues from three groups of crossbred steers differing in backfat thickness were compared using qrt-pcr analysis.
eighty-six mirnas were detectable in all samples, with  <dig> mirnas differing among crossbreds  and  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed between tissues with high and low backfat thickness .
the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were correlated with backfat thickness .
the mirna most differentially expressed and the most strongly associated with backfat thickness was mir- <dig>  with a  <dig> -fold increase in high backfat thickness tissues .
approximately 20% of the mirnas in this study were identified as being correlated with backfat thickness.
mirna expression patterns differed significantly in response to host genetic components.
this result suggests that mirnas may play a regulatory role in white adipose tissue development in beef animals.
