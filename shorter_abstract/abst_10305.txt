following vaccination with gel + ova, cd8+ t cell memory populations specific for ovalbumin protein were detected.
an infiltrate of t cells into tumours of people with colorectal cancer has proven to be a significant indicator of good prognosis.
vaccination generating a robust memory population of cd8+ t cells may provide protection against cancer.
we investigated the generation of murine memory cd8+ t cells using a sustained antigen release vaccine vehicle  containing the model antigen ovalbumin, chitosan gel alone  or conventional dendritic cell vaccination  using the same protein antigen.
these results indicate that subcutaneous vaccination with gel + ova generates a population of functional cd8+ memory t cells in lymphoid tissue able to protect against intracaecal tumour challenge.

vaccination with chitosan gel may be valuable in anti-cancer treatment at both peripheral and mucosal sites.
we used an intracaecal mouse model of cancer to determine whether a protective immune response against a mucosal gut tumour could be generated using a systemic intervention.
