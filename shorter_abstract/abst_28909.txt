just as importantly ampliconnoise generates the right otus even at low sequence differences.
this has revolutionised the study of microbial diversity as it is now possible to sequence a substantial fraction of the 16s rrna genes in a community.
we present ampliconnoise, a development of the pyronoise algorithm that is capable of separately removing  <dig> sequencing errors and pcr single base errors.
in addition the principles behind the algorithms, the inference of true sequences using expectation-maximization , and the treatment of chimera detection as a classification or 'supervised learning' problem, will be equally applicable to new sequencing technologies as they appear.
ampliconnoise outperforms alternative algorithms substantially reducing per base error rates for both the gs flx and latest titanium protocol.
we also introduce a novel chimera removal program, perseus, that exploits the sequence abundances associated with pyrosequencing data.
we show that ampliconnoise allows accurate estimates of otu number.
otherwise this leads to inflated estimates of the number of types or operational taxonomic units  present.
three sources of error are important: sequencing error, pcr single base substitutions and pcr chimeras.
we demonstrate that perseus has very high sensitivity, able to find 99% of chimeras, which is critical when these are present at high frequencies.
