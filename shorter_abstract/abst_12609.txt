the ku <dig> deletion construct was designed using resistance to phosphinothricin as the selection marker.
in the present study, we developed a high efficiency agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation system for m. thermophila, including an approach for targeted gene deletion using green fluorescence protein  as a marker for selection.
moreover, a ku <dig> deletion mutant was constructed in the atcc  <dig> background using the tools developed in present study and subsequently characterized.
transformants with ectopically integrated ku <dig> deletion constructs were therefore identified using the fluorescent signal of gfp.
the thermophilic filamentous fungus myceliophthora thermophila has many suitable characteristics for industrial biotechnology and could be a promising new chassis system for synthetic biology, particularly the atcc  <dig> strain, whose genome was sequenced in  <dig>  however, metabolic engineering of this strain using genetic approaches has not been reported owing to a lack of genetic tools for this organism.
the tools and the ku <dig> deletion strain developed here should advance the development of m. thermophila as an industrial host through metabolic engineering and accelerate the elucidation of the mechanism of rapid cellulose degradation in this thermophilic fungus.
up to  <dig> transformants per  <dig> conidia were obtained in one transformation plate.
moreover, the homologous rate improved about  <dig> folds under ku <dig> mutant using the pyrg as a test gene to disrupt in m. thermophila.
we successfully developed an efficient transformation and target gene disruption approach for m. thermophila atcc  <dig> mediated by a. tumefaciens.
