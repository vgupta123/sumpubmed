to address this issue, this work proposed a new algorithm to estimate parameters in stochastic models using simulated likelihood density in the framework of approximate bayesian computation.
simulation results suggest that the usage of simulated likelihood density improves the accuracy of estimates substantially.
however, one of the major challenges in systems biology is how to infer unknown parameters in mathematical models based on the experimental data sets, in particular, when the data are sparse and the regulatory network is stochastic.
two stochastic models were used to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
mathematical modeling is an important tool in systems biology to study the dynamic property of complex biological systems.
