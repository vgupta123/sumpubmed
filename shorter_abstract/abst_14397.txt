our systematic predictions provide us with the opportunity to perform a global analysis of human gene pleiotropy and its underlying regulatory mechanisms.
our analysis of these phenotype-specific coexpression modules reveals a high prevalence of gene pleiotropy, and suggests that phenotype-specific transcription factor binding may contribute to phenotypic diversity.
we integrated these modules, protein-protein interaction data, gene ontology annotations, and our database of gene-phenotype associations derived from literature to predict novel human gene-phenotype associations.
we trained random forest classifiers for each phenotype and predicted a total of  <dig>  gene-phenotype associations.
utilizing this unique data source, we confirmed that dynamic transcriptional regulation is an important force driving the formation of phenotype specific gene modules.
to study the basis for these complex phenotypes, we developed a network-based approach to identify coexpression modules specifically activated in particular phenotypes.
we collected  <dig> chip-chip datasets studying  <dig> transcription factors binding over  <dig>  targets under various phenotypic conditions.
