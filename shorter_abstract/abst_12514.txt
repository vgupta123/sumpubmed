it can be broadly applied to identify condition-specific targets computationally by embedding information of gene expression profiles.
since the changes of mirnas affect the expression of target genes, the expression levels of target genes in specific biological processes could be different from those of non-target genes.
the proposed model yielded low false positive rate and retrieved condition-specific candidate targets through a genome-wide screening.
they regulate target mrnas post-transcriptionally through complementary base pairing.
here we demonstrate that gene expression profiles contain useful information in separating mirna targets from non-targets.
the gene expression profiles related to various developmental processes and stresses, as well as the sequences of mirnas and mrnas in arabidopsis, were used to determine whether a given gene is a mirna target.
our approach provides a novel framework into screening target genes by considering the gene regulation of mirnas.
