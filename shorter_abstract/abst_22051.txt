the use of whole-genome sequencing in microbiology at a diagnostic level, although feasible, is still limited by the expenses associated and by the complex bioinformatics pipelines in data analyses.
the results obtained were comparable to or an improvement on the currently existing molecular serotyping methods for s. pneumoniae in relation to the polysaccharide vaccine serotypes.
correct identification of streptococcus pneumoniae and prediction of common vaccine serotypes:  <dig> to serotype level and the rest to serogroup levels were achieved for all serotypes with > <dig> reads mapped against serotypes sequences.
we describe the use of target enrichment-based next-generation sequencing for pneumococcal identification and serotyping as applied to the polysaccharide  <dig> valent vaccine serotypes as an affordable alternative to whole genome sequencing.
we propose that this method has the potential to become an affordable and adaptable alternative to whole-genome sequencing for pneumococcal identification and serotyping.
