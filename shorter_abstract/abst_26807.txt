our previous studies revealed that a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome  is associated with specific streptococcus suis serotype  <dig>  strains.
to achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of ss <dig> at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> ss <dig> strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using nimblegen tiling arrays.
the 89k pathogenicity island , which has been previously recognized as unique to the chinese epidemic strains causing stss, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains.
our results demonstrate that ss <dig> isolates have highly divergent genomes.
our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89k pai present in the genome of ss <dig> strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to stss, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic ss <dig> strains.
moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as plcr, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator revs and ctsr.
