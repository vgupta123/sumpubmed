for ~80% of the clones, the best assemblies consisted of less than  <dig> contigs at 24-fold mean sequence coverage.
though the resolution of complex repetitive structures requires additional experimental efforts, our approach paves the way for a clone based strategy of sequencing the barley genome.
to test the feasibility, we sequenced  <dig> barcoded, pooled, gene containing barley bacs using the gs flx platform and assembled the sequences under iterative change of parameters.
