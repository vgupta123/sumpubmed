we show that both sequences can be aligned resulting a single cluster with a gene arrangement collinear compared to other clusters of aspergillus section nidulantes.

sequence analyses showed that ani is clearly delimited from the genomic context and forms a monophyletic lineage with the other echinocandin gene clusters.
ecd/hty was originally reported as two disjunct sub-clusters ecd and hty, but is in fact a continuous sequence with the same gene order as in ani.
importantly, we found that the disjunct genomic location of the echinocandin b gene cluster in a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig> on two separate subclusters, ecd and hty, at two loci was likely an artifact of genome misassembly in the absence of a reference sequence.
according to sequences of pcr products amplified from genomic dna, the echinocandin b producer a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig> is closely related to a. pachycristatus nrrl  <dig>  a pcr-product from the gene cluster was very similar, but clearly distinct from the sequence published for a. delacroxii nrrl  <dig> at the ncbi .
