the results further suggest that the resolution at the isolate level may, subsequently be improved by targeting more variable genes.
the core-gene tree displays high confidence and divides the e. coli strains into the observed mlst type clades and also separates defined phylotypes.
a core-gene tree, based on alignment and a pan-genome tree based on gene presence/absence, maps the relatedness of the  <dig> sequenced e. coli genomes.
the e. coli pan-genome for this set of isolates contains  <dig>  gene clusters.
the use of whole genome sequencing will make it possible to eliminate, or at least reduce, the need for several typing steps used in traditional epidemiology.
the results of comparing a large and diverse e. coli dataset support the theory that reliable and good resolution phylogenies can be inferred from the core-genome.
by measuring the variation of individual genes across more than a hundred sequenced genomes, gene variation can be studied in detail, including the number of mutations found for any given gene.
