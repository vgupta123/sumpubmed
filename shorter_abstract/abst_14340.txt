owing to their different nature, the dbn and nn combine to form a more accurate method dbnn.
however, at present, the prediction accuracy of pure hmm-type methods is much lower than that of machine learning-based methods such as neural networks  or support vector machines .
the most interesting feature of dbn/dbnn is that a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy is achieved when combined with other methods by a simple consensus.
the dbn method using a gaussian distribution for the psi-blast profile and a high-ordered dependency between profiles of neighboring residues produces significantly better prediction accuracy than other hmm-type probabilistic methods.
tests show that the dbn method has made a significant improvement in the accuracy compared to other pure hmm-type methods.
in addition, a segment length distribution is introduced for each secondary structure state.
protein secondary structure prediction method based on probabilistic models such as hidden markov model  appeals to many because it provides meaningful information relevant to sequence-structure relationship.
in this paper, we report a new method of probabilistic nature for protein secondary structure prediction, based on dynamic bayesian networks .
the new method models the psi-blast profile of a protein sequence using a multivariate gaussian distribution, and simultaneously takes into account the dependency between the profile and secondary structure and the dependency between profiles of neighboring residues.
further improvement is achieved by combining the dbn with an nn, a method called dbnn, which shows better q <dig> accuracy than many popular methods and is competitive to the current state-of-the-arts.
