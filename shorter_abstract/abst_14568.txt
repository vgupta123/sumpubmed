we attributed false positive and false negative calls of the nine tools to specific error sources and assigned them to processing steps of the pipeline.
we were able to relate observed substantial differences in performance to the underlying statistical models of the tools, and to pinpoint the error sources of false positive and false negative calls.
sequencing costs have dropped tremendously, allowing the sequencing of the whole exome of tumors for just a fraction of the total treatment costs.
using simulations based on kidney tumor data, we compared the performance of nine state-of-the-art variant callers, namely deepsnv, gatk haplotypecaller, gatk unifiedgenotyper, jointsnvmix <dig>  mutect, samtools, sinvict, somaticsniper, and varscan <dig>  the comparison was done as a function of variant allele frequencies and coverage.
more precisely, the rank-combination of deepsnv, jointsnvmix <dig>  mutect, sinvict and varscan <dig> reached a sensitivity of 78% when fixing the precision at 90%, and outperformed all individual tools, where the maximum sensitivity was 71% with the same precision.
our analysis revealed that deepsnv and jointsnvmix <dig> perform very well, especially in the low-frequency range.
all of these errors can be expected to occur in real data sets.
