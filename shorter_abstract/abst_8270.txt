in a field study, we experimentally manipulated the hunger level of colonially breeding jackson's golden-backed weaver  nestlings close to fledging and investigated its effects on acoustic call parameters.
the results indicate that individual recognition processes can be based on static, hunger-independent call parameters, but also on dynamic hunger-related parameters that show high individuality.
some acoustic parameters that were related to the time-frequency pattern showed high individuality and were largely unaffected by a nestling's state of hunger.
furthermore, these signal properties suggest that the assessment of signals of need can be improved if the signal value is referenced to a chick's vocal spectrum.
these calls are also often used as hunger-related signals of need in young birds.
interestingly, most of these acoustic parameters showed both consistent changes with hunger and high between-individual differences, i.e.
