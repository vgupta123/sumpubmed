computer-assisted structure elucidation  of biological metabolites will be an important tool to leverage this lack of knowledge.
nmr prediction methods applied in the course of this work delivered precise predictions which can serve as a building block for computer-assisted structure elucidation for biological metabolites.
this paper evaluates different statistical and machine learning methods to perform predictions of proton nmr spectra based on data from our open database nmrshiftdb.
hose codes being a notably simple method achieved a comparatively good result of  <dig>  ppm mean absolute error.
current efforts in metabolomics, such as the human metabolome project, collect structures of biological metabolites as well as data for their characterisation, such as spectra for identification of substances and measurements of their concentration.
random forest, j <dig> decision tree and support vector machines achieved similar overall errors.
