importantly, during spermatogenesis mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on sex chromosomes are different from autosomes: x-linked somatic/progenitor genes are suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation without deposition of h3k27me <dig>

induction of late spermatogenesis genes during spermatogenesis is facilitated by poised chromatin established in the stem cell phases of spermatogonia, whereas silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during meiosis and postmeiosis is associated with formation of bivalent domains which also allows the recovery of the somatic/progenitor program after fertilization.
the male germline transcriptome changes dramatically during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition to activate late spermatogenesis genes and to transiently suppress genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis progenitor cells, termed somatic/progenitor genes.
our results suggest that bivalent h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me2/ <dig> domains are not limited to developmental promoters , but also underlie reversible silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in late spermatogenesis.
