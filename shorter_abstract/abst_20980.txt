as secreted proteins could regulate the balance between both lineages, we aimed at characterizing the secretome of human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell  at an early step of commitment to adipocytes and osteoblasts.
it is well established that adipose tissue plays a key role in energy storage and release but is also a secretory organ and a source of stem cells.
analysis of identified proteins showed that  <dig> % corresponded to classical secreted proteins characterized by a signal peptide, that  <dig> % previously described in the extracellular compartment were devoid of signal peptide and that  <dig> % neither exhibited a signal peptide nor had been previously described extracellularly.
a proteomic approach, using mono-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify a total of  <dig> proteins at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation.
given its regulation during the early events of hmads cell differentiation and its status in ovariectomized mice, pai- <dig> could play a role in the adipocyte/osteoblast balance and thus in bone diseases such as osteoporosis.
among different lineages, stem cells are able to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts.
quantitative analysis has been performed for  <dig> candidates: pai- <dig>  pedf, bigh <dig>  ptx <dig>  sparc, eno <dig>  grp <dig> and mmp <dig>  among them, pai- <dig> was detected at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of osteoblast differentiation but never in adipocyte secretome.
