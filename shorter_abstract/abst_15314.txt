a third  of c. sakazakii strains were in st <dig>  which had almost equal numbers of clinical and infant formula isolates from  <dig> to  <dig>  st <dig> may represent a particularly virulent grouping of c. sakazakii as 7/ <dig> strains were clinical in origin which had been isolated between  <dig> -  <dig>  from four countries.
due to the ubiquitous nature of the organism, and the high severity of infection for the immunocompromised, a multilocus sequence typing  scheme has been developed for the fast and reliable identification and discrimination of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus strains.
the cronobacter genus  has come to prominence due to its association with infant infections, and the ingestion of contaminated reconstituted infant formula.
c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus are closely related, and are defined according their biotype.
it was applied to  <dig> strains of c. sakazakii and  <dig> strains of c. malonaticus, including the index strains used to define the biotypes.
there were  <dig> sequence types  identified in c. sakazakii, and  <dig> in c. malonaticus.
c. malonaticus divided into three sts.
in conclusion, mlst is a more robust means of identifying and discriminating between c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus than biotyping.
the strains were from clinical and non-clinical sources between  <dig> and  <dig> in usa, canada, europe, new zealand and the far east.
