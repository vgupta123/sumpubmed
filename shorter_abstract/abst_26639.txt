further refinement of the proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the early identification of diabetic nephropathy and the development of more efficient treatment in a clinical setting.
often, when patients are diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, their renal functions have already been significantly damaged.
various complications are associated with type  <dig> diabetes, with diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of renal failure among diabetics.
the inclusion of genetic features and the implementation of an additional gender-based rule yielded better classification results.
in the present study, we developed a decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type  <dig> diabetic patients.
