our results indicate that snps can alter mirna function and produce unique mirna targets in cultivated and wild cucumbers.
we employed cucumber resequencing data to perform a genome-wide scan for snps in cucumber mirna-target interaction sites, including mirna mature sequences and mirna-target binding sites.
this is the first experimental validation of snps in mirna-target interaction sites affecting mirna-target binding in plants.
therefore, mirna-related snps may have played important in events that led to the agronomic differences between domestic and wild cucumber.
genetic variations in mirnas sequences or their target-binding sites  can alter mirna targets in animal and human.
furthermore, we experimentally confirmed that these snps produced  <dig> 9930-unique targets mrnas and  <dig> hardwickii-unique targets mrna for cucumber mirnas.
micrornas  are endogenous small rnas that play important regulatory functions in plant development.
a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families, nine less-conserved mirna families, and  <dig> cucumber-specific mirnas were identified in both line  <dig> and hardwickii.
