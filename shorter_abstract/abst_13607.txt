prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic genomes are covered with ubiquitous patterns that we termed "class a flexible patterns".
judging from the structure of the patterns, we suggest that they may define a dense network of protein interaction sites in chromosomes.
the genomes of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes display a very strong  <dig> bp periodic bias in the distribution of their nucleotides.
they generate the previously recognized  <dig> bp periodic bias.
