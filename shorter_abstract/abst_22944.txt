dmrt <dig> is a highly conserved gene involved in the determination and early differentiation phase of the primordial gonad in vertebrates.
in males mrna and protein expression was observed before morphological sex differentiation in the somatic cells surrounding primordial germ cells  of the gonadal anlage and later on exclusively in sertoli cells.
this occurs possibly via a cross-talk of sertoli cells and pgcs.
in the fish medaka dmrt1by, a functional duplicate of the autosomal dmrt1a gene on the y-chromosome, has been shown to be the master regulator of male gonadal development, comparable to sry in mammals.
in medaka, dmrt1by mediates a mitotic arrest of pgcs in males prior to testes differentiation at the sex determination stage.
injection of antisense morpholinos led to an increase of pgcs in genetically male embryos due to loss of proliferation inhibition.
