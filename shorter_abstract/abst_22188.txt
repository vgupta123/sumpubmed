strands can tolerate fewer sequence changes and nonetheless keep their specific shape and function.
similar numbers of loops were found in conserved and random regions.
these results can be understood in light of the structural constraints on different secondary structure elements, and their role in protein structural stabilization and topology.
conserved protein sequence regions are extremely useful for identifying and studying functionally and structurally important regions.
by means of an integrated analysis of large-scale protein structure and sequence data, structural features of conserved protein sequence regions were identified.
the basic structural features of conserved sequence regions are also important determinants of protein structure motifs and their function.
