the amount of biomedical literature available is growing at an explosive speed, but a large amount of useful information remains undiscovered in it.
thus, the proposed method has the potential to help biomedical experts find the most useful and valuable target concepts effectively.
we successfully replicate swanson's two classic discoveries and find the rankings of potentially relevant target concepts are relatively high.
the number of target concepts is greatly reduced and potentially relevant target concepts gain higher ranking by adopting only relevant linking concepts.
this paper presents a new method for selecting linking concepts which exploits statistical and textual features to represent each linking concept, and then classifies them as relevant or irrelevant to the starting concepts.
through an evaluation it is observed textual features improve the results obtained with only statistical features.
unfortunately, popular mining methods based on co-occurrence produce too many target concepts, leading to the declining relevance ranking of the potential target concepts.
relevant linking concepts are then used to discover target concepts.
