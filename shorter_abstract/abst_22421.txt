the results show tissue-specifically expressed, feedback-regulated, stress-responsive and alternatively spliced novel genes and reveal multiple layer regulation of ga metabolism and crosstalk between gibberellin metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.
it shares the important intermediate diphosphate precursor, ggpp, with the main lipophilic bioactive components, diterpenoid tanshinones in salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, one of the most important traditional chinese medicine materials and an emerging model medicinal plant.
gibberellin metabolism pathway genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns and responded differentially to exogenous ga <dig> treatment, indicating differential regulation of gibberellin metabolism in different tissue types in s. miltiorrhiza.
analysis of ga metabolism and regulation may help to demonstrate the biological functions of gas and the crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.
among the  <dig> identified genes, nine responded to yeast extract and ag+-treatment in s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots.
moreover, tissue-specifically expressed splice variants were identified for smko, smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  of which smkov <dig>  smga20ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> were ga3-responsive, suggesting the importance of alternative splicing in regulating ga metabolism.
gibberellin , a classical phytohormone, plays significant roles in plant growth and development.
smkao <dig>  smkao <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  and smga2ox4â€“smga2ox <dig> were significantly up-regulated; smga20ox <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were significantly down-regulated; while the responses of many other genes varied among different tissue-types and time-points of ga <dig> treatment, suggesting the complexity of feedback regulation.
tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes, such as smcps <dig> and smksl <dig>  were up-regulated in response to ga <dig> treatment.
through genome-wide prediction and molecular cloning, twenty two candidate gibberellin metabolism pathway genes were systematically identified for the first time.
