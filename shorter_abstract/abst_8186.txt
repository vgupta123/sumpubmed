sheep constitute the second major component of livestock in ethiopia.
out of  <dig> samples examined, pasterurella was isolated in  <dig> , of which  <dig>  were from lungs and  <dig>  were from nasal cavities.
hence this study was conducted to determine the causative agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pasteurella isolates among pneumonic ovine in haramaya district, eastern hararghe, ethiopia.
the isolates were susceptible to limited antimicrobial agents.
haramaya district is one of the remote settings in ethiopia where information about the livestock disease is not well documented.

therefore, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be conducted before treatment, except for critical cases.
mannheimia haemolytica is the most common cause of ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis in the study area.
age and body temperature were significantly associated with pasteurella isolates from clinic .
despite diverse in the site of origins, the isolates exhibited uniformity in sensitivity to a majority of the antibacterial agents.
