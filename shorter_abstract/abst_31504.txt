the majority strand has a  <dig> % at-content but a gc-skew of  <dig> .
the mitochondrial genome of d. pteronyssinus is a circular dna molecule of  <dig>  bp.
both maximum likelihood and bayesian inference analysis clustered d. pteronyssinus with steganacarus magnus, forming a sistergroup of the trombidiformes.
although the mitochondrial genome of d. pteronyssinus shares different features with previously characterised acari mitochondrial genomes, it is unique in many ways.
finally, phylogenetic analysis using concatenated mt gene sequences succeeded in recovering acari relationships concordant with traditional views of phylogeny of acari.
the mitochondrial gene order differs considerably from that of other acari mitochondrial genomes.
gene order is extremely rearranged and represents a new pattern within the acari.
a microsatellite was detected in a large non-coding region , which probably functions as the control region.
furthermore, the strong and reversed gc- and at-skews suggest the inversion of the control region as an evolutionary event.
in this study, we describe the mitochondrial genome of the european house dust mite dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, the most important member of this largely neglected group.
almost all trna genes lack a t-arm, provoking the formation of canonical cloverleaf trna-structures, and both rrna genes are considerably reduced in size.
