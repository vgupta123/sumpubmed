it is well known that these hormonal pathways are involved in physiological regulation following morphogenesis in many insect species.
employing a candidate gene approach and identifying differentially-expressed genes revealed that the morphogenetic factors, hox <dig>  extradenticle and escargot, were up-regulated by kairomones in the postembryonic stage and may potentially be responsible for defense morph formation.
biological functions of the up-regulated genes are discussed in the context of defense morph formation.
during the embryonic stage when morphotypes were determined, one of the novel genes identified by differential display was up-regulated, suggesting that this gene may be related to morphotype determination.
it is suggested that, following the reception of kairomone signals, the identified genes are involved in a series of defensive phenotypic alterations and the production of a defensive phenotype.
the genus daphnia  provides a model experimental system for the study of the developmental mechanisms and evolutionary processes associated with predator-induced polyphenisms.
we therefore examined which of the genes in the embryonic and first-instar juvenile stages exhibit different expression levels in the presence or absence of predator kairomones.
in d. pulex, juveniles form neckteeth in response to predatory kairomones released by chaoborus larvae .
previous studies suggest that the timing of the sensitivity to kairomones in d. pulex can generally be divided into the embryonic and postembryonic developmental periods.
