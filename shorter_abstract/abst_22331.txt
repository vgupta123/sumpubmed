we show that the simplified logistic lotka–volterra model, a well-established ode model for biological and biochemical phenomena, can represent rnai dynamics as a predator–prey system.
for the representation of rna interference  dynamics, several mathematical models based on systems of ordinary differential equations  have been proposed.
the results suggest that analyses using our model are useful to estimate dynamic profiles of sirna effects on apoptosis and to score sirna by its effects on apoptosis, namely ‘phenotypic scoring’.
although a hidden variable exists in the model, its values can be determined and made visible as dynamic profiles of rna-decomposing effects of sirnas.
identification of the ode models is also quite difficult.
correlation analysis shows that the model parameters correlate highly with the total effect of the sirna.
