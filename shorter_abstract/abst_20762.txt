the sequences of the ori regions described here are only similar among closely related bacteria while fundamental characteristics like presence of dnaa and ihf binding sites as well as the boundary genes are more widely conserved.
the relative paucity of ctra binding sites in the ori regions, as well as the absence of key enzymes associated with dna replication in the respective genomes, suggest that several of these obligate intracellular bacteria may have altered replication mechanisms.
these features include dnaa-, ctra- and ihf-binding sites as well as the flanking genes in c. crescentus.
the wolbachia ori boundary genes were found to be heme and cog <dig> protein .
using features that have been previously experimentally verified in the alpha-proteobacterium caulobacter crescentus, the origin of dna replication  regions were identified in silico for wolbachia strains and eleven other related bacteria belonging to ehrlichia, anaplasma, and rickettsia genera.
the annotated genomes of two closely related strains of the intracellular bacterium wolbachia pipientis have been reported without the identifications of the putative origin of replication .
comparisons of the putative ori region among related wolbachia strains showed higher conservation of bases within binding sites.
based on these analyses, criteria are set forth for identifying the ori region in genome sequencing projects.
