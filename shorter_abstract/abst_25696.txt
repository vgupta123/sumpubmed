while the ultimate causes of most species extinctions are environmental, environmental constraints have various secondary consequences on evolutionary and ecological processes.
results indicate that a given population may have a high demographic, but low genetic viability or vice versa; and whether genetic or demographic aspects will be the most limiting to overall viability depends on the constraints faced by the species .
as a consequence, depending on metapopulation or species characteristics, incorporating genetic considerations to demographically-based viability assessments may either moderately or severely reduce the persistence time.
here, i computed projected times to metapopulation extinction using  a model focusing on the effects of species properties, habitat quality, quantity and temporal variability on the time to demographic extinction;  a genetic model focusing on the dynamics of the drift and inbreeding loads under the same species and habitat constraints;  a demo-genetic model accounting for demographic-genetic processes and feedbacks.
