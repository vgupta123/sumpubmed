these points of interest warrant experimental investigation.
this property facilitates the identification of possible false negatives for genome-wide significance.
our results are strongly consistent with results gathered using genome-wide methods and identify additional hotspots and eqtls.
our approach identifies expression traits that have exceptional associations regardless of the genome-wide significance of those associations.
expression traits identified by this method may warrant additional study because their expression level may be affected by targeting genes near a single locus.
in contrast to genome-wide techniques, our method determines the significance of an association between an expression trait and a locus with respect to the set of all associations to the expression trait.
the use of this specific information facilitates identification of expression traits that have an expression profile that is characterized by a single exceptional association to a locus.
further, our approach has the property of prioritizing expression traits that are affected by few strong associations.
we demonstrate our method by identifying eqtl hotspots in plasmodium falciparum  and saccharomyces cerevisiae .
the vast number of statistical tests carried out on these data make false negatives very likely.
new eqtls and hotspots found with this method may represent regions of the genome or biological processes that are controlled through few relatively strong genetic interactions.
the predominant method of identifying eqtls finds associations that are significant at a genome-wide level.
we propose an alternative method to identify eqtls that builds on traditional approaches.
