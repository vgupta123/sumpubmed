mir155hg has been proposed to be a target gene for transcription factor nf-κb largely due to the positive correlation between high nuclear nf-κb activity and increased mir- <dig> expression following treatment with nf-κb inducers or in subsets of hematopoietic cancers.
this report shows that induction of nf-κb activity rapidly leads to increased levels of both primary mir155hg mrna and mature mir- <dig> transcripts.
we have mapped an nf-κb-responsive element to a position approximately  <dig> nt upstream of the mir155hg transcription start site.
nevertheless, direct regulation of the human mir155hg promoter by nf-κb has not been convincingly demonstrated previously.
microrna- <dig>  is the diced product of the mir155hg gene.
moreover, the levels of mir- <dig> in nine human b-lymphoma cell lines generally correlate with increased nuclear nf-κb proteins.
