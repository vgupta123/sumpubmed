nts serotypes obtained from all the cases included s. typhimurium , s. enteritidis  and other serotypes in smaller numbers ; distribution of these serotypes among cases with bacteremia or gastroenteritis was not significantly different.
there was no significant difference in antibiotic resistance between the two serotypes, s. typhimurium and s. enteritidis.
using pulsed field gel electrophoresis  there were  <dig> main patterns of s. typhimurium and  <dig> main patterns of s. enteritidis among cases of bacteraemia and gastroenteritis.
the emergence of multidrug resistance is a major challenge in treatment of life threatening invasive nts infections in these settings.
serotype distribution, antibiotic susceptibility and pfge patterns of nts causing bacteraemia and gastroenteritis did not differ significantly.
the high prevalence of nts strains resistant to most of the commonly used antimicrobials is of major public health concern.
in sub-saharan africa community-acquired non-typhoidal salmonella  is a major cause of high morbidity and death among children under  <dig> years of age especially from resource poor settings.
a significantly higher proportion of younger children  and those from the slums presented with invasive nts compared to older children and those from upper socio-economic groups .
