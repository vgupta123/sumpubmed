instead, the human locus syntenic to mouse dpy19l <dig> contains a pseudogene, dpy19l2p <dig>  this indicates that the ancestral copy of this gene has been silenced, while the descendant copy has remained active.
our results show that the dpy19l family has expanded throughout the vertebrate lineage and has undergone recent primate-specific evolution within lcrs.
low copy repeats  are thought to play an important role in recent gene evolution, especially when they facilitate gene duplications.
we then describe the expansion and evolution of the dpy19l gene family from a single gene found in invertebrate animals.
ancient duplications have led to multiple homologues in different lineages, with three in fish, frogs and birds and four in mammals.
moreover, silencing of duplicate genes can have an indirect effect on adaptive evolution by causing genomic relocation of functional genes.
here we present a novel example showing functional gene relocation within a lcr.
we characterize the genomic structure and gene content of eight related lcrs on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  two members of a novel transmembrane gene family, dpy19l, were identified in these regions, along with six transcribed pseudogenes.
duplicate genes are fundamental to adaptive evolution, providing substrates for the development of new or shared gene functions.
