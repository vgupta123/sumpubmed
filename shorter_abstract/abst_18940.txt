for the alternate donor  and acceptor  classes, the distance between the splice sites for the majority of events was found to be less than  <dig> basepairs .
in both species, the most frequent distance between aa is  <dig> bp, consistent with reports in mammalian systems.
many isoforms will presumably have negative consequences for protein structure and function, suggesting that their biological role involves post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.
alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon  and we have described nine alternative splicing variations.
a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing was performed in rice that started with > <dig>  million publicly available spliced ests and over  <dig>  full length cdnas in conjunction with the newly enhanced pasa software.
while alternative splicing has the potential to create many rna isoforms from a single locus, the majority of loci generate only two or three isoforms and transcript support indicates that these isoforms are generally not rare events.
a parallel analysis was performed with arabidopsis to compare and ascertain potential differences between monocots and dicots.
additionally, these two plant species have extensive cdna and expressed sequence tag  libraries.
conversely, the most frequent distance between ad is  <dig> bp in both plant species, as previously observed in mouse.
