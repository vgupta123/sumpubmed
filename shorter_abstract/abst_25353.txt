these cells could not differentiate into chondrocytes, adipocytes, neuronal and glial cells, however they readily mineralized when placed in osteogenic conditions.
nkx <dig>  was expressed in vivo by cns vascular muscular cells located in the parenchyma and the meninges.
smooth muscle cells expressing nestin and nkx <dig>  is the main cell population derived from culturing human spinal cord cells in adherent conditions with serum.
we previously isolated nestin+ sox2+ neural multipotential cells from the adult human spinal cord using the neurosphere method .
in addition, long term propagation of these cells will allow the study of their interaction with other cns cells and their implication in scar formation during spinal cord injury.
mineralization of these cells in vitro could represent a valuable model for studying calcifications of cns vessels which are observed in pathological situations or as part of the normal aging.
the adult central nervous system  contains different populations of immature cells that could possibly be used to repair brain and spinal cord lesions.
