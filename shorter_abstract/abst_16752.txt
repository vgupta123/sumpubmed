bayesian analysis further suggested a sister relationship between the lesion nematode pratylenchus thornei and all type b cellulases from root-knot nematodes.
represented by  <dig> sequences, type b is numerically dominant, and the overall topology of the catalytic domain type shows remarkable resemblance with trees based on neutral  small subunit ribosomal dna sequences.
yet, the relationship between the three catalytic domain types remained unclear.
three types of catalytic domains are distinguished, and the presence of at least two types is relatively common among plant parasitic tylenchida.
single nematodes were used to obtain  genomic sequences of cellulases from representatives of the genera meloidogyne, pratylenchus, hirschmanniella and globodera.
superposition of intron data onto the cellulase tree suggests that types b and c are related, and together distinct from type a that is characterized by two unique introns.
plant parasitic nematodes are unusual metazoans as they are equipped with genes that allow for symbiont-independent degradation of plant cell walls.
to obtain insight into the origin of ghf <dig> cellulases among evolutionary advanced members of the order tylenchida, cellulase biodiversity data from less distal family members were collected and analyzed.
combined bayesian analysis of â‰ˆ  <dig> cellulase sequences revealed three types of catalytic domains .
among the cell wall-degrading enzymes, glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  cellulases are relatively well characterized, especially for high impact parasites such as root-knot and cyst nematodes.
analysis of coding sequences of cellulases suggests that root-knot and cyst nematodes did not acquire this gene directly by lateral genes transfer.
