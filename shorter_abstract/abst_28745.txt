the wolf spider pardosa pseudoannulata, one of the dominant predators in south china, plays a crucial role in the rice agroecosystem.
to validate these transcriptomic responses, further examination at the translational level will be warranted.
in this study, we investigated transcriptome responses of the 5th instar spiders fed on preys maintained on bt- and non-bt rice.
non-target organisms can be exposed to bt toxins through direct feeding or trophic interactions in the field.
functional analysis indicated a potential impact of bt toxin on the formation of new cuticles during molting.
comparative transcriptome analysis resulted in  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between spiderlings preying upon n. lugens fed on bt- and non-bt rice .
the cry1ab may have a negative impact on the formation of new cuticles during molting, which is contributed to the delayed development of spiderlings.
go and kegg enrichment analyses suggested that go terms associated with chitin or cuticle, including “chitin binding”, “chitin metabolic process”, “chitin synthase activity”, “cuticle chitin biosynthetic process”, “cuticle hydrocarbon biosynthetic process”, and “structural constituent of cuticle”, and an array of amino acid metabolic pathways, including “alanine, asparatate and glutamate metabolism”, “glycine, serine and theronine metabolism”, “cysteine and methionine metabolism”, “tyrosine metabolism”, “phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine”, and “tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis” were significantly influenced in response to cry1ab.
