this enabled the effective modulation of two central growth control pathways resulting in the phenotypic outcome of cell cycle reentry in postmitotic islet cells.
at least three genes can be effectively suppressed simultaneously in cultured intact human pancreatic islets without disruption of islet architecture or overt alterations in function.
two genes were simultaneously suppressed by 80% from baseline levels.
simultaneous targeting of rb and p <dig> pathway members resulted in cell cycle reentry as measured by edu incorporation in 10% of islet nuclei.
approaches that improve transient targeting of gene expression in intact human islets are needed in order to effectively perturb intracellular pathways to achieve biological effects in the most relevant tissue contexts.

human pancreatic islet structure poses challenges to investigations that require specific modulation of gene expression.
electroporation of intact human cadaveric islets resulted in robust and specific suppression of gene expression.
transient exposure to multiple sirnas is an effective approach to modify islets for study with the potential to aid clinical applications.
