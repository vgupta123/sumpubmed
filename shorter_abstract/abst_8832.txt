fecal consistency was improved and body weights increased in the znhigh group when compared to the other groups, but no direct effect of zn concentrations in the diet on fecal tgev shedding and mucosal immune responses was detectable.
however, in the znhigh group, we found a prevention of villus atrophy and decreased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of jejunal epithelium.
finally, in the znhigh group, we documented an earlier and higher systemic tgev-specific serum antibody response.
transmissible gastroenteritis virus  causes diarrhea in piglets with an age-dependent decrease of severity.
we used  <dig> weaned piglets that were divided into three groups to evaluate the effect of different zn levels added to a conventional diet .
these results suggest that high dietary zn could provide enhanced protection in the intestinal tract and stimulate the systemic humoral immune response against tgev infection.
in addition, forskolin-induced chloride secretion and epithelial resistance were controlled at a physiological level in the znhigh but not the other groups.
