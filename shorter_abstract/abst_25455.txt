mage-ml has been promoted as a standard format for describing microarray experiments and the data they produce.
xbabelphish provides a way to inter-translate mage-ml variants for improved interchange of microarray experiment information.
as a result, different producers of mage-ml create different documents describing the same experiment and its data.
xbabelphish's use is not restricted to translating mage-ml documents.
it can transform xml files independent of their dtd, xml schema, or semantic content.
more generally, it can be used to transform most xml files, including very large ones that exceed the capacity of most xml tools.
