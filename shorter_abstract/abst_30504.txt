at the cellular level, there appears to be a consequential interplay between the transformed smg cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix, resulting in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin.
active infection for up to  <dig> days in vitro results in a remarkable cell and molecular pathology characterized by atypical ductal epithelial hyperplasia, apparent epitheliomesenchymal transformation, oncocytic-like stromal metaplasia, β-catenin nuclear localization, and upregulation of nfkb <dig>  relb, il <dig>  stat <dig>  and cox <dig>  rescue with an antiviral nucleoside analogue indicates that mcmv replication is necessary to initiate and maintain smg dysmorphogenesis.
mcmv infection of embryonic mouse explants results in dysplasia, metaplasia, and, possibly, anaplasia.
it has been postulated that mesenchymal infection is the critical step in disrupting organogenesis.
we infected e <dig> smg explants with mouse cmv .
the molecular pathogenesis appears to center around the activation of canonical and, perhaps more importantly, noncanonical nfκb.
human studies suggest, and mouse models clearly demonstrate, that cytomegalovirus  is dysmorphic to early organ and tissue development.
from these studies, a tentative framework has emerged within which additional studies may be planned and performed.
cmv has a particular tropism for embryonic salivary gland and other head mesenchyme.
if so, organogenesis dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions would be particularly vulnerable.
in this study, we chose to model the vulnerability by investigating the cell and molecular pathogenesis of cmv infected mouse embryonic submandibular salivary glands .
