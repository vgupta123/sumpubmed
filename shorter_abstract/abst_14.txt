this work presents a strategy for microbial production of recombinant human pro-relaxin h <dig> in pichia pastoris that allowed the obtainment of biologically active pro-hormone, with a final concentration in the fermentation broth ranging between  <dig> and 14 mg/l of product, as determined by densitometric analyses.
most productive results were obtained when using escherichia coli as a host for human relaxin expression.
to overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression here we report the production and purification of secreted human pro-relaxin h <dig> by using the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris as expression host.
its precursor, pro-relaxin, is an 18 kda protein, that shows activity in in vitro assays.
however, in such host, relaxin precipitated in the form of inclusion bodies and, therefore, required several expensive recovery steps as cell lysis, refolding and reduction.
