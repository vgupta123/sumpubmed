program, source code and exemplary files are freely available at the biosave homepage.
possible applications of the program include display of transcription factor binding sites in a genomic context or the visualisation of structural domain assignments in protein sequences and many more.
visualization of sequence annotation is a common feature in many bioinformatics tools.
the dynamic visualisation of these annotations is useful, e.g., for the determination of cutoff values of predicted features to match experimental data.
we present biosave, a sequence annotation viewer with on-the-fly selection of visualisation thresholds for each feature.
biosave is a versatile os x program for visual display of scored features  within a sequence context.
