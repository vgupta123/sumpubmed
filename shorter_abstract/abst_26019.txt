interleukin- <dig> was the most significantly up-regulated gene and appears to play a paramount role in the epithelial cell response to h. pylori infection and in the pathological processes leading to gastric disease.
there was dysregulation of apoptosis, tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes as early as in the first  <dig> h of h. pylori infection, which may represent early signs of gastric tumorigenesis.
the aim of this study was to profile the most significant cellular pathways and biological processes affected in gastric epithelial cells during  <dig> h of h. pylori exposure, and to study the inflammatory response to ompla+ and ompla- h. pylori variants.
however, only a small fraction of h. pylori carriers develop disease, and there are great geographical differences in disease penetrance.
ompla+/-did not affect the acute inflammatory response to h. pylori.
h. pylori outer membrane phospholipase a  has been suggested to play a role in the virulence of this bacterium.
there was marked up-regulation of tp53bp <dig>  whose corresponding protein aspp <dig> may interact with h. pylori caga and cause marked p <dig> suppression of apoptosis.
h. pylori ompla phase variation did not seem to influence the inflammatory epithelial cell gene response in this experiment.
in whole genome analysis of the epithelial response to h. pylori exposure, il- <dig> demonstrated the most marked up-regulation, and was involved in many of the most important cellular response processes to the infection.
