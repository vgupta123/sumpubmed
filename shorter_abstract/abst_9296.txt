these exploratory findings suggest that neuronal plasticity is influenced by pain and that the mental imagery effects on pain depend on the state of central sensitization.
although there was only a within-group effect of mental imagery on pain, further analyses showed a significant positive correlation of changes in pain threshold and cortical excitability .
mental imagery is a powerful method of altering brain activity and behavioral outcomes, such as performance of cognition and motor skills.
this exploratory study examined the effects of mental imagery-induced attention on pressure pain threshold and cortical plasticity using transcranial magnetic stimulation .
mental imagery has a minor effect on pain modulation in healthy subjects.

pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the association between changes in pain threshold and cortical excitability.
assessments of cortical excitability confirmed that these effects are related to the modulation of pain-related cortical circuits.
exploratory statistical analyses were performed using anova and t-tests for pain and tms assessments.
its effects appear to differ compared with chronic pain, leading to a small decrease in pain threshold.
in an exploratory analysis, we only observed a significant effect of group for the targeted left hand .
