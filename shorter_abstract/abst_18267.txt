our results suggest that although both ang <dig> and ang <dig> can activate the tie- <dig> receptor in bmlecs, ang <dig> and ang <dig> may have distinct roles in mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells.
the response of endothelial cells to stimulation with either ang <dig> or ang <dig> is thought to be dependent upon the origin of the endothelial cells.
in this study, we examined the effects of the angiopoietins on lymphatic, venous and arterial primary endothelial cells , which were isolated and cultured from bovine mesenteric vessels.
