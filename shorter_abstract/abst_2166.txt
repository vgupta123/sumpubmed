2-de analysis showed the presence of four proteins displaying a shift in their isoelectric point in both resistant strains, confirmed by the presence of amino acid changes in the sequence analysis, absent in the susceptible.
the aim of this study was to investigate the protein content and to identify differential expression in specific proteins in two rifampicin resistant and one susceptible meningococci using two-dimensional electrophoresis  combined with mass spectrometry.
the analysis of differentially expressed proteins suggests that an intricate series of events occurs in n. meningitidis rifampicin resistant strains and the results here reported may be considered a starting point in understanding their decreased invasion capacity.
different reports have described and discussed how a drug resistant pathogen shows a high biological cost for survival and that may also explain why, for some pathogens, the rate of resistant organisms is relatively low considering the widespread use of a particular drug.
in our experimental conditions, able to resolve soluble proteins with an isoelectric point between  <dig> and  <dig>  twenty-three proteins have been found differentially expressed in the two resistant strains compared to the susceptible.
this seems the case of rifampicin resistant meningococci.
several mutations have been described as responsible for rifampicin resistance in neisseria meningitidis.
