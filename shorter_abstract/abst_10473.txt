the x-ray crystal structure of mt-dsba reveals a two-domain structure, comprising a canonical thioredoxin domain with the conserved cxxc active site cysteines in their reduced form, and an inserted Î±-helical domain containing a structural disulfide bond.
the overall fold of mt-dsba resembles that of other dsba-like proteins and not mt-dsbe or mt-dsbf.
these results suggest that mt-dsba acts upon a distinct subset of substrates as compared to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf.
bacterial disulfide bond forming  proteins facilitate proper folding and disulfide bond formation of periplasmic and secreted proteins.
the m. tuberculosis proteome contains another predicted membrane-tethered dsb protein, mt-dsba, which is encoded by an essential gene.
