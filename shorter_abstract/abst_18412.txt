these data suggest that sr is most active as a noncovalent dimer containing one or more free sulfhydryls in the enzyme's active center or a modulatory site.
buffer composition and reduction/oxidation status during preparation can dramatically impact interpretations of sr activity.
michaelis-menten kinetic analysis indicated a km value of  <dig> mm and vmax value of  <dig>  μmol·mg-1·hr- <dig> when l-serine was used as a substrate for purified sr. gel-filtration chromatography and protein cross-linking experiments revealed that dimer is the major oligomeric form of recombinant sr in aqueous solution, though the proportions of monomer, tetramer, and larger aggregates differed somewhat with the specific buffer used.
gel-filtration chromatography and western blot analysis indicated that dtt enhanced the recovery of noncovalent sr dimer.
regulation of sr activity is still poorly understood.
chemical reduction with dtt increased the activity of sr by elevating vmax; cystamine, a reagent that blocks sulfhydryl groups, abolished sr activity.
