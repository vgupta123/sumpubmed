courtship parameters  from wild-type males were more affected by desat <dig> knocked-down females  than by desatf knocked-down ones .
a possible explanation is given of how pheromones could have evolved in species such as d. simulans, which only synthesize monoenes.
some biosynthesis enzymes are expressed both in fat body and oenocytes, rendering it difficult to estimate the exact role of oenocytes and of the transport of fatty acids from fat body to oenocytes in pheromone elaboration.
the species d. melanogaster shows sex pheromone dimorphism, with high levels of monoenes in males, and of dienes in females.
to address this question, we rnai silenced two main genes of the biosynthesis pathway, desat <dig> and desatf, in the oenocytes of d. melanogaster, without modifying their fat body expression.
courtship experiments allow us to discuss the behavioral role of diene pheromones, which, under special conditions, could be replaced by monoenes in d. melanogaster.
knock-down results for desat <dig> suggest that there must be very little transport of unsaturated precursors from fat body to the oenocytes, so pheromone synthesis occurs almost entirely through the action of biosynthesis enzymes within the oenocytes.
inactivation of desatf, which is female-specific and responsible for diene formation, resulted in a dramatic loss of pheromones  paralleled with a two-fold increase in monoenes.
in drosophila, cuticular sex pheromones are long-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons synthesized from fatty acid precursors in epidermal cells called oenocytes.
female pheromones  showed a decrease of 90%.
