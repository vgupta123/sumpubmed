here we report, for the first time, a survey of whole genome shotgun data to develop a large number of simple sequence repeat  markers to analyse the genetic diversity of the common cultivated chinese bayberry and the relationship with three other myrica species.
the taste and high level of health promoting characters identified in the fruit in recent years has stimulated its extension in china and introduction to australia.
myrica rubra has a small genome of about 323 mb with a high level of heterozygosity.
the whole genome shotgun survey of chinese bayberry produced  <dig> gb of sequence data, about 26x coverage of the estimated genome size of 323 mb.
a limited number of co-dominant markers have been developed and applied in genetic diversity and identity studies.
these markers can be used in the construction of a linkage map and for genetic diversity studies in myrica species.
it has been cultivated in southern china for several thousand years, and annual production has reached  <dig>  million tons.
the upgma dendrogram tree showed that cultivated myrica rubra is closely related to myrica adenophora and myrica nana, originating in southwest china, and very distantly related to myrica cerifera, originating in america.
chinese bayberry  is a subtropical evergreen tree originating in china.
of these,  <dig> were used to screen  <dig> chinese bayberry accessions and three other myrica species:  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % ssrs could be used in myrica adenophora, myrica nana and myrica cerifera, respectively.
a large number of ssrs were identified, and  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers developed, 91% of which can be transferred to other myrica species.
