the majority of s. pseudintermedius isolates evaluated in this study were able to produce biofilm and this may be an important virulence factor in the rapid emergence of this bacterium in veterinary hospitals worldwide.
in other staphylococci, biofilm formation has been shown to be a virulence factor for infection, however, it has received little attention in s. pseudintermedius.
there was no difference in biofilm formation between mrsp and mssp , amongst isolates from clinical infections compared with isolates obtained from colonized dogs , and between isolates from sequence type   <dig> and st  <dig> .
further study into the mechanisms of biofilm formation by s. pseudintermedius is warranted.
the objectives of this study were to evaluate the biofilm forming ability of clinical isolates of s. pseudintermedius obtained from dogs using phenotypic and genotypic techniques.
scanning electron microscopic evaluation of s. pseudintermedius biofilm production revealed aggregates of cocci and irregularly produced extracellular polymeric matrix.
methicillin resistance is common and clinical infections as a result of methicillin-resistant s. pseudintermedius  pose a clinical challenge.
staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an opportunistic pathogen of dogs and has emerged as a leading cause of skin, wound and surgical site infections worldwide.
96%  of s. pseudintermedius isolates were classified as strong or moderate biofilm producers, with the majority of isolates being able to produce biofilm.
