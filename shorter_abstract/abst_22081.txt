the present study used in silico analysis to develop simple sequence repeat-based and transposon-based markers.
the use of in silico analysis increased the efficiency of polymorphic marker development by more than 3-fold.
in silico analysis of polymorphisms increased the efficiency of polymorphic marker development, and contributed to the construction of high-density linkage maps in cultivated peanut.
more than  <dig>  dna markers have been developed in arachis spp., but high-density linkage maps useful for genetics, genomics, and breeding have not been constructed due to extremely low genetic diversity.
polymorphic marker loci are useful for the construction of such high-density linkage maps.
marker subsets and linkage maps developed in this study should be useful for genetics, genomics, and breeding in arachis.
in total,  <dig>  of  <dig>  markers showed polymorphisms between parental lines of the mapping population.
the resultant maps were applicable to qtl analysis.

peanut  is an autogamous allotetraploid legume  that is widely cultivated as a food and oil crop.
