some nlps induce a hypersensitive-like response in dicot plants though the basis for this response remains unclear.
the conserved sequence ghrhdwe and several common residues, especially some conserved histidines, in nlps match closely the two cupin motifs.
besides other common residues shared by dicot auxin-binding proteins  and nlps, an additional conserved histidine found in all dicot abps was also found in all nlps at the same position.
nep1-like proteins  are a novel family of microbial elicitors of plant necrosis.
we predict a 3d-structure for the Î²-rich section of the nlps based on alignments, prediction tools and molecular dynamics.
