in addition, we found a correlation between the overexpression of human xbp- <dig>  size expansion) and the specific igg productivity under dox induction.
the optimization of protein production is a complex and challenging problem in biotechnology.
in this work, we focus on the regulation of secreted protein specific productivity ) by controlling the expression of the spliced form of human x-box binding protein ) in chinese hamster ovary cells  under doxycycline  induction at different temperatures.
we observed a four-fold increase in specific igg productivity by cho cells under elevated concentrations of dox at 30°c compared to 37°c, without detectable differences in binding activity in vitro or changes in the structural integrity of igg.

our data suggest the t-rex system overexpressing human xbp- <dig> can be successfully used in cho-k <dig> cells for human immunoglobulin production.
