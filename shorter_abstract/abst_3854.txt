there is great diversity in hb gene evolution in placental mammals, mostly in the repertoire and regulation of the β-globin subunits.
we also showed that canine hbd and hbb genes are complex chimeras that resulted from multiple gene conversion events between them.
our findings are also likely to raise new questions about the significance of human hbd.
dogs are an ideal model in which to study hb genes because: 1) they are members of laurasiatheria, our closest relatives outside of euarchontoglires , 2) dog breeds are isolated populations with their own hb-associated genetics and diseases, and 3) their high level of health care allows for development of biomedical investigation and translation.
we report the first molecular genetic characterization of hb genes in dogs.
lastly, we showed that the strongest signal of evolutionary selection in a high-altitude breed, the bernese mountain dog, lies in a haplotype block that spans the β-globin locus.
we established that dogs have a complement of five α and five β-globin genes, all of which can be detected as spliced mrna in adults.
