in order to optimize the early detection, we compared the sensitivity of microbiological culture and quantitative pcr  for the detection of p. aeruginosa in respiratory samples of not chronically infected cf patients.
for a total of  <dig> samples,  <dig>  remained p. aeruginosa negative by both culture and qpcr, whereas  <dig> samples  were positive by both culture and qpcr.
five of the  <dig> patients with a culture negative, qpcr positive sample became later p. aeruginosa positive both by culture and qpcr.
based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that qpcr may have a predictive value for impending p. aeruginosa infection for only a limited number of patients.
once infection is established, early antibiotic treatment is able to postpone the transition to chronic lung infection.
in this national study, we followed cf patients during periods between  <dig> to  <dig> months.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major respiratory pathogen causing severe lung infections among cf patients, leading to high morbidity and mortality.
