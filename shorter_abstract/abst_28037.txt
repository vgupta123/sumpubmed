the integration of protein-protein interaction networks derived from high-throughput screening approaches and complementary sources is a key topic in systems biology.
since highly connected regions of the human interactome may point to potential protein complexes, we have focused on the concept of modularity, and elucidated the detection power of module extraction algorithms by independent validations based on go, mips and kegg.
from the combination of protein interactions with gene expressions, a confidence scoring scheme has been proposed before proceeding via go with further classification in permanent and transient modules.
we examined this issue based on the analysis of modules detected by network clustering methods applied to both integrated and individual  data sources, which we call interactome classes.
validation of the extracted modules by multiple annotation allows for the assessment of confidence measures assigned to the modules in a protein pathway context.
