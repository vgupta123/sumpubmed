micrornas  are known to be involved in fat deposition and to be regulated by the androgen-induced androgen receptor .
however, there is little understanding of the relationship between mirnas and fat deposition after castration.
the patterns of adipogenesis and fat deposition were compared between castrated and intact male pigs.
the functions of mirnas important for regulating fat deposition were also investigated in this study.
the differentially expressed mirnas may play important roles in fat deposition after castration.
a total of  <dig> unique mirna genes were identified, comprising  <dig> known pre-mirnas and  <dig> novel pre-mirnas.
the expression patterns of eight arbitrarily selected mirnas were validated by stem-loop reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
the results also indicate that castration can significantly affect the expression patterns of fat-related mirnas.
one hundred and seventy-seven mirnas, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated, had more than 2-fold differential expression between the castrated and intact male pigs .
one hundred and sixty-seven pre-mirnas were common to both castrated  and intact  male pig small rna libraries.
mirtrons are a recently described category of mirna relying on splicing rather than processing by the microprocessor complex to generate the rnai pathway.
it is widely known that castration has a significant effect on the accumulation of adipose tissue.
kegg pathway analyses suggested that mirnas differentially expressed between the castrated and intact male pigs are involved in proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration, adipose tissue development and other important biological processes.
the novel pre-mirnas encoded  <dig> mirnas/mirna*s and  <dig> mirnas/mirna*s in the f <dig> and f <dig> libraries, respectively.
