iview will be useful for those wanting to make introgression data from their stock of germplasm searchable.
the source code for iview can be downloaded from http://xrl.us/iview.
users can search for introgressions using marker names, or chromosome number and map positions.
an introgression library is a family of near-isogenic lines in a common genetic background, each of which carries one or more genomic regions contributed by a donor genome.
this search results in a display of lines carrying an introgression at the specified position.
with many thousands of distinct genotypes, querying introgression libraries for lines of interest is an issue.
this tool incorporates a web interface for displaying the location and extent of introgressions.
