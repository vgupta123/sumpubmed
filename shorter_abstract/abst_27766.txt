the o-antigen is the distal part of the lipopolysaccharide, which is a key component of outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and confers serological specificity.
the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of leptospirosis are relative to the serology based taxonomic unit.
in this study, the o-antigen gene clusters of four epidemic leptospira serogroups  in china were sequenced and all genes were predicted in silico.
adding published sequences of two serogroups, icterohaemorrhagiae  and sejroe , we identified six o-antigen-specific genes for six epidemic serogroups in china.
the results show that the pcr-based assays can be reliable and alternative means for rapid typing of these six serogroups of leptospira.
