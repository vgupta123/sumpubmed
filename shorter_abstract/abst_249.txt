no statistically significant difference was observed in the serum resistance phenotype between nmec and hfec.
a total of  <dig> isolates of nmec obtained from neonates with meningitis and  <dig> isolates of fecal e. coli obtained from healthy individuals  were comparatively evaluated using five phenotypic  and three genotypic  methods.
the objective of the present study was to identify genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of nmec that can be used to distinguish them from commensal e. coli.
the nmec strains demonstrated a greater ability to form biofilms in luria bertani broth medium than did hfec .
high levels of heterogeneity and diversity have been observed in the repertoire of virulence traits and other characteristics among strains of nmec making it difficult to define the nmec pathotype.
the results of our study demonstrated that virulence genotyping and phylogrouping may assist in defining the potential nmec pathotype.
neonatal meningitis-causing escherichia coli  is the predominant gram-negative bacterial pathogen associated with meningitis in newborn infants.
