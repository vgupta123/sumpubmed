it plays an important role in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increases permeability across the vessels.
at the early stage, fd <dig> showed better inhibitory effect on the growth of conv compared with bevacizumab .
binding kinetics assays showed similar results that fd <dig> possessed 2-fold higher affinity to bind vegf than bevacizumab due to slower dissociation rate of fd006; meanwhile, fd <dig> inhibited the vegf-induced proliferation of huvec with an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, which seemed similar or a litter better than bevacizumab .
western blot analysis showed that fd <dig> could inhibit the expression of vegf, vegfr- <dig>  vegfr- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and icam- <dig>  which could explain its favorable anti-angiogenic activity.
experimental analysis showed that the binding ability of fd <dig> seemed a little stronger than bevacizumab, for the ec <dig> of fd <dig> to bind vegf analyzed by elisa was about  <dig>  μg/ml while that of bevacizumab was  <dig>  μg/ml.
the subconjunctival administration of fd <dig>  bevacizumab or dexamethasone could significantly inhibit the growth of conv contrasting to n.s .
using antibody phage display technology, we obtained a novel anti-vegfa igg, named as fd <dig>  in this study, the pharmacological characteristics and efficacy of fd <dig> in corneal neovascularization  were evaluated.
the pharmacological characteristics of fd <dig> were similar or even a little better than bevacizumab in inhibiting corneal neovascularization.
vascular endothelial growth factor  is a key angiogenic factors.
