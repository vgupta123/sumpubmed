anovarray is a package implementing anova for gene expression data using sasÂ® statistical software.
the advantage of the anova model is the possibility to evaluate multiple sources of variation in an experiment.
analysis of variance is a powerful approach to identify differentially expressed genes in a complex experimental design for microarray and macroarray data.
the originality of the package is 1) to quantify the different sources of variation on all genes together, 2) to provide a quality control of the model, 3) to propose two models for a gene's variance estimation and to perform a correction for multiple comparisons.
