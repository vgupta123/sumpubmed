the presence of serum led to a distinct pattern of gene expression in comparison to those of previous single-stimulus microarray studies on the effect of temperature and osmolarity upshift.
transmission of pathogenic leptospira to humans mostly occurs through abraded skin or mucosal surfaces after direct or indirect contact with infected animals or contaminated soil or water.
our study showed global transcriptional changes of pathogenic leptospira upon exposure to serum, representing a specific host environmental cue present in the bloodstream.
in order to identify genes involved in survival in the early spirochetemic phase of infection, we performed a transcriptional analysis of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni upon exposure to serum in comparison with emjh medium.
most of the differentially expressed genes were predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation, translational process, two-component signal transduction systems, cell or membrane biogenesis, and metabolic pathways.
the results provide insights into the pathogenesis of leptospirosis during the early bacteremic phase of infection.
the most common species, l. interrogans, can survive in the environment for lengthy periods of time in between infection of mammalian hosts.
previous dna microarray studies have identified differentially expressed genes required for adaptation to temperature and osmolarity conditions inside the host compared to those of the environment.
