performance decreases as read length increases relative to island size.
an exception for applying standard theory arises if sequence redundancy is less than about 1-fold.
specifically, rates of coverage and gap reduction are appreciably lower than those for conventional libraries, as predicted by standard theory.
here, evolution of the random quantities is independent of library gaps and edge effects.
the edge effect cannot be neglected in most cases.
although opposite of what happens in a conventional library, this apparent paradox is readily explained in terms of the edge effect.
moreover, the associated density function suggests well-defined probabilistic milestones for the number of reads necessary to capture a given fraction of the gene space.
coverage performance using a filtered library is significantly lower than that for an equivalent-sized conventional library, suggesting that directed methods may be more critical for the former.
the standard model for random sequencing, lander-waterman theory, does not account for two important issues in such libraries, discontinuities and position-based sampling biases .
