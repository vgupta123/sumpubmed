dipyrone  is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used both in human and in veterinary medicine.
after oral administration, is broken down rapidly to metabolites which largely retain the activity of the parent drug.
in summation, our observations suggest that a piglet model is useful for studying the impact of met on hemorheological parameters.
the study calculated the value of several hemorheological parameters.
significant impact of met treatment  was proven in case: activated partial thromboplastin time; ratio of activated partial thromboplastin time; hemoglobin; hematocrit; mean corpuscular hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; red blood cells volume; white blood cells volume; prothrombin time index.
the subjects were eight healthy male large white post-suckling piglets, weighing between  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg, of ages 35 ± 10 days.
