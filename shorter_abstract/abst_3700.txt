dff <dig>  has been described as a substrate for caspase- <dig>  dff <dig> seems to play an important role in the onset of apoptotic process by acting probably through the regulation of dna fragmentation.
rcas <dig>  is a protein expressed mainly by various human cancer cells.
it is not only the marker of cancer process and its expression can also be observed in physiological processes.
the aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of nasal polyps to regulate the cytotoxic immune response and to determine their resistance to apoptosis.
the alterations in rcas <dig> expression indicate that nasal polyps have the ability to regulate the cytotoxic immune response.
nasal polyp constitutes a benign growth process in the nasal and sinus mucosa.
the higher rcas <dig> level was identified in lymphocytic nasal polyps, the medium one in eosinophilic while the lowest was identified in neutrophilic.
dff- <dig> expression was higher in eosinophilic than in neutrophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps.
the changes in dff- <dig> level in nasal polyps might indicate a different resistance to apoptosis mediated by immune cells.
the breaking of resistance to immune mediated apoptosis in nasal polyps might have a new therapeutic impact.
it is responsible for the regulation of immune cells activity.
