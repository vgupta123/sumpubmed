temperature and ph optimums were found to be 60Â°c and ph 3- <dig>  in agreement with the values observed for the fungal members of family g <dig>  in addition, pepg <dig> was found to be pepstatin-insensitive, a characteristic signature of glutamic peptidases.
previously, only glutamic peptidases derived from filamentous fungi have been characterized.
glutamic peptidases, from the merops family g <dig>  are a distinct group of peptidases characterized by a catalytic dyad consisting of a glutamate and a glutamine residue, optimal activity at acidic ph and insensitivity towards the microbial derived protease inhibitor, pepstatin.
dsm  <dig>  the amino acid sequence identity between pepg <dig> and known fungal glutamic peptidases is only 24-30% but homology modeling, the presence of the glutamate/glutamine catalytic dyad and a number of highly conserved motifs strongly support the inclusion of pepg <dig> as a glutamic peptidase.
based on the obtained results, we suggest that pepg <dig> can be added to the merops family g <dig> as the first characterized bacterial member.
phylogenetic analysis places pepg <dig> and other putative bacterial and archaeal glutamic peptidases in a cluster separate from the fungal glutamic peptidases, indicating a divergent and independent evolution of bacterial and fungal glutamic peptidases.
the purified peptidase was characterized with respect to its physical properties.
