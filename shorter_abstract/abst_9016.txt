our data reveals the mammalian glut proteins segregate into five distinct classes.
combined with biological assays, we present novel evidence that, in response to changing nutrient availability and environmental ph, proton-coupled, active glucose symport function is maintained in mammalian cells.
in mammals it has been assumed that evolution of whole body regulatory mechanisms would eliminate this need.
they also reveal that mammals may have conserved an adaptive response to nutrient demand that would have important physiological implications to cell survival and growth.
this evolutionary ancestry gives insight to structure, function and transport mechanisms within the groups.
to determine whether any isoforms bearing this function might be conserved in mammals, we investigated the relationship between the transporters of animals and the proton-coupled hexose symporters found in other species.
facilitative carriers transport sugars along a concentration gradient, thus transport is dependent upon extracellular nutrient levels.
across bacteria, fungi, unicellular non-vertebrates and plants, proton-coupled hexose symport is a crucial process supplying energy under conditions of nutrient flux.
we took a comparative genomic approach and have performed the first comprehensive and statistically supported phylogenetic analysis of all mammalian glucose transporter  isoforms.
these findings significantly extend our understanding of the evolution of mammalian glucose transport systems.
