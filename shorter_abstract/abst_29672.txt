we used the new 20k atlantic cod microarray to investigate how a water temperature change which, simulates that seen in newfoundland during the spring-summer  impacted the cod spleen transcriptome response to the intraperitoneal injection of a viral mimic .
the temperature increase appeared to accelerate the spleen immune transcriptome response to pic.
these results substantially increase our understanding of the genes and molecular pathways involved in the negative impacts of elevated ambient temperature on fish health, and may also be valuable to our understanding of how accelerated global climate change could impact cold-water marine finfish species.
our results indicate that the modulation of mrna expression of genes belonging to the nf-κb and type i interferon signal transduction pathways may play a role in controlling temperature-induced changes in the spleen’s transcript expression response to pic.
the temperature regime alone did not cause any significant increases in plasma cortisol levels and only minor changes in spleen gene transcription.
seventeen microarray-identified transcripts were selected for qpcr validation based on immune-relevant functional annotations.
however, it had a considerable impact on the fish spleen transcriptome response to pic .
atlantic cod  reared in sea-cages can experience large variations in temperature, and these have been shown to affect their immune function.
