our analysis is performed taking advantage of the recently implemented bologna annotation resource , a non hierarchical clustering method that relies on the pair wise sequence comparison of about  <dig> millions proteins from over  <dig>  species and their grouping into clusters where annotation can safely be inherited after statistical validation.
interestingly a set of  <dig> human sequences inherit mg2+ binding sites from templates sharing less than 30% sequence identity with the template.
magnesium binding features, differently from those of other divalent cations such as calcium and zinc, are elusive.
we describe and deliver the "human magnesome", a set of proteins of the human proteome that inherit putative binding of magnesium ions.
this is mainly due to little information on the structural characteristics of magnesium binding sites in proteins and protein complexes.
with our bar-hmg,  <dig> clusters including  <dig>  magnesium binding protein structures corresponding to  <dig> sequences are sufficient to annotate some  <dig>  residues in  <dig>  human sequences as "magnesium binding".
protein structures act therefore as three dimensional seeds for structural and functional annotation of human sequences.
the data base collects specifically all the human proteins that can be annotated according to our procedure as "magnesium binding", the corresponding structures and bar+ clusters from where they derive the annotation .
after cluster assignment of the latest version of the human proteome, the total number of human proteins for which we can assign putative mg binding sites is  <dig> .
here we address a question that is relevant in protein annotation: how many human proteins can bind mg2+?
among these proteins,  <dig>  inherit annotation directly from human templates and  <dig>  inherit annotation from templates of other organisms.
protein structures are highly conserved inside a given cluster.
transfer of structural properties is possible after alignment of a given sequence with the protein structures that characterise a given cluster as obtained with a hidden markov model  based procedure.
