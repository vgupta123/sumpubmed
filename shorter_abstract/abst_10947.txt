however, data from high-incidence settings are only sparely available.
the majority of isoniazid and rifampin resistant strains had mutations in katg <dig>  and rpob <dig> .
strikingly, none of the streptomycin resistant strains had mutations in rrs, but  <dig> % harboured mutations in rpsl.
among ethambutol resistant strains  <dig> % had mutations at embb <dig>  pyrazinamide resistant strains displayed a variety of mutations throughout pnca.
however, the fact that particular mutations in rpob are not linked to high-level resistance is challenging and demonstrates that careful interpretation of molecular resistance assays is mandatory.
of the strains investigated  <dig> were either mono- or poly-resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide or mdr and  <dig> fully susceptible strains served as controls.
however, rpob mutations in codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also detected in five rifampin susceptible strains.
our study reveals a good correlation between data from molecular and phenotypic resistance testing in this high-incidence setting.
therefore we performed a systematic approach and analyzed a total of 97â€‰m. tuberculosis strains from previously treated patients in sierra leone for mutations in katg, rpob, rrs, rpsl, gidb, embb, pnca and where applicable in inha and ahpc.
for molecular resistance testing, it is essential to have precise knowledge on genomic variations involved in resistance development.
drug resistance displays a problem for the therapy of mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.
thus, the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing of katg for detection of drug resistance were  <dig> % and 100% and for sequencing of rpob 100% and  <dig> %, respectively.
in addition, certain variations, especially in gidb, appear to be phylogenetically informative polymorphisms rather than markers for drug resistance.
