to achieve greater resolution of small differences in transcript levels in degraded samples, we improved this normalization method by developing a corrective algorithm that compensates for the loss of rna integrity.
our results show that rna degradation could introduce up to 100% error in gene expression measurements when rt-qpcr data were normalized to total rna.
we developed a new normalization method of rt-qpcr data that compensates for loss of rna integrity and therefore allows accurate gene expression quantification in human biopsies.
taken together, our data show that normalization of gene expression measurements by taking into account also rna degradation allows much more reliable sample comparison.
in this study, we evaluated the effect of rna degradation on the quantification of the relative expression of nine genes  that cover a wide expression spectrum.
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction  is the gold standard technique for mrna quantification, but appropriate normalization is required to obtain reliable data.
however, this approach does not correct differences in rna integrity.
normalization to accurately quantitated rna has been proposed as the most reliable method for in vivo biopsies.
