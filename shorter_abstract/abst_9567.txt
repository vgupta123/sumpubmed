for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of sbv infection in adult ruminants, we carried out experimental infections in adult goats.
our specific objectives were:  to record clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion;  to monitor viral excretion in the semen of infected bucks;  to determine in which tissues sbv replication took place and virus-induced lesions developed.
virus inoculation was followed by a short viremic phase lasting  <dig> to 4Â days and a seroconversion occurring between days  <dig> and  <dig> pi in all animals.
sbv causes a subclinical or mild disease in adult animals but vertical transmission to pregnant dams may lead to severe malformations in the offspring.
sbv rna was not found in the semen samples collected from two inoculated bucks.
the inoculated goats did not display any clinical signs, gross lesions or histological lesions.
data on the onset of clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion in experimentally infected adult animals are available for cattle and sheep but are still lacking for goats.
our limited set of data provides no evidence of viral excretion in buck semen.
