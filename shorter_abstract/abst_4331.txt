we introduce two cytoscape plug-ins, which support the generation and interpretation of experiment-based interaction networks.
numerical values from expression studies assigned to the nodes serve to score identified paths.
based on our investigations using viper and peanut, we suggest a role of the foxa1/a2/a <dig> transcriptional network in the cellular response to atorvastatin treatment.
it supports the interpretation and navigation of large-scale datasets by creating focus networks, facilitating mechanistic predictions from â€“omics studies.
using time series expression data of atorvastatin treated primary hepatocytes from six patients, we demonstrate the handling and applicability of viper and peanut.
moreover, we find an enrichment of metabolic and cancer pathways in the fox transcriptional network and demonstrate a patient-specific reaction to the drug.
the virtual pathway explorer viper creates so-called focus networks by joining a list of experimentally determined genes with the interactome of a specific organism.
peanut provides an up-front method to identify underlying biological principles by calculating enriched pathways in focus networks.
the pathway enrichment analysis tool peanut annotates networks with pathway information from various sources and calculates enriched pathways between a focus and a background network.
