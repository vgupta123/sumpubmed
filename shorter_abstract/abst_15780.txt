these results cast light on how dna mutations affect the genome over evolutionary time.
for eukaryotes, there is almost no strand bias with regard to base composition, with exceptions for origins of replication and transcription start sites and transcribed regions.
for a typical mammal, for example mouse or human, there is a small strand bias throughout the genomic dna: there is a correlation between  and  on the same strand, .
the genome of mammals and birds has a structure marked by strand bias segments.
the correlations on the large scale may be explained by dna replication.
an analysis of available genomes of different species shows that this contrast between large and small windows is a general feature of mammals and birds.
at least for vertebrates, there is a broad relationship between body temperature and the size of the correlation.
an analysis of the human genome showed that position within the isochore structure did not affect these correlations.
