prolonged responses depended on cortical stimulation because they could not be elicited using intrastriatal stimulation, even if gabaergic transmission was blocked.
moreover, inhibitory participation was larger after cortical than after intrastriatal stimulation.
previous work showed differences in the polysynaptic activation of gabaergic synapses during corticostriatal suprathreshold responses in direct and indirect striatal projection neurons .
here, we now show differences and similarities in the polysynaptic activation of cortical glutamatergic synapses on the same responses.
does glutamatergic synaptic activation exhibits a distribution of latencies over time in vitro?
one hypothesis was: if prolonged synaptic activation distributed along time was present, then it would be mainly generated from the cortex, and not from the striatum.
by isolating responses from ampa-receptors out of the complex suprathreshold response of spns, it is shown that a single cortical stimulus induces early and late synaptic activation lasting hundreds of milliseconds.
a strong activation of interneurons was obtained from the cortex, demonstrating that polysynaptic activation includes the striatum.
as it has been established in previous physiological studies in vivo, synaptic invasion over different latencies, spanning hundreds of milliseconds after a single stimulus strongly indicates convergent polysynaptic activation.
interconnected cortical neurons converging on the same spns may explain prolonged corticostriatal responses.
thus, the results are not explained by differences in evoked inhibition.
that would be a strong suggestion of polysynaptic cortical convergence.
responses of dspns and ispns did not depend on the cortical area stimulated.
in contrast to ampa-receptors, responses from nmda- and ka-receptors do not exhibit early and late responses, but generate slow responses that contribute to plateau depolarizations.
