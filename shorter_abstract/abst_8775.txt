in this study, seven descriptors namely area, convex area, major axis length, minor axis length, perimeter, equivalent diameter and extent which are based on the shape are used as features to represent digital image of skull that consists of dorsal, lateral and jaw views for each specimen.
thus, specimen classification using training data set and identification using testing data set were performed through two stages of anns.
thus, an automated identification system is developed to assist and simplify this task.
this automated system demonstrates the practicability of using computer-assisted systems in providing interesting alternative approach for quick and easy identification of unknown species.
this results show that the shape characteristic features used are substantial because they can differentiate the specimens based on regions and sexes up to the accuracy of 80% and above.
finally, an application was developed and can be used for the scientific community.
this study looks into another invasive process in identification of house shrew  using image analysis and machine learning approaches.
an artificial neural network  is used as classifier to classify the skulls of s. murinus based on region  and sex .
