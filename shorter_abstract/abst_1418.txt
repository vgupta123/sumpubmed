we find that glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was associated with enhancement of superoxide production, activation of caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  increases of mitochondrial fission marker and mitochondrial morphological changes.
previous studies have indicated that selenium supplementation may be beneficial in neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell damage, in which mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a major pathogenic feature.
selenium significantly resolved the glutamate-induced mitochondria structural damage, alleviated oxidative stress, decreased apaf- <dig>  caspases- <dig> and - <dig> contents, and altered the autophagy process as observed by a decline in the ratio of the autophagy markers lc3-i and lc3-ii.
