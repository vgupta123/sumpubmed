however, whether chemical inducers are able to enhance cbcs germline competence in vitro is unknown and the molecular mechanisms of differentiation of chicken pluripotent cells into germ cells are poorly understood.
as chicken primordial germ cells  have been reported as an efficient method for producing transgenic chickens, the inefficiency of cbcs could potentially be resolved by inducing them to differentiate into germ cells.
our results demonstrated that e <dig> medium is able to maintain cbc growth for weeks and ra treatment induced germ cell differentiation of cbcs through the bmp-smad1/ <dig> signaling pathway.
producing transgenic chickens with chicken blastodermal cells  is inefficient due to the extremely low germline transmission capacity of cbcs.
using western blot, we determined that ra stimulated smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation.
