host- and overexpressed proteins do not co-precipitate with sds and the residual concentration of detergent is compatible with affinity purification on ni/nta resin.
many proteins form insoluble protein aggregates, called “inclusion bodies”, when overexpressed in e. coli.
ever since the reversible denaturation of proteins by chaotropic agents such as urea or guanidinium hydrochloride had been shown, these compounds were predominantly used to dissolve inclusion bodies.
the excess of detergent is removed by cooling and centrifugation prior to affinity purification.
