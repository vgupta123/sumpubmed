it is widely used as a defined and tractable c. difficile strain.
the annotated genome sequence of this lab strain, including the first analysis of major methylation patterns, will be a valuable resource for genetic research on c. difficile.
though largely similar to the ancestral strain, it demonstrates phenotypic differences that might be the result of underlying genetic changes.
together, the genetic features identified in this study may help to explain at least part of the phenotypic differences.
clostridium difficile strain 630Δerm is a spontaneous erythromycin sensitive derivative of the reference strain  <dig> obtained by serial passaging in antibiotic-free media.
in addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms and various indels, we found that the mobile element ctn <dig> is present in the gene encoding the methyltransferase ruma rather than adhesin cd <dig> where it is located in the reference strain.
here, we performed a de novo assembly based on single-molecule real-time sequencing and an analysis of major methylation patterns.
