to determine if these results are relevant to human tumors, we knocked-down hmga <dig> in human t-cell leukemia cells and identified a subset of genes dysregulated in both the transgenic and human lymphoid tumors.
these results provide insight into hmga <dig> function during tumor development and point to cellular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets in lymphoid and other human cancers with aberrant hmga <dig> expression.
to define the hmga <dig> transcriptome, we analyzed gene expression profiles in lymphoid cells from hmga1a transgenic mice at different stages in tumorigenesis.
rna from lymphoid samples at  <dig> months  and  <dig> months  was screened for differential expression of >  <dig>  unique genes by microarray analysis  using a parametric and nonparametric approach.
because hmga <dig> chromatin remodeling proteins regulate transcription, hmga <dig> is thought to drive malignant transformation by modulating expression of specific genes.
at both stages in tumorigenesis, hmga <dig> induced pathways involved in cellular development, hematopoiesis, and hematologic development.
hmga <dig> also dyregulates genes and pathways involved in stem cells, cellular development and hematopoiesis at both early and late stages of tumorigenesis.
we found that hmga <dig> induces inflammatory pathways early in lymphoid tumorigenesis and pathways involved in stem cells, cell cycle progression, and cancer in established tumors.
differentially expressed genes were analyzed for cellular pathways and functions using ingenuity pathway analysis.
in established tumors, hmga <dig> induced pathways involved in cell cycle progression, cell-mediated immune response, and cancer.
hmga <dig> functions as a potent oncogene in cultured cells and induces aggressive lymphoid tumors in transgenic mice.
early in tumorigenesis, hmga <dig> induced inflammatory pathways with nfkappab identified as a major node.
gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell and immature t cell genes are enriched in the established tumors.
although the high mobility group a <dig>  gene is widely overexpressed in diverse cancers and portends a poor prognosis in some tumors, the molecular mechanisms that mediate its role in transformation have remained elusive.
differential expression was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr in a subset of genes.
