the plasmid survey indicated that nine out of  <dig> xoc chinese isolates contain plasmids.
gaps were closed by primer walking and sequencing, and multi-pcrs were conducted through the whole plasmid sequence for verification.
an indigenous plasmid was identified in a chinese isolate  of the invasive phytopathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv.
it could significantly enhance the tolerance of xanthomonas oryzae pv.
pxocgx <dig> is the first report of indigenous plasmid from xanthomonas oryzae pv.
the results will be helpful to elucidate the biological significance of this cryptic plasmid and the adaptive evolution of xoc.
the indigenous plasmid from xoc strain gx <dig>  designated pxocgx <dig>  is  <dig> -bp long and has been annotated to possess  <dig> open reading frames , including genes encoding type iv secretion system, heavy metal exporter, plasmid stability factors, and dna mobile factors, i.e., the tn3-like transposon.
bioinformatics analysis showed that pxocgx <dig> has a mosaic structure containing different genome contexts with distinct genomic heterogeneities.
it is a self-transmissible plasmid and has a mosaic structure, containing genes for macromolecule secretion, heavy metal exportation, and dna mobile factors, especially the tn3-like transposon which may provide transposition function for mobile insertion cassette and play a major role in the spread of pathogenicity determinants.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the closest relative of pxocgx <dig> is pxac <dig> from xanthomonas axonopodis pv.
the plasmid dna was extracted from xoc strain gx <dig> by alkaline lysis and digested with restriction enzymes.

blast, phylogenetic analysis and dinucleotide calculation were performed for gene annotation and dna structure analysis.
sequences were assembled by using sequencher software.
we demonstrate that pxocgx <dig> is a self-transmissible plasmid and can replicate in some xanthomonas spp.
