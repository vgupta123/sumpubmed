the fungus appears to adapt by trans-differentiation into a resting mycelial stage.
invasive aspergillosis is started after germination of aspergillus fumigatus conidia that are inhaled by susceptible individuals.
we analyzed whether blood represents a hostile environment to which the physiology of a. fumigatus has to adapt.
an in vitro model of a. fumigatus infection was established by incubating mycelium in blood.
our model allowed to discern the changes of the gene expression profile of a. fumigatus at various stages of the infection.
we propose that a. fumigatus is hardly able to propagate in blood.
this might reflect the harsh conditions in blood where a. fumigatus cannot take up sufficient nutrients to establish self-defense mechanisms combined with significant growth.
three active processes were identified that presumably help the fungus to survive the blood environment in an advanced phase of the infection: iron homeostasis, secondary metabolism, and the formation of detoxifying enzymes.
after an early stage of sensing the environment, virtually all uptake mechanisms and energy-consuming metabolic pathways are shut-down.
fungal hyphae can grow in the lung through the epithelial tissue and disseminate hematogenously to invade into other organs.
the majority of described virulence factors that are connected to pulmonary infections appeared not to be activated during the blood phase.
