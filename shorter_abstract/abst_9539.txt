sucrose transporters  play important roles in regulating the translocation of assimilates from source to sink tissues.
topological analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three homeologues revealed that they contain  <dig> transmembrane spanning helices, which are described as distinct characteristic features of glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide cation symporter family that includes all known plant suts, and a histidine residue that appears to be localized at and associated conformationally with the sucrose binding site.
identification and characterization of new suts in economically important crops such as wheat provide insights into their role in determining seed yield.
at the cellular level, tasut <dig> is expressed mainly in the vein of developing seeds and subepidermal mesophyll cells of the leaf blade.
the expression of tasut <dig> was detected in the source, including flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath, peduncle, glumes, palea and lemma, and sink  tissues.
the present study reports the isolation and characterization of a new sut, designated as tasut <dig>  and its homeologues  in hexaploid wheat .
yeast susy7/ura <dig> strain cells transformed with tasut2a, tasut2b and tasut2d were able to uptake sucrose and grow on a medium containing sucrose as a sole source of carbon; however, our subcellular localization study with plant cells revealed that tasut <dig> is localized to the tonoplast.
the relative contributions of the three genomes of wheat to the total expression of tasut <dig> appear to differ with tissues and developmental stages.
