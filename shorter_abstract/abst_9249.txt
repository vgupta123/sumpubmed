the individuals were collected from regions representing two different australian patterns of btv strain distribution: the northern territory  and the east coast.
this study employed the gbs method to isolate snp markers de novo from whole genome amplified culicoides brevitarsis genomic dna.
genotyping by sequencing , a reduced representation library sequencing method, allows highly multiplexed sequencing of genomic subsets.
however, more extensive sampling over a wider spatial and temporal range is needed.
the described workflow is transferable to genotyping of small, non-model organisms, including arthropod vectors of pathogens of economic and medical importance.
the results suggest that genotyping vectors with high density markers in combination with biological and environmental data is useful.
the presence of sub-structure in populations and loci under natural selection indicates the need for further investigation of the role of vectors in shaping the two australian systems of btv transmission.
two loci showed a very strong signal for selection and were unique to the nt population.
this method has limitations for small organisms with low amounts of genomic dna, such as the bluetongue virus  vectors, culicoides midges.
phylogenetic analysis conducted using the filtered  <dig> snps revealed the presence of a distinct c. brevitarsis sub-population in the nt and this was confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial dna.
