a manufactured oligoarray including a subset of control escherichia coli probes was validated for applications in the fields of comparative genomics and molecular epidemiology, mapping of deletion mutations and transcription profiling.
relying on parameters shown to affect the hybridization of nucleic acids, we designed freely available software and validated experimentally its performance on the bacterial pathogen staphylococcus aureus.
this algorithm efficiently selected probes recognizing homologous gene targets across three different sequenced genomes of staphylococcus aureus.
blast analysis of the final selection of  <dig>  probes yielded >97%, 93%, and 81% of staphylococcus aureus genome coverage in strains n <dig>  mu <dig>  and col, respectively.
optimal design of immobilized nucleic acids has a direct impact on the reliability of microarray results.
the algorithm for filtering probes from extensive oligonucleotides libraries fitting standard thermodynamic criteria includes positional information of predicted target-probe binding regions.
we describe an efficient procedure for selecting 40â€“ <dig> mer oligonucleotide probes combining optimal thermodynamic properties with high target specificity, suitable for genomic studies of microbial species.
