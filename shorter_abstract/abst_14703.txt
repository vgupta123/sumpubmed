generalist bacterial pathogens, with the ability for environmental survival and growth, often face variable conditions during their outside-host period.
maintaining and increasing virulence ensures efficient invasion into the host especially under circumstances when the host density is low or the outside-host period is long.
abiotic factors  act as selection pressures for bacterial characteristics, but their effect on virulence is not entirely understood.
“sit and wait” hypothesis expects that long outside-host survival selects for increased virulence, but maintaining virulence in the absence of hosts is generally expected to be costly if active investments are needed.
the starved rhizoid isolates had significantly higher virulence than the ancestral rhizoid, whereas the virulence of the rough isolates was low.
changing from rhizoid into a rough morphotype has trade-offs in making bacteria less virulent and unable to exploit the host, but may ensure bacterial survival under unpredictable conditions.
our study gives an example how abiotic selection can diversify virulence of environmentally transmitting bacterial pathogen.
after 5 months starvation in lake water, the virulence of the starved and ancestral bacterial isolates was tested.
f. columnare populations in distilled water and in lake water were monitored for 5 months.
during the experiment, the population structure of f. columnare diversified by rough and soft colony morphotypes appearing among the ancestral rhizoid ones.
we suggest that f. columnare population diversification is an adaptation to tolerate unpredictable environment, but may also have other biological significance.
