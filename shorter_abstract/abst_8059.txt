some leptospiral proteins were found to be excreted in the urine from the early phase of infection.
this is the first report on the detection of leptospiral hadh in the host urine, which may be a possible candidate leptospiral antigen that can be used in the early diagnosis of human and animal leptospirosis.
in this research, with the ultimate goal of formulating a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for leptospirosis, we aimed to identify leptospiral proteins excreted in urine of infected hamsters, which are thought to mimic weilâ€™s disease.
the most important finding of this study was the detection of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme, 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase , before the onset of illness, when leptospires were not yet detected in the urine of infected hamsters.
leptospirosis is a global zoonosis caused by pathogenic leptospira.
