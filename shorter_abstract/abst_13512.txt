using a panel of  <dig> overlapping  <dig> amino acid-long peptides covering the entire adiponectin globular domain , we identified the 149- <dig> region as the adiponectin active site.
three-dimensional modeling of the active site and functional screening of additional  <dig> peptide analogs covering this region resulted in the development of a lead peptidomimetic, adp  <dig> .
its biological activity, superior stability in biological fluids as well as acceptable toxicity profile indicate that the peptidomimetic represents a true lead compound for pharmaceutical development to replace low adiponectin levels in cancer and other malignancies.
we aimed to generate adiponectin-based short peptide that can mimic adiponectin action and be suitable for preclinical and clinical development as a cancer therapeutic.
circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and this feature correlates with increased risk of developing several metabolic, immunological and neoplastic diseases.
sirna knockdown experiments suggested that adp  <dig> effects can be transmitted through both adiponectin receptors, with a greater contribution of adipor <dig>  in vivo, intraperitoneal administration of  <dig> mg/kg/day adp  <dig> for  <dig> days suppressed the growth of orthotopic human breast cancer xenografts by ~31%.
the peptide displayed excellent stability  in mouse blood or serum and did not induce gross toxic effects at 5- <dig> mg/kg bolus doses in normal cba/j mice.
adiponectin, a fat tissue-derived adipokine, exhibits beneficial effects against insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, and cancer.
at present, adiponectin-based therapeutics are not available, partly due to yet unclear structure/function relationships of the cytokine and difficulties in converting the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug.
in several adiponectin receptor-positive cancer cell lines, adp  <dig> restricted proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at  <dig> nm- <dig> Î¼m concentrations .
