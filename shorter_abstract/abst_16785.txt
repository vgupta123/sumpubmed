we demonstrate that the somatostatin receptors sst <dig> and sst <dig> are specifically expressed in outer and inner hair cells  of the organ of corti , as well as in defined supporting cells.
these findings reveal that somatostatin receptors demonstrate specific expression in hcs and supporting cells of the mouse cochlea, and that absence of sst <dig> alters the expression of sst <dig>  this specific expression pattern suggests that somatostatin receptors may have important functional roles in the inner ear.
in this study, we have analyzed the cochlear expression of somatostatin receptor  <dig>  and somatostatin receptor  <dig>  at both the mrna and the protein level in wild-type mice, as well as in sst <dig> and sst <dig> knock-out  mice and in cultivated neurosensory cells.
somatostatin itself was not expressed in the mammalian cochlea, suggesting that somatostatin reaches its receptors either through the blood-labyrinthine barrier from the systemic circulation or via the endolymphatic duct from the endolymphatic sac.
we demonstrate that in sst <dig> ko mice, sst <dig> was expressed in outer hcs and deiters' cells, but not in pillar cells or inner hcs, as compared with wild-type mice.
little is known about expression and function of the somatostatinergic system in the mammalian cochlea.
in contrast, in sst <dig> ko mice, the expression pattern of the sst <dig> receptor was not altered relative to wild-type mice.
we have previously shown that somatostatin administration may have a protective effect on gentamicin-induced hair cell loss.
