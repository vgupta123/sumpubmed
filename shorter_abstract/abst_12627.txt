many branches of biomedical research find use for pure recombinant proteins for direct application or to study other molecules and pathways.
herein, we describe a novel method for the purification of gst-tagged recombinant proteins.
although gst affinity materials are commercially available as glutathione immobilized on beaded agarose resins, few simple options for in-house production of those systems exist.
gsh containing polymers might find use as in-house methods of protein purification.
they exhibited similar ability to purify gst tagged proteins as purchased gsh agarose beads.
glutathione was conjugated to low molecular weight poly diacrylate  via thiol-ene “click” chemistry.
glutathione affinity purification is commonly used to isolate and purify glutathione s-transferase -tagged fusion proteins from total cellular proteins in lysates.
