it is an efficient implementation of the beltrami flow, a nonlinear filtering method that locally tunes the strength of the smoothing according to an edge indicator based on geometry properties.
noise filtering techniques are needed in electron tomography to allow proper interpretation of datasets.
furthermore, tomobflow is provided with abilities to deal with different types and formats of images in order to make it useful for electron tomography in particular and bioimaging in general.
the standard linear filtering techniques are characterized by a tradeoff between the amount of reduced noise and the blurring of the features of interest.
tomobflow allows efficient noise filtering of bioimaging datasets with preservation of the features of interest, thereby yielding data better suited for post-processing, visualization and interpretation.
on the other hand, sophisticated anisotropic nonlinear filtering techniques allow noise reduction with good preservation of structures.
