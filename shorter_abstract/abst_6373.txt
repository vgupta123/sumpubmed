we also evaluated genomic polymorphism and transcriptional profile in three organs of five eucalyptus species.
irap and remap markers suggested genomic polymorphisms among eucalyptus species.
in eucalyptus genus, studies on genome composition and transposable elements  are particularly scarce.
using est analysis and qrt-pcrs, we observed transcriptional activity in several tissues and in all evaluated species.
we characterized nine families of transcriptionally active ltr retrotransposons from copia and gypsy superfamilies in eucalyptus grandis genome and we depicted genomic distribution and copy number in two eucalyptus species.
overall, our results show that retrotransposon activity have differentially affected genome and transcriptome among eucalyptus species.
rlc_egmax_ <dig> was the most prevalent family and rlc_egangela_ <dig> was the family with the lowest copy number.
nearly half of the recently released eucalyptus grandis genome is composed by retrotransposons and this data provides an important opportunity to understand te dynamics in eucalyptus genome and transcriptome.
