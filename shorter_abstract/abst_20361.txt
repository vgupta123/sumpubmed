we investigated relative abundances of short sequence motifs in all human cnss present in the human/mouse whole-genome alignments vs. three background sets of sequences:  weakly conserved or unconserved non-coding sequences ;  near-promoter sequences ; and  random sequences with the same nucleotide composition as that of cnss.
when compared to non-cnss and near-promoter sequences, cnss possess an excess of at-rich motifs, often containing runs of identical nucleotides.
in particular, ~5% of the human genome consists of conserved non-coding sequences .
thus, abundance of short sequence motifs in human cnss, taken as a whole, is mostly determined by their overall compositional properties and not by overrepresentation of any specific short motifs.
only a small number of short motifs, overrepresented in all human cnss are similar to binding sites of transcription factors from the fox family.
human cnss as a whole appear to be too broad a class of sequences to possess strong footprints of any short sequence-specific functions.
in contrast, when compared to random sequences, cnss contain an excess of gc-rich motifs which, however, lack cpg dinucleotides.
such footprints should be studied at the level of functional subclasses of cnss, such as those which flank genes with a particular pattern of expression.
a substantial fraction of non-coding dna sequences of multicellular eukaryotes is under selective constraint.
cnss differ from other genomic sequences in their nucleotide composition and must play important functional roles, which mostly remain obscure.
