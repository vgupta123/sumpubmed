mitochondrial analysis revealed paraphyly for prosciurillus, with p. murinus between or outside of hyosciurus and rubrisciurus, separate from other species of prosciurillus.
the indonesian island of sulawesi has a complex geological history.
the divergence of the sulawesi squirrels from their closest relatives dated to ~ <dig> – <dig>  million years ago , pushing back the age estimate of this ancient adaptive radiation prior to the formation of the current conformation of sulawesi.
nuclear and mitochondrial analyses were largely congruent and well supported, except for the placement of prosciurillus murinus.
here we present a molecular phylogeny of this radiation using data from museum specimens.
we propose that incongruence between phylogenies based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequences may have resulted from biogeographic discordance, when two allopatric lineages come into secondary contact, with complete replacement of the mitochondria in one species.
our analysis confirmed monophyly of the sulawesi taxa with deep divergences between the three endemic genera, which predate the amalgamation of the current island of sulawesi.
it is the largest island in the biodiversity hotspot of wallacea—an area demarcated by the biogeographic breaks between wallace’s and lydekker’s lines.
high throughput sequencing technology was used to generate whole mitochondrial genomes and a panel of nuclear ultraconserved elements providing a large genome-wide dataset for inferring phylogenetic relationships.
