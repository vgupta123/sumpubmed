a comprehensive sensitivity analysis and an extensive validation of the algorithm have been carried out.
here we present a new algorithm pocketmatch for comparison of binding sites in a frame invariant manner.
a new algorithm has been developed to compare binding sites in accurate, efficient and high-throughput manner.
our analysis also demonstrates that shape information alone is insufficient to discriminate between diverse binding sites, unless combined with chemical nature of amino acids.
perturbation studies where the geometry of a given site was retained but the residue types were changed randomly, indicated that chance similarities were virtually non-existent.
to benefit from the enormous amount of structural data that is being rapidly accumulated, it is essential to have high throughput tools that enable large scale binding site comparison.
each binding site is represented by  <dig> lists of sorted distances capturing shape and chemical nature of the site.
novel methodology has also been presented for validating the algorithm for accuracy and sensitivity with respect to geometry and chemical nature of the site.
recognizing similarities and deriving relationships among protein molecules is a fundamental requirement in present-day biology.
inferring functional similarities between protein molecules by comparing their binding sites is still largely exploratory and not as yet a routine protocol.
one of the main reasons for this is the limitation in the choice of appropriate analytical tools that can compare binding sites with high sensitivity.
