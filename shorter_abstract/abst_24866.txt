most studies apply statistical, bioclimatic envelope models and focus primarily on plant species as compared to other taxa.
protected areas are the most common and important instrument for the conservation of biological diversity and are called for under the united nations' convention on biological diversity.
very few studies utilize a mechanistic, process-based approach and none examine biotic interactions like predation and competition.
this approach would go beyond reactive crisis management and, by necessity, would include anticipatory risk assessments.
therefore, it is of crucial importance to include the potential impact of climate change when designing future nature conservation strategies and implementing protected area management.
growing human population densities, intensified land-use, invasive species and increasing habitat fragmentation threaten ecosystems worldwide and protected areas are often the only refuge for endangered species.
here we review the literature to determine the state-of-the-art in modeling terrestrial protected areas under climate change, with the aim of evaluating and detecting trends and gaps in the current approaches being employed, as well as to provide a useful overview and guidelines for future research.
important factors like land-use, habitat fragmentation, invasion and dispersal are rarely incorporated, restricting the informative value of the resulting predictions considerably.
the general impression that emerges is that biodiversity conservation in protected areas could benefit from the application of modern modeling approaches to a greater extent than is currently reflected in the scientific literature.
