aegypti genome and provided new insights into genomic composition and evolution of ae.
a comparative genomic analysis with an.
the study demonstrated that the q arm of the sex-determining chromosome  <dig> had the lowest gene content and the highest density of minisatellites.
gambiae determined that the previously proposed whole-arm synteny is not fully preserved; a number of pericentric inversions have occurred between the two species.
an initial comparative genomic study of the malaria vector anopheles gambiae and the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti revealed striking differences in the genome assembly size and in the abundance of transposable elements between the two species.
we used this map to analyze the distribution of genes, tandem repeats and transposable elements along the chromosomes and to explore the patterns of chromosome homology and rearrangements between ae.
our data suggest that minisatellites rather than transposable elements played a major role in rapid evolution of chromosome  <dig> in the aedes lineage.
the study developed a physical map of 45% of the ae.
aegypti, as well as the distribution of genes and repetitive elements in chromosomes of ae.
the research tools and information generated by this study contribute to a more complete understanding of the genome organization and evolution in mosquitoes.
