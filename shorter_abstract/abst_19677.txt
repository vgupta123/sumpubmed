golden promise accumulates lower shoot na+ compared to maythorpe when growing under saline conditions.
the results confirm that golden promise and maythorpe are genetically very closely related but establish that they are not isogenic, as previously reported, due to three polymorphic haplotype blocks.
transcriptome analysis indicates that the response of the two genotypes to salinity stress is quite different.
additionally, the response to salinity stress in the roots and shoot tissue is strikingly different.
salt tolerance in golden promise has been attributed to a single mutation at the ari-e locus  resulting from irradiation of maythorpe.
