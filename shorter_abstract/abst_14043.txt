cb1r mrna decreases until adulthood, particularly in layer ii, after peaking between neonates and toddlers.
stronger endocannabinoid regulation of presynaptic neurotransmission in both supragranular and infragranular cortical layers as indexed through higher cb1r mrna may occur within the first few years of human life.
daglÎ± mrna expression is lowest in early life and adulthood, peaking between school age and young adulthood.
mgl expression declines after peaking in infancy, while abhd <dig> increases from neonatal age.
we used microarray with qpcr validation and in situ hybridisation to quantify mrna for the central endocannabinoid receptor cb1r, endocannabinoid synthetic enzymes , and inactivating enzymes  in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
we investigated the developmental expression of key genes in the endocannabinoid system across human postnatal life and determined whether they correspond to the development of markers for inhibitory interneurons, which shape cortical development.
thus, expression of key genes in the endocannabinoid system changes with maturation of cortical function.
