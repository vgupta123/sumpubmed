a cell culture model was utilized to study the interactions of mutant tau proteins, model hirano bodies, and gsk3β in human astrocytoma cells.
hirano bodies are actin-rich paracrystalline inclusions found in brains of patients with alzheimer’s disease , frontotemporal dementia , and in normal aged individuals.

model hirano bodies had no effect or enhanced cell death induced by tau in the absence of amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain .
although studies of post-mortem brain tissue provide clues of etiology, the physiological function of hirano bodies remains unknown.
most tau variants showed co-localization with model hirano bodies.
in the presence of aicd and tau, synergistic cell death was observed in most cases, and model hirano bodies decreased this synergistic cell death, except for forms of tau that caused significant cell death in the presence of hirano bodies only.
a subset of hirano bodies in brain tissue of both alzheimer’s disease and normal aged individuals was found to contain tau, with some hirano bodies in alzheimer’s disease brains containing hyperphosphorylated tau.
the results demonstrate a complex interaction between tau and aicd involving activation of gsk3β in promoting cell death, and the ability of hirano bodies to modulate this process.
a role for the kinase gsk3β is suggested by the finding that a dominant negative form of gsk3β reduces this synergistic cell death.
