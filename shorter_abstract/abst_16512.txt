par  <dig> agonist did not increase platelet adhesion of platelets from dogs with bacterial inflammation in the flow chamber in contrast to platelets of healthy dogs.
in vitro addition of lps highlights the inhibiting effect of bacterial wall components on platelet function.
in the present study, the influence of bacterial infection, lipopolysacharides  and hydroxyethyl starch  on platelet function in a parallel plate flow chamber were measured.
the flow chamber detects platelet dysfunctions in dogs with inflammatory diseases.
comparative measurements were in vivo capillary bleeding time, platelet function analyzer and impedance aggregometry.
the flow chamber could be a useful tool to detect sepsis associated platelet dysfunction given that larger prospective trials confirm these findings from a proof of concept study.
except from impedance aggregometry with lower sensitivity and specificity, pfa did not detect platelet dysfunctions in dogs with infection.
platelet dysfunction induced by infection could possibly also be diagnosed after treatment of sepsis with colloids has commenced.
in vitro addition of lps or hes significantly reduced platelet covered area after par-activation.
