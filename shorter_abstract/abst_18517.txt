we established a mouse embryonic stem  cell culture system which exhibited changes in gene expression profiles similar to those observed in the development of endodermal and hepatocyte-lineage cells previously described in the normal mouse embryo.
this approach has isolated mes-derived hepatocyte-lineage cells that express several markers of mature hepatocytes including albumin, glucose-6-phosphatase, tyrosine aminotransferase, cytochrome p450-3a, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase.
induction of stem cell differentiation toward functional hepatocytes is hampered by lack of knowledge of the hepatocyte differentiation processes.
in addition, our results show that the up-regulation of the expression levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3α, -4α, - <dig>  and ccaat-enhancer binding protein-β might be critical for passage into late-stage differentiation towards functional hepatocytes.
the mes cell culture system generated in this study provides a model for studying transition between stages of the hepatocyte development and has significant potential value for studying the molecular basis of hepatocyte differentiation in vitro.
the overall objective of this project is to characterize key stages in the hepatocyte differentiation process.
