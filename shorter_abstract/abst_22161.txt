thermophilic bacillus strains of phylogenetic bacillus rrna group  <dig> were described as a new genus geobacillus.
the results of physiological and biochemical tests, dna/dna hybridization, riboprint analysis, the length of lipase gene and protein pattern allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain t1t from its validly published closest phylogenetic neighbors.
the strain t1t was identified as geobacillus zalihae t1t as it differs from its type strains geobacillus kaustophilus  and geobacillus thermoleovorans  on some physiological studies, cellular fatty acids composition, riboprint analysis, length of lipase gene and protein profile.
the members from the genus geobacillus have a growth temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 78Â°c and contained iso-branched saturated fatty acids  as the major fatty acids.
the quest for intrinsically thermostable lipases from thermophiles is a prominent task due to the laborious processes via genetic modification.
strain t1t therefore represents a novel species, for which the name geobacillus zalihae sp.
on the basic of 16s rdna analysis, strain t1t was shown to belong to the bacillus rrna group  <dig> related to geobacillus thermoleovorans  and geobacillus kaustophilus .
nov. is proposed, with the type strain t1t .
their geographical distribution included oilfields, hay compost, hydrothermal vent or soils.
chemotaxonomic data of cellular fatty acids supported the affiliation of strain t1t to the genus geobacillus.
of these, isolate t1t was chosen for further study as relatively higher lipase activity was detected quantitatively.
twenty-nine putative lipase producers were screened and isolated from palm oil mill effluent in malaysia.
strain t1t was a gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore forming bacterium.
strain t1t was able to secrete extracellular thermostable lipase into culture medium.
thermophiles harboring intrinsically stable enzymes are suitable for industrial applications.
