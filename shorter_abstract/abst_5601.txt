we have resolved the relationship of the classes leotiomyctes and sordariomycetes, and have identified two classes within the ctg clade of the saccharomycotina that may correlate with sexual status.
supertree methods were employed to derive phylogenies from  <dig>  single gene families.
we found that the average consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts, while matrix representation with parsimony  appears to be immune from these.
there is also strong support for two groups within the ctg clade, one containing the fully sexual species candida lusitaniae, candida guilliermondii and debaryomyces hansenii, and the second group containing candida albicans, candida dubliniensis, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis and lodderomyces elongisporus.
overall, our phylogenies provide strong support for the classification of phyla, sub-phyla, classes and orders.
our mrp supertree and concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent.
both phylogenies infer that the leotiomycetes are the closest sister group to the sordariomycetes.
we could not confidently resolve whether candida glabrata or saccharomyces castellii lies at the base of the wgd clade.
