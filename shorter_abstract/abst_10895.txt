we adopt a logic mining method based on two optimization models and present the results obtained on two datasets where a number of coi fragments are used to describe the individuals that belong to different species.
we have presented a logic mining technique designed to analyze barcode data and to provide detailed output of interest to the taxonomists and the barcode community represented in the cbol consortium.
the most successful results in this area are those obtained from a particular fragment of mitochondrial dna, the gene cytochrome c oxidase i  .
according to many field experts, specimens classification based on morphological keys needs to be supported with automated techniques based on the analysis of dna fragments.
the method proposed exhibits high correct recognition rates on a training-testing split of the available data using a small proportion of the information available .
