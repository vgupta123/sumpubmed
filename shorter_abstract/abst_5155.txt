thousands of high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, and coding polymorphism was correlated with differential expression between individual nematodes.
the parasite is more pathogenic in its new host than in its native one, and is thought to threaten the endangered an.
the molecular bases for the increased pathogenicity of the nematodes in their new hosts is not known.
a reference transcriptome was assembled for a. crassus from roche  <dig> pyrosequencing data.
the reference transcriptome of a. crassus is of high quality, and will serve as a basis for future work on the invasion biology of this important parasite.
transcripts identified as being under positive selection were enriched in peptidases.
the identification of peptidases under positive selection is a first step in this programme.
enzymes involved in energy metabolism were enriched in the set of genes differentially expressed between european and asian a. crassus.
the native range of a. crassus is in east asia, where it infects anguilla japonica, the japanese eel.
a. crassus was introduced into european eels, anguilla anguilla,  <dig> years ago.
sequences conserved only in nematodes, or unique to a. crassus were more likely to have secretory signal peptides.
