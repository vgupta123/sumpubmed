we demonstrate that at least 44Â % of multi-exonic genes undergo as and a large number of low abundance splice variants is present within the  <dig>  splice junctions we have annotated from pinot noir.
here, we performed a comprehensive high-throughput transcript sequencing of ten different grapevine cultivars, which resulted in the first high coverage atlas of the grape berry transcriptome.
