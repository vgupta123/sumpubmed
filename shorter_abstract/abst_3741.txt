p. tricornutum has evolved diversified srna pathways, likely implicated in the regulation of largely still uncharacterized genetic and epigenetic processes.
a subset of this population also targets dna methylated protein-coding genes, suggesting that gene body methylation might be srna-driven in diatoms.
while canonical mirnas are not detectable, other 21-25 nt srnas of unknown origin are highly expressed.
the majority of srnas is  <dig> to 30 nt-long and maps to repetitive and silenced transposable elements marked by dna methylation.

these results uncover an unexpected complexity of diatom srna population and previously unappreciated features, providing new insights into the diversification of srna-based processes in eukaryotes.
besides, non-coding rnas with well-described function, namely trnas and u <dig> snrna, constitute a major source of 21-25 nt srnas and likely play important roles under stressful environmental conditions.
furthermore, they display both dna methylation and gene silencing activities.
yet, the biogenesis and regulatory function of small rnas  remain ill defined in diatoms.
remarkably, 25-30 nt srnas display a well-defined and unprecedented 180 nt-long periodic distribution at several highly methylated regions that awaits characterization.
here we report the first comprehensive characterization of the srna landscape and its correlation with genomic and epigenomic information in phaeodactylum tricornutum.
