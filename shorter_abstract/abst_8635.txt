the cardioprotection seen with nnos inhibition was as potent as that of ip, however, in nnos knockout mice the cardioprotective effect of non-selective nos  and selective nnos inhibition and also that of ip was blocked while the benefit of exogenous no remained intact.
ventricular myocardial slices from rats and wild and nnos knockout mice, and right atrial myocardial slices from human were subjected to  <dig> min ischemia and  <dig> min reoxygenation .
additional studies revealed that the cardioprotection afforded by exogenous no and by inhibition of nnos were unaffected by the mitokatp channel blocker 5-hd, although it was abrogated by p38mapk blocker sb <dig>
therefore, the aims of these studies were to:  investigate the role of nnos in ischemia/reoxygenation-induced injury and ip,  determine whether its effect is species-dependent, and  elucidate the relationship of nnos with mitokatp channels and p38mapk, two key components of ip transduction pathway.
the role of nnos is species-independent and exerted downstream of the mitokatp channels and upstream of p38mapk.
nnos plays a dual role in ischemia/reoxygenation in that its presence is necessary to afford cardioprotection by ip and its inhibition reduces myocardial ischemic injury.
