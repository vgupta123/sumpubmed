tbx <dig> is pivotal for proper ear and heart development; ectopic activation of tbx1-gfp in the otic vesicle by pax2-cre and foxg1-cre represses neurogenesis and produces morphological defects of the inner ear.
we have partially rescued inner ear and heart anomalies in tbx1cre/- null embryos by expression of tbx1-gfp.
we have generated a new mouse model to conditionally overexpress a gfp-tagged tbx <dig> protein in vivo.
the requirement for tbx <dig> in mammalian development is dosage-sensitive, such that loss-of-function  and gain-of-function  of tbx <dig> in both mice and humans results in disease relevant congenital malformations.
velo-cardio-facial syndrome/digeorge syndrome  is caused by a  <dig> -3Â mb microdeletion of chromosome 22q <dig> , frequently referred to as 22q <dig>  deletion syndrome .
to further gain insight into the role of tbx <dig> in development, we have targeted the rosa <dig> locus to generate a new gof mouse model in which a tbx1-gfp fusion protein is expressed conditionally using the cre/loxp system.
