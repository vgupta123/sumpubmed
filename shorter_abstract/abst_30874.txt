administration of ds  in cd <dig> mice for  <dig> days prior to the onset of stress procedure, diminished manifestations of anhedonia defined in a sucrose test and behavioral despair in the forced swim test.
our data suggest that dicholine succinate has an antidepressant-like effect, which might be mediated via the up-regulation of hippocampal expression of igf <dig>  and implicate the neuronal insulin receptor in the pathogenesis of stress-induced depressive syndrome.
recently, dicholine succinate, a sensitizer of the neuronal insulin receptor, was shown to stimulate insulin-dependent h2o <dig> production of the mitochondrial respiratory chain leading to an enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.
treatment with dicholine succinate reduced the anxiety scores of stressed mice in the dark/light box paradigm, precluded stress-induced decreases of long-term contextual memory in the step-down avoidance test and hippocampal gene expression of igf <dig>
a number of epidemiological studies have established a link between insulin resistance and the prevalence of depression.
