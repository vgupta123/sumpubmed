sesb shares sequence similarity with animal and fungal putative proteins, with potential esterase/lipase/thioesterase activity, whereas sesa is similar to proteins of unknown function present only in the filamentous fungi fusarium graminearum and podospora anserina.
the full scope of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to bistability and hysteresis remains elusive.
the remaining five mutations promote its constitutive generation, which determines an intense pigmentation but not growth alteration.
atypical regulatory relations between the two proteins may account for the hysteresis of secteur differentiation.
the s <dig> mutant was obtained by an insertional mutagenesis strategy, which permitted the cloning of the ses locus.
nectria haemaotcocca, a saprophytic or pathogenic fungus with sexual reproduction, exhibits a bistable morphological modification characterized by a reduced growth rate and an intense pigmentation.
