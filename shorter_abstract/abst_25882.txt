we report  <dig> gene families conserved throughout eukaryotes from yeasts  to bilaterian animals .
none of these  <dig> gene families are found in human nor mouse genomes, and their absence generally extends to all vertebrates.
a total of  <dig> out of these  <dig> gene families have orthologs in plants, suggesting they were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor .
we investigated known functional information for these  <dig> gene families.
this allowed us to correlate some of the lost gene families to loss of capabilities.
mammalian and vertebrate genomes lost evolutionary conserved ancestral genes that are probably otherwise not dispensable in eukaryotes.
hence, the human genome, which is generally viewed as being the result of increased complexity and gene-content, has also evolved through simplification and gene losses.
gene losses played a role which may have been as important as gene and genome duplications and rearrangements, in modelling today species' genomes from a common ancestral set of genes.
while gene losses have been reported in all the major lineages of the metazoan tree of life, none have proposed a focus on specific losses in the vertebrates and mammals lineages.
this probable over-anthropocentric way of comparing genomes does not consider as an important phenomena, gene losses in species that are usually described as "higher".
this evolutionarily wide conservation suggests they were present in the last common ancestors of fungi and metazoan animals.
