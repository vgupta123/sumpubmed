wood development is of outstanding interest both to basic research and industry due to the associated cellulose and lignin biomass production.
our novel multivariate approach highlights important processes and provides confirmatory insights into the molecular foundations of wood development.
a combination of principal component analysis , orthogonal projections to latent structures  modeling and an enhanced stepwise linear modeling approach identified several major transitions in global protein expression profiles, pinpointing  locations of the cambial division leading to phloem and xylem cells, and secondary cell wall formation zones.
our data also show that pt-kor <dig>   exhibits an expression pattern that supports the hypothesis put forward in previous studies that this is a key xyloglucanase involved in cellulose biosynthesis in primary cell walls and reduction of cellulose crystallinity in secondary walls.
we also identified key proteins and associated pathways underlying these developmental landmarks.
we examined protein profiles, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry system, in high-resolution tangential sections spanning all wood development zones in populus tremula from undifferentiated cambium to mature phloem and xylem, including cell expansion and cell death zones.
in order to identify protein profiles across the developmental region of wood formation, an in-depth and tissue specific sampling was performed.
in total, we analyzed  <dig> sections, 20–160 μm thick, from four 47-year-old trees growing wild in sweden.
efforts to elucidate wood formation  have been made using transcriptomic analyses and/or low-resolution sampling.
