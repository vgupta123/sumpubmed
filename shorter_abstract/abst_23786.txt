however, enhanced colocalization of granulysin with listerial dna in presence of perforin was found by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
perforin treatment did not affect granulysin binding, initial uptake or intracellular trafficking to early endosomes.
the results provide evidence that perforin increases granulysin-mediated killing of intracellular listeria by enhanced phagosome-endosome fusion triggered by a transient ca2+ flux.
we found granulysin-induced lysis of intracellular listeria significantly increased when perforin was simultaneously present.
this was in contrast to non challenged dc that were more susceptible to perforin lysis.
for listeria-challenged dc, there was clear evidence for an ca2+ influx in response to sublytic perforin demonstrating a short-lived change in the plasma membrane permeability.
cytotoxic t lymphocytes  and natural killer  cells play an essential role in the host defence against intracellular pathogens such as listeria, and mycobacteria.
the perforin concentration sufficient to enhance granulysin-induced intracellular bacteriolysis did not cause permanent membrane pores in listeria-challenged dc as shown by dye exclusion test and ldh release.
in the present study we analysed the role of perforin in granulysin-induced intracellular bacteriolysis in dc.
the key mediator of bacteria-directed cytotoxicity is granulysin, a  <dig> kda protein stored in cytolytic granules together with perforin and granzymes.
in dendritic cells  granulysin is further transferred via early endosomes to l. innocua-containing phagosomes were bacteriolysis is induced.
in pulse-chase experiments enhanced bacteriolysis was observed when perforin was added up to  <dig> minutes after loading the cells with granulysin demonstrating no ultimate need for simultaneous uptake of granulysin and perforin.
