baseline values of hp, m-saa <dig> and crp were established in composite milk from cows with normal scc on the dairy farm.
composite milk app results were compared with cow factors including parity, stage of lactation, percentage protein and fat as well as somatic cell counts .
milk acute phase proteins  have been identified and show promise as biomarkers of mastitis.
the profiles of milk haptoglobin , mammary associated serum amyloid a <dig>  and c-reactive protein  were determined in  <dig> composite milk  samples  from a commercial dairy farm.

milk crp was correlated with % fat  and % protein  of the milk samples.
milk hp was also determined in individual quarter milk  samples   of the cows.
an elisa was developed and validated for the determination of milk hp while commercial kits were used for m-saa <dig> and crp assay respectively.
composite milk hp ranged from < <dig> –55 μg/ml with a median of  <dig>  μg/ml; composite milk m-saa <dig> ranged from < <dig> –50 μg/ml and had a median of  <dig>  μg/ml, while crp ranged from < <dig> –173 ng/ml and had a median of  <dig>  ng/ml.
quarter milk hp had a range of < <dig> –420 μg/ml with a median value of  <dig>  μg/ml, with 92 % of samples below 20 μg/ml.
however analysis of their profile in dairy cows from a production herd is necessary in order to confirm their benefits in mastitis diagnosis.
significant correlations were found between composite scc and hp  as well as parity and hp , but not between m-saa <dig> and scc, m-saa <dig> and hp, m-saa <dig> and crp or m-saa <dig> and parity.
