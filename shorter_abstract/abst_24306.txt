in this research, we investigated the effect of feature selection and prediction algorithm on the performance of prediction method thoroughly.
in particular, we considered the following feature selection and prediction methods: regression analysis, regularized regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis, non-linear support vector machine, and random forest.
for feature selection, the performances of support vector machine  and elastic-net  showed better results than those of linear discriminant analysis , random forest  and simple logistic regression  methods.
a great success of the genome wide association study enabled us to give more attention on the personal genome and clinical application such as diagnosis and disease risk prediction.
to observe the effect of feature selection methods on prediction performance, selected features were used for prediction and area under the curve score was measured.
with less than  <dig> snps, en was the best prediction method while svm was the best if over  <dig> snps were used for the prediction.
based on combination of feature selection and prediction methods, svm showed the best performance in feature selection and prediction.
there are several reasons for poor predictability such as small number of known disease-associated loci, simple analysis not considering complexity in phenotype, and a limited number of features used for prediction.
however, previous prediction studies using known disease associated loci have not been successful .
