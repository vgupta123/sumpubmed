leucine rich repeat containing  <dig> , also known as glycoprotein a repetitions predominant , has been postulated as a novel surface marker of activated tregs.
furthermore, we demonstrate using a construct containing a deleted putative signal peptide region that the presence of a signal peptide region is critical to cell surface expression of lrrc <dig>  finally, mixed lymphocyte assays demonstrate that lrrc32+ tregs are more potent suppressors than lrrc32- tregs.
a cleaved signal peptide site in lrrc <dig> is necessary for surface localization of native lrrc <dig> following activation of naturally-occurring freshly-isolated regulatory t cells.
elevated numbers of regulatory t cells  have been implicated in certain cancers.
using lrrc <dig> transfectants of hek cells, we demonstrate that the n-terminus of lrrc <dig> is cleaved prior to expression of the protein at the cell surface.
lrrc <dig> expression appears to alter the surface expression of activation markers of t cells such as cd62l.
using naturally-occurring freshly isolated tregs, we demonstrate that low levels of lrrc <dig> are present intracellularly prior to activation and that freshly isolated lrrc32+ tregs are distinct from lrrc32- tregs with respect to the expression of surface cd62l.
lrrc <dig> surface expression may be useful as a marker that selects for more potent treg populations.
in summary, understanding the processing and expression of lrrc <dig> may provide insight into the mechanism of action of tregs and the refinement of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting these cells.
