selection signatures were inferred with the integrated haplotype score and a locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score that works with a folded frequency spectrum and provides a formal test of signifance to identify selection signatures.
about  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snps showed signatures of selection and the locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score showed overall good accordance with the whole genome association study.
the locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score provides a formal test of significance in selection signature mapping.
we show that the combination of whole genome association and selection signature mapping based on the same snps increases the power to detect loci influencing complex traits.
we applied our approach to dairy cattle as they underwent extremely successful selection for milk production traits and since an excellent phenotypic record is available.
these regions agree well with previous results from other selection signature scans and whole genome association studies in cattle.
in this study we combine both approaches to complement their specific strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a method with higher statistical power and fewer false positive signals.
we performed whole genome association tests with a new mixed model approach to account for stratification, which we validated via monte carlo simulations.
hitchhiking mapping and association studies are two popular approaches to map genotypes to phenotypes.
combining whole genome association with hitchhiking mapping yielded two significant loci for the trait protein yield.
