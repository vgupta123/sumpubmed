we have termed this methodology "chelated ligand internalization assay", or clia.
the specificity of the assay was demonstrated with different antibodies to the erbb- <dig> and egf receptors.
discovery of tumor-selective antibodies or antibody fragments is a promising approach for delivering therapeutic agents to antigen over-expressing cancers.
antibody-uptake correlated with receptor expression levels in tumor cell lines with a range of receptor expression.
furthermore, ni-nta liposomes containing doxorubicin were used to screen for the ability of antibodies to confer target-specific cytotoxicity.
