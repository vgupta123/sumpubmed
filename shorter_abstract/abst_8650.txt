the gene content of these two transposons differ considerably which could impact upon horizontal gene transfer; differences include cdss encoding methylases and a conjugative prophage only in tn <dig>  to investigate mechanisms which could affect mge transfer, the methylome, restriction modification   and the crispr/cas systems were characterised for each strain.
data suggests that both mechanisms are functional and impact upon horizontal gene transfer and genome evolution within c. difficile.
the possession of a highly mobile genome has contributed to the genetic diversity and ongoing evolution of c. difficile.
notably, the environmental isolate, cd105hs <dig>  does not share a consensus motif for m4c methylation, but has one additional spacer  when compared to the clinical isolate m <dig>
the crispr/cas system appears active although perhaps slow to evolve.
the carriage of horizontally transferred genes appear to have genome wide effects based on two different methylation patterns.
how the pathogen clostridium difficile might survive, evolve and be transferred between reservoirs within the natural environment is poorly understood.

to address this, single molecule real time  sequencing was used in this study as it produces high quality genome sequences, with resolution of repeat regions  and can generate data to determine methylation modifications across the sequence .
chromosomal rearrangements and ribosomal operon duplications were observed in both genomes.
