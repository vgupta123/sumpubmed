protein kinasesspecificity determining positionsbinding affinityieee international conference on bioinformatics and biomedicine  <dig> washington, dc, usa 9- <dig> november  <dig> http://cci.drexel.edu/ieeebibm/bibm2015/issue-copyright-statement© the author 2016
the increased availability of protein 3d structures has provided much information on the structural variation within a given protein family.
however, the relationship between structural variations and binding specificity is complex and incompletely understood.
this is also the case for inhibitors of many other protein families.
we propose a greedy algorithm that computes a subset of residue positions in a multiple sequence alignment such that structural and chemical variation in those positions helps explain known binding affinities.
we show that the binding affinity of  <dig> different kinase inhibitors can be explained with consistently high precision and accuracy using the variation of at most six residue positions in the kinome binding site.
the human kinome contains many important drug targets.
the algorithm’s performance is demonstrated using an extensive dataset for the human kinome.
