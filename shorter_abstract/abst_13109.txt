down-regulation of apob <dig> is a potential therapy to lower circulating ldl and cholesterol levels.
the induction of apob87skip <dig> expression in vivo should lead to decreased ldl and cholesterol levels, by analogy to patients with hypobetalipoproteinemia.
these asos are directed towards the 5' and 3' splice-sites of exon  <dig>  the branch-point sequence  of intron 26â€“ <dig> and several predicted exonic splicing enhancers within exon  <dig>  asos targeting either the 5' or 3' splice-site, in combination with the bps, are the most effective.
apolipoprotein b  is an integral part of the ldl, vldl, idl, lp and chylomicron lipoprotein particles.
the apob pre-mrna consists of  <dig> constitutively-spliced exons.
