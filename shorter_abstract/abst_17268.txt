daysleeper has retained the global structure of hat transposases and it seems that most of these conserved features are essential to daysleeperâ€™s cellular function.
using several vesicular markers, we found that these foci belong to vesicular structures of the trans-golgi network, multivesicular bodies  and late endosomes.
like hat-transposases, we show that daysleeper has a functionally conserved dimerization domain .
the central region as well as both the n- and the c-terminus are essential to daysleeper function, since versions of daysleeper deleted for these regions are not able to complement the daysleeper phenotype.
