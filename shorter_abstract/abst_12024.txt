further study of metatherian herpesvirus genetics and pathogenesis provides a unique approach to understanding herpesvirus-mammalian interactions.
this is the first genome sequence of a herpesvirus that infects metatherians, a taxonomically unique mammalian clade.
while many placental herpesvirus genomes have been fully sequenced, the complete genome of a marsupial herpesvirus has not been described.
here we present the first genome sequence of a metatherian herpesvirus, macropodid herpesvirus  <dig> .
members of the simplexvirus genus are remarkably conserved, so the absence of orfs otherwise retained in eutherian and avian alphaherpesviruses contributes to our understanding of the alphaherpesvirinae.
we identified six novel orfs and confirmed their transcription by rt-pcr.
