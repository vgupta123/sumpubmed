we compared the eight gene ranking methods using the microarray quality control  datasets produced by five manufacturers: affymetrix, applied biosystems, agilent, ge healthcare, and illumina.
the high intra- and inter-platform reproducibility of wad was also observed at a higher biological function level.
a more general evaluation that also includes other microarray platforms, such as the agilent or illumina systems, is desirable for determining which methods are suitable for each platform and which method has better inter-platform reproducibility.
these results for the five microarray platforms were consistent with our previous ones based on  <dig> real experimental datasets measured using the affymetrix platform.
in our previous studies, we evaluated eight gene ranking methods applied to only affymetrix genechip data.
although the highest auc values can vary with the definition of "true" degs, the best methods were, in most cases, either the weighted average difference , rank products , or intensity-based moderated t statistic .
thus, recommendations made using the maqc benchmark data might be universally applicable.
the pog values for wad were the highest overall, irrespective of the choice of microarray platform.
the percentages of overlapping genes  across different test sites were mainly evaluated as a measure for both intra- and inter-platform reproducibility.
statistical methods for ranking differentially expressed genes  from gene expression data should be evaluated with regard to high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.
