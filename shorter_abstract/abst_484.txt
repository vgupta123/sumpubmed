after examining brca <dig> polymorphisms in  <dig> bonobo,  <dig> chimpanzee, and  <dig> rhesus macaque  individuals, we find considerable variation within each of these species and evidence for recent selection in chimpanzee populations.
finally, we also sequenced and analyzed brca <dig> from  <dig> primate species and find that this gene has also evolved under positive selection.

however, brca <dig>  an essential gene involved in dna repair, has been reported to be evolving rapidly despite the fact that many protein-altering mutations within this gene convey a significantly elevated risk for breast and ovarian cancers.
a hypothesis where viruses are the drivers of this natural selection is discussed.
while mutations leading to truncated forms of brca <dig> are clearly linked to cancer phenotypes in humans, there is also an underlying selective pressure in favor of amino acid-altering substitutions in this gene.
given the importance of this process, it is expected that dna repair proteins would be evolutionarily conserved, exhibiting very minimal sequence change over time.
