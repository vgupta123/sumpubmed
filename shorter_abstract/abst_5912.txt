, and Δs, were determined using arrhenius plot and found to be  <dig>  kj/mol,  <dig>  kj/mol, and  <dig>  kj/mol/k, respectively.
the enzyme was then purified in three consequence steps: acetone precipitation, deae-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography .
urease, one of the highly efficient known enzymes, catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide.
this may provide an insight on the various aspects of the property of the enzyme.
the effects of ph, concentration of enzyme, temperature, concentration of substrate, and storage period on urease activity were examined.
maximum urease activity  was achieved at the optimum conditions of 40°c and ph of  <dig>  after 5 min of incubation.
urease was purified from germinating pisum sativum l. seeds.
the purification fold was  <dig>  with a yield of 40%.
the purification fold, yield, and molecular weight were determined.
the molecular weight of the isolated urease was estimated by chromatography to be  <dig>  daltons.
