together, these findings indicate that srf, along with its two cofactors, are important players in both cellular homeostasis and stress responses in macrophages.
the knockdown study, combined with gene expression array analysis, revealed that mkl1/ <dig> regulated srf-dependent genes were related to actin cytoskeleton organization, while elk <dig> regulated srf-dependent genes were related to external stimulus responses.
i conclude that srf utilizes mkl1/ <dig> to fulfill steady state cellular functions, including cytoskeletal organization, and utilizes elk <dig> to facilitate acute responses to external infection.
serum response factor  is a widely expressed transcription factor involved in multiple regulatory programs.
it is believed that srf can toggle between disparate programs of gene expression through association with different cofactors.
however, the direct evidence as to how these factors function on a genome-wide level is still lacking.
