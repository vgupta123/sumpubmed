furthermore, we generated transcriptomes for another three aethionema species and one other cleomaceae species to validate their transcriptional activity.
we show that a subset of lncrnas are highly diverged at the nucleotide level, but conserved by position .
these results highlight the importance of analysing not only sequence conservation, but also positional conservation of non-coding genetic elements in plants including lncrnas.
using a phylogenomics approach, we assessed the positional and sequence conservation of these lncrnas by analyzing the genomes of the basal brassicaceae species aethionema arabicum and tarenaya hassleriana of the sister-family cleomaceae.
recently,  <dig> lincrnas were putatively identified in arabidopsis thaliana , however there is limited information on their conservation.
interestingly, >65 % of the positionally conserved lncrnas are located within  <dig>  mb of telomeres in arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes.
