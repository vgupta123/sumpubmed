as a preliminary validation, we asked whether known 3d environments associated with prosite motifs were "rediscovered".
our results demonstrate that we can cluster protein environments successfully using a simplified representation and k-means clustering algorithm.
structural genomics initiatives are producing increasing numbers of three-dimensional  structures for which there is little functional information.
however, feature uses supervised machine learning and so is limited to building models for sites of known importance and location.
we previously presented feature, a method for describing microenvironments around functional sites in proteins.
this information will then allow us to find new clusters with similar characteristics that represent novel structural or functional sites.
