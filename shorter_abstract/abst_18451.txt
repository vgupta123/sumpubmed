neoscopelidae is resolved as the sister family to myctophids with solivomer arenidens positioned as a sister taxon to the remaining neoscopelids.
the enigmatic notolychnus valdiviae is placed as a sister taxon to all other myctophids and exhibits an unusual second copy of the trna-met gene â€“ a gene order rearrangement reminiscent of that found in the tribe diaphini although our analyses show it to be independently derived.
myctophids possess a unique communication system of species-specific photophore patterns and traditional intrafamilial classification has been established to reflect arrangements of photophores.
mitogenomic evidence from dna sequences and unique gene orders are highly congruent concerning phylogenetic resolution on several myctophiform classification levels, corroborating evidence from osteology, larval ontogeny and photophore patterns, although the lack of larval morphological characters within the subfamily lampanyctinae stands out.
mitogenomic results from dna sequences and unique gene orders corroborate morphology in phylogeny reconstruction and provide a likely scenario for the phylogenetic history of myctophiformes.
this study attempts to resolve major myctophiform phylogenies from both mitogenomic sequences and corroborating evidence in the form of unique mitochondrial gene order rearrangements.
the extent of gene order rearrangements found within the mitochondrial genomes of myctophids is unique for phylogenetic purposes.
mitogenomic sequence data from this study recognize  <dig> reciprocally monophyletic lineages within myctophidae, with five of these clades delimited from additional rearranged gene orders or intergenic non-coding sequences.
most tribes are resolved in accordance with adult morphology although gonichthyini is found within a subclade of the tribe myctophini consisting of ctenoid scaled species.
