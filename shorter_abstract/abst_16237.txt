computer-aided modelling has to be based on a formal semantic description of bio-models.
systems biology develops computational models in order to understand biological phenomena.
but, even if computational bio-models themselves are represented precisely in terms of mathematical expressions their full meaning is not yet formally specified and only described in natural language.
the proposed conceptual framework establishes a new methodology for modelling in systems biology and constitutes a basis for computer-aided collaborative research.
a bio-model has a dual interpretation: on the one hand it is a mathematical expression which can be used in computational simulations .
on the other hand the model is related to the biological reality .
in order to demonstrate the strengths of the meaning facets framework we apply it to two semantically related models of the cell cycle.
the meaning facets framework provides a systematic in-depth approach to the semantics of bio-models.
the increasing number and complexity of such “bio-models” necessitate computer support for the overall modelling task.
secondly, because it can be formalised, the framework is a solid foundation for any sort of computer support in bio-modelling.
