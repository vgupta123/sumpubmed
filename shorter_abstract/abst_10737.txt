antioxidant  and p <dig> mapk inhibitor  treatment attenuated the increase in caspase- <dig> activity, cell death and wdr <dig> expression induced by bupivacaine or h2o <dig>  although transfection of neuro2a cells with wdr <dig> sirna attenuated the bupivacaine- or h2o2-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein, in contrast to our previous studies, it did not inhibit the increase in caspase- <dig> activity in bupivacaine- or h2o2-treated cells.
the present study was undertaken to test whether bupivacaine induces apoptosis in mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a cells and to determine whether ros, p <dig> mapk, and wdr <dig> are involved.
our results showed that bupivacaine induced ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation in neuro2a cells, resulting in apoptosis.
in summary, our results indicated that bupivacaine induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells.
these results may suggest the existence of another mechanism of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis independent from wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells.
bupivacaine also increased wdr <dig> expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
bupivacaine induced ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation, resulting in an increase in wdr <dig> expression, in these cells.
hydrogen peroxide  also increased wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells.
however, the increase in wdr <dig> expression may not be essential for the bupivacaine-induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells.
