the sequenced reads can contain deletions or insertions due to sequencing limitations, and the primer sequence may contain ambiguous bases.
sequencing metagenomes that were pre-amplified with primer-based methods requires the removal of the additional tag sequences from the datasets.
tagcleaner is a web application developed to automatically identify and remove known or unknown tag sequences allowing insertions and deletions in the dataset.
tagcleaner is a publicly available web application that is able to automatically detect and efficiently remove tag sequences from metagenomic datasets.
because of the potential for downstream inaccuracies introduced by unwanted sequence contaminations, it is important to use reliable tools for pre-processing sequence data.
furthermore, the tag sequence may be unavailable or incorrectly reported.
an additional screening for and splitting of fragment-to-fragment concatenations that gave rise to artificial concatenated sequences can increase the quality of the dataset.
