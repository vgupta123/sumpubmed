in contrast to epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells require 3-dimensional type-i collagen in response to tnf-alpha to massively express mmp- <dig>  the collagen effect is mediated, in part, by boost jnk activation in a way to cooperate the cytokine signaling.
expressed in embryonic development, matrix metalloprotein- <dig>  is absent in most of developed adult tissues, but recurs in inflammation during tissue injury, wound healing, tumor formation and metastasis.
expression of mmp- <dig> is tightly controlled by extracellular cues including pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix .
in response to tnf-alpha or il-1alpha, pak <dig> was promptly activated, as characterized by a sequential phosphorylation, initiated at threonine- <dig> followed by at threonine- <dig> in the activation loop of the kinase, in human skin keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and rat hepatic stellate cells.
ectopic expression of pak <dig> variants, but not p <dig> map kinase, impaired the tnf-alpha-induced mmp- <dig> expression, while other mmps such as mmp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were not affected.
we identified a novel mechanism for mmp- <dig> expression in response to injury signals, which is mediated by pak <dig> activation and stabilization leading jnk activation.
activation of jun n-terminal kinase  and nf-kappab has been demonstrated to be essential for mmp- <dig> expression.
after the cytokine-induced phosphorylation, both ectopically expressed and endogenous pak <dig> proteins were promptly accumulated even in the condition of suppressing protein synthesis, suggesting the pak <dig> protein is stabilized upon tnf-alpha stimulation.
