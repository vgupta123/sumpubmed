at embryonic day   <dig> , the liver bud failed to expand although, contrary to expectations, the hepatic endoderm was able to form a pseudo-stratified epithelial liver bud that expressed hepatic genes.
analyses of pancreatic development revealed a complete absence of the ventral but not the dorsal pancreas in gata4-/- embryos.
in the mouse, the parenchyma of both the liver and ventral pancreas is specified from adjacent domains of the ventral foregut endoderm.
in the absence of gata <dig>  development of the liver and ventral pancreas was disrupted.
moreover, gata6-/- embryos displayed a similar, although less dramatic phenotype, suggesting a critical role for multiple gata factors at the earliest stages of ventral pancreas development.
to determine whether gata <dig> contributes to development of either the pancreas or liver we characterized the formation of pancreatic and hepatic tissues in embryos derived from gata4-/- es cells by tetraploid embryo complementation.
this study defines integral roles for gata factors in controlling early development of the mammalian liver and pancreas.
we therefore hypothesized that gata <dig> has an integral role in controlling the early stages of pancreatic and liver development.
moreover, as we had shown previously, the embryos lacked septum transversum mesenchyme suggesting that liver defects may be cell non-autonomous.
