icn, a user-friendly method, can well complement other network-based methods in the context of prioritizing candidate disease genes.

this means that re-training network-based tools may be required when existing biological networks are updated or when networks from different sources are to be tried.
icn was tested using  <dig>  known disease-gene associations and achieved a success rate of ~44% using a protein-protein interaction network under a test scenario of simulated linkage analysis.
this performance is comparable with those of other well-known methods and icn outperforms other methods when a candidate disease gene is not directly linked to known disease genes in a network.
genome-wide disease-gene finding approaches may sometimes provide us with a long list of candidate genes.
we developed a parameter-free method, interconnectedness , to rank candidate genes by assessing the closeness of them to known disease genes in a network.
