resistance to fusarium ear rot of maize is a quantitative and complex trait.
we conducted a genome-wide association study  for fusarium ear rot resistance in a panel of  <dig> diverse inbred lines from the usda maize gene bank with  <dig>  snps while controlling for background genetic relationships with a mixed model and identified seven single nucleotide polymorphisms  in six genes associated with disease resistance in either the complete inbred panel  or in a filtered inbred panel .
because of their small effects, the value of selection on these snps for improving resistance to fusarium ear rot is limited.
the complexity of inheritance of resistance hinders the use marker-assisted selection for ear rot resistance.
selection to combine these resistance alleles combined with genomic selection to improve the polygenic background resistance might be fruitful.

the alleles conferring greater disease resistance at all seven snps were rare overall  and always higher in allele frequency in tropical maize than in temperate dent maize.
the genes associated with resistance provide candidate gene targets for further study of the biological pathways involved in this complex disease resistance.
