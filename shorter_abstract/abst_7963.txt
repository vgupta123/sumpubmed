the spatio-temporal simulation environment  is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on microscopy images.
recently, the availability of high-resolution microscopy together with the advancements in the development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in molecular cell biology.
stse is an efficient and powerful novel platform, designed for computational handling and evaluation of microscopic images.
stse should be considered rather as an api together with workflow guidelines and a collection of gui tools than a stand alone application.
by providing the means to relate the simulation to the image data it allows for systematic, image driven model validation or rejection.
stse can be scripted and extended using the python language.
the priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive way of extending and customizing software using the python language.
computer science can efficiently address this task by providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and evaluation of biological data to the benefit of experimenters and modelers.
the python source code as well as a comprehensive user manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research community.
