recent research examining cross-platform correlation of gene expression intensities has yielded mixed results.
in this study, we demonstrate use of a correction factor for estimating cross-platform correlations.
herein we demonstrate that correcting for measurement error by estimating the "disattenuated" correlation substantially improves cross-platform correlations.
when estimating cross-platform correlation, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate intra-platform reproducibility as a first step.
in addition, since measurement error is present in microarray gene expression data, methods to correct for attenuation are useful in decreasing the bias in cross-platform correlation estimates.
we present various methods for examining intra-platform reproducibility.
the three platforms were then analyzed to assess both intra- and cross-platform reproducibility.
we also examine cross-platform reproducibility using pearson's correlation.
