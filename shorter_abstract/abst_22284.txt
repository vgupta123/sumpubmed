however, the meca gene might not be carried by a sccmec in a staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical isolate, wch <dig>  as no cassette chromosome recombinase genes were detected.
the presence of 8-bp dr suggests that the two copies of is <dig> might have formed a composite transposon for mobilizing meca.
this finding is of significance as multiple copies of is <dig> are commonly present in the contexts of meca, which might have the potential to form various composite transposons that could mediate the mobilization of meca.
therefore, the genetic context of meca in wch <dig> was investigated.
this 40-kb region was very complex in structure with multiple genetic components that appeared to have different origins.
a 40-kb region containing meca was obtained from wch <dig>  bounded by orfx at one end and several orfs of s. haemolyticus core chromosome at the other.
for instance, the  <dig> -kb structure adjacent to orfx was almost identical to that on the chromosome of staphylococcus epidermidis rp62a but was absent from s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig>  terminal inverted repeats of scc were found but no ccr genes could be detected.
