hemocyanin subunit sequences had been available from horseshoe crabs  and various spiders , but not from any other chelicerate taxon.
subsequently, independent gene duplication events gave rise to the other distinct subunits in each of the  <dig> × 6mer hemocyanin of xiphosura and the  <dig> × 6mer of arachnida.
the hemocyanin sequences were used to infer the evolutionary history of chelicerates.
arthropod hemocyanins are hexamers or oligomers of hexamers, which are characterized by a high o <dig> transport capacity and a high cooperativity, thereby enhancing o <dig> supply.
bayesian phylogenetic analysis was used to reconstruct the evolution of hemocyanin subunits and a relaxed molecular clock approach was applied to date the major events.
hemocyanins also turned out to be a good marker to trace chelicerate evolution, which is, however, limited by the loss of hemocyanin in some taxa.
hemocyanin subunits from a sea spider, a scorpion, a whip scorpion and a whip spider were sequenced.
while the sea spider has a simple hexameric hemocyanin, four distinct subunit types evolved before xiphosura and arachnida diverged around  <dig> ma ago, suggesting the existence of a  <dig> × 6mer at that time.
the molecular clock calculations were in excellent agreement with the fossil record, also demonstrating the applicability of hemocyanins for such approach.
the phylogenetic trees support a basal position of pycnogonida, a sister group relationship of xiphosura and arachnida, and a sister group relationship of the whip scorpions and the whip spiders.
oxygen transport in the hemolymph of many arthropod species is facilitated by large copper-proteins referred to as hemocyanins.
a  <dig> × 6mer hemocyanin consisting of seven subunit types is conserved in most arachnids since more than  <dig> ma, although some entelegyne spiders display selective subunit loss and independent oligomerization.
