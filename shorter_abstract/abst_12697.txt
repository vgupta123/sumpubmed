here, we expanded previous observations on the ability of necm to support in vitro neuronal differentiation, with the following goals:  to recreate complex neuronal networks of embryonic rat hippocampal cells, and  to achieve improved levels of dopaminergic differentiation of subventricular zone  neural progenitor cells.
when seeded on necm-coated substrates, both hippocampal cells and svz progenitor cells showed neural expression patterns that were similar to their poly-l-lysine-seeded counterparts.
however, necm-based cultures of both hippocampal neurons and svz progenitor cells could be maintained for longer times as compared to poly-l-lysine-based cultures.
interestingly, the prolonged differentiation time of svz progenitor cells in necm allowed us to obtain a purer population of dopaminergic neurons.

in addition, neural ecm-coated substrates increased neuronal survival and neuronal differentiation efficiency as compared to cationic polymers such as poly-l-lysine.
we conclude that necm-based coating is an efficient substrate to culture neural cells at different stages of differentiation.
hippocampal cells from e <dig> rat embryos were seeded on pll- and necm-coated substrates.
