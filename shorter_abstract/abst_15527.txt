several techniques are available to study gene function, but many are less than ideal for soybean.
three mutations in independent lines were identified in the omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase gene fad2-1a; all three mutations resulted in missense amino acid mutations and one resulted in an altered seed fatty acid profile that led to an increase in oleic acid and a decrease in linoleic acid in the seed oil.
reverse genetics, a relatively new approach, can be utilized to identify novel mutations in candidate genes; this technique has not produced an allelic variant with a confirmed phenotype in soybean.
our results serve as the first demonstration of the identification of soybean mutants controlling seed phenotypes discovered through the reverse genetics technique tilling.
the fatty acid phenotype controlled by the novel fad2-1a allele controls an increase in oleic acid in the seed oil, a phenotype also observed in a line previously characterized to have a null allele of the fad2-1a gene.
molecular marker assays were developed to reliably detect the inheritance of the mutant alleles and can be used in efficient breeding for these desired seed phenotypes.
four mutations in independent lines were identified in the raffinose synthase gene rs2; two mutations resulted in amino acid mutations and one resulted in an altered seed oligosaccharide phenotype.
the oligosaccharide phenotype controlled by the novel rs <dig> allele is similar to previously observed seed oligosaccharide phenotypes in rs <dig> mutant  allele-containing lines.
soybean raffinose synthase genes and microsomal omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase genes were screened for novel alleles in mutagenized soybean populations.
