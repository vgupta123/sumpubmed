the assay was 100% sensitive and specific, correctly identifying all  <dig> salmonella strains, all  <dig> samples of s. enteritidis and all  <dig> samples of s. typhimurium tested in this work.
the assay can amplify and analyse a large number of samples in approximately  <dig> hours, compared to the  <dig> to  <dig> days conventional identification takes, and is thus considered a very promising method for detecting the two major serotypes of salmonella quickly and accurately from clinical and environmental samples.
salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium, respectively, the two most clinically relevant serotypes.
target sequences were regions of the inva, prot6e and flic genes specific for salmonella spp.
three sets of primers were used for the amplification of the target sequences.
the results were compared to those of the kauffmann-white antigenic classification scheme.
the detection limit was down to  <dig> copies of dna target per  <dig> Î¼l reaction.
molecular beacons were incorporated into the assay as probes for target dna.
