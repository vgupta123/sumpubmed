our method is designed to account for biases at smaller pattern sizes, removing their effects.
we used this method to investigate context bias in the human lineage after the divergence from chimpanzee.
to address this we have developed a method which identifies over- and under-represented substitution patterns and assesses their overall impact on the evolution of genome composition.
we examined bias effects in substitution patterns between  <dig> and  <dig> bp long and found significant effects at all sizes.
we found that nucleotides beyond the immediately adjacent one are responsible for substantial context effects, and that these biases vary across the genome.
