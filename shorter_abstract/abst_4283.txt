these results thus suggest that selection is of little importance for shaping genotype distributions of all-hybrid populations of p. esculentus, but further studies are needed for confirmation.
a gradual approach to adult genotype proportions through successive stages would support the selection hypotheses, whereas the presence of adult genotype proportions already at the egg stage would support the gamete pattern hypothesis.
then, both hypotheses were tested simultaneously in juvenile stages  in three of the ponds.
moreover, the study provided valuable data on genotype-specific body lengths, adult survival and sex ratios.
with data from  <dig> swedish ponds, we first show that in spite of significant changes in genotype proportions over time, the most extreme ponds retained their differences over a six year study period.
the result was a weak preference for the gamete pattern hypothesis.
the role of differential selection in determining the geographic distribution of genotypes in hybrid systems has long been discussed, but not settled.
the uneven distribution of genotypes among ponds could be a consequence of differential selection varying among ponds , or, alternatively, of different gamete production patterns among ponds .
these populations, in which the parental species  are absent, have pond-specific proportions of diploid  and triploid  genotypes.
the selection hypothesis was tested in adults by a six year mark-recapture study in all  <dig> ponds.
as the relative survival and proportion of llr, lr and lrr did not correlate within ponds, this study provided no evidence for the selection hypothesis in adults.
