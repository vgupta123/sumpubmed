silea <dig> was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, inflorescences and seeds at different levels under normal growth conditions.
late embryogenesis abundant  proteins are involved in protecting higher plants from damage caused by environmental stresses.
similarly, the transgenic foxtail millet showed improved growth under salt and drought stresses compared with the wt.
taken together, our results indicated that silea <dig> is a novel atypical lea protein and plays important roles in resistance to abiotic stresses in plants.
overexpression of silea <dig> improved escherichia coli growth performance compared with the control under salt stress.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance to these conditions are not well defined.
foxtail millet  is an important cereal crop for food and feed in semi-arid areas.
here, we characterized a novel atypical lea gene named silea <dig> from foxtail millet.
to further assess the function of silea <dig> in plants, transgenic arabidopsis and foxtail millet plants that overexpressed silea <dig> were obtained.
we characterized a novel atypical lea gene silea <dig> from foxtail millet, which plays important roles in plant abiotic stress resistance.
the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings showed higher tolerance to salt and osmotic stress than the wild type .
modification of silea <dig> expression may improve abiotic stress resistance in agricultural crops.
