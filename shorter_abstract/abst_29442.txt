this early snow clearance results in a longer growing period and allows the aphid to experience at least the minimum number of degree days required to complete its life cycle.
we aimed to test the relationship between the aphid distribution and time of snow clearance at landscape scale, mapping snow depth at peak of snow accumulation for the two succeeding years  <dig> and  <dig> and examining site occupancy and plant phenology the following summers.
snow depth alone, and hence date of snow clearance, cannot precisely define species distribution at landscape scale, as this cannot explain why are they unoccupied patches under shallow snow depths with advanced plant phenology.
in august, the aphid, at the three life stages scored , was present most frequently in those d. octopetala patches with the most advanced plant phenology and which showed shallower snow depths in spring.
the aphid distribution range has expanded  <dig>  km towards the fjord mouth from  <dig>
both snow depth and plant phenology were found to affect patch occupancy.
a linear relation between snow depth and timing of snow melt was found but with strong inter-annual and landscape variation.
the svalbard endemic aphid acyrthosiphon svalbardicum  is host specific to dryas octopetala l. ssp octopetala .
additionally, the distribution range mapped by strathdee & bale  was revisited to address possible changes in range along the coast of the fjord.
