in the present study, we characterized a denv cross-reactive monoclonal antibody , 4d <dig>  that neutralized poorly but potently enhanced infection of four standard denv serotypes and immature denv  over a broad range of concentration.
these findings may provide significant implications for future vaccine design and facilitate understanding the pathogenesis of denv infection.
these results suggested 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera were infection-enhancing antibodies and pl <dig> was infection-enhancing epitope.
many studies showed that pre-membrane -specific antibodies do not efficiently neutralize denv infection but potently promote ade infection.
furthermore, antibody against epitope peptide pl <dig>  like 4d <dig>  showed broad cross-reactivity and weak neutralizing activtity with four standard denv serotypes and imdenv but significantly promoted ade infection.
in addition, the epitope of 4d <dig> was successfully mapped to amino acid residues  <dig> to <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm protein using a phage-displayed peptide library and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.

we found that the epitope was denv serocomplex cross-reactive and showed to be highly immunogenic in balb/c mice.
