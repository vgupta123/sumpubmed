promoter residency of tpk <dig> correlated with the transcript level of the corresponding gene during hyphal morphogenesis and occurred near efg <dig> binding sites, mainly on genes encoding regulators of morphogenesis.
pka isoforms change their genomic binding sites from orf to promoter regions during yeast-hyphal morphogenesis.
the human fungal pathogen candida albicans is able to undergo morphogenesis from a yeast to a hyphal growth form.
protein kinase a  isoforms tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> promote hyphal growth in a signalling pathway via the transcription factor efg <dig>

during yeast growth, both pka isoforms were situated primarily within orfs but moved to promoter regions shortly after hyphal induction.
c. albicans strains producing epitope-tagged tpk <dig> or tpk <dig> were used in genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip  to reveal genomic binding sites.
binding sequences for tpk <dig> greatly exceeded tpk <dig> sites and did not coincide with binding of the pka regulatory subunit bcy <dig>  consensus binding sequences for tpk <dig> within orfs included accac and cagca motifs that appeared to bias codon usage within the binding regions.
