the purpose of the current studies was to evaluate the quantitative pharmacology and concentration/effect relationships of ce- <dig> based on unbound plasma concentration and in vitro pharmacology data in different in vivo preclinical models of fi and energy expenditure.
as measured by indirect calorimetry, ce- <dig> acutely stimulates energy expenditure by greater than 30% in rats and shifts substrate oxidation from carbohydrate to fat as indicated by a decrease the respiratory quotient from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
we have combined quantitative pharmacology and ex vivo cb <dig> receptor occupancy data to assess concentration/effect relationships in food intake, energy expenditure and weight loss studies.
in vivo, ce- <dig> exhibits concentration-dependent anorectic activity in both fast-induced re-feeding and spontaneous nocturnal feeding fi models.
quantitative pharmacology studies provide a strong a foundation for establishing and improving confidence in mechanism as well as aiding in the progression of compounds from preclinical pharmacology to clinical development.
despite a large body of knowledge on cannabinoid receptor antagonists little data exist on the quantitative pharmacology of this therapeutic class of drugs.
in vitro, ce- <dig> exhibits sub-nanomolar potency at human cb <dig> receptors in both binding  and functional assays .
cannabinoid  <dig>  receptor antagonists exhibit pharmacological properties favorable for the treatment of obesity and other related metabolic disorders.
