a large number of early cold -responsive genes were identified, suggesting that a multitude of transcriptional cascades function in cold perception.
our results provide a global transcriptome picture of p. euphratica under low temperature stress.
analyses of multiple cold-responsive genes, transcription factors, and some key transduction components involved in aba and calcium signaling revealed their potential function in low temperature responses in p. euphratica.
exhibits better tolerance to abiotic stress, especially those involving extreme temperatures.
the potential cold stress related transcripts identified in this study provide valuable information for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of low temperature perception in p. euphratica.
to understand the gene network controlling low temperature perception in p. euphratica, we performed transcriptome sequencing using solexa sequence analysis to generate a leaf transcriptome at a depth of  <dig> gigabases for each sample.
however, little is known about gene regulation and signaling pathways involved in low temperature stress responses in this species.
compared with other populus species, populus euphratica oliv.
using the trinity method,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality trimmed reads were assembled into a non-redundant set and  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp were generated.
in 4°c-treated sample and -4°c-treated sample,  <dig>  and  <dig> differently expressed unigenes were detected at an estimated absolute log2-fold change of >  <dig>  respectively.
