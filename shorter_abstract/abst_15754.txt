to this end, we have developed an automated sample preparation, molecular barcoding and multiplexing protocol for the amplification and sequence-determination of class i hla loci.
a variation of this initial protocol, more suitable for large sample sizes, in which molecular barcodes are added during pcr rather than library construction, was tested on  <dig> hapmap individuals with  <dig> % accuracy at 4-digit resolution.
we have benchmarked our protocol with  <dig> hapmap individuals from four worldwide populations with  <dig> % accuracy at 4-digit resolution.
next-generation sequencing on the  <dig> flx titanium platform is a reliable, efficient, and scalable technology for hla typing.
we have coupled this process to a novel hla calling algorithm to determine the most likely pair of alleles at each locus.
