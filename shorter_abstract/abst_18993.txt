in this work, we have developed  <dig> modeling rules based on hybrid functional petri net with extension , which is suitable for graphical representing and simulating biological processes.
many biological repositories store information based on experimental study of the biological processes within a cell, such as protein-protein interactions, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, or regulations of transcription factors and mirna.
the results are encoded into a biological pathway format, cell system markup language , which eases the exchange and integration of biological data and models.
as a formal ontology for biological pathway modeling with dynamics, cso also defines biological terminology and corresponding icons.
we selected the transpath database, a manually curated high-quality pathway database, which provides a plentiful source of cellular events in humans, mice, and rats, collected from over  <dig>  publications.
