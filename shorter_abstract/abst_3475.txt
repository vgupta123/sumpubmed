we tested our algorithm on flow cytometry data as an example of large, multidimensional data containing potentially hundreds of thousands of data points .
compared to two state of the art model-based flow cytometry clustering methods, samspectral demonstrates significant advantages in proper identification of populations with non-elliptical shapes, low density populations close to dense ones, minor subpopulations of a major population and rare populations.
this work is the first successful attempt to apply spectral methodology on flow cytometry data.
recent biological discoveries have shown that clustering large datasets is essential for better understanding biology in many areas.
however, it cannot be directly applied to large datasets due to time and memory limitations.
