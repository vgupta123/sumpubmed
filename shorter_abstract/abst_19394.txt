given that the loci targeted for enrichment are often highly conserved, how informative are they at different taxonomic scales, especially at the intraspecific/phylogeographic scale?
we assessed the phylogenetic information content of these loci at the intergeneric, interspecific, and phylogeographic scales.
as a further test of the utility at the phylogeographic scale, we used the anchor hybrid enriched loci to infer lineage divergence parameters using coalescent models of isolation with migration.
anchored-enriched loci are useful at the deep phylogeny and phylogeographic scales.
further, ahe loci yielded estimates of divergence times between closely related lineages that were broadly consistent with previous population-level analyses.
we investigate this question using australian scincid lizards in the eugongylus group .
although overall phylogenetic support was high throughout the australian eugongylus group phylogeny, there were nonetheless some conflicting or unresolved relationships, especially regarding the placement of pseudemoia, cryptoblepharus, and the relationships amongst closely-related species of tasmanian niveoscincus skinks.
high-throughput sequencing using targeted enrichment and transcriptomic methods enables rapid construction of phylogenomic data sets incorporating hundreds to thousands of loci.
phylogenetic analyses of both data sets inferred very strongly supported trees at all taxonomic levels.
