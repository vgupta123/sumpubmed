a potential pelgipeptin synthetase gene cluster  was identified from paenibacillus elgii b <dig> through genome analysis.
the gene cluster spans  <dig>  kb with eight open reading frames.
additional biochemical analysis of four recombinant adenylation domains  provided further evidence that the plp gene cluster involved in pelgipeptin biosynthesis.
in this study, a gene cluster  responsible for the biosynthesis of pelgipeptin was identified from the genome sequence of paenibacillus elgii b <dig>  the identification of the plp gene cluster provides an opportunity to develop novel lipopeptide antibiotics by genetic engineering.
bioinformatic analysis of the substrate specificity of all nine adenylation domains indicated that the sequence of the nrps modules is well collinear with the order of amino acids in pelgipeptin.
this compound consists of a β-hydroxy fatty acid and nine amino acids.
pelgipeptin, a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent, is a non-ribosomally synthesised lipopeptide antibiotic.
