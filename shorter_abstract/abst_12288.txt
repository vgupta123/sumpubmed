shigella flexneri is the major pathogen causing bacillary dysentery.
twenty four s. flexneri clinical isolates of serotype x were all converted to serotype  <dig> d by infection with phage sfi.
pcr and sequencing revealed that sfi and sfx were integrated in tandem into the proa-yaic region of the host chromosome.
untypeable or novel serotypes from natural infections had been reported worldwide but have not been generated in laboratory.
the new serotype  <dig> d strain agglutinated with both serotype x-specific anti-7; <dig> grouping serum and serotype 1a-specific anti- i typing serum, and differed from subserotypes 1a, 1b and 1c.
