noble provides a term-to-concept matching system suitable for general concept recognition in biomedical nlp pipelines.
concept recognition is an important component task for nlp pipelines, and can be either general-purpose or domain-specific.
we describe a novel, flexible, and general-purpose concept recognition component for nlp pipelines, and compare its speed and accuracy against five commonly used alternatives on both a biological and clinical corpus.
noble coder is comparable to other widely used concept recognition systems in terms of accuracy and speed.

the software is open source, freely available, and easily integrated into uima or gate.
the system’s matching options can be configured individually or in combination to yield specific system behavior for a variety of nlp tasks.
noble coder implements a general algorithm for matching terms to concepts from an arbitrary vocabulary set.
we describe key advantages of the noble coder system and associated tools, including its greedy algorithm, configurable matching strategies, and multiple terminology input formats.
advantages of noble coder include its interactive terminology builder tool, ease of configuration, and adaptability to various domains and tasks.
we benchmarked speed and accuracy of the system against the craft and share corpora as reference standards and compared it to mmtx, mgrep, concept mapper, ctakes dictionary lookup annotator, and ctakes fast dictionary lookup annotator.
these features provide unique functionality when compared with existing alternatives, including state-of-the-art systems.
