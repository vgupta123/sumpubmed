two transgenic wheat lines and a non-transgenic control were grown under a controlled temperature regimen with or without post-anthesis fertilizer and the protein composition of the resulting flour was analyzed by quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis .
protein contents of flour were determined by the fertilizer regimen and were similar in control and transgenic samples produced under each regimen while both mixing time and mixing tolerance were improved in flour from transgenic lines when plants received post-anthesis fertilizer.
the data indicate that omega- <dig> gliadins have a negative effect on flour quality and suggest that changes in quality with the growth environment may be due in part to alterations in the levels of the omega gliadins.

because a known food allergen and one of the major sources of environmentally-induced variation in wheat flour protein composition has been eliminated, the transgenic lines may yield flour with both improved end-use quality and more consistent functionality when grown in different locations.
these lines make it possible to determine whether changes in the levels of omega- <dig> gliadins in response to environmental conditions and agronomic inputs may be responsible for changes in flour end-use quality.
the end-use quality of wheat flour varies as a result of the growth conditions of the plant.
among the wheat gluten proteins, the omega- <dig> gliadins have been identified as a major source of environmental variability, increasing in proportion in grain from plants that receive fertilizer or are subjected to high temperatures during grain development.
with the exception of the omega gliadins, the non-transgenic control and the transgenic plants showed similar responses to the fertilizer treatment.
recently, transgenic lines with reduced levels of omega- <dig> gliadins were developed using rna interference .
in one transgenic line, all 2-de spots identified as omega- <dig> gliadins were substantially reduced without effects on other proteins.
in the other transgenic line, the omega- <dig> gliadins were absent and there was a partial reduction in the levels of the omega- <dig>  gliadins and the omega- <dig>  chain-terminating gliadins as well as small changes in several other proteins.
