the gal <dig> trap system described here uses the 5xuas-luc and 5xuas rsgfp-gus as reporters and allows for in planta quantitative screening, including the rapid monitoring for silencing.
while gal <dig> transactivation has been demonstrated in arabidopsis, wide use of a trap has not emerged in part because of the lack of detailed analysis, which is the purpose of the present study.
this system will be useful for the isolation and comprehensive characterization of specific reporter and driver lines.
quantitative multiplex rt-pcr on the gal <dig> and luc mrna indicate that this silencing can occur at the level of gal <dig> or luc transcription.
a key feature of this study is the use of luciferase  as the primary reporter and rsgfp-gus as secondary reporters.
a 5xuas-luc reporter is expressed at high levels in arabidopsis lines transformed with gal <dig> driven by the full, enhanced 35s promoter.
reporters driven by a 5xuas are better suited in arabidopsis than those containing a 1x or 2x uas.
luciferase expression in trap lines of the t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> generations are generally stable but by the t <dig> generation approximately 25% of the lines are significantly silenced.
however, a gal <dig> enhancer trap system in arabidopsis has not been described in the primary literature.
in drosophila, the reporters possess a gal <dig> upstream activation sequence  as five repeats  and lines that express gal <dig> from tissue specific enhancers have also been used for the ectopic expression of any transgene .
