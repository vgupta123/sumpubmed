the initial step in olfaction involves the translocation of odorants from the periphery through the aqueous lymph of the olfactory sensilla to the odorant receptors most likely by chemosensory proteins  or odorant binding proteins .
by maldi-tof-tof ms protein fingerprinting, we confirmed three csps, four abpiis, three classic obps, and four c-obps in the antennae.
most of the classic obps and all abpiis are likely involved in chemoreception.
to better understand the roles of csps and obps in a coleopteran pest species, the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum , we performed transcriptome analyses of male and female antennae, heads, mouthparts, legs, and bodies, which revealed that all  <dig> csps and  <dig> of the  <dig> previously annotated obps are transcribed.
only six of the  <dig> csp are significantly transcriptionally enriched in the main chemosensory tissues , whereas of the obps all eight members of the antenna binding proteins ii  subgroup,  <dig> of the  <dig> classic obp subgroup, the c + obp, and only five of the  <dig> c-obps show increased chemosensory tissue expression.
