the damselfly ischnura elegans is characterised by a female colour polymorphism that consists of one androchrome and two gynochrome female morphs.

the ontogenetic change in male mate preferences occurs most likely because of learned mate recognition after experience with females, which in this case does not result in a preference for one of the morphs, but rather in the loss of an innate preference for androchrome females.
interestingly, we found that naïve males showed significantly higher sexual preferences to androchrome than to gynochrome females in experimental trials.
field and molecular data show that androchrome females were less polyandrous than gynochrome females.
we used molecular markers to investigate differences in polyandry between female morphs.
in addition, we experimentally investigated innate male mating preferences and experience-dependent shifts in male mating preferences for female morphs.
sexual conflict over mating rates may favour the origin and maintenance of phenotypes with contrasting reproductive strategies.
in contrast, experienced males showed no preference for androchrome females.
previous studies have shown that the polymorphism is genetic and to a high extent maintained by negative frequency-dependent mating success that varies temporally and spatially.
