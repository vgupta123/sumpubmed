histamine-related drugs are commonly used in the treatment of vertigo and related vestibular disorders.
this study provides a molecular substrate for the effects of histamine-related antivertigo drugs acting on  h <dig> receptors, and suggest a potential target for the treatment of vestibular disorders of peripheral origin.
to assess the expression of h <dig> histamine receptors in vestibular neurons, we performed mrna rt-pcr and immunofluorescence experiments in mouse scarpa's ganglia.
the present results are consistent with calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferent vestibular neurons expressing h <dig> receptors.
betahistine, inhibit the afferent discharge recorded from the vestibular nerve.
