normal human tissues showed different complex patterns of at least  <dig> different adam <dig> splice variants arising from the alternative use of the cytosolic-encoding exons  <dig>  20a/b, and 21a/b.
we have previously shown that the alternative splicing of adam <dig> transcripts is mis-regulated in cancer cells.
characterization of human adam <dig> gene and identification of elements involved in the regulation of transcription and alternative splicing provide important clues for elucidation of physiological and pathological roles of adam <dig>  the present results also show that the alternative exon use is a physiological post-transcriptional mechanism regulating adam <dig> expression in human tissues.
human adam <dig>  flanked by the flj32785/dcst <dig> and ephrin-a <dig> genes, spans  <dig>  kb from the translation initiation codon to the polyadenylation signal, being the shortest multiple-exon adam gene.
reporter expression experiments confirmed the location of functional gc-rich, tataless and caatless promoter, with the most critical transcription-supporting elements located - <dig> to - <dig> bp relative to the translation start.
to gain a better understanding of adam <dig> regulation, its genomic organization and regulatory elements as well as the alternative exon use in human tissues were characterized.
the gene appeared to have several transcription start sites and their location suggested the promoter location within a cpg island proximal to the translation start.
