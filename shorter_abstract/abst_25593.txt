compared to other species, small populations of hybrid fibres were detected.
the purposes of the present study were to characterise the fibre type composition of a trunk  and a limb  muscle in the bovine species and to study the degree of coordination among contractile, metabolic and histological properties of fibre types.
the fibre type attributes and the relationships among their properties play an important role in the differences in muscle capabilities and features.
these results support the concept that, to some extent, muscle plasticity can be explained by the fibre type composition, and by the properties derived from their metabolic and histological profiles.
type i fibres had the highest oxidative capacity and the lowest glycolytic capacity.
regarding the histological properties, type i fibres tended to be more capillarised than the ii types.
the reverse was true for the iix fibres, whereas the type iia fibres showed intermediate properties.
the fibre type composition was delineated immunohistochemically in calf muscle samples, identifying three pure  and two hybrid type fibres .
correlations among contractile, metabolic and histological features on individual fibres were significantly different from zero .
coordination among the contractile, metabolic and histological properties of fibres has been observed.
hybrid fibre values were positioned between their corresponding pure types, and their positions were different regarding their metabolic and contractile properties.
all fibre types were found in pm, the iix type being the most frequent.
the five fibre types, previously identified, were ascribed to three different acid and alkaline matpase activity patterns.
