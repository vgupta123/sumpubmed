in total  <dig> novel type  <dig> lantibiotic clusters were identified which unexpectedly were associated with species, genera and even phyla of bacteria which have not previously been associated with lantibiotic production.
here we take advantage of the conserved nature of lanc enzymes to devise an in silico approach to identify potential lantibiotic-encoding gene clusters in genome sequenced bacteria.
multiple type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters were identified at a frequency that suggests that these antimicrobials are much more widespread than previously thought.
these clusters represent a rich repository which can yield a large number of valuable novel antimicrobials and biosynthetic enzymes.
type  <dig> lantibiotics are those in which lanthionine residues are introduced into the structural peptide  through the activity of separate lanthionine dehydratase  and lanthionine synthetase  enzymes.
