piwi interacting rna, or pirna, is a class of small rna almost exclusively expressed in the germline where they serve essential roles in retrotransposon silencing.
most pr19rna clusters were associated with retrotransposons and unannotated antisense transcripts overlapping pirna clusters.
while pr19rnas appear not to bind directly to miwi or mili, their abundance relative to secondary pirnas, in combination with their precise length, suggests they may be more than by-products of secondary pirna biogenesis.
at these loci the abundance of 19mers was found to be greater than that of secondary pirnas.
there are two types, primary and secondary pirna, and the latter is a product of enzymatic cleavage of retrotransposons' transcripts directed by the former.
