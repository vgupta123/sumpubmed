chemical genomics is an interdisciplinary field that combines small molecule perturbation with traditional genomics to understand gene function and to study the mode of drug action.
this algorithm was also tested on gene expression microarray data and high throughput sequencing chemogenomic screens and found the method is applicable to a variety of dataset types.
we created software and a user interface for using be, which is publically available.
we present a method, bucket evaluations  that surmounts many of these problems and is extensible to other datasets such as those obtained via gene expression profiling and which is platform independent.
we used levelled rank comparisons to identify drugs/compounds with similar profiles that minimizes batch effects and avoids the requirement of pre-defining the disrupting effects.
