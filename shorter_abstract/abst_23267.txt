fetal mesenchymal stem/stromal cells  represent a developmentally-advantageous cell type with translational potential.
to enhance adult msc migration, studies have focussed on the role of the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> and its ligand sdf- <dig> , but more recent work implicates an intricate system of cxcr <dig> receptor dimerization, intracellular localization, multiple ligands, splice variants and nuclear accumulation.
we investigated the intracellular localization of cxcr <dig> in fetal bone marrow-derived msc and role of intracellular trafficking in cxcr <dig> surface expression and function.
these molecules had a transient effect on cell morphology and adhesion, which abated after the removal of the inhibitors, and did not alter functional stem cell properties.
we conclude that constitutive endocytosis is implicated in the regulation of cxcr <dig> membrane expression, and suggest a novel pharmacological strategy to enhance migration of systemically-transplanted cells.
we found that up to 4% of human fetal msc have detectable surface-localized cxcr <dig>  in the majority of cells, cxcr <dig> is located not at the cell surface, as would be required for ‘sensing’ migratory cues, but intracellularly.
cxcr <dig> was identified in early endosomes, recycling endosomes, and lysosomes, indicating only a small percentage of cxcr <dig> travelling to the plasma membrane.
