bovine brucellosis is commonly caused by b. abortus and very occasionally b. melitensis and b. suis.
in this paper we describe the distribution, pattern and trend of bovine brucellosis in peninsular malaysia between  <dig> and  <dig> based on serological data obtained from nationwide b. abortus serosurveillance activities in cattle populations.
the herd-level seroprevalence varied but remained high  over the period of study and generally increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  seropositive herds clustered around the central part of the peninsula within the period of the study.
bovine brucellosis is an important disease affecting cattle characterised by abortion, still birth, reduced milk production, weak foetus and infertility in both males and females.
the months of september, october and november illustrated the highest rates with corresponding seroprevalences of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.
the distribution of bovine brucellosis in cattle has not been described in malaysia.
bovine brucellosis is widespread among herds in peninsular malaysia at a low within-herd seroprevalence rate.
a noticeable variation was observed in the cattle-level seroprevalence, but the rate remained relatively low .
the state of pahang had the highest animal and herd-level seroprevalence of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.
the chi-square statistics showed herd size , breed , month of sampling , year  and state  to be associated with increased seropositivity.
