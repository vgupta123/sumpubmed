huntington's disease  is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cag repeat expansion in the hd gene.
in r6/ <dig> fibroblast cultures, a reduced mitotic index and high frequencies of multiple centrosomes and aneuploid cells have recently been reported.
enlarged and supernumerary centrosomes were found in cultures from both r6/ <dig> and wild-type mice.
to further explore this unexpected aspect of hd, we studied cultures derived from 6- and 12-week-old r6/ <dig> fibroblasts, skeletal muscle cells, and liver cells.
cytogenetic analyses revealed a high frequency of polyploid cells in cultures from both r6/ <dig> and wild-type mice with the greatest proportions of polyploid cells in cultures derived from skeletal muscle cells of both genotypes.
the presence of polyploid cells in skeletal muscle in vivo was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation with centromeric probes.
we conclude that polyploid cells are found in fibroblast and skeletal muscle cultures derived from both r6/ <dig> and wild-type littermate mice and that aneuploidy is unlikely to be a hallmark of hd.
however, no aneuploid cells could be found in any of the tissues.
aneuploidy is normally a feature closely connected to neoplastic disease.
