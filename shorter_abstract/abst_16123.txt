n. cyriacigeorgica strain guh- <dig> genome size is  <dig> Â mb-long,  <dig> % of its cds have homologs in at least another actinobacterial genome, and  <dig> % of these are found in n. farcinica.
the full genome sequence of n. cyriacigeorgica strain guh- <dig> was studied to infer major trends in its evolution, including the acquisition of novel genetic elements that could explain its ability to thrive in multiple habitats.
among n. cyriacigeorgica specific cds, some are likely implicated in niche specialization such as those involved in denitrification and rubisco production, and are found in regions of genomic plasticity .
n. cyriacigeorgica guh- <dig> genome shows features suggesting a diversification from an ancestral saprophytic state.
cog analyses showed this genome to have an organization similar to environmental actinobacteria.
cds playing part in virulence were identified in this genome such as those involved in mammalian cell entry or encoding a superoxide dismutase.
cds encoding non ribosomal peptide synthetases  and polyketide synthases  were identified, with some being likely involved in the synthesis of siderophores and toxins.
guh- <dig> ability at acquiring foreign dna was found significant and to have led to functional changes likely beneficial for its environmental cycle and opportunistic colonization of a human host.
nocardia cyriacigeorgica is recognized as one of the most prevalent etiological agents of human nocardiosis.
