we demonstrate here, using purified muc <dig> to overlay blots of sds-extracts of streptococcus gordonii cell surface proteins,  <dig> muc7-binding bands, with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda from the streptococcus gordonii strain, pk <dig>  putative adhesins were identified by in-gel digestion and subsequent nanolc-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of resultant peptides.
the  <dig> kda band was a hppa gene product; the  <dig> kda oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein.
some of these proteins, for example alpha enolase are expected to be intracellular, however, flow cytometric analysis confirmed its location on the bacterial surface.
the salivary mucin muc <dig>  can adhere to various strains of streptococci that are primary colonizers and predominant microorganisms of the oral cavity.
the  <dig> kda band contained two proteins; alpha enolase and dna-directed rna polymerase, beta' subunit.
our data demonstrated that s. gordonii expressed a number of putative muc <dig> recognizing proteins and these contribute to muc <dig> mucin binding of this streptococcal strain.
