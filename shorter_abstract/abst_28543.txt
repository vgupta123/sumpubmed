most of the existing methods for this problem are designed for data with longitudinal replicates.
one of the fundamental problems in time course gene expression data analysis is to identify genes associated with a biological process or a particular stimulus of interest, like a treatment or virus infection.
the improved performance is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data application to the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle data.
we focus on the case without replicates and propose a new method for identifying differentially expressed genes by incorporating the functional principal component analysis  into a hypothesis testing framework.
but in reality, many time course gene experiments have no replicates or only have a small number of independent replicates.
