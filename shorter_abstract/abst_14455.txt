the 5s ribosomal dna  is organized in tandem arrays with repeat units that consist of a transcribing region  and a variable nontranscribed spacer , in higher eukaryotes.
five different units of 5s rdna were characterized in p. pollicipes and two different units in p. elegans and p. polymerus.
in analyses of 5s rdna evolution is found several 5s rdna types in the genome, with low levels of nucleotide variation in the 5s and a spacer region highly divergent.
we predicted the secondary structure and characterized the upstream and downstream conserved elements.
they are clustered in up to seven different types based on differences in their nontranscribed spacers .
these results suggest that the evolution of pollicipes 5s rdna is driven by birth-and-death processes with strong purifying selection.
molecular organization and nucleotide sequence of the 5s ribosomal dna multigene family  were investigated in three pollicipes species in an evolutionary context.
the nucleotide sequence variation revealed that several 5s rdna variants occur in pollicipes genomes.
so, many studies have shown that birth-and-death processes and selection can drive the evolution of 5s rdna.
phylogenetic analysis showed an among-species clustering pattern of 5s rdna types.
until recently the 5s rdna was thought to be subject to concerted evolution, however, in several taxa, sequence divergence levels between the 5s and the nts were found higher than expected under this model.
