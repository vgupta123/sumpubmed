the expected information content gives an easy to interpret measure for the usefulness of variant sites.
high-throughput sequencing is a cost effective method for identifying genetic variation, and it is currently in use on a large scale across the field of biology, including ecology and population genetics.
the results show that we achieve a clear separation between true variants and noise, allowing us to select candidate sites with a high degree of confidence.
correctly identifying variable sites and allele frequencies from sequencing data remains challenging, in large part due to artifacts and biases inherent in the sequencing process.
we then develop and implement a conservative estimator that takes into account uncertainity introduced by sampling bias and sequencing error.
