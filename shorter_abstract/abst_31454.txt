this study presents the development and application of a noise model that suppresses noise, limits false positives in the results, and allows integration of results from individual studies derived from different research groups.
however many challenging and unresolved issues regarding the acquisition and analysis of microarray data remain, such as accounting for both experimental and biological noise, transcripts whose expression profiles are not normally distributed, guidelines for statistical assessment of false positive/negative rates and comparing data derived from different research groups.
this study addresses these issues using affymetrix hg-u95a and hg-u <dig> genechip data derived from different research groups.
an important feature of this study is the ability to integrate data from different laboratories, improving the analytical power of the individual results.
