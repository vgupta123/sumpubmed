the method appears to be resilient against the presence of false positive interactions.
this paper describes an automated method for finding clusters of interconnected proteins in protein interaction networks and retrieving protein annotations associated with these clusters.
protein interaction graphs were separated into subgraphs of interconnected proteins, using the jung implementation of girvan and newman's edge-betweenness algorithm.
protein clusters with significant correlations to functional annotations could be identified and included groups of proteins know to cooperate in cell metabolism.
