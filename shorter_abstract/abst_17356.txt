our data suggest an important role of cemtm <dig> in regulating autophagy and maintaining muscle fibers.
this was preceded by the occurrence of excessive autophagy in the muscle and other tissues, which subsequently resulted in increased lysosomal activity and necrotic cell death.
knockdown of cemtm <dig> by using feeding-based rna interference caused loss of muscle fibers accompanied by shortening of muscle cell and body size in aged c. elegans worms.
in this study, we demonstrate that cemtm <dig>  a fyve-domain containing myotubalarin family phosphatase, is required for the maintenance of muscle fibers by preventing excessive autophagy in caenorhabditis elegans.
this study may have clinical implications for prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.
