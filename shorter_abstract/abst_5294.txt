in simulation studies, we showed that this multivariate nonlinear mixed model had little relative bias  in estimating compartment model pk parameters if all non-compartment pk parameters were reported in every study.
if there missing non-compartment pk parameters existed in some published literatures, the relative bias of compartment model pk parameter was still small .
the 95% coverage probabilities of these pk parameter estimates were above 85%.
this paper proposed an important approach to transform published non-compartment model pharmacokinetics  parameters into compartment model pk parameters.
using mdz as an example, we showed that this approach successfully transformed  <dig> non-compartment model pk parameters from  <dig> publications into  <dig> compartment model pk parameters.
a conditional first-order linearization approach was developed for statistical estimation and inference.
this meta-analysis was performed with a multivariate nonlinear mixed model.
pharmacokinetics model is the central piece of model based drug development.
to fulfill the model based drug development, the very first step is usually a model establishment from published literatures.
it can be routinely used for model based drug development.
this non-compartment model pk parameter transformation into compartment model meta-analysis approach possesses valid statistical inference.
