to further characterize their regulatory networks, rna-seq was used to define the transcriptional profiles of c. jejuni nctc <dig> wild type, Δfur, Δperr and ΔfurΔperr isogenic deletion mutants under both iron-replete and iron-limited conditions.
the genome of campylobacter jejuni contains two iron activated fur-family transcriptional regulators, cjfur and cjperr, which are primarily responsible for regulating iron homeostasis and oxidative stress respectively.
both transcriptional regulators have been previously implicated in regulating diverse functions beyond their primary roles in c. jejuni.
these findings represent additional modes of co-regulation by these two transcriptional regulators in c. jejuni.
interestingly, our results indicate that cjfur/cjperr appear to co-regulate the expression of flagellar biogenesis genes in an opposing and iron-independent fashion.
in particular, deletion of perr results in the differential expression of a large group of genes in the absence of iron, suggesting that cjperr may also regulate genes in an iron-independent manner, similar to what has already been demonstrated with cjfur.
it was found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in at least one mutant under iron-replete conditions and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in at least one mutant under iron-limited conditions.
in particular the iron-independent co-regulation of flagellar biogenesis by cjfur/cjperr represents a potentially novel regulatory function for these proteins.
the cjfur and cjperr transcriptomes characterized in this study were compared to those previously identified using microarray profiling and found to be more extensive than previously understood.
the cjfur and cjperr transcriptomes are larger than previously reported.
