we demonstrate and explore the utility of our approach with both simulated and microarray data; random graphs and weighted  correlation networks are used to form network models.
we outline an inferential method for performing one- and two-sample hypothesis tests where the sampling unit is a network and the hypotheses are stated via network model.
we propose a dissimilarity measure that incorporates nearby neighbour information to contrast one or more networks in a statistical test.
