although instruments for physical shearing, such as the covaris s <dig> focused-ultrasonicator system, and products for enzymatic shearing, such as the nextera technology and nebnext dsdna fragmentase kit, are commercially available, a simple and inexpensive method is desirable for high-throughput sequencing library preparation.
in this method, random incorporation of 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine-5’-triphosphate is achieved through dna amplification with dna polymerase, followed by dna digestion with mspji.
alignment of generated short reads to a reference sequence demonstrated a relatively high level of random fragmentation.
a library suitable for sequencing using the illumina miseq platform was prepared and processed using the proposed method.
the size range of the resulting fragments was capable of control through optimisation of 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine-5’-triphosphate concentration in the reaction mixture.
fragmentation at random nucleotide locations is an essential process for preparation of dna libraries to be used on massively parallel short-read dna sequencing platforms.
due to the recognition sequence of the enzyme, dna amplicons are fragmented in a relatively sequence-independent manner.
mspji is a recently characterised restriction enzyme which recognises the sequence motif cnnr  when the first base is modified to 5-methylcytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.
