here, we describe an optimized protocol for effectively suppressing gene expression in the egg and nymphal stages of i. scapularis by electroporation.
the significant disruption of β-actin and cytoplasmic cystatin transcripts in tick eggs demonstrate the applicability of this technique.
using cy3-labeled dsrna to monitor the movement, electroporated dsrna entered the nymphs and spread to salivary glands and other tissues.
the genes encoding the putative phospholipase a <dig> , cytoplasmic cystatin, syntaxin- <dig>  β-actin and calreticulin were targeted by delivering the dsrna encoding the specific gene coding regions in the unfed nymphs.
the pla <dig>  cytoplasmic cystatin, syntaxin- <dig>  β-actin and calreticulin genes were also significantly silenced, suggesting that this method has the potential to introduce dsrna in eggs and unfed nymphs.
this technique represents a novel approach for specific gene suppression in immature stages of ticks.
our study demonstrates that electroporation can be used as a simple dsrna delivery tool in assessing the functional role of tick genes in the vector-host interactions.
