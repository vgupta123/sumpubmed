high-density gene-rich maps represent a powerful resource to assist gene discovery endeavors when used in combination with qtl and association mapping and should be especially valuable to assist the assembly of reference genome sequences soon to come for several plant and animal species.
a total of  <dig>  genes were mapped, with  <dig> of them ordered with high likelihood support on a framework map anchored to  <dig> microsatellites with average density of  <dig>  cm.
a general protocol is proposed to build high-density transcript linkage maps in less characterized plant species by sfp genotyping with a concurrent objective of reducing microarray costs.
the eucalyptus  <dig>  gene map is the most highly enriched map for transcriptional information for any forest tree species to date.
an sfp-mapping microarray with  <dig>  selected candidate sfp probes representing  <dig>  genes was subsequently designed and used to genotype sfps in a larger subset of the segregating population drawn by selective mapping.
it represents a major improvement on the number of genes previously positioned on eucalyptus maps and provides an initial glimpse at the gene space for this global tree genome.
sfp discovery and mapping was achieved using pseudo-testcross screening and selective mapping to simultaneously optimize linkage mapping and microarray costs.
we report the construction of a high-density linkage map of expressed genes for the heterozygous genome of eucalyptus using single feature polymorphism  markers.
in silico validation showed that 87% of the sfps map to the expected location on the  <dig> x draft sequence of the eucalyptus grandis genome.
