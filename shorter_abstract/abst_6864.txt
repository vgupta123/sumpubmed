lep-caspase- <dig> is absent from the silkworm genome and appears to be noctuid-specific, and to have arisen from a tandem duplication of the caspase- <dig> gene.
we identified  <dig> sequences distributed among  <dig> species encoding putative caspases.
evolutionarily conserved proteases, called caspases, play a central role in regulating apoptosis.
the discovery of p <dig>  a baculovirus protein inhibiting caspase activity, has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran caspase, sf-caspase- <dig>  studies on sf-caspase- <dig> mode of activation suggested that apoptosis in lepidoptera requires a cascade of caspase activation, as demonstrated in many other species.
in order to get insights into this gene family in lepidoptera, we performed an extensive survey of lepidopteran-derived est datasets.
reception of death stimuli triggers the activation of initiator caspases, which in turn activate the effector caspases.
according to homology to their drosophila counterparts and their primary structure, we determined that lep-caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are putative effector caspases, whereas lep-caspase- <dig> and - <dig> are putative initiators.
in the tobacco hawkmoth,  <dig> distinct transcripts encoding putative caspase- <dig> were identified, suggesting at least  <dig> duplication events in this species.
phylogenetic analyses showed that lepidoptera possess at least  <dig> caspases, for which we propose a unified nomenclature.
the basic repertoire of five major types of caspases shared among lepidoptera seems to be smaller than for most other groups studied to date, but gene duplication still plays a role in lineage-specific increases in diversity, just as in diptera and mammals.
