experiments using culture supernatants from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and a double chamber co-culture model confirmed that p. aeruginosa stimulates biofilm formation and activates sigb in a s. aureus strain isolated from a cf patient.
the presence of s. aureus scvs as well as biofilms have both been associated with chronic infections in cf.
it was previously shown that the p. aeruginosa exoproduct 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline-n-oxide  suppresses the growth of s. aureus and provokes the emergence of small-colony variants .
furthermore, the supernatant from p. aeruginosa mutants unable to produce hqno induced the production of biofilms by s. aureus to a lesser extent than the wild-type strain only in a s. aureus sigb-functional background.
these results suggest that s. aureus responds to hqno from p. aeruginosa by forming scvs and biofilms through sigb activation, a phenomenon that may contribute to the establishment of chronic infections in cf patients.
the emergence of scvs and biofilm production under hqno exposure was shown to be dependent on the activity of the stress- and colonization-related alternative sigma factor b .
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are often found together in the airways of cystic fibrosis  patients.
we demonstrated that hqno stimulates s. aureus to form a biofilm in association with the formation of scvs.
analysis of gene expression revealed that exposure of a prototypical s. aureus strain to hqno activates sigb, which was leading to an increase in the expression of the fibronectin-binding protein a and the biofilm-associated sara genes.
