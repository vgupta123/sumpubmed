it is therefore necessary to separate regions of the chromatin structure that are sufficiently constrained from regions with measurements that do not provide enough information to reconstruct the embedding.
we present a new method based on graph rigidity to assess the suitability of experiments for constructing plausible three-dimensional models of chromatin structure.
pre-processing experimentally observed interactions with this method before relating chromatin structure to biological phenomena will ensure that hypothesized correlations are not driven by the arbitrary choice of a particular unconstrained embedding.
underlying this analysis is a new, efficient, and accurate algorithm for finding sufficiently constrained  collections of constraints in three dimensions, a problem for which there is no known efficient algorithm.
applying the method to four recent chromosome conformation experiments, we find that, for even stringently filtered constraints, a large rigid component spans most of the measured region.
the software for identifying rigid components is gpl-licensed and available for download at http://cbcb.umd.edu/kingsford-group/starfish.
it also establishes that interactions from recent highly filtered genome-wide chromosome conformation experiments provide an adequate set of constraints for embedding.
filtering highlights higher-confidence regions, and we find that the organization of these regions depends crucially on short-range interactions.
a priori, it is possible that an infinite number of embeddings are consistent with the measurements due to a lack of constraints between some regions.
chromosome conformation capture experiments result in pairwise proximity measurements between chromosome locations in a genome, and they have been used to construct three-dimensional models of genomic regions, chromosomes, and entire genomes.
