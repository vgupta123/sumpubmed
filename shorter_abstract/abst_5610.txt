though accurate prediction and high specificity and sensitivity can be achieved with several methods, the method based on hypergeometric distribution provides a significant advantage in term of positive predicting value with two to sixty folds the positive predicting values of other methods.
the proposed multi-specie array analysis based on the hypergeometric distribution addresses shortcomings of previous methods by enhancing signals of positively hybridized probes.
in this study, we conceived an automated method based on the hypergeometric distribution for identifying pathogens in multiplexed arrays and compared it to five other methods.
we evaluated these metrics: 1) accurate prediction, whether the top ranked prediction match the real virus; 2) four accuracy scores.
