here we show that combining conventional global gene expression arrays with the power of bioinformatic genomic survey of aml1-consensus sequences is an effective strategy to identify aml <dig> targets whose transcription is epigenetically downregulated by the leukemia-associated aml1-mtg <dig> protein.
however, when we applied a bioinformatic approach to search for aml1-consensus sequences in the  <dig> kb around the gene transcription start sites, we closed on  <dig> potential direct aml <dig> targets.
preliminary findings showing that these fusion proteins lead to transcriptional downregulation of aml <dig> targets, marked by repressive chromatin changes, would support this hypothesis.
we interrogated mouse gene expression microarrays with probes generated either from 32d cells infected with a retroviral vector carrying aml1-mtg <dig> and unable of granulocyte differentiation and proliferation in response to the granulocyte colony stimulating factor , or from 32d cells infected with the cognate empty vector.
further, the promoter of one of these genes, containing a cpg island, was aberrantly methylated.
these findings strengthen the conclusion that leukemia-specific oncoproteins can induce non-random epigenetic changes.
some of these features could be consequent to differential epigenetic transcriptional deregulation at aml <dig> targets imposed by aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig>  the fusion proteins deriving from the two translocations.
