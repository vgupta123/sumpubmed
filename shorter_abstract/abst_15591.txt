this is the first report suggesting involvement of abc transporters in zea tolerance.
c. rosea produces the enzyme zearalenone hydrolase , which degrades zea.
however, the molecular basis of resistance to don in c. rosea is not understood.
we have exploited a genome-wide transcriptomic approach to identify genes induced by don and zea in order to investigate the molecular basis of mycotoxin resistance c. rosea.
the present study identifies a number of transcripts encoding proteins that are potentially involved in conferring resistance to don and zea in the mycoparasitic fungus c. rosea.
subsequent bioinformatics analysis predicted that all transcripts with similarity to abc transporters could be ascribed to only  <dig> abc transporters genes, and phylogenetic analysis of the predicted abc transporters suggested that they belong to group g  of the fungal abc transporter gene family.
clonostachys rosea strain ik <dig> is a mycoparasitic fungus capable of controlling mycotoxin-producing fusarium species, including f. graminearum and f. culmorum, known to produce zearalenone  and deoxynivalenol .
the qrt-pcr results obtained confirm the expression patterns suggested from the est redundancy data.
don-induced transcripts represented genes encoding metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig>  cytochrome c oxidase and stress response proteins.
we generated don- and zea-induced cdna libraries based on suppression subtractive hybridization.
whilst metabolic readjustment is potentially the key to withstanding don, the fungus produces zhd <dig> to detoxify zea and abc transporters to transport zea or its degradation products out from the fungal cell.
