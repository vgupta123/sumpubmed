furthermore, the generation of a useful database of novel genes associated with muscle recovery growth will allow further investigations on particular genes, pathways or cellular process involved in muscle growth and regeneration.
significance analysis of microarrays  and temporal expression profiling led to the segregation of differentially expressed genes into four major clusters.
our study is the first demonstration of a coordinated expression of functionally related genes during muscle recovery growth.
a third cluster that contained  <dig> genes that were up-regulated  <dig> to  <dig> days post-refeeding was enriched with genes involved in reticulum and golgi dynamics and with genes indicative of myofiber and muscle remodelling such as genes encoding sarcomeric proteins and matrix compounds.
in this study, to obtain more information on the system-wide integration of recovery growth in muscle, we undertook a time-course analysis of transcript expression in trout subjected to a food deprivation-refeeding sequence.
finally, a fourth cluster of  <dig> genes overexpressed only in 36-day refed trout muscle contained genes with function in carbohydrate metabolism and lipid biosynthesis.
a second cluster that included approximately  <dig> genes with transient induction  <dig> to  <dig> days post-refeeding was dominated by genes involved in transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, translation, chaperone activity, mitochondrial production of atp and cell division.
remarkably, among the genes induced were several transcriptional regulators which might be important for the gene-specific transcriptional adaptations that underlie muscle recovery.
one cluster comprising  <dig> genes with high expression in muscle from fasted animals included a large set of genes involved in protein catabolism.
