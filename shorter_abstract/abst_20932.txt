earlier research showed that a rifampicin-passaged strain of f. psychrophilum  caused no disease in rainbow trout  while inducing a protective immune response against challenge with the virulent csf 259– <dig> strain.
to assess the pattern of phenotypic and genotypic changes associated with passage, we examined proteomic, lps and single-nucleotide polymorphism  differences for two f. psychrophilum strains  that were passaged with and without rifampicin selection.
comparative methylome analysis of two strains  identified no shared methylation motifs for these two strains.
multiple genomic changes arose during passage experiments with rifampicin selection pressure.
rifampicin resistance was conveyed by expected mutations in rpob, although affecting different dna bases depending on the strain.
few proteomic differences were observed by 2d sds-page and there were no apparent changes in lps between strains.
one rifampicin-passaged csf 259– <dig> strain  was attenuated  in challenged fish, but only accumulated eight nonsynonymous snps compared to the parent strain.
a csf 259– <dig> strain passaged without rifampicin  accumulated five nonsynonymous snps and was partially attenuated  compared to the parent strain .
we hypothesized that rifampicin passage leads to an accumulation of genomic mutations that, by chance, reduce virulence.
while only three missense snps were associated with attenuation, a ser492phe rpob mutation in the cr strain may contribute to further attenuation.
