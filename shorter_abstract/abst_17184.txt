easily accessible, differentiated model systems of the cervical epithelium are not yet available to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms within these highly specialized cells.
therefore, the aim of the study was to establish a cell culture of the porcine cervical epithelium representing in vivo-like properties of the tissue.
primary porcine cervical cells performed best in conditioned ham's f- <dig>  containing 10% fcs, egf and insulin.
we tested different isolation methods and culture conditions and validated purity of the cultured cells by immunohistochemistry against keratins.
finally, differentiation was validated via immunohistochemistry against beta catenin.
after cultivation in an air-liquid interface for three weeks, the cells showed a discontinuously multilayered phenotype.
