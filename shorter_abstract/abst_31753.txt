isolates from the outbreak were represented by a single genotype based on multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis ; four sub-genotypes were identified using single nucleotide repeat  analysis.
carcass locations from a single white-tailed deer, odocoileus virginanus, outbreak were analyzed for spatial clustering using k-function analysis and directionality with trend surface analysis and the direction test.
overlap of case home ranges provides spatial and temporal support for localized transmission, which may include the role of necrophagous or hematophagous flies in outbreaks in this region.
the directionalities were compared to results of high resolution genotyping.
the results of the spatial clustering analyses, combined with deer movement data, suggest anthrax transmission events occur within limited spatial areas, with carcass locations occurring within the activity space of adjacent cases.
these results emphasize the need for active surveillance and prompt cleanup of anthrax carcasses to control anthrax both during outbreaks and between seasons.
here we combined case-level spatio-temporal analysis and high resolution genotyping to investigate anthrax transmission dynamics.
