it would be useful to identify further candidate sequences, however identifying them computationally is hard since exon sequences are also constrained by their functional role in coding for proteins.
known sequences include binding sites for sr proteins, which are thought to mediate interactions between splicing factors bound to the 5' and 3' splice sites.
