accordingly, the activation of human neutrophil fpr and fprl <dig> induces identical, pertussis toxin-sensitive functional responses and a transient increase in intracellular calcium is followed by a secretory response leading to mobilization of receptors from intracellular stores, as well as a release of reactive oxygen metabolites.
the transient rise in intracellular calcium induced by the active receptors is not affected by pbp <dig>  suggesting that the blockage occurs in a parallel, novel signaling pathway used by fprl <dig> to induce oxygen radical production and secretion.
the pip2-binding peptide pbp <dig> selectively inhibits fprl1-mediated superoxide production and granule mobilization.
the inhibitory effect of pbp <dig> is, however, receptor specific and affects the fprl1-, but not the fpr-, induced cellular response.
they share a high degree of sequence similarity, particularly in the cytoplasmic domains involved in intracellular signaling.
we report that a cell permeable ten amino acid peptide  derived from the phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  binding region of gelsolin  blocks granule mobilization as well as secretion of oxygen radicals.
also the fpr can activate neutrophils through a pbp10-sensitive signaling pathway, but this signal is normally blocked by the cytoskeleton.
