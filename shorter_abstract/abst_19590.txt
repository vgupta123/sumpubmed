we have uncovered significant bioinformatics evidence that ctcf is widespread, at least among drosophila species.
the mosquito ctcfs are constitutively expressed and are upregulated in early embryos and in the ovaries of blood-fed females.
mosquito ctcfs are likely orthologous to the widely-characterized vertebrate ctcfs and potentially also serve an insulating function.
recently, ctcf joined su, zw <dig>  beaf <dig> and gaga factor as a protein associated with insulator activity in the fruitfly, drosophila melanogaster.
as such, endogenous insulator sequences would be valuable elements to enable stable transgene expression.
these genes encode polypeptides with eleven c2h <dig> zinc fingers that show significant similarity to those of vertebrate ctcfs, despite at least  <dig> million years of divergence.
gambiae ctcf binds two known insulator sequences.
