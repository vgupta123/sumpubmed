this largely automated technique is much faster than manual methods and is able to detect homologs accurately and efficiently among a diverse set of organisms.
in this study, we combined two popular approaches for homolog detection, reciprocal best hit   and hiddenâ€“markov model  profiles search , on a diverse set of complete genomes of  <dig> eukaryotic species ranging from excavates to humans to identify all detectable members of  <dig> c2h <dig> znf gene families.
our hybrid approach combines features of the both rbh and hmm methods for homolog detection.
our analysis of the  <dig> evolutionarily conserved c2h <dig> znf gene families revealed a stepwise appearance of znf families, agreeing well with the phylogenetic relationship of the organisms compared and their presumed stepwise increase in complexity .
the genes of this family usually occur as clusters in genomes and are thought to have undergone a massive expansion in vertebrates by multiple tandem duplication events .
the c2h <dig> zinc-finger  containing gene family is one of the largest and most complex gene families in metazoan genomes.
