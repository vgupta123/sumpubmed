bisulfite treatment followed by pcr amplification specifically converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine.
however, mapping high-throughput bisulfite reads to the reference genome remains a great challenge due to the increased searching space, reduced complexity of bisulfite sequence, asymmetric cytosine to thymine alignments, and multiple cpg heterogeneous methylation.
it is able to map high-throughput bisulfite reads at whole genome level with feasible memory and cpu usage.
bisulfite sequencing is a powerful technique to study dna cytosine methylation.
