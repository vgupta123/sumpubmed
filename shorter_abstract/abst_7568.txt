in particular, icln regulates myod expression via its interaction with prmt <dig> by an epigenetic modification that utilizes symmetrical di-methylation of histone h <dig> on arginine  <dig>  we provide multiple evidences that tis <dig> directly binds dna, which is a functional feature necessary for its role in transcriptional regulation.
tpa induced sequence  <dig> acts as a transcriptional co-regulator controlling the expression of genes involved in differentiation of various cell types, including skeletal myoblasts.
we show that tis7/icln epigenetically regulate myod expression controlling protein methyl transferase activity.
