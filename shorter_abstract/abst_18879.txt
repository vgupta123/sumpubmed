this study demonstrated that degu positively regulates flgb and sacb through its binding to the promoter regions.
the hypothesis was confirmed by observing degs-independent expression when the dr in the sacb-lacz fusion was changed to an ir, suggesting that unphosphorylated degu regulates the sacb promoter through the newly created ir.
unphosphorylated degu bound to two regions in the fla/che regulatory region containing an inverted repeat-like sequence that resembles the inverted repeat  in the comk promoter.
these results strongly suggest that the arrangement of the degu-binding motifs determines whether unphosphorylated degu or degu-p binds to the sacb promoter.
this was confirmed by binding of unphosphorylated degu to the ir in the sacb promoter.
we demonstrated that degu-p prefers binding to dr but not to ir in the sacb promoter.
mutational analysis revealed that positive regulation of fla/che by swraa requires degu-binding.
the response regulator degu and its cognate histidine kinase degs constitute a two-component system in the gram-positive soil bacterium bacillus subtilis.
an analysis of the degu-p-regulated gene sacb  by footprint and mutational analyses revealed that degu-p bound to a direct repeat  of the degu-recognition motifs, which has been shown to be functional in vivo, while unphosphorylated degu did not.
