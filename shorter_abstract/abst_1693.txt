both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number amplifications were found, with specific gains over array-based methodologies previously used to analyze these genomes.
experimental evolution of microbial populations provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary adaptation in response to controlled selective pressures.
this study suggests that whole-genome sequencing can provide a rapid approach to uncover the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations, with further applications in the study of laboratory selections and mutagenesis screens.
in addition, we show how single-end, short read sequencing data can provide detailed information about structural rearrangements, and generate predictions about the genomic features and processes that underlie genome plasticity.
however, until recently it has been difficult to identify the precise genetic changes underlying adaptation at a genome-wide scale.
these boundaries guided the recovery of breakpoint sequences, which provide insights into the nature of a complex genomic rearrangement.
applying a segmentation algorithm to quantify structural changes, we determined the approximate genomic boundaries of a 5Ã— gene amplification.
