microarray experiments, as well as other genomic analyses, often result in large gene sets containing up to several hundred genes.
the gene ontology consortium  <cit>  has annotated genes in several model organisms using a controlled vocabulary of terms and placed the terms on a gene ontology , which comprises three disjoint hierarchies for molecular functions, biological processes and cellular locations.
we use the gene ontology hierarchy and the annotations to pick significant functions and pathways by comparing the distribution of functions in a given gene list against the distribution of all the genes in the genome, using the hypergeometric distribution to assign probabilities.
we analyse a gene list from a genomic study of pre-mrna splicing to demonstrate the utility of gobar.
for example, a large number of genes in a set might be kinases just because the genome contains many kinases.
it also allows visualization of the go tree, as well as placement of a single gene on the go hierarchy.
the biological significance of such sets of genes is, usually, not readily apparent.
