we also found that shorter 5’utrs are affected more by the stochastic process, whereas longer 5’utrs are affected more by selection pressure on genomic features.
the most important genomic features are the oe ratios of ustops and g+c content.
we hypothesize that the selection pressure on a combination of genomic features is also important for 5’utr evolution.
the relative contributions of each feature to the variation of 5’utr length were also evaluated.
we found that 14%~33% of the 5’utr length variations can be explained by a linear combination of the analyzed genomic features.
our results suggest that upstream open reading frames may be the real target of selection, rather than uaugs.
here we use a multiple linear regression model to delineate the correlation between 5’utr length and the combination of a series of genomic features  ratios of uaugs, upstream stop codons , methylation-related cg/ug dinucleotides, and mrna-destabilizing uu/ua dinucleotides) in six vertebrates  and four invertebrates .
the surprisingly large weightings of ustops highlight the importance of selection on upstream open reading frames , rather than on uaugs per se.
the lengths of 5’utrs of multicellular eukaryotes have been suggested to be subject to stochastic changes, with upstream start codons  as the major constraint to suppress 5’utr elongation.
furthermore, g+c content is the most important determinants for most invertebrates, but for vertebrates its effect is second to ustops.
