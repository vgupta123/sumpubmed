the production of the toxins implicated in gas gangrene, α-toxin and perfringolysin o, is regulated by the virsr two-component regulatory system.
to further characterize the virsr and revr regulatory networks, comparative transcriptomic analysis was carried out with strand-specific rna-seq on c. perfringens strain jir <dig> and its isogenic virr and revr regulatory mutants.
in conclusion, using strand-specific rna-seq analysis, this study has identified differentially expressed chromosomal and pcp <dig> native plasmid-encoded genes, antisense transcripts, and transcripts within intergenic regions that are controlled by the virsr or revr regulatory systems.
clostridium perfringens causes toxin-mediated diseases, including gas gangrene  and food poisoning in humans.
comparative analysis revealed that virr acts as a global negative regulator, whilst revr acts as a global positive regulator.
furthermore, analysis of the mapped rna-seq reads visualized as depth of coverage plots showed that there were  <dig> previously unannotated transcripts in intergenic regions.
in addition, revr, an orphan response regulator, has been shown to affect virulence in the mouse myonecrosis model.
using the edger analysis package,  <dig> genes in the virr mutant and  <dig> genes in the revr mutant were found to be differentially expressed.
therefore, about 95 % of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in the virr mutant, whereas 81 % of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated in the revr mutant.
