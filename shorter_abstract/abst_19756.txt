phylogenetic and population analyses using  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps successfully assigned rice accessions to the relevant rice subgroups, suggesting that these snps capture evolutionary signatures that have accumulated in rice subpopulations.
thus, our resequencing results will be useful for future breeding, as well as functional and evolutionary studies, in the post-genomic era.
this study provides strong evidence that the size of krice_core is small but contains high genetic and functional diversity across the genome.
furthermore, genome-wide association studies  for four exemplary agronomic traits in the kric_core manifest the utility of krice_core; that is, identifying previously defined genes or novel genetic factors that potentially regulate important phenotypes.
a core collection, by definition, refers to a subset of the entire population that preserves the majority of genetic diversity, enhancing the efficiency of germplasm utilization.
rice germplasm collections continue to grow in number and size around the world.
here, we report whole-genome resequencing of the  <dig> rice mini core collection or korean rice core set  that represents  <dig>  rice germplasms deposited in the korean genebank of the rural development administration .

comparisons of the sequences with the reference genome yielded more than  <dig> million  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig>  m indels.
since maintaining and screening such massive resources remains challenging, it is important to establish practical methods to manage them.
