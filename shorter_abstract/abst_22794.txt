however, both read length and contig depth are highly variable and thus raise doubt about simple methods of snp frequency estimation.
a modeling approach  can be a powerful tool for identifying selection on specific functional sequence groups by comparing the frequency and distribution of polymorphisms.
these results support the hypothesis that long non-coding transcripts are less conserved than long protein-coding transcripts.
we used  <dig> pyrosequencing to identify  <dig>  putative snps in the eastern tiger salamander  transcriptome, then constructed analytical models to estimate snp frequency.
using this novel modeling approach, we estimated snp frequency in protein-coding  and non-coding transcripts .
we found little difference in snp frequency in the contigs, but we found a trend of a higher frequency of snps in long contigs representing non-coding transcripts relative to protein-coding transcripts.

our most robust model considered read depth as well as contig length, and was  <dig>  ×  <dig> times more likely than the length-only model.
the model which considered only contig length  was evaluated with very poor likelihood.
using this high-throughput and cost-effective technology, a number of studies have estimated single nucleotide polymorphism  frequency by calculating the mean number of snps per unit sequence length .
