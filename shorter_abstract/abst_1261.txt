we evaluate the performance in terms of coverage against the original  <dig> genomes used in training fpfam and against five more recently sequenced fungal genomes that can be considered as an independent test set.
taking fungal species as an example, we construct a domain library of hmms  using sequences from  <dig> genomes, consisting of  <dig> species from the ascomycetes group and two basidiomycetes, ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen of maize, and the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium.
in addition, we include the microsporidion encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite, and two non-fungal species, the oomycetes phytophthora sojae and phytophthora ramorum, both plant pathogens.
