the source code of mxscarna and its web server are available at .
although many alignment methods for non-coding rnas, including sankoff's algorithm for strict structural alignments, have been proposed, they are either inaccurate or computationally too expensive.
we propose a fast algorithm for multiple structural alignments of rna sequences that is an extension of our pairwise structural alignment method .
the proposed method for structural alignment of multiple rna sequences is fast enough for large-scale analyses with accuracies at least comparable to those of existing algorithms.
aligning multiple rna sequences is essential for analyzing non-coding rnas.
