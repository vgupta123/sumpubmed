enhancement of enzymatic digestibility by some supplementations could reduce enzyme loading and cost, which is still too high to realize economical production of lignocellulosic biofuels.
in the supernatant of yh , substances of high molecular weight were identified as proteins and other uv-absorbing compounds, which showed close molecular weight to components of cellulases.
in the current work, the components of yh were separated by centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography and finally characterized in order to better understand this positive effect.
a  <dig> % of nitrogen of yeast cells was remained in the slurry  after hydrothermal treatment.
supplementation of cellulases with yh enhances enzymatic digestibility of fr mainly by a competitive adsorption of non-enzymatic substances on lignin.
different strategies can be used for a good utilization of yeast cells in terms of biorefinery concept.
experiment results proved the adsorption of proteins in yhl on lignin.
a recent study indicates that yeast hydrolysates  have improved the efficiency of cellulases on digestibility of furfural residues .
those substances attributed to a synergetic positive effect on enzymatic hydrolysis of fr.
the molecular weight of these substances has a significant impact on their performance.
