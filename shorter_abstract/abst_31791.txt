between april  <dig> and april  <dig>   <dig> patients with nosocomial surgical-site infections were consecutively recruited into the study at five surgical departments in three major tertiary care centres.
we also studied the genetic basis for antibiotic resistance and the genetic background of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant  enterobacteriaceae.
horizontal transfer of both plasmids is probably an important mechanism for the spread of blactx-m- <dig> among enterobacteriaceae species and hospitals.
the presence of sets of antibiotic resistance genes in these two plasmids indicates their capacity for gene rearrangement and their evolution into new variants.
diverse modes are involved in transmission of resistance, plasmid dissemination probably playing a major role.
surgical-site infection is the most frequent health care-associated infection in the developing world, with a strikingly higher prevalence than in developed countries we studied the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in enterobacteriaceae isolates from surgical-site infections collected in three major tertiary care centres in bangui, central african republic.
the blactx-m- <dig> and aac-ib-cr genes were detected in all strains, usually associated with qnr genes .
of these, 65/ <dig>  were 3gc-r, which were characterized for resistance gene determinants and genetic background.
resistance transfer was studied in one representative strain of the resistance gene content in each repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-pcr banding pattern.
