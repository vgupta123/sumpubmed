microarray data suggest that as  induces genes involved in response to oxidative stress and represses transcription of genes induced by phosphate starvation.
on the other hand, fe sods were strongly repressed in response to as  stress.
arsenate stress resulted in the repression of numerous genes known to be induced by phosphate starvation.
most importantly, these data reveal that arsenate stress affects the expression of several genes with little or unknown biological functions, thereby providing new putative gene targets for future research.
the microarray experiment revealed induction of chloroplast cu/zn superoxide dismutase  , cu/zn sod , as well as an sod copper chaperone .
whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays were employed to investigate the transcriptional responses of arabidopsis thaliana plants to as  stress.
