we have predicted the protein interaction network of leishmania major by using three validated methods: psimap, peimap, and ipfam.
we have constructed the first protein interaction network of the leishmania major parasite by using a computational approach.
we were able to predict the biological process for  <dig> interacting proteins by doing enrichment analysis of the clusters detected.
the topological analysis of the protein network enabled us to identify a set of candidate proteins that may be both  essential for parasite survival and  without human orthologs.
these potential targets are promising for further experimental validation.
we have taken a computational approach to the detection of new drug targets, which may become an effective strategy for the discovery of new drugs for this tropical disease.
analyzing the topology of the network with metrics such as connectivity and betweenness centrality, we detected  <dig> potential drug targets after homology filtering with the human proteome.
combining the results from these methods, we calculated a high confidence network  with  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  interactions.
this strategy, if validated, may augment established drug discovery methodologies, for this and possibly other tropical diseases, with a relatively low additional investment of time and resources.
