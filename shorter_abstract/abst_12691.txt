it is compared with other well-known variable importance measures in different contexts, such as a classification problem with variables of different types, another classification problem with correlated predictor variables, and problems with multivariate responses and predictors of different types.
a new alternative importance measure, called intervention in prediction measure, is investigated.
several simulation studies are carried out, showing the new measure to be very competitive.
it can easily be computed for any kind of response, including multivariate responses.
furthermore, it can be used with any algorithm employed to grow each individual tree.
it can be used with new observations.
but measures of prediction performance are not unique or there is not even a clear definition, as in the case of multivariate response random forests.
furthermore, they provide variable importance measures that aid qualitative interpretation and also the selection of relevant predictors.
it can be used in place of  other variable importance measures.
random forests are a popular method in many fields since they can be successfully applied to complex data, with a small sample size, complex interactions and correlations, mixed type predictors, etc.
however, most of these measures rely on the choice of a performance measure.
it depends on the structure of the trees, without depending on performance measures.
in addition, it is applied in two well-known bioinformatics applications previously used in other papers.
