while the probes on affymetrix arrays remain the same for several years, the biological knowledge concerning the genomic sequences evolves rapidly.
in a large number of cases, 36%, the probes matching a reference sequence were consistent with the grouping of probes by the manufacturer of the chips.
however, once probes have been selected and synthesized on an array, it is still possible to re-evaluate the results using an updated mapping of probes to genes, taking into account the latest biological knowledge available.
short oligonucleotide arrays have several probes measuring the expression level of each target transcript.
