nonribosomal peptides , bioactive secondary metabolites produced by many microorganisms, show a broad range of important biological activities .
this opens a way to a systematic analysis of structural patterns occurring in nrps.
this amounts to solving a variant of the maximum common subgraph problem on pattern and peptide graphs, which is done by computing cliques in an appropriate compatibility graph.
such studies can investigate the functional role of some monomeric chains, or analyse nrps that have been computationally predicted from the synthetase protein sequence.
nrps are mainly composed of amino acids but their primary structure is not always linear and can contain cycles or branchings.
we developed an efficient method that allows for a quick search for a structural pattern in the norine database.
a basic operation in such analyses is the search for a given structural pattern in the database.
the norine database, the first resource entirely dedicated to nrps, currently stores more than  <dig> nrps annotated with their monomeric peptide structure encoded by undirected labeled graphs.
the method has been incorporated into the norine database, available at .
