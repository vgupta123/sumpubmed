currently, there is a paucity of methods for finding small rna generative locales.
we describe and implement an algorithm that can determine small rna generative locales from high-throughput sequencing data.
for each of the sub-networks in the resulting graph the clustering coefficient, a measure of the interconnectedness of the subnetwork, is used to identify the generative locales.
the algorithm creates a network, or graph, of the small rnas by creating links between them depending on their proximity on the target genome.
we test the algorithm over a wide range of parameters using rfam sequences as positive controls and demonstrate that the algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity in a range of arabidopsis and mouse small rna sequence sets and that the locales it generates are robust to differences in the choice of parameters.
