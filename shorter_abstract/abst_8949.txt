until now, the identification of chemical compounds with priming-inducing activity  relied on tedious and invasive approaches, or required the late detection of secreted furanocoumarin phytoalexins in parsley cell cultures.
furthermore, there was a close correlation of a compound’s activity to enhance the oxygen consumption in parsley cells and its capacity to prime pep13-induced furanocoumarin secretion as evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy.
chemical enhancement of oxygen consumption by salicylic derivatives in parsley cell suspension cultures correlates with the induction of the primed state of enhanced defense that enhances the quantity of pep13-induced furanocoumarin phytoalexins.
the direct activation of the plant immune system does not provide a promising plant protection measure because of high fitness costs.
however, upon treatment with certain natural or synthetic compounds, plant cells can promote to a fitness cost-saving, primed state of enhanced defense.
ramos noninvasively determines the otr as a measure of the metabolic activity of plant cells.
this report demonstrates that a respiration activity-monitoring system  can identify compounds with defense priming-inducing activity in parsley cell suspension in culture.
treatment with the priming-active compounds methyl jasmonate and pyraclostrobin also resulted in an enhanced respiration activity.

treatment of parsley culture cells with the known plant activator salicylic acid , a natural plant defense signal, resulted in an otr increase.
both, the otr increase after priming with sa and the pep <dig> challenge were dose-dependent.
