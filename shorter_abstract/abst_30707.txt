extensive accumulation of an abnormal polysaccharide displaced and partially replaced mitochondria and myofibrils.
thus, the functional genomic approach could be conducted in order to provide new knowledge about the metabolic disorders related to pssm.
the main disorders observed in pssm muscles could be related to mitochondrial dysfunctions, glycogenesis inhibition and the chronic hypoxia of the pssm muscles.
muscle histology examinations revealed that some families suffer from a polysaccharide storage myopathy .
several up-regulated genes, especially il <dig>  revealed a severe muscular inflammation in pssm muscles.
we propose exploring the pssm muscle fiber metabolic disorders by measuring gene expression in relationship with the histological phenotype.
the severity of the disease was higher in the two homozygous pssm horses.
ultrastructural evaluation revealed a decrease of mitochondrial number and structural disorders.
it is assumed that a gene expression signature related to pssm should be observed at the transcriptional level because the glycogen storage disease could also be linked to other dysfunctions in gene regulation.
in the pssm muscles, histological data revealed pas positive amylase resistant abnormal polysaccharides, inflammation, necrosis, and lipomatosis and active regeneration of fibers.
gene expression analysis revealed  <dig> genes significantly modulated .
the up-regulation of glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>  under its active form could be responsible for glycogen synthase  inhibition and hypoxia-inducible factor  destabilization.
data mining analysis showed that protein synthesis, apoptosis, cellular movement, growth and proliferation were the main cellular functions significantly associated with the modulated genes .
