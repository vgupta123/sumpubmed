we have developed a 12-parameter/10-color flow cytometric staining method for the simultaneous detection and characterization of  <dig> mouse thymocyte subpopulations that represent discreet stages of t cell development.
intracellular staining of sp thymocytes for phosphorylated stat- <dig> demonstrated that il- <dig> signaling was confined to the most mature sp subsets.
these experiments revealed distinct patterns of surface expression of receptors for the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>
the il- <dig> receptor α chain  was highly expressed on the earliest thymocyte subsets, then downregulated prior to t cell receptor β-selection and finally upregulated in the cd4/cd <dig> double positive cells prior to positive selection.
