it was determined that: i) red qds  display higher toxicity than green , ii) qds mainly induce expression of genes involved with cd+ <dig> stress  and tellurium does not contribute significantly to qds-mediated toxicity since cells incorporate low levels of te, iii) red qds also induce genes related to oxidative stress response and membrane proteins, iv) cd2+ release is higher in red qds, and v) qds render the cells more sensitive to polymyxin b.
the higher toxicity of red qds is most probably due to higher cadmium content and release from the nanoparticle as compared to green qds.
in a previous work our group described a biomimetic method for the aqueous synthesis of cdte-gsh quantum dots  using biomolecules present in cells as reducing and stabilizing agents.
moreover, qds-treated cells become more sensitive to polymyxin b making these biomimetic qds candidates for adjuvant therapies against bacterial infections.
most semiconductor nanoparticles used in biomedical applications are made of heavy metals and involve synthetic methods that require organic solvents and high temperatures.
results indicate that bacterial toxicity of qds is mainly associated with cadmium release, oxidative stress and loss of membrane integrity.
based on the results obtained in this work, a general model of cdte-gsh qds toxicity in e. coli is proposed.
in this work, the response of e. coli exposed to different sized-cdte-gsh qds synthesized by a biomimetic protocol was evaluated through transcriptomic, biochemical, microbiological and genetic approaches.
