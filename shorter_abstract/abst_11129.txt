ran gtpase has multiple functions during the cell division cycle, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope formation.
gfp-ranq69l, a mutant locked in the gtp-bound state, is less highly concentrated in the nucleus and associates with nuclear pore complexes within the nuclear envelope.
our data indicate that ran-gtp generated at chromatin is highly mobile and interacts dynamically with distal structures that are involved in nuclear transport and mitotic spindle assembly.
here, we have characterised the localisation and mobility of ran coupled to green fluorescent protein  during the cell cycle in live human cells.
these results show that ran interacts dynamically with chromatin, nuclear pore complexes and the mitotic spindle during the cell cycle.
the activity of ran is determined by both its guanine nucleotide-bound state and its subcellular localization.
by contrast, gfp-rant24n, a mutant with low affinity for nucleotides, interacts relatively stably with chromatin throughout the cell cycle and is highly concentrated on mitotic chromosomes.
these interactions are dependent on the nucleotide-bound state of the protein.
