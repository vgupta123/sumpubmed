francisella tularensis is a highly pathogenic gram-negative bacterium that causes the disease tularaemia in humans and animals.
our findings suggest that f. tularensis encodes a significant number of non-coding regulatory rnas, including members of well conserved families of structural and housekeeping rnas and other poorly conserved transcripts that may have evolved more recently to help f. tularensis deal with the unique and diverse set of environments with which it must contend.
deletion of these srnas did not, however, significantly alter f. tularensis growth under various stress conditions in vitro, its replication in murine cells, or its ability to induce disease in a mouse model of f. tularensis infection.
we have used a combination of experimental assays and in silico prediction to identify srnas in f. tularensis strain lvs.
regulation of bacterial gene expression by small rnas  have proved to be important for many biological processes.
we have also discovered two abundant putative srnas that share no sequence similarity or conserved genomic context with any previously annotated regulatory transcripts.
