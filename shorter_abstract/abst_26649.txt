gene targets for prognostic mirnas were identified using in silico predictions and in-house bc transcriptome dataset.
in both the approaches, the risk scores were significant after adjusting for potential confounders.
cox-proportional hazards regression model was employed and risk score analysis was performed to identify mirna signature independent of potential confounders.
the mirnas associated with os identified in our cohort were validated using an external dataset from the cancer genome atlas  project.
independent validation of signatures  using an external dataset from tcga further strengthened the study findings.
targets for the identified mirnas were enriched for cell proliferation, invasion and migration.
gene ontology terms were identified using david bioinformatics v <dig> .
the study identified twelve non-redundant mirnas associated with os and/or rfs.
in the co approach, from  <dig> mirnas retained after filtering,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were significant for os and rfs, respectively.
of these, four and two mirnas were significant for overall survival  and recurrence free survival , respectively.

we used case–control  and case-only  statistical paradigm to identify prognostic markers.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have shown promise as potential prognostic markers in several cancer types including bc.
representative mirnas were validated using qrt-pcr.
in the cc approach,  <dig> mirnas were retained with predetermined criteria for good read counts, from which  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed.
