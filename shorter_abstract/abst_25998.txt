to enhance the construction of input to primetv, two helper programs, readreconciliation and reconcile, accompany primetv.
the software is distributed under the gnu general public license.
it reads reconciled trees in an extended newick format and outputs them as tree-within-tree illustrations in a range of graphic formats.
for the casual user a web-service provides a simple user interface to all programs.
adequate software tools for generating illustrations of tree reconciliations are instrumental for presenting and communicating results and ideas regarding these phenomena.
illustrations of these general reconciliations may not be achieved without manual editing.
with primetv, the first visualization tool for general reconciliations, illustrations of trees-within-trees are easy to produce.
because it clarifies and accentuates an underlying structure in a reconciled tree, e.g., the impact of a species tree on a gene-family phylogeny, it will enhance scientific presentations as well as pedagogic illustrations in an educational setting.
evolutionary processes, such as gene family evolution or parasite-host co-speciation, can often be viewed as a tree evolving inside another tree.
available visualization tools have been limited to illustrations of the most parsimonious reconciliation.
however, there exists a plethora of biologically relevant non-parsimonious reconciliations.
