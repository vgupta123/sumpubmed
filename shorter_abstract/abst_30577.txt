we identify h. glycines homologs of c. elegans unc genes whose protein products are involved in muscle composition and regulation.
previously, we reported a substantial decrease in transcript abundance for hg-unc- <dig>  the h. glycines homolog of unc- <dig>  during the adult sedentary phase of scn.
we developed a bioinformatics database that compares expressed sequence tag  and genomic data of c. elegans and h. glycines .
rt-pcr reveals the transcript abundance of h. glycines unc homologs at mobile and sedentary stages of its lifecycle.
the cehg bioinformatics database is shown to be useful in identifying homologs of genes whose protein products perform roles in specific aspects of h. glycines muscle biology.
our bioinformatics comparison of c. elegans and h. glycines genomic data and our hg-unc- <dig> expression experiments demonstrate that the transcript abundance of specific h. glycines homologs of muscle gene decreases as the nematode becomes sedentary inside the root during its parasitic feeding stages.
a prominent reduction in transcript abundance occurs in samples from sedentary nematodes for homologs of actin, unc-60b , unc- <dig>  unc- <dig> , unc- <dig> , unc- <dig> , and the potassium channel unc- <dig> .
less reduction is observed for the focal adhesion complex gene hg-unc- <dig>
