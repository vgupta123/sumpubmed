moreover, the patients infected with isolates with strong or weak p-caga intensity had a higher risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia  than those infected with sparse p-caga isolates.
infection with h. pylori stains with stronger p-caga intensity may lead to an increased risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia and cancer.
these patients were categorized according to the clinical diseases, such as duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, and gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia.
furthermore, a total of  <dig> patients were randomly selected from each clinical category for evaluation of their isolates' p-caga intensity by in vitro ags cells co-culture.
the isolates from the patients of gastric cancer or gastritis with intestinal metaplasia had stronger p-caga intensity than those of gastritis without intestinal metaplasia .
their gastric specimens were reviewed by the updated sydney's system.
we enrolled  <dig> dyspeptic patients and prospectively obtained the gastric biopsy specimens and the h. pylori isolates.
