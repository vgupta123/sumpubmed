during cect, first visualization of the contrast medium was at  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds in the aorta,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds in the hepatic arteries, and 15 ±  <dig>   seconds in the liver parenchyma.
time to peak was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and 31 ±  <dig>   seconds in the aorta and the liver parenchyma, respectively.
although hepatic diseases are a common occurrence in reptile medicine, there is no reference to the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound  and contrast-enhanced computed tomography  to evaluate the liver in lizards.
ceus and dynamic cect are practical means to determine liver hemodynamics in green iguanas.
an increase in liver echogenicity and density was evident during ceus and cect, respectively.
distribution of contrast medium in iguana differed from mammals.
contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging techniques are considered useful in veterinary and human medicine to evaluate liver perfusion and focal hepatic lesions.
in ceus, the mean ± sd  peak enhancement was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  .
time to peak enhancement was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds.
therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of change in echogenicity and attenuation of the liver in green iguanas  after administration of specific contrast media.
