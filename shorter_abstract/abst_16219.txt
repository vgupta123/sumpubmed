apo and -mevalonate bound crystal structures of lmmk, from a bacterial expression system, have been determined to high resolution providing, for the first time, information concerning binding of mevalonate to an mk.
we are unable to provide a definitive explanation for the low activity of recombinant protein isolated from a bacterial expression system compared to material isolated from procyclic-form trypanosoma brucei.
the mevalonate binds in a deep cavity lined by highly conserved residues.
putative mevalonate kinase encoding genes from leishmania major  and trypanosoma brucei  have been cloned, over-expressed in and proteins isolated from procyclic-form t. brucei.
his <dig> is key for binding and for discrimination of - over -mevalonate, with the main chain amide interacting with the c <dig> hydroxyl group of -mevalonate, and the side chain contributing, together with val <dig> and thr <dig>  to the construction of a hydrophobic binding site for the c <dig> methyl substituent.
