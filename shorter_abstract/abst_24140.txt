the software package arlequin was used to evaluate the standard genetic measures of the alignments obtained with and without the use of the csa algorithm with two well known multiple alignment algorithms, the clustalw and the mavid tools, and also the visualization tool sinicview.
researchers interested in aligning circular dna sequences must first rotate them to the "right" place using an essentially manual process, before they can use multiple sequence alignment tools.
the results show that a circularization and rotation pre-processing step significantly improves the efficiency of public available multiple sequence alignment algorithms when used in the alignment of circular dna sequences.
in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm that identifies the most interesting region to cut circular genomes in order to improve phylogenetic analysis when using standard multiple sequence alignment algorithms.
although a large number of multiple sequence alignment algorithms have been proposed to date, they all deal with linear dna and cannot handle directly circular dna.
several complete mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are now available, increasing the importance of using multiple sequence alignment algorithms in comparative genomics.
