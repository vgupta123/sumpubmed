in  <dig>  the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome  outbreak that occurred between late-february and mid-june in taiwan.
isolates of streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  method.
the number of scarlet fever occurrences reported between  <dig> and  <dig> fluctuated considerably in central taiwan and throughout the nation.
the large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between  <dig> and  <dig> was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones.
the fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the sars outbreak in  <dig>
a total of  <dig> emm types were identified in  <dig>  s. pyogenes isolates.
the five most prevalent emm types were emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig>  and emm <dig> .
the occurrences of scarlet fever in central taiwan in 2000â€“ <dig> were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for  <dig> % of the isolates collected.
pfge analysis with smai suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone.
most of the s. pyogenes strains  emerged and lasted for only a few years.
