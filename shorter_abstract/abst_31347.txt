both hrcu and hrpp were shown to be required for disease development in an immature pear infection model and respective mutants were unable to induce a hypersensitive response in tobacco.

based on amino acid conservation in animal pathogenic bacteria, hrcu and hrpp were examined for their roles in regulation of t3s hierarchy.
successful translocation requires timely synthesis and allocation of both structural and secreted t3s proteins.
finally, all hrcu and hrpp phenotypes identified were shown to be dependent on a conserved amino acid motif in the cytoplasmic tail of hrcu.
the t3s system is a complex molecular machine consisting of more than  <dig> proteins.
collectively, these data demonstrate roles for hrcu and hrpp in regulating t3s and represent the first attempt in understanding t3s heirarchy in e. amylovora.
