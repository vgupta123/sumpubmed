many studies now show that plant genetics can drive changes in the structure of both above and belowground communities; however, the role of plant genetic variation in mediating aboveground-belowground interactions is still unclear.

we used an earthworm-plant-aphid model system with two aphid species  to test the effect of host-plant  genetic variation on the indirect interaction between the belowground earthworms  on the aboveground aphid populations.
previous work has shown inconsistent effects of earthworms on aphids, but we suggest these differences could be explained by plant genetic variation and variation among aphid species.
this study demonstrates that the outcome of belowground-aboveground interactions can be mediated by genetic variation in the host-plant, but depends on the identity of the species involved.
our data shows that host-plant variety mediated an indirect ecological effect of earthworms on generalist black bean aphids , with earthworms increasing aphid growth rate in three plant varieties but decreasing it in another variety.
we found no effect of earthworms on the second aphid species, the pea aphid , and no effect of competition between the aphid species.
interactions between aboveground and belowground terrestrial communities are often mediated by plants, with soil organisms interacting via the roots and aboveground organisms via the shoots and leaves.
plant biomass was increased when earthworms were present, and decreased when a. pisum was feeding on the plant .
although a. fabae aphids were influenced by the plants and worms, they did not, in turn, alter plant biomass.
