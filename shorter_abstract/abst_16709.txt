however, our assumptions of functional equivalence fail to consider the opportunity for divergence conferred by ~ <dig> million years  of independent evolution between these species.
lineage-specific positive selection was detected in the ancestral euarchontoglires and hominidae lineages for stk <dig>  in the ancestral primate lineage for cdh <dig>  in the ancestral murinae lineage for both sdhc and msh <dig> genes and the ancestral muridae lineage for tsc <dig>
analysis of these orthologous datasets revealed significant levels of positive selection.
evidence of lineage-specific positive selection was identified in  <dig> genes in both ancestral and extant lineages.
identifying positive selection in the primate, hominidae, muridae and murinae lineages suggests an ancestral functional shift in these genes between the rodent and primate lineages.

our analysis of the current literature and colon cancer databases identified  <dig> genes exhibiting colon cancer associated germline mutations.
