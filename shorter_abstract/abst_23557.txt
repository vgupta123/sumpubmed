the results with high success rates indicate that the rough sets approach as proposed in this paper might hold a high potential to become a useful tool in bioinformatics.
amino acid compositions and  <dig> physicochemical properties data are used as conditional attributes for the construction of decision system.
after reducing the decision system, decision rules are generated, which can be used to classify new objects.
a new method for the prediction of protein structural classes is constructed based on rough sets algorithm, which is a rule-based data mining method.
the results showed that the rough sets approach is very promising and may play a complementary role to the existing powerful approaches, such as the component-coupled, neural network, svm, and logitboost approaches.
in this study, self-consistency and jackknife tests on the datasets constructed by g.p.
