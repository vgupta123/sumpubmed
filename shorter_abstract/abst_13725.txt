in an outdoor experiment, populations were set up to include the extremes of the prevalence spectrum observed in natural populations: 5% initial prevalence mimicking a newly invading parasite, 100% mimicking a rock pool population founded by infected hosts only, and 50% prevalence which is commonly observed in natural populations in spring.
populations started with 5% and 50% prevalence exhibited strong and regular seasonality already in the first year.
our study shows that the time needed to approach the seasonal changes in prevalence depends strongly on the initial prevalence.
the microsporidian parasite hamiltosporidium tv√§rminnensis exhibits pronounced seasonality in natural rock pool populations of its host, daphnia magna with a regular increase of prevalence during summer and a decrease during winter.
here, we aim at testing how the starting prevalence affects the regular prevalence changes over a 4-year period in experimental populations.
the parasite exhibited similar prevalence changes in all treatments, but seasonal patterns in the 100% treatment differed significantly from those in the 5% and 50% treatments.
in contrast, the amplitude of changes in the 100% treatment was low throughout the experiment demonstrating the long-lasting effect of initial conditions on prevalence dynamics.
regular seasonal changes in prevalence of infectious diseases are often observed in nature, but the mechanisms are rarely understood.
empirical tests aiming at a better understanding of seasonal prevalence patterns are not feasible for most diseases and thus are widely lacking.
