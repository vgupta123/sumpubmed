better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction and the detailed b. pertussis  target recognition pattern will help in guided vaccine design.
slides were incubated with serum and peptide-igg complexes detected with cy5-labeled goat anti-human igg and analyzed using a genepix 4000b microarray scanner, followed by statistical analysis, using pam  and the identification of uniquely recognized peptide epitopes.
dtpwc resembles more closely the whooping cough reactome as compared to acellular vaccines.
peptide microarray technology allows detection of subtle differences in epitope signature responses and may help to guide rational vaccine development by the objective description of a clinically relevant immune response that confers protection against infectious pathogens.
