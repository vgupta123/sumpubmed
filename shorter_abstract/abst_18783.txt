in this regard, we  characterized the gonadosomatic index  in the anadromous fish c. nasus;  analyzed the gnrh-r <dig> mrna expression levels in ovary and brain, and concentrations in the serum; and  identified the gnrh-r <dig> protein distribution in the brain and ovaries.
the results indicate that gnrh-r <dig> could act together to promote spawning during the anadromous migration.
there is some evidence that the gnrh-r <dig> gene expression levels and protein distributions change in association with the migratory behavior.
