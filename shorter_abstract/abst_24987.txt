our approach of identifying networks of highly connected genes that are potentially co-regulated by geminiviruses during infection will allow us to identify novel pathways of co-regulated genes that are stimulated in response to pathogen infection in general, and virus infection in particular.
an indirect promoter targeting strategy, via ac2-host dsdna binding protein interactions, and inactivation of snrk <dig> -mediated defense responses could provide the opportunity for geminiviruses to alter host gene expression and in turn, reprogram the host to support virus infection.
quantitative real-time pcr analysis validated the microarray expression results for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes tested.
it is becoming increasingly apparent that geminiviruses manipulate the host in several ways to facilitate an environment conducive to infection, predominantly through the use of multifunctional proteins.
the goal of this study was to identify changes in the transcriptome of arabidopsis induced by the transcription activation function of ac <dig> and the inactivation of snrk <dig> .
transcriptional regulation by ac <dig> appears to be mediated through interaction with a plant specific dna binding protein, peapod <dig> , that specifically binds to sequences known to mediate activation of the cp promoter of cabbage leaf curl virus  and tomato golden mosaic virus .
geminivirus ac <dig> is a multifunctional protein that acts as a pathogenicity factor.
network analysis of these two sets of differentially regulated genes identified several networks consisting of between four and eight highly connected genes.
