the major algorithmic improvements rely on the use of binary trees to represent the sets of candidate haplotypes for each individual.
these binary tree representations:  speed up the computations of posterior probabilities of the haplotypes by avoiding the redundant operations made in phase v <dig> , and  overcome the exponential aspect of the haplotypes inference problem by the smart exploration of the most plausible pathways  in the binary trees.
we have developed a new computational algorithm, shape-it, to infer haplotypes under the genetic model of coalescence with recombination developed by stephens et al in phase v <dig> .
as a matter of speed, shape-it was faster than ishape and fastphase for datasets smaller than  <dig> snps, but fastphase became faster -but still less accurate- to infer haplotypes on larger snp datasets.
this new algorithm based on tree representations could be used in other hmm-based haplotype inference software and may apply more largely to other fields using hmm.
our results show that shape-it is several orders of magnitude faster than phase v <dig>  while being as accurate.
