i further show that likely eh <dig> motifs are found in combination with t-box, zinc finger and doublesex domains as well as discussing other plausible candidate associations.
using motif identification methods and database searching techniques, i delimit which homeobox and forkhead domain containing proteins also have likely eh <dig> motifs.
candidate eh <dig> motifs exist in combination with a variety of transcription factor domains, suggesting that these proteins have repressor functions.
i show that despite low database search scores, there is a significant association of the motif with transcription factor function.
i have systematically searched the predicted proteomes of drosophila, c. elegans and human for further instances of the motif.
the distribution of the eh <dig> motif is suggestive of convergent evolution, although in many cases, the motif has been conserved throughout bilaterian orthologs.
