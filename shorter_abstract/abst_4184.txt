our approach utilizes both word and syntactic features to effectively capture ppi patterns from biomedical literature.
identifying protein-protein interactions  from literature is an important step in mining the function of individual proteins as well as their biological network.
the proposed method automatically identifies gene names by a priority model, then extracts grammar relations using a dependency parser.
while current performance is far from satisfactory as an annotation tool, it is already useful for a ppi article search engine since users are mainly focused on highly-ranked results.
a large margin classifier with huber loss function learns from the extracted features, and unknown articles are predicted using this data-driven model.
for the biocreative iii act evaluation, our official runs were ranked in top positions by obtaining maximum  <dig> % accuracy,  <dig> % f <dig> score,  <dig>  mcc score, and  <dig> % auc ip/r score.
our approach is valuable in showing how to use grammatical relations for ppi article filtering, in particular, with a limited training corpus.
