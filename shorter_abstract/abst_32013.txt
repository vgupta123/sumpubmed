wood is a valuable natural resource and a major carbon sink.
a total of  <dig> putative xylem orthologs were identified, which are unevenly distributed across the arabidopsis chromosomes with eight hot spots observed.
we use comparative genomics to examine evolution of the xylem transcriptome to gain insights into xylem evolution.
these xylem orthologs and conifer-specific unigenes are likely to have played a crucial role in xylem evolution.
conifers have highly conserved xylem transcriptomes, while angiosperm xylem transcriptomes are relatively diversified.
the xylem transcriptomes of vascular plants are more conserved than the total transcriptomes.
wood formation is an important developmental process in vascular plants which played a crucial role in plant evolution.
the functional domains of genes in the xylem transcriptome are moderately to highly conserved in vascular plants, suggesting the existence of a common ancestral xylem transcriptome.
compared to the total transcriptome derived from a range of tissues, the xylem transcriptome is relatively conserved in vascular plants.
of the xylem transcriptome, cell wall genes, ancestral xylem genes, known proteins and transcription factors are relatively more conserved in vascular plants.
vascular plants share a common ancestral xylem transcriptome.
although genes involved in xylem formation have been investigated, the molecular mechanisms of xylem evolution are not well understood.
phylogenetic analysis revealed that evolution of the xylem transcriptome has paralleled plant evolution.
evolution of the xylem transcriptome has largely followed the trend of plant evolution.
we also identified  <dig> conifer-specific xylem unigenes, all of which are of unknown function.
the xylem transcriptome is highly conserved in conifers, but considerably divergent in angiosperms.
