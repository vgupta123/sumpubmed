for post-hoc testing a tukey-kramer multiple-comparison test was performed to compare the relative volumes on the different examination days.
affiliation to treatment group, local treatment and examination modality had no significant influence on the results .
an analysis of variance  for repeated measurements was performed to identify statistically significant influences on the relative tumor volume.
in all groups, the relative tumor volume decreased significantly to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % by day  <dig> .
prior to each injection and on day  <dig>  the sizes of up to nine melanoma lesions per horse were measured by caliper and ultrasound.
this is the first clinical report on a systemic effect against equine melanoma following treatment with dna vectors encoding eqil <dig> and eqil <dig> and formulated with a transfection reagent.
neither a cellular nor a humoral immune response directed against htyr or hgp <dig> was detected.
xenogenic dna vaccination may represent a promising therapeutic approach against equine melanoma as it successfully induced an immunological response in other species suffering from melanoma and in healthy horses.
a one-way anova was used to evaluate differences in body temperature between the groups.
an anova for repeated measurements was performed to analyse changes in body temperature over time.
specific serum antibodies against hgp <dig> and htyr were measured using cell based flow-cytometric assays.
in a clinical study, twenty-seven, grey, melanoma-bearing, horses were assigned to three groups  and vaccinated on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with dna vectors encoding for equine  il- <dig> and il- <dig> alone or in combination with either human glycoprotein   <dig> or human tyrosinase .
addition of dna vectors encoding hgp <dig> respectively htyr did not potentiate this effect.
equine melanoma has a high incidence in grey horses.
a p–value <  <dig>  was considered significant for all statistical tests applied.
horses had an increased body temperature on the day after vaccination.
