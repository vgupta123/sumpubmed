several qtls on rye chromosomes appeared to be involved in the phenotypic expression of the trait, suggesting that rye genome factors are predominantly responsible for al tolerance in triticale.
available rye and triticale genetic maps suggested the putative location of the markers and demonstrated that they formed several linked groups assigned to distinct chromosomes .
markers associated with genomic regions under positive selection were identified and indirectly mapped in the vicinity of the al-tolerant markers.
the r <dig> values were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in most cases, indicating a good fit of the data, with better results obtained with the gml than the mlm approach.
the chromosomal locations of candidate markers were verified based on known assignments of ssrs and darts or by using genetic maps of rye and triticale.
the effect of aluminum on agronomic performance is particularly important in cereals like wheat, which has promoted the development of programs directed towards selection of tolerant forms.
