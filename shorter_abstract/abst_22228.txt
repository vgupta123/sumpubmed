the developed computational method is able to include heterogeneous features of promoters and suggest combinatorial modules for experimental testing.
transcriptional activity of genes depends on many factors like dna motifs, conformational characteristics of dna, melting etc.
expansibility and robustness of the methodology implemented in the approach ensures good results for a wide range of problems.
here, we present an integrative bioinformatic approach aimed at the discovery of regulatory modules that can be effectively verified experimentally.
and there are computational approaches for their identification.
hence, one needs an approach that is able to integrate many heterogeneous computational methods and upon that suggest selected regulatory elements for experimental verification.
however, in real applications, the number of predicted, for example, dna motifs may be considerably large.
it is based on combinatorial analysis of known and novel binding motifs, as well as of any other known features of promoters.
the goal of this method is the identification of a collection of modules that are specific for an established dataset and at the same time are optimal for experimental verification.
