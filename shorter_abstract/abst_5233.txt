to find new mirna in this important crop, small rnas from mixed tissues were sequenced, resulting in over  <dig> million unique sequences.
five new mirnas were validated by northern blot.
moreover, we found targets for  <dig> of the  <dig> new mirnas.
using a newly established criterion, based on the precision of mirna processing from precursors, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas in maize.
we have implemented a novel method of identifying mirna by measuring the precision of mirna processing from precursors.
mirnas are known to play important regulatory roles throughout plant development.
until recently, nearly all the mirnas in maize were identified by comparative analysis to mirnas sequences of other plant species, such as rice and arabidopsis.
our sequencing effort validated  <dig> of the  <dig> known maize mirna families, including  <dig> unique mirnas.
using this method,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> potential mirnas have been identified in maize.
