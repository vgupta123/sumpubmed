nucleosome exclusion patterns are correlated with various factors that regulate gene expression, which emphasizes the need to include chromatin structural parameters in experimental analysis of gene expression.
nucleosome exclusion scores  were calculated individually for each nucleotide, giving a measure of how likely a specific nucleotide and its immediate neighborhood would impair dna bending and, consequently, exclude nucleosomes.
a whole genome annotation for nucleosome exclusion regions  was carried out on the human genome.
we present, for the first time, a whole genome prediction of nucleosome exclusion regions for the human genome .
nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin, and they play a significant role in regulating gene expression.
we developed a new method based on grubbs' outliers test for ranking genes based on their tissue specificity, and correlated this ranking with nxscores.
the results show a strong correlation between tissue specificity of a gene and the propensity of its promoter to exclude nucleosomes .
specific dna sequence patterns are known, from empirical and theoretical studies, to influence dna bending and flexibility, and have been shown to exclude nucleosomes.
the resulting annotations were correlated with  <dig> gene expression profiles.
in addition, nxscores correlated well with gene density, gene expression levels, and dnasei hypersensitive sites.
