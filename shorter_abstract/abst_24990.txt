this simulator, tested against in vivo experiments on her-2/neu mice, reproduces all the vaccination protocols used in the in vivo experiments.
biological experiments leave open the question of whether the chronic protocol is indeed the minimal vaccination schedule affording 100% protection, or whether shorter protocols could be applied that would result in the same efficacy.
the results suggest that the chronic protocol included a good number of redundant vaccine administrations, and that maximal protection could still be obtained with a number of vaccinations ~40% less than with the chronic protocol.
a biological solution would require an enormous number of experiments, each lasting at least one year.
this approach may have important connotations with regard to translation of cancer immunopreventive approaches to human situations, in which it is desirable to minimize the number of vaccinations.
therefore we approached this problem by developing a simulator  which describes the immune response activated by triplex vaccine.
we are currently setting up experiments in mice to test whether the actual effectiveness of the vaccination protocol agrees with the genetic algorithm.
a possible solution to the former open question using a minimal search strategy based on a genetic algorithm is presented.
the simulator should describe any vaccination protocol within the tested range.
