rt-qpcr analysis, using the validated controls, confirmed the up-regulation of transcripts predicted to encode a cycloisomerase, an slc <dig> transporter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, a small heat shock protein, and an aldo-keto reductase, as well as the down-regulation of a transcript encoding a fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein, under these conditions.
we tested eleven potential reference genes for stability using rt-qpcr and genorm analyses.
pseudo-nitzschia multiseries hasle   is distinctive among the ecologically important marine diatoms because it produces the neurotoxin domoic acid.
to identify transcripts whose levels correlate with domoic acid production, we analyzed ps-n under conditions of high and low domoic acid production by cdna microarray technology and reverse-transcription quantitative pcr  methods.
through microarray analysis of exponential- and stationary-phase cultures with low and high domoic acid production, respectively, we identified candidate reference genes whose transcripts did not vary across conditions.
our results indicated that transcripts encoding jmjc, dynein, and histone h <dig> proteins were the most suitable for normalization of expression data under conditions of silicon-limitation, in late-exponential through stationary phase.
our results provide a strong basis for further studies of rna expression levels in ps-n, which will contribute to our understanding of genes involved in the production and release of domoic acid, an important neurotoxin that affects human health as well as ecosystem function.
