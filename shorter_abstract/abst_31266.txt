moreover, the algorithm improved the primer design efficiency and was shown to be useful both for building vh and vl gene libraries and for the cloning of unknown genes in gene families.
the vh sequence of csa cells was  <dig> bp.
the amplification of variable regions of immunoglobulins has become a major challenge in the cloning of antibody genes, whether from hybridoma cell lines or splenic b cells.
polymerase chain reaction protocols were performed to recognize the vh gene from the hybridoma cell line.
the vh gene was amplified by both the 3'race and 5'race.
the new protocol rescued the amplifications of the vh gene that had failed under conventional protocols.
using conventional protocols, the heavy-chain variable region genes often are not amplified successfully from the hybridoma cell lines.
the most highly conserved region in the middle of the vh regions of the ig cdna was identified, and a degenerated 5'primer was designed, using our algorithms.
