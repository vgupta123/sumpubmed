several proteins, including our protein of interest, major histocompatibility complex class i , can bypass the first line of er-qc and reside in post-er compartments in an unfolded form.
we confirm the egress of h-2kb in an unfolded form to a post-er compartment from where they can cycle back to the er.
deciphering the exact identity of the post-er compartment by laser scanning microscopy did not only point to the existence of the ergic and cis-golgi compartments as residency areas for unfolded proteins, but also to the involvement of an addional compartment, that lies in close proximity and possesses high resemblance to the aforementioned compartments.
finally, we demonstrate the plausible usage of the rapamycin assay to assess the trafficking of defected proteins especially in diseases and under therapeutic studies.
in mammalian cells, the quality control  of properly folded proteins is monitored in the early secretory pathway, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum .

such forms entail both monomeric and dimeric structures that are devoid of peptides and thus cannot fulfill the immunological function of antigen presentation at the cell surface.
interestingly, we were capable of showing using the same rapamycin trapping assay that h-2kb can undergo a potential maturation event during their cycling; this is attained upon addition of peptides and trapping of accumulated post-er molecules at the cell surface.
