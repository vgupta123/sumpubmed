however, intriguingly, our data suggest other factors may be specifically required for the stress-induced expression of gcs- <dig>  notably, we demonstrate that the candidate activator tir- <dig> and the mapkkk nsy- <dig> are required for the arsenite-induced activation of pmk- <dig>  however, our data suggest that the majority of candidates participate in novel mechanisms to promote gcs- <dig> expression.
many of these new candidate activators of gcs- <dig> are also required for the stress-induced intestinal expression of other phase  <dig> genes.
taking advantage of the elevated phase  <dig> gene expression in a mutant lacking the peroxidase prdx- <dig>  we have identified many new genes that are required for stress-induced expression of gcs- <dig>  a phase  <dig> enzyme critically required for glutathione synthesis.
significantly, these include genes previously implicated in resistance to ionizing radiation, longevity and responses to pathogenic infection.
for example, the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase ufd- <dig> is dispensable for pmk- <dig> activation but important for maintaining nuclear levels of skn- <dig>  the stress-induced expression of multiple skn-1-target genes and oxidative stress resistance.
our study identifies potential new regulators of nrf <dig>  reveals that additional mechanisms promote the stress-induced expression of specific phase  <dig> detoxification genes and provides new insight into the relationships between these universally important stress defences, oxidative stress resistance and aging.
cnc transcription factors, such as mammalian nrf <dig>  drive the expression of phase  <dig> enzymes and are activated as an important conserved response to oxidative stress and xenobiotics.
phase  <dig> detoxification enzymes provide a vital defence against reactive oxygen species, including xenobiotic metabolites, which cause the oxidative damage involved in drug toxicity and many diseases.
