our data are consistent with lccs being the primary virulence factors in the majority of infections, but lcc-negative strains may precipitate certain categories of infection.
a high quality, annotated sequence of atcc <dig> reveals many putative virulence factors including neuraminidase, phospholipase c and the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin sordellilysin that are highly conserved between all strains studied.
a high quality genome sequence reveals putative virulence factors whose role in virulence can be investigated.
many strains do not contain the lcc genes; it is probable that in several of these cases the plasmid has been lost upon laboratory subculture.
although all strains originated from animal or clinical disease, only  <dig> strains contained lcc genes:  <dig> strains contain tcsl alone and one strain contains tcsl and tcsh.
where present, tcsl and tcsh were localised in a pathogenicity locus, similar to but distinct from that present in c. difficile.
in contrast to c. difficile, where the lccs are chromosomally localised, the c. sordellii tcsl and tcsh genes are localised on plasmids.
clostridium sordellii can cause severe infections in animals and humans, the latter associated with trauma, toxic shock and often-fatal gynaecological infections.

our data suggest gain and loss of entire toxigenic plasmids in addition to horizontal transfer of the pathogenicity locus.
phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequences of  <dig> strains isolated from human and animal infections in the uk, us and australia placed the species into four clades.
strains can produce two large clostridial cytotoxins , tcsl and tcsh, related to those produced by clostridium difficile, clostridium novyi and clostridium perfringens, but the genetic basis of toxin production remains uncharacterised.
