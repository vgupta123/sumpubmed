here we describe creation of the pblic plasmid, and demonstrate successful cloning and protein overexpression from three different cdnas, bax, catalase, and p <dig> through transduction into the human prostate cancer cell line, lncap or the human lung cancer line, h <dig>
our results show that pblic vector retains the high transduction efficiency of the original pbabe while eliminating the requirement for checking individual cdna inserts for internal restriction sites.
cloning vectors capable of retroviral transduction have enabled stable gene overexpression in numerous mitotic cell lines.
utilizing ligation-independent cloning  technology, we have modified the highly efficient retroviral transduction vector, pbabe, to eliminate reliance on restriction enzymes for cloning.
to our knowledge, pblic is the first lic vector for retroviral transduction-mediated stable gene expression in mammalian cells.
instead, the modified plasmid, pblic, utilizes random 12/13-base overhangs generated by t <dig> dna polymerase 3' exonuclease activity.
