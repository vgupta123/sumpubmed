bifidobacteria are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract.
bifidobacteria contribute to the establishment of healthy intestinal ecology and can confer health benefits to their host.
these results showed that proteomic analysis can be valuable for investigating differences in bifidobacterial species and may provide a better understanding of the diversity of bifidobacteria and their potential use as probiotics.
in full-term newborns, these bacteria are acquired from the mother during delivery and rapidly become the predominant organisms in the intestinal microbiota.
our objective was to compare three human b. longum isolates with the sequenced model strain b. longum ncc <dig> at the chromosome and proteome levels.
consequently, there is growing interest in bifidobacteria, and various strains are currently used as probiotic components in functional food products.
the  <dig> spots represented  <dig> proteins, most of which were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall or cell membrane synthesis.
notably, the protein patterns were correlated with differences in cell membrane properties like surface hydrophobicity and cell agglutination.
using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we analyzed qualitative differences in the cytosolic protein patterns.
