full characterization of promoters of dna repair genes and the similarities among them will more fully elucidate the regulatory networks that activate or inhibit their expression.
to address this goal, the authors introduce a technique to find regulatory genomic signatures, which represents a specific application of the genomic signature methodology to classify dna sequences as putative functional elements within a single organism.
these genes produce a large network of interacting proteins whose mrna expression is likely to be regulated by similar regulatory factors.
the effectiveness of the regulatory genomic signatures is demonstrated via analysis of promoter sequences for genes in dna repair pathways of humans.
in addition to providing an effective characterization method for related dna sequences, the signatures elucidate putative regulatory aspects of dna repair pathways, which are notably under-characterized.
the promoters are divided into two classes, the bidirectional promoters and the unidirectional promoters, and distinct genomic signatures are calculated for each class.
dna repair genes provide an important contribution towards the surveillance and repair of dna damage.
moreover, the signatures of the bidirectional and unidirectional promoters of human dna repair pathways are clearly distinct, exhibiting virtually no overlap.
the genomic signatures include statistically overrepresented words, word clusters, and co-occurring words.
