since carbohydrate active enzymes  in plants are responsible for the synthesis, modification and degradation of carbohydrate biopolymers, the differences in gene copy number and regulation between woody and herbaceous species have been highlighted previously.
the stoichiometric conservation of gene expression in woody and non-woody tissues of eucalyptus and populus are indicative of gene balance preservation.
cazyme domain ratio across embryophytes is maintained, and the diversity of cazyme domains is similar in all land plants, regardless of woody habit.
carbohydrate metabolism is a key feature of vascular plant architecture, and is of particular importance in large woody species, where lignocellulosic biomass is responsible for bearing the bulk of the stem and crown.
in addition, we compared the diversity and levels of cazyme gene expression during wood formation in trees using mrna-seq data from two distantly related angiosperm tree species eucalyptus grandis and populus trichocarpa, highlighting the major cazyme classes involved in xylogenesis and lignocellulosic biomass production.
