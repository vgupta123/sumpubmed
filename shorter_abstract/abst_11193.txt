we also introduce a second dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates a priori knowledge to identify and quantify positive signals in these datasets.
brdu-ip-chip experiments map large, recently replicated genomic regions and have similar characteristics to histone modification/location data.
to prepare such data for downstream analysis we employ a dynamic programming algorithm that identifies a set of putative unenriched probes, which we use for both within-array and between-array normalization.
highly enriched ip-chip datasets are often difficult to analyze with traditional array normalization and analysis strategies.
chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling arrays  has been employed to examine features such as protein binding and histone modifications on a genome-wide scale in a variety of cell types.
