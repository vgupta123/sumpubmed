the new functionalities of our bisulfite aligner and caller make it a fast and memory efficient tool, useful to analyze big datasets with little computational resources, to easily process target enrichment data, and produce statistics such as protocol efficiency and coverage as a function of the distance from target regions.
further challenges arise both during and after the alignment phase: data structures used by the aligner should be fast and should fit into main memory, and the methylation-caller output should be somehow compressed, due to its significant size.
as far as data structures employed to align bisulfite-treated reads are concerned, solutions proposed in the literature can be roughly grouped into two main categories: those storing pointers at each text position , and those using the information-theoretic minimum number of bits .
in this paper, we try to close this gap proposing a data structure for aligning bisulfite-treated reads which is at the same time fast, light, and very accurate.
aligning bisulfite-treated reads, however, is a computationally difficult task: bisulfite treatment decreases the  complexity of low-methylated genomic regions, and c-to-t mismatches may reflect cytosine unmethylation rather than snps or sequencing errors.
experimental results on public and simulated wgbs libraries show that our algorithmic solution is a competitive tradeoff between hash-based and bwt-based indexes, being as fast and accurate as the former, and as memory-efficient as the latter.
