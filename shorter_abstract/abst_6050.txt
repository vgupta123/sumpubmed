the vast amount of publicly available biomedical literature contains rich side effect information for drugs at all clinical stages.
we have developed an efficient and effective drug safety signal ranking and strengthening approach we demonstrate that large-scale combining information from faers and biomedical literature can significantly contribute to drug safety surveillance.
we then compared these different ranking algorithms before and after they were boosted with signals from medline sentences or abstracts.
finally, we manually curated all drug-cardiovascular  pairs that appeared in both data sources and investigated whether our approach can detect many true signals that have not been included in fda drug labels.
we showed by manual curation that drug-se pairs that appeared in both data sources were highly enriched with true signals, many of which have not yet been included in fda drug labels.
we extracted a total of  <dig> , <dig> drug-se pairs from faers with a low initial precision of  <dig> .
independent data sources can be used to augment post-marketing drug safety signal detection.
in this study, we present a large-scale signal boosting approach that combines over  <dig> million records in the us food and drug administration  adverse event reporting system  and over  <dig> million biomedical articles.
