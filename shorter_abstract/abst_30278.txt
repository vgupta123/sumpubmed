information provided by the male pheromone appears critical for female acceptance.
furthermore, male signals may allow species discrimination and reinforce reproductive isolation.
finally, we found evidence for a genetic correlation between male and female signals, the evolution of which is best explained by the constraints and opportunities resulting from the sharing of gene products.
evolutionary mechanisms such as sexual selection and sexual conflict have led to the elaboration of traits to gain attention and favours from potential partners.
moth display traits – pheromones – constitute an advantageous model with which to address questions about the evolution of mating systems in animals.
hence, in systems where both sexes possess display traits, the pleiotropy of genes generating the traits could influence the evolutionary trajectories of sexual signals and lead to their divergence, with speciation being the ultimate result.
female and male pheromones appear to have different origins and to be under different evolutionary constraints, thus they might be envisioned as independently evolving traits.
we conducted laboratory experiments to explore the role of scents released during courtship by males of the european corn borer, ostrinia nubilalis.
the composition of this male pheromone varies in an age-dependent manner and females show mating preference towards older males in choice experiments.
