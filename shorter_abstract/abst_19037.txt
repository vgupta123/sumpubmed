one way to study gene function is to investigate the alterations in the responses of deletion mutants to different stimuli.
we show that a previously uncharacterized orf, ybr261c, affects the process of protein synthesis and reaffirm that large-scale genetic profile analysis can be a useful tool to study novel gene function.
the remaining strains can be divided into smaller functional categories: metabolism , cellular component biogenesis and organization , dna maintenance , transport , others  and unknown .
phenotypic suppression analysis using tae <dig> overexpression also links tae <dig> to protein synthesis.
here we investigate the genetic profile of yeast non-essential gene deletion array  for increased sensitivity to paromomycin, which targets the process of protein synthesis.
they may also represent novel links to protein synthesis.
functional genomics has received considerable attention in the post-genomic era, as it aims to identify function for different genes.
one of these strains carries a deletion for a previously uncharacterized orf, ybr261c, that we term tae <dig> for translation associated element  <dig>  our focused follow-up experiments indicated that deletion of tae <dig> alters the ribosomal profile of the mutant cells.
also, gene deletion strain for tae <dig> has defects in both translation efficiency and fidelity.
these may represent minor cellular target sites  for paromomycin.
as expected, our analysis indicated that the majority of deletion strains  with increased sensitivity to paromomycin, are involved in protein biosynthesis.
