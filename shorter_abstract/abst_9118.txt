it is also one of the key embryonic stem cell factors that, when overexpressed can convert somatic cells into induced pluripotent cells.
finally, we found that a mutant form of sox <dig> that was unable to bind groucho was no longer able to inhibit differentiation of neural stem cells to the same extent as the wild type protein.
we found that sox <dig> interacts directly with members of the groucho family of corepressors and that repression of several target genes required this interaction.
although generally studied as a transcriptional activator, recent evidence suggests that it might also repress gene expression.
the transcription factor, sox <dig>  is central to the behaviour of neural stem cells.
we show that in neural stem cells sox <dig> represses as many genes as it activates.

strikingly, where many of the genes activated by sox <dig> encode transcriptional regulators, no such genes were repressed.
