in order to profile the microtranscriptome of arabidopsis thaliana leaf and callus tissues in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide , small rna libraries were constructed at  <dig> and 3 h post induction with lps and sequenced by illumina sequencing technology.
small rna reads were mapped to the mirna database and  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families in the callus tissues and  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families in the leaf tissues were identified.
moreover, target genes for all the identified mirnas families in the leaf tissues and  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas families in the callus tissues were predicted.
the sequencing analysis showed that in both callus and leaf tissues, various stress regulated-mirnas were differentially expressed and real time pcr validated the expression profile of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> along with their target genes.
a. thaliana callus and leaf callus tissues respond to lps as a microbe-associated molecular pattern molecule through dynamic changes to the microtranscriptome associated with differential transcriptional regulation in support of immunity and basal resistance.
mirnas regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by translational repression or target degradation of specific mrnas and gene silencing.

micrornas  are non-coding rna molecules which have recently emerged as important gene regulators in plants and their gene expression analysis is becoming increasingly important.
