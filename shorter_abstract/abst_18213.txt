here we present a novel assay for assessing the quality of directly labeled fluorescent cdna prior to microarray hybridization utilizing the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, which employs microfluidic technology for the analysis of nucleic acids and proteins.
furthermore, an rna of reasonable quality still may not yield reliable hybridization data if the labeling efficiency was poor.
