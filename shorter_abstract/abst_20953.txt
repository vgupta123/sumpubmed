the method employed by ssmap differs from the other mapping resources in that it stresses on the correct reconstruction of the pdb sequence from structures, and on the correct attribution of a uniprotkb entry to each pdb chain by using a series of post-processing steps.
ssmap was compared to other existing mapping resources in terms of the correctness of the attribution of pdb chains to uniprotkb entries, and of the quality of the pairwise alignments supporting the residue-residue mapping.
ssmap mapping is currently used to provide pdb cross-references in uniprotkb.
the primary objective of this mapping is not only to facilitate the two tasks mentioned above, but also to palliate a number of shortcomings of existent mappings.
in this study, ssmap – a new uniprot-pdb residue-residue level mapping – was generated.
the systematic comparison conducted in this study allows the further identification of general problems in uniprot-pdb mappings so that both the coverage and the quality of the mappings can be systematically improved for the benefit of the scientific community.
new and alternative mappings proposed by ssmap were mostly good as assessed by manual verification of data subsets.
however, it is not always straightforward for users to gather information concurrently from the sequence and structure levels.
