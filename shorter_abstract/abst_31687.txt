its strains comprise two mutually-exclusive toxin chemotypes, one producing satratoxins, which are a subclass of trichothecenes, and the other producing the less-toxic atranones.
one such satratoxin chemotype-specific cluster is adjacent to the core trichothecene cluster, which has diverged from those of other trichothecene producers to contain a unique polyketide synthase.
to determine the genetic basis for chemotype-specific differences in toxin production, the genomes of four stachybotrys strains were sequenced and assembled de novo.
the results suggest that chemotype-specific gene clusters are likely the genetic basis for the mutually-exclusive toxin chemotypes of stachybotrys.
the largest, which was named the core atranone cluster, encodes  <dig> proteins that may suffice to produce all observed atranone compounds via reactions that include an unusual baeyer-villiger oxidation.
satratoxins are suggested to be made by products of multiple gene clusters that encode  <dig> proteins in all, including polyketide synthases, acetyltransferases, and other enzymes expected to modify the trichothecene skeleton.
comparative analysis of these four 35-mbp genomes revealed several chemotype-specific gene clusters that are predicted to make secondary metabolites.
