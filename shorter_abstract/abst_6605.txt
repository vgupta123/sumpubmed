active binding sites can be seen as peaks in enrichment profiles when the sequencing reads are mapped to a reference genome.
we present the triform algorithm, an improved approach to automatic peak finding in chip-seq enrichment profiles for transcription factors.
triform outperforms several existing methods in the identification of representative peak profiles in curated benchmark data sets.
finally, we show that triform can be used to generate novel information on transcription factor binding in repeat regions, which represents a particular challenge in many chip-seq experiments.
the method uses model-free statistics to identify peak-like distributions of sequencing reads, taking advantage of improved peak definition in combination with known characteristics of chip-seq data.
chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing  is the most frequently used method to identify the binding sites of transcription factors.
we also show that triform in many cases is able to identify peaks that are more consistent with biological function, compared with other methods.
the triform algorithm has been implemented in r, and is available via http://tare.medisin.ntnu.no/triform.
