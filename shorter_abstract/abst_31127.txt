for a real clinical data set, rma and mbei showed significant correlation for absent genes.
in a large collection of genes, a random pair of genes should have on average zero correlation, hence allowing a correlation test.
the choice of technique has a profound effect on subsequent statistical analyses, but there is no method to assess whether a particular technique is appropriate for a specific data set, without reference to external data.
in the absence of a known gold-standard, the correlation criterion allows us to assess the appropriateness of low-level processing of a specific data set and the success of normalization for subsets of genes.
