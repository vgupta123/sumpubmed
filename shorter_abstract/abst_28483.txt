existing splicing-aware aligners that rely on the read-count method in identifying junction sites are inevitably affected by sequencing depths.
many existing aligners are capable of mapping millions of sequencing reads onto a reference genome.
for reads that can be mapped to multiple positions along the reference genome , these aligners may either randomly assign them to a location, or discard them altogether.
gt models that combine sequence similarity from alignment, and together with the probability of length distribution, could accurately determine the location of both multireads and spliced reads.
meanwhile, challenges remain in the alignment of reads spanning across splice junctions.
we here proposed a new method that employs an empirical geometric-tail  distribution of intron lengths to make a rational choice in multireads selection and splice-sites detection, according to the aligned distances from pe and sliced reads.
