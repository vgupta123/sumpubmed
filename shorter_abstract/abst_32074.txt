for this purpose, we generated g <dig> populations of reciprocal crosses between the two hypermuscular mouse lines bmmi <dig>  which carries a myostatin mutation and is lean, and bmmi <dig>  which has high intramuscular and body fat content.
a large proportion of variation of intramuscular fat content of the m. longissimus at the myostatin locus could be explained by sex  and direction-of-cross effects .
linkage analyses confirmed the influence of the myostatin mutation on higher lean mass , reduced body fat content , and lower imf in m. longissimus  and m. quadriceps .
this study is aimed at the analysis of genetic and physiological effects of myostatin on economically relevant meat quality traits in a genetic background of high muscularity.
to assess the relationship between muscle mass, body composition and muscle quality traits, we also analysed intramuscular fat content , water holding capacity , and additional physiological parameters in m. quadriceps and m. longissimus in  <dig> g3-animals.
an additional locus with negative over-dominance effects on total fat mass  was identified on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig> mb  which concurs with fat related qtl in syntenic regions on ssc <dig> in pigs and bta <dig> in cattle.
new information from the mouse model helps to describe variation in meat quantity and quality, and thus contribute to research in livestock.
in males, higher muscle mass was also significantly correlated with higher glycogen contents  and lower carcass ph-values  <dig> hours after dissection .
the data shows qtl effects on mouse muscle that are similar to those previously observed in livestock, supporting the mouse model.
