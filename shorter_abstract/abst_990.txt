we asked how the mitochondrial localization signal, the transmembrane domain, and the kinase domain participate in pink <dig> localization.
we also showed that pink <dig> dual subcellular distribution requires both hsp <dig> interaction with the kinase domain and the proteolysis at a cleavage site downstream of the transmembrane domain because removal of this cleavage site completely abolished cytosolic pink <dig>  in addition, the disruption of the hsp90-pink <dig> interaction increased mitochondrial pink <dig> level.
together, we believe that once pink <dig> enters the mitochondria, pink <dig> adopts a tethered topology because the transmembrane domain and the kinase domain prevent pink <dig> forward movement into the mitochondria.
subsequent proteolysis downstream of the transmembrane domain then releases pink <dig> for retrograde movement while pink <dig> kinase domain interacts with hsp <dig> chaperone.
the significance of this dual localization could mean that pink <dig> has compartmental-specific functions.
we confirmed that pink <dig> mitochondrial targeting signal is responsible for mitochondrial localization.
the mechanism of how pink <dig> achieves cytosolic localization following mitochondrial processing remains unknown.
once inside the mitochondria, we found that both pink <dig> transmembrane and kinase domain are important for membrane tethering and cytosolic-facing topology.
