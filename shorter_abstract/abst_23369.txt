we performed a genome-wide association study  in prt including  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls and found a statistically strong signal in the genomic region on dog chromosome  <dig>  where kcnj <dig> is located.
spinocerebellar ataxia also referred to as hereditary ataxia comprises different forms of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.
recently, the missense mutation kcnj10:c.627c > g was shown to be associated with the spinocerebellar ataxia  in jrt and related russell group of terriers, whereas the missense mutation capn1:c.344g > a was associated with late onset ataxia  in prt.
in silico analysis showed that this indel may influence the regulation of gene expression.
a complex mode of inheritance was most likely in parson russell terriers  and in jack russell terriers .
in the present study, 16/ <dig> cases of hereditary ataxia perfectly co-segregated with the kcnj10:c.627c > g mutation.
breeders have to be aware that dna-testing for hereditary ataxia in prt and jrt does not capture all cases of hereditary ataxia in these dog breeds.
at least one further form of hereditary ataxia not yet resolved by a mutation may occur in prt and jrt.

we tested the capn1:c.344g > a and kcnj10:c.627c > g  mutations in a sample of  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt from germany as well as further  <dig> controls from  <dig> different dog breeds.
