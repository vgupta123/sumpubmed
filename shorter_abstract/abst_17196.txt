taken together, these results suggest that fgf <dig> may play a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the bbb during the progress of hiv associated cerebral endothelial cell damage.
the cytotoxic hiv protein, gp <dig>  damages endothelial cells of the bbb, thereby compromising its integrity, which may lead to migration of hiv-infected cells into the brain.
we hypothesized that treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  with fgf <dig> would protect the cells from gp120-mediated toxicity via endothelial cell survival signalling.
exposure of huvec to gp <dig> resulted in dose- and time-dependent cell death; whereas, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with fgf <dig> protected cells from gp <dig> angiotoxicity.
