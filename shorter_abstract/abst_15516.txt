however, denoising processing in the frequency domain is a better solution for preserving edge sharpness.
it has been used to image the molecular surface of membrane proteins at a lateral resolution of one nanometer or less.
noise removal can be performed in either spatial or frequency domain.
to better interpret structures at a sub-domain level, pre-processing of afm images for removing stripe noises is necessary.
this program adopts a divide-and-conquer approach by dividing the fourier spectrum of the image into central and off-center regions for noisy pixels detection and intensity restoration; it is also applicable to other images interfered with high-density stripes such as those acquired by the scanning electron microscope.
it allows extracting extended information from the topographic measurements and implicitly enhances the molecular features in the image.
an immediate obstacle of characterizing surface features in afm images is stripe noise.
all the presented images were processed by destripe with the raw image as the only input without any requirement for other prior information.
atomic force microscopy  is a relatively recently developed technique that shows a promising impact in the field of structural biology and biophysics.
the destripe denoising effect on afm images is illustrated in the present work.
we have developed a denoising protocol, called destripe, for afm bio-molecular images that are contaminated with heavy and fine stripes.
