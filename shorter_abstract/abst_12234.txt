distinct protein spots in the beer and wort proteomes were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and ms/ms and revealed common beer proteins, such as lipid transfer proteins , protein z and amylase-protease inhibitors.
these three proteins, all derived from yeast, were identified as cell wall associated proteins, that is exg <dig> , bgl <dig> , and uth <dig> .
in this study, changes of the proteome of immature beer, i.e.
both immature beers had the same alcohol and protein concentrations.
immature beer and unfermented wort proteins were analysed by 2-de and compared in order to determine protein changes arising from fermentation.
yeast strain dependent changes in the immature beer proteome were identified, i.e.
during fermentation, two protein spots, corresponding to ltp <dig>  disappeared, while three protein spots were exclusively found in beer.
beers were fermented from standard hopped wort  using two ale brewer’s yeast  strains with different attenuation degrees.
beer that has not been matured after fermentation, by ale brewer’s yeast strains with different abilities to degrade fermentable sugars were investigated.
however, the influence of brewer’s yeast on the protein composition of beer is currently unknown.
