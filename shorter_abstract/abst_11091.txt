although the responses to many pathogen associated molecular patterns  in cell cultures and extracted organs are well characterized, there is little known of transcriptome responses to pamps in whole organisms.
to characterize this in detail, we have performed rnaseq analysis of responses of zebrafish embryos to injection of pamps in the caudal vein at one hour after exposure.
remarkably, in the pam3csk <dig> specific set, there was a set of transcription factors with more than  <dig> fold-change, as confirmed by qpcr analyses, including cebpb, fosb, nr4a <dig> and egr <dig>  we also showed that the regulation of the pam3csk <dig> and flagellin specifically responding sets is inhibited by knockdown of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  respectively.
