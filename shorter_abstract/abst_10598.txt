the developed method identified all previously known mosaic abnormalities reported in snp array data obtained from controls, bladder cancer and hapmap individuals.
mosaicism for copy number and copy neutral chromosomal rearrangements has been recently identified as a relatively common source of genetic variation in the normal population.
in addition mad tool was able to detect new mosaic variants not reported before that were smaller in size and with lower percentage of cells affected.
our work suggests that the prevalence of mosaic alterations could be higher than initially thought.
our results confirm the lack of sensitivity of former methods by identifying new mosaic variants not reported in previously utilised datasets.
however its prevalence is poorly defined since it has been only studied systematically in one large-scale study and by using non optimal ad-hoc snp array data analysis tools, uncovering rather large alterations  and affecting a high proportion of cells.
the use of appropriate snp array data analysis methods would help in defining the human genome mosaic map.
the tool presented here has the ability to identify mosaic abnormalities with high sensitivity and specificity.
the performance of the tool was analysed by studying simulated data for different scenarios.
our method showed high sensitivity and specificity for all assessed scenarios.
