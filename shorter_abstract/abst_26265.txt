bbp-a is an avidin-like protein having a β-barrel fold and high affinity towards btn.
furthermore, the solved structures of the bbp-a – btn and bbp-a – bso complexes, which share the fold with the members of the avidin and lipocalin protein families, are extremely similar to each other.
however, bbp-a differs from the other known members of the avidin protein family in thermal stability and immunological properties.
the bbp-a recombinant protein was expressed using two different expression systems and purified with affinity chromatography, biochemically characterized and two x-ray structures were solved – in complex with d-biotin  and in complex with d-biotin d-sulfoxide .
the bbp-a protein binds free biotin with high, "streptavidin-like" affinity , which is about  <dig> times lower than that of chicken avidin.
