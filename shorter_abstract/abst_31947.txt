basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain transcription factors have been shown to specify all different neuronal cell subtypes composing the vertebrate retina.
the appearance of gene paralogs of such retina-specific transcription factors in lower vertebrates, with differently evolved function and/or conserved non-coding elements, might provide an important source for the generation of neuronal diversity within the vertebrate retinal architecture.
zebrafish has three barhl paralogs: barhl <dig> , barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig>  but their precise spatio-temporal retinal expression, as well as their function is yet unknown.
finally, we found that the two retained medaka fish barhl paralogs, barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  are both expressed in the retina, in a pattern reminiscent of zebrafish barhl <dig>  and barhl <dig> respectively.
our findings provide a starting point for the study of barhl gene evolution in relation to the generation of cell diversity in the vertebrate retina.
functional differences among retained paralogs of key retina-specific transcription factors between teleosts and tetrapods might provide important clues for understanding their potential impact on the generation of retinal neuronal diversity.
by performing phylogenetic and synteny analysis, we provide evidence that barhl retinal expression domain is an ancestral feature, probably lost in tetrapods due to functional redundancy.
in line with this hypothesis, we investigated the evolution of the homeobox barhl family of transcription factors, barhl <dig> and barhl <dig>  in the teleost and tetrapod lineages.
here we performed a meticulous expression pattern comparison of all known barhl fish paralogs and described a novel barhl paralog in medaka.
