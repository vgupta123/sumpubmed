we find extensive genetic variation in doe, with a 15 % difference in rate between the slowest and fastest strains measured, and 89 % of phenotypic variation due to dgrp strain.
however, while genetic variation underlying simpler morphological traits, or with large phenotypic effects is well described in the literature, less is known about the underlying genetics of traits, such as doe, partly due to a lack of tools with which to study them.
here, we establish a novel microscope-based assay to survey genetic variation for the duration of embryogenesis .

using sequence information from the dgrp, we perform a genome-wide association study, which suggests that some well-known developmental genes affect the speed of embryonic development.
further functional assays, or transcriptomic analysis of embryos from the dgrp, can validate the role of our candidates in early developmental processes.
we showed that the duration of embryogenesis  can be efficiently and precisely measured in drosophila, and that the dgrp strains show remarkable variation in doe.
our assay greatly simplifies the measurement of doe, making it possible to precisely quantify this trait for  <dig>  individual embryos .
