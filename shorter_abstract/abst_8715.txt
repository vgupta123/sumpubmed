the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins in the crude translation reaction mixture was unaffected by treatment with mg <dig>  suggesting that our system does not contain 26s proteasome-dependent protein degradation activity.
in our luminescent method using flag- or his-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitins, the polyubiquitin chain on atubc <dig>  upl <dig> and upl <dig>  and cip <dig>  was detected.
furthermore, screening of the ring  <dig> subgroup demonstrated that at1g <dig> was capable of polyubiquitin chain formation like cip <dig>  interestingly, these ubiquitinations were carried out without the addition of exogenous e <dig> and/or e <dig> proteins, indicating that these enzymes were endogenous to the wheat cell-free system.
these proteins were analyzed either in the translation mixture or purified recombinant protein from the translation mixture.
polyubiquitination of target proteins is also implicated in several critical cellular processes.
in this study, we developed a simple wheat cell-free based luminescence method that could be a powerful tool for comprehensive ubiquitination analysis.
here we demonstrate a novel, simple and high-sensitive method for in vitro analysis of ubiquitination and polyubiquitination based on wheat cell-free protein synthesis and luminescent detection.
using wheat cell-free synthesis,  <dig> e <dig> proteins from arabidopsis full-length cdna templates were produced.
also, binding of ubiquitin to these proteins was detected using biotinylated ubiquitin and flag-tagged recombinant protein.
