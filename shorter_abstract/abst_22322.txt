"open" transcriptome analysis methods allow to study gene expression without a priori knowledge of the transcript sequences.
in contrast to longsage, the high throughput sequencing method used in mpss enables the rapid sequencing of very large libraries containing several millions of tags, allowing deep transcriptome analysis.
we found that solexa sequencing technology combined with longsage is perfectly suited for deep transcriptome analysis.
as of now, sage , longsage and mpss  are the mostly used methods for "open" transcriptome analysis.
in order to make a deep analysis of mouse hypothalamus transcriptome avoiding the limitation introduced by mpss, we combined longsage with the solexa sequencing technology and obtained a library of more than  <dig> millions of tags.
we then compared it to a longsage library of mouse hypothalamus sequenced with the sanger method.
in contrast to mpss, it gives a complex representation of transcriptome as reliable as a longsage library sequenced by the sanger method.
