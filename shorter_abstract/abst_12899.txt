the earthworm fibronectinase  cleaved fn at four sites, r <dig>  r <dig>  k <dig> and r <dig>  among which the digested fragments at r <dig>  k <dig> and r <dig> were related to the virus-binding activity as reported.
the serum fn was significantly decreased when the earthworm fibronectinase was orally administrated to rats.
the earthworm fibronectinase  cleaves fn much faster than the other proteins in serum, showing a potential to inhibit hbv infection through its suppressing the level of hbeag.
therefore, to investigate a protease that hydrolyzes fn rapidly is useful to decrease the fn concentration in blood and hbv infection.
it has been reported that a high concentration of fn in blood improves the transmission frequency of hepatitis viruses.
the cleavage sites were determined by n-terminus amino acid residues sequencing.
the cleavage sites on fn by the fnase were at r and k, exhibiting a trypsin alkaline serine-like function.
this suggests that efnase is probably used as one of the candidates for the therapeutic agents to treat hepatitis virus infection.
the elisa results showed that the secretion of hbeag from hepg <dig> .
virus-binding activity is one of the important functions of fibronectin .
we employed a purified earthworm protease to digest serum proteins.
the protease was orally administrated to rats to investigate whether serum fn in vivo became decreased.
the serum fn was determined by western blotting and elisa.
the rapidly cleaved protein  was identified by maldi-tof ms and western blotting.
