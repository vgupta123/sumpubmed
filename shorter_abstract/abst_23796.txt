viable cells of the  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h biofilms were counted.
l.gg, c. albicans, s. mutans and f. nucleatum, with poor ability to grow in mono-species biofilms demonstrated better abilities of adhesion and reproduction in dual- and/or multi-species biofilms.
l.gg slightly suppressed the growth of c. albicans in all groups, markedly weakened the growth of s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum in 4sp + l.gg group, and slightly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans in l.gg+ s. mutans group.
to conclude, in this in vitro model l.gg successfully integrated in all oral biofilms, and reduced the counts of s. sanguinis and c. albicans and lowered the biofilm-forming ability of f. nucleatum, but only slightly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans.
our results showed that l.gg and s. mutans demonstrated stronger adhesion ability than the other strains to saliva-coated ha discs.
this study aimed to investigate in vitro the ability of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  to integrate in oral biofilm and affect its species composition.
c. albicans significantly promoted the growth of l.gg.
probiotics have shown favourable properties in maintaining oral health.

cell suspensions of six strains were pooled according to the group setup.
