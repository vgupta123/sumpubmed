this can be achieved by covalently linking short, unique "barcode" dna segments to genomic dna samples, for instance through incorporation of barcode sequences in pcr primers.
although several strategies have been described to insure that barcode sequences are unique and robust to sequencing errors, these have not been integrated into the overall primer design process, thus potentially introducing bias into pcr amplification and/or sequencing steps.
the program bartab can be used to deconvolute dna sequence datasets produced by the use of multiple barcoded primers.
an increasingly popular means of increasing project throughput is by multiplexing samples during the sequencing phase.
