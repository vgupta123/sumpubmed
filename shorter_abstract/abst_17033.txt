moreover, our study distinguishes between homologous exchanges of the entire aur gene  between divergent s. aureus lineages and recombination events within aur genes.
gene trees constructed from aur and concatenated mlst genes revealed several putative assortative recombination events  between divergent lineages of s. aureus.
despite the importance of aureolysin in the physiology and pathogenesis of s. aureus, relatively little information was so far available concerning the aur gene diversity and mobility within and between the major subdivisions of the s. aureus population.
sequence analyses support the conclusion that the aur gene occurs in two distinct types of related sequences.
the aur gene was much more polymorphic but, at the same time, showed higher purifying selection than genes utilized for multilocus sequence typing .
evidence for intragenic recombination events  across aur genes was also found.
although numerous nucleotide differences were identified between the aur alleles studied, our findings showed that a strong purifying selection is acting on the aur gene.
the biochemical properties and substrate specificity of the two types of aureolysin purified to homogeneity were studied, revealing minor differences in their affinity to low molecular weight synthetic substrates.
therefore, an epidemiologically and genetically diverse collection of s. aureus strains was used to determine the range of aureolysin  gene polymorphism.
