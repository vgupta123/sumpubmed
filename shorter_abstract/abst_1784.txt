the fidelity of dna synthesis by hiv- <dig> rt was approximately  <dig>  fold greater in zn2+ when compared to mg2+ at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis.
although zn2+ supports dna synthesis, it inhibits hiv rt by significantly modifying rt catalysis.
fidelity of dna polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors.
physiologically, mg2+ is used as a co-factor by hiv reverse transcriptase  to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including mn2+, co2+, and zn2+ can also support catalysis.
this study shows that zn2+, at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of hiv- <dig> rt and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.
however, surprisingly, the fidelity of hiv rt with mn2+ and co2+ remained similar to mg2+ at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis.
