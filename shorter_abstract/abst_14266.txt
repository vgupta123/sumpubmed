furthermore, easyexon can integrate with other related programs, such as integrate genome browser  and affymetrix power tools , to make the whole analysis more comprehensive.
in this study we present a java-based freeware, easyexon , to process, filtrate and visualize exon array data with an analysis pipeline.
we applied easyexon on a public accessible colon cancer dataset as an example to illustrate the analysis pipeline of this tool.
the possibility to study alternative splicing  events on a genomic scale using splicing-sensitive microarrays, including the affymetrix genechip exon  <dig>  st microarray , has appeared very recently.
easyexon can efficiently process and analyze the affymetrix exon array data.
however, the application of this new technology is hindered by the lack of free and user-friendly software devoted to these novel platforms.
