the mst-derived tree was similar to that based on mlsa and rpob gene sequencing and yielded three main clusters comprising each the type strain of the respective m. abscessus sub-species.
two isolates exhibited discordant mlsa- and rpob gene sequence-derived position, one isolate exhibited discordant mst- and rpob gene sequence-derived position and one isolate exhibited discordant mst- and mlsa-derived position.
the hunter-gaston index was off  <dig>  for mst and of  <dig>  for mlsa.
in this report, we describe the development of a multispacer sequence typing  analysis for the simultaneous identification and typing of m. abscessus mycobacteria.

mst and mlsa grouped 37 m. abscessus organisms into  <dig> and nine types, respectively; four formerly “m.
massiliense” organisms from other m. abscessus subsp.
mst is a new sequencing-based approach for both identifying and genotyping m. abscessus mycobacteria that clearly differentiates formerly “m.
mst spacer n° <dig> sequencing alone allowed for the accurate identification of the different isolates at the sub-species level.
based on the m. abscessus cip104536t genome, eight intergenic spacers were selected, pcr amplified and sequenced in 21 m. abscessus isolates and analysed in  <dig> available m. abscessus genomes.
