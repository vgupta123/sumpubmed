a significant majority of the collocations used by crystalp <dig> include residues with high conformational entropy, or low entropy and high potential to mediate crystal contacts; notably, such residues are utilized by surface entropy reduction methods.
this method utilizes the composition and collocation of amino acids, isoelectric point, and hydrophobicity, as estimated from the primary sequence, to generate predictions.
we show that the collocations provide complementary information to the hydrophobicity and isoelectric point.
our results also suggest that, as work in protein crystallization continues , the prediction quality of the crystalp <dig> method should increase.
crystalp <dig> extends its predecessor, crystalp, by enabling predictions for sequences of unrestricted size and provides improved prediction quality.
crystalp <dig> provides relatively accurate crystallization propensity predictions for a given protein chain that either outperform or complement the existing approaches.
we introduce crystalp <dig>  a kernel-based method that predicts the propensity of a given protein sequence to produce diffraction-quality crystals.
the proposed method can be used to support current efforts towards improving the success rate in obtaining diffraction-quality crystals.
current protocols yield crystals for <30% of known proteins, indicating that automatically identifying crystallizable proteins may improve high-throughput structural genomics efforts.
