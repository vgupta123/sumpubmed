herein, we employed an immunoaffinity-based enrichment approach combined with protein mass spectrometry and attempted to identify tip110-interacting cellular proteins.
tip <dig> plays important roles in tumor immunobiology, pre-mrna splicing, expression regulation of viral and host genes, and possibly protein turnover.
a hiv- <dig> ltr promoter-driven reporter gene assay and a cd <dig> minigene in vivo splicing assay were chosen to evaluate the functional relevance of the tip110/yb- <dig> interaction.
