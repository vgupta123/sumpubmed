in this work, newly released pilot data from the  <dig> genomes project is analyzed to detect previously unreported full length insertions of the retrotransposon line- <dig>  by direct analysis of the sequence data, we have identified  <dig> previously unreported line- <dig> insertion sites within the sequence data reported for a mother/father/daughter trio.
in humans, copies of the long interspersed nuclear element  <dig>  retrotransposon comprise 21% of the reference genome, and have been shown to modulate expression and produce novel splice isoforms of transcripts from genes that span or neighbor the line- <dig> insertion site.
