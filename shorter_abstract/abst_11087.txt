binding of mbp-prp to prp-specific sequences indicate that several specific self-interactions between individual prp molecules can occur and suggest that an array of interactions between prpc-prpc as well as prpc-prpsc may be possible, which ultimately lead to variations in species barrier and strain differences.
the first high binding area comprises sheep-prp peptides 43– <dig> , including the n-terminal octarepeats.
the common event in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  or prion diseases is the conversion of host-encoded protease sensitive cellular prion protein  into strain dependent isoforms of scrapie associated protease resistant isoform  of prion protein .
selective self-interaction between prp molecules is the most probable basis for initiation of these processes, potentially influenced by chaperone molecules, however the mechanisms behind these processes are far from understood.
comparison of ovine – and bovine peptide-array binding patterns revealed that amino acid specific differences can influence the mbp-prp binding pattern.
the peptide-arrays revealed two distinct high binding areas as well as some regions of lower affinity in prpc resulting in total in  <dig> distinct amino acid sequences .
prp-specific antibodies were capable to completely block interaction between the peptide-array and mbp-prp.
to this end, ovine – and bovine prp peptide-arrays consisting of 15-mer overlapping peptides were probed with recombinant sheep prpc fused to maltose binding protein .
