polymorphic sites showed a significantly clustered distribution, but the degree of snp clustering  did not vary among gene families, suggesting that clustering of polymorphisms is a general property of the an.
comparison of snps identified from pooled templates with those from individual sequences revealed a very low false positive rate.
association mapping approaches are dependent upon discovery and validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms .
we identified a total of  <dig> polymorphic features comprising  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels, with, on average, a snp every  <dig> bp; a high rate of polymorphism that is comparable to other studies of mosquitoes.
to further association studies in anopheles gambiae we conducted a major resequencing programme, primarily targeting regions within or close to candidate genes for insecticide resistance.
false negative rates were much higher and mostly resulted from snps with a low minor allele frequency.
