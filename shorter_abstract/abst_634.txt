despite a large number of small-scale dairy farms in addis ababa and its surrounding districts, little is known about the status of salmonella in these farms.
animal level prevalence of salmonella was significantly associated with age  and study location; it was highest among those under 6 months of age and in farms from adaa district and addis ababa .
the rate of occurrence of multi-drug resistance  in salmonella strains isolated from dairy farms in addis ababa was significantly higher than those isolated from farms outside of addis ababa .
consumption of contaminated dairy products and contact with dairy cattle represent a common source of non-typhoidal salmonella infection in humans.
out of  <dig> fecal samples examined,  <dig> were positive for salmonella resulting in a weighted animal level prevalence of  <dig>  %.
detection of diarrhea in an animal and in a farm was significantly associated with animal level  and herd level  prevalence of salmonella.
the most frequently recovered serotypes were salmonella typhimurium , s. saintpaul , s. kentucky  and s. virchow .
mdr was more common in s. kentucky, s. virchow and s. saintpaul.
salmonella was recovered from the feces of at least one animal in  <dig>  %  of the dairy farms.
isolation of salmonella serotypes commonly known for causing human salmonellosis that are associated with an mdr phenotype in dairy farms in close proximity with human population is a major public health concern.
nine different serotypes were identified using standard serological agglutination tests.
