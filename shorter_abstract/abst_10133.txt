consistently, blocking the erk1/ <dig> pathway with u <dig>  the selective inhibitor of the erk upstream mitogen-activated protein -erk kinase , results in a dramatic reduction  of the capability of hp to induce monocyte migration.
in an effort to elucidate the biological significance of hp presence in the wat and of its upregulation in obesity we formulated the hypothesis that hp may serve as a macrophage chemoattractant.
we demonstrated by chemotaxis assay that hp is able to attract chemokine  receptor  <dig> -transfected pre-b lymphocytes and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
haptoglobin  is an inflammatory marker and its expression is induced in the wat of obese subjects.
our data show that hp is a novel monocyte chemoattractant and that its chemotactic potential is mediated, at least in part.
obesity is a chronic low inflammatory state.
