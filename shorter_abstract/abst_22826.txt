however, validation of database search results creates a bottleneck in ms/ms data processing.
recently, methods based on a randomized database have become popular for quality control of database search results.
in this paper, a multivariate nonlinear discriminate function  based on the multivariate nonparametric density estimation technique was used to filter out false-positive database search results with a predictable false positive rate .
this nonparametric statistical technique is a powerful tool for tackling the complexity and diversity of datasets in shotgun proteomics.
analysis of complex samples with tandem mass spectrometry  has become routine in proteomic research.
however, a consequent problem is the ignorance of how to combine different database search scores to improve the sensitivity of randomized database methods.
application of this method to control datasets of different instruments  yielded an estimated fpr close to the actual fpr.
using the nonparametric model, a more flexible df can be obtained, resulting in improved sensitivity and good fpr estimation.
