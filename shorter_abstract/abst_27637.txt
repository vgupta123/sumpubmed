whereas t cell receptors  detect peptide/major histocompatibility complexes  with exquisite specificity, there are challenges regarding their expression and use as soluble detection molecules due to molecular instability.
in others, the complete extracellular part of the tcr was fused either to a complete ig or an ig fc region.
molecules that included the complete heterodimeric tcr, with a stabilizing disulfide bridge, were correctly folded as they bound tcr-specific antibodies  and detected pmhc on cells after specific peptide loading.
in the absence of further affinity maturation, the reagents will be very useful for the detection of kinetic stability of complexes of peptide and mhc.
in one, the tcr v domains were fused to ig constant  regions.
all molecules were initially poorly secreted from eukaryotic cells, but replacement of unfavourable amino acids in the v regions improved secretion, as did the introduction of a disulfide bridge between the tcr c domains and the removal of an unpaired cysteine.
two different tcrs that are characteristic of a mouse model for idiotype  dependent immune regulation were engineered.
we show that fully functional tcr-ig fusion proteins can be made in good yields following stabilizing engineering of tcr v and c region genes.
