a new receptor, sspaqr <dig> , was identified as interacting with sporothrix schenckii g protein alpha subunit ssg- <dig> in a yeast two-hybrid assay.
this work describes a receptor associated with a g protein alpha subunit in s. schenckii belonging to the paqr family.
progesterone inhibited the growth of both the yeast and mycelium forms of the fungus, with the yeast form being the most affected by the hormone.
these receptors have the seven transmembrane domains characteristic of g-protein coupled receptors, but their activity has not been associated directly to g proteins.
protein domain analysis of sspaqr <dig> showed the  <dig> transmembrane domains  characteristic of g protein coupled receptors and the presence of the distinctive motifs that characterize paqrs.
adaptive responses in fungi result from the interaction of membrane receptors and extracellular ligands.
the receptor was identified as a member of the paqr family.
s. schenckii yeast cells exposed to progesterone  showed an increase in intracellular levels of 3′, 5′ cyclic adenosine monophosphate  within the first min of incubation with the hormone.
many different classes of receptors have been described in eukaryotic cells.
the cdna sequence revealed a predicted orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acids protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda.
