real-time pcr based on taqman mirna assays confirmed the expression of  <dig> mirnas in mature pollen, and identified  <dig> additional mirnas that were expressed at low level in mature pollen.
however, the expression of  <dig> mirna that were identified on the array could not be confirmed by the taqman mirna assays.
the results can be utilized in future research to study post-transcriptional gene regulation in pollen function.
sexual reproduction in flowering plants relies on pollen, the male gametophyte, to deliver sperm cells to fertilize the egg cell hidden in the embryo sac.
studies indicated that post-transcriptional processes are important for regulating gene expression during pollen function.
in summary, our results showed that some known mirnas were expressed in arabidopsis mature pollen, with most of them being low abundant.
analyses of transcriptome data for some mirna target genes indicated that mirnas are functional in pollen.
using mircury lna array technology, we have profiled the expression of  <dig> known mirnas  in arabidopsis mature pollen, and compared the expression of these mirnas in pollen and young inflorescence.
thirty-seven probes on the array were identified using rnas isolated from mature pollen,  <dig> of which showed significant differences in expression between mature pollen and inflorescence.
