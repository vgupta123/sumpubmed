brain tissue analysis from both treated and vehicle treated app/ps <dig> groups indicate no significant differences in amyloid plaque burden, aβ40/ <dig>  prpc or aβ oligomer levels.
aβ oligomers suppress ltp signal in murine hippocampal slices but activity remains when pretreated with the prp monoclonal anti-prp antibody, 6d <dig>  we hypothesized that targeting of prpc to prevent aβ oligomer-related cognitive deficits is a potentially novel therapeutic approach.
alzheimer's disease  is the most common of the conformational neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the conversion of a normal biological protein into a β-sheet-rich pathological isoform.
even short term treatment with monoclonal antibodies such as 6d <dig> or other compounds which block the binding of aβ oligomers to prpc can be used to treat cognitive deficits in aged ad transgenic mice.
6d <dig> treated app/ps <dig> tg mice had significantly greater synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the hippocampus compared to vehicle treated app/ps <dig> tg mice .
a recent study reveals the cellular prion protein, prpc, to be a receptor for aβ oligomers.
at the conclusion of behavioral testing, animals were sacrificed and brain tissue was analyzed biochemically or immunohistochemically for the levels of amyloid plaques, prpc, synaptophysin, aβ40/ <dig> and aβ oligomers.
injections of vehicle solution or the same dose of mouse igg over the same period.
the mice were then subjected to cognitive behavioral testing using a radial arm maze, over a period of  <dig> days.
in ad the normal soluble aβ  forms oligomers and fibrils which assemble into neuritic plaques.
