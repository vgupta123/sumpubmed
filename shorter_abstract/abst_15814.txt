neutral genetic markers  revealed genetic subdivision between australian and indonesian populations of c. sorrah.
cooperative management between australia and indonesia is the best option at present for p. glauca and s. lewini, while c. sorrah and c. obscurus should be managed independently.
populations of four commercially harvested shark species  were sampled from northern australia and central indonesia.
on-going research on these and other exploited shark and ray species is strongly recommended.
there was no evidence of genetic subdivision for p. glauca and s. lewini populations, but the sampling represented a relatively small part of their distributional range.
further research is needed to address the possibility of genetic subdivision among c. obscurus populations.
for these species, more detailed analyses of population genetic structure is recommended in the future.
biological and ecological similarity between species may not be a predictor of population genetic structure, so species-specific studies are recommended to provide new data to assist with sustainable fisheries management.
an essential starting point is knowledge of the degree of population subdivision, and hence fisheries stock status, in exploited species.
