this suggests that environmental estrogens could threaten the sustainability of wild fish populations.
here we tested this hypothesis by examining population genetic structures and effective population sizes  of wild roach  living in english rivers contaminated with estrogenic effluents.
we found no significant negative correlation between ne and the predicted estrogen exposure at  <dig> sample sites.
these results demonstrate that roach populations living in some effluent-contaminated river stretches, where feminization is widespread, are self-sustaining.
although we found no evidence to suggest that exposure to estrogenic effluents is a significant driving factor in determining the size of roach breeding populations, a reduction in ne of up to 65% is still possible for the most contaminated sites because of the wide confidence intervals associated with the statistical model.
long-term experimental exposures have resulted in skewed sex ratios, reproductive failures in breeding colonies, and population collapse.
furthermore, examination of the population genetic structure of roach in the region showed that some populations have been confined to stretches of river with a high proportion of estrogenic effluent for multiple generations and have survived, apparently without reliance on immigration of fish from less polluted sites.
treated effluents from wastewater treatment works can comprise a large proportion of the flow of rivers in the developed world.
