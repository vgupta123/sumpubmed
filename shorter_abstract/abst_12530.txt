to test this hypothesis, we examined whether the single presentation of a sound is enough to elicit a change-related cortical response, and therefore, shape a memory trace enough to separate a subsequent stimulus.
one presentation of a sound is enough to shape a memory trace for comparison with a subsequent physically different sound and elicits change-related cortical responses in the stg.
the process should relate closely to memory since it requires that the brain separate a new stimulus from an ongoing background or past event.
given that sensory memory monitors current sensory status and works to pick-up changes in real-time, any change detected by this system should evoke a change-related cortical response.
the stg works as a real-time sensory gate open to a new event.
under a paradigm where two pure sounds  <dig> ms in duration and  <dig> or  <dig> hz in frequency were presented in a specific order at an even probability, cortical responses to each sound were measured with magnetoencephalograms.
whereas activation in the planum temporale did not differ among events, activation in the superior temporal gyrus  was clearly greater for the different events  than the same event .
