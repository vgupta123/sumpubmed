transcriptome changes were also observed between early and late-stage treatments.

diabetic nephropathy  is a major complication of type <dig> and type  <dig> diabetes.
expression of  <dig>   including  <dig> coding genes was altered by diabetes with log <dig> fold changes  between - <dig>  and + <dig>   compared to wt.
precursor non-coding mirnas showed the highest fold changes in expression in the diabetic and p <dig> treatment groups.
unique biomarkers and canonical pathways identified in this study may hold the key to understanding mechanisms of dn pathobiology with value for clinical translation.
from ingenuity pathway analysis , mitochondrial dysfunction, nrf-2- mediated oxidative stress and renal injury pathways emerged as key mechanisms in dn.
dn-enriching genes in these pathways were reduced in number or regulated in the opposite direction by treatment.
using rna-seq, we identified <dig>  transcripts  that were significant and reliably expressed  in diabetic kidneys.
coding genes with highest fc in diabetic kidneys include nhej <dig> , ept <dig> , srd5a <dig> , aif <dig> , and angptl <dig> .
the dna repair gene, nhej <dig> with the greatest fc in diabetic kidneys was completely restored to control levels by both early and late p <dig> treatments.
early and late stage diabetic groups receiving continuous infusion of p <dig> showed altered expression of 316/ <dig>   transcripts, including  <dig> coding genes compared to non-treated diabetic controls.
our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, genotoxicity and oxidative stress are principal events in dn and that p78-pedf holds promise for its management.
