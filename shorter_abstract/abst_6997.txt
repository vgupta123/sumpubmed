expression patterns of some genes, especially light-related genes, did not show significant oscillation in japanese cedar, thus differing from those reported in angiosperms.
the data also revealed genes that showed different expression patterns compared to angiosperms, suggesting a unique gene regulatory network in conifers.
the circadian clock and diurnal dynamics of the transcriptome are presumed to play important roles in the regulation of physiological, biological and developmental processes synchronized with diurnal and annual cycles of plant environments.
gene network analysis of the microarray data revealed a network associated with the putative core clock genes , which were also isolated, indicating their importance in the diurnal regulation of the transcriptome.
this study revealed the existence of core clock genes and diurnal rhythms of the transcriptome in summer in japanese cedar.
here we present the diurnal transcriptome dynamics of japanese cedar  d.don) in both active  and dormant  periods.
microarray analysis revealed significant differences in transcripts between summer and winter, and diurnal transcriptome dynamics only in the summer.
this study provides fundamental data to understand transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in conifers.
about  <dig> % of unique genes  on the microarray were periodically expressed in summer.
dampening of diurnal rhythms in winter indicated seasonal change in the rhythms according to environmental conditions.
however, little is known about the circadian clock and its regulation in gymnosperms, including conifers.
