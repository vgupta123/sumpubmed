each spc is the average sequence profiles of residue pairs belonging to the same contact class or non-contact class.
the negative data sets, having roughly the same sizes as the positive ones, are constructed by random sampling over the original imbalanced negative data.
we also found that the ensemble of gacs indeed makes an accuracy improvement by around  <dig> % over the single gac.
gacs train on multiple but different pairs of long-range contact data  and long-range non-contact data .
in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of genetic algorithm classifiers  to address the long-range contact prediction problem.
it is helpful for determining protein structures, understanding protein foldings, and therefore advancing the annotation of protein functions.
classifiers with the use of sequence profile centers may advance the long-range contact prediction.
our method is based on the key idea called sequence profile centers .
