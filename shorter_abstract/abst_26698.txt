we developed an iut adjustment procedure, called relaxed iut , which is proved to be less conservative and more powerful for intersecting independent tests than the traditional venn diagram approach.
in dna microarray gene expression profiling studies, a fundamental task is to extract statistically significant genes that meet certain research hypothesis.
however this simple operation of intersecting multiple gene lists, known as the intersection-union tests , is performed without knowing the incurred changes in type  <dig> error rate and can lead to loss of discovery power.
riut is proved to be a more powerful alternative for performing iuts in identifying overlapping genes from multiple gene lists derived from microarray gene expression profiling.
