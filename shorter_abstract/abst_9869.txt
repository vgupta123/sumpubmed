candida albicans exacerbated these features, showed an unbalanced trna population for decoding its pool of codons and used near-cognate decoding for a large set of codons, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces shaped the evolution of its orfeome.
in order to tackle this question we have carried out a large scale study of codon-triplet contexts in  <dig> fungal species to unravel associations or relationships between codons present at the ribosome a-, p- and e-sites during each decoding cycle.
we have developed bioinformatics tools for large-scale analysis of codon-triplet contexts.
these algorithms identified codon-triplets context biases, allowed for large scale comparative codon-triplet analysis, and identified rules governing codon-triplet context.
the evolutionary forces that determine the arrangement of synonymous codons within open reading frames and fine tune mrna translation efficiency are not yet understood.
we have also identified a surprisingly large number of codon-triplet combinations that vanished from fungal orfeomes.
our analysis unveiled high bias within the context of codon-triplets, in particular strong preference for triplets of identical codons.
