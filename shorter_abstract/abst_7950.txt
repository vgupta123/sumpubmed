this experiment aimed to evaluate if the local delivery of male sheep embryonic stem-like  cells into osteochondral defects in the femoral condyles of adult sheep can enhance the regeneration of articular cartilage.
histological assessments demonstrated that the local delivery of es-like cells into osteochondral defects in sheep femoral condyles enhances the regeneration of the articular hyaline cartilage, without signs of immune rejection or teratoma for 24 months after engraftment.

samples engrafted with es-like cells had significantly better histologic evidence of regeneration with respect to empty defects, used as controls, at all time periods.
since mesenchymal stem cells  deriving from patients affected by osteoarthritis have a lower proliferative and chondrogenic activity, the systemic or local delivery of heterologous cells may enhance regeneration or inhibit the progressive loss of joint tissue.
defects deriving from trauma or joint disease tend to be repaired with fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage.
to date only a few experiments have used escs for the study of the cartilage regeneration in animal models and most of them used laboratory animals.
articular cartilage has poor intrinsic capacity for regeneration because of its avascularity and very slow cellular turnover.
embryonic stem cells  are very promising, since they can self-renew for prolonged periods without differentiation and can differentiate into tissues from all the  <dig> germ layers.
sheep, due to their anatomical, physiological and immunological similarity to humans, represent a valid model for translational studies.
