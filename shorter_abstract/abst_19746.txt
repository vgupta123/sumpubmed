on the other hand, monoclonal antibodies against alpha- <dig> giardin showed plasma membrane localization in both assemblages with the bare area of gs trophozoites also being distinguished.
in the present study, we developed monoclonal antibodies against alpha- <dig> and beta giardin, two immunodominant proteins produced during g. lamblia infection, and studied their expression and localization in wb  and gs trophozoites .
the polyclonal antibodies generated against wb trophozoites, particularly those recognizing intracellular proteins as well as the proteins present at the plasma membrane , showed cross-reactivity with intracellular proteins in gs trophozoites.
the use of monoclonal antibodies against beta giardin indicated ventral disc localization, particularly at the periphery in wb trophozoites.
to date, eight assemblages of giardia lamblia have been described, but only assemblages a and b are known to infect humans.
interestingly, although beta giardin was also restricted to the ventral disc in gs trophozoites, the pattern of localization clearly differed in this assemblage.
moreover, the same localization at the plasma membrane was observed in portland- <dig>  and in p <dig>  trophozoites.
