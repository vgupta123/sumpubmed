in this survey, two different error correction packages, quake and echo, are examined to see how they perform on next-generation sequence data from heterozygous genomes.
these findings suggest that quake and echo both have strengths and weaknesses when applied to heterozygous data.
however, errors that occur at heterozygous positions had unique trends.
quake's read trimming removed a large portion of the original data and often left reads with few heterozygous markers.
echo resulted in more chimeric reads and introduced more errors than quake but preserved heterozygous markers.
