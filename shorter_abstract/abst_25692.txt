our study was designed as an integrative approach using omics technologies for the identification of constitutive defects in epiphyseal cartilage and/or subchondral bone associated with the development of primary lesions to further understand oc pathology.
this study suggests that ocd lesions may result from a cartilage defect whereas oc lesions may be triggered by both bone and cartilage defects, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms responsible for the equine osteochondrosis lesion subtypes and predisposition could be due to a defect in both bone and cartilage.
this study will contribute to refining the definition of oc lesions and may improve diagnosis and development of therapies for horses and other species, including humans.
these were associated with cellular processes including cell cycle, energy production, cell signaling and adhesion as well as tissue-specific processes such as chondrocyte maturation, extracellular matrix and mineral metabolism.
consequently, results are not confounded by changes associated with the evolution of the lesion, but focus on altered constitutive molecular mechanisms.
this study compared samples from non-affected joints  from oc-affected foals  with samples from oc-free foals  considered as control samples.
modulated proteins were identified using omics technologies  in cartilage and bone from affected foals compare to oc-free foals.
metabolomics was also performed on synovial fluid from oc-free, oc-affected and predisposed joints.
of these, five had already been identified in synovial fluid of oc-affected foals: actg <dig> , albumin, haptoglobin, fbg  and c4bpa .
comparative proteomics and micro computed tomography analyses were performed on predisposed and oc-free bone and cartilage samples.
