based on analysis of repetitive sequences, we also showed that recombination hotspots are positively correlated with sine/mir repetitive elements and negatively correlated with line/l <dig> elements.
lower crossover rates near the centromeres were more prominent in males than in females.
the advantages of the pst approach include the ability to use only two-generation pedigrees with two siblings and the ability to perform gender-specific analyses of repetitive elements and tandem repeat sequences while including fewer uninformative snp regions in the results.
the number of meiotic recombination events was positively correlated with the number of shorter tandem repeat sequences.
meiotic recombination ensures that each child inherits distinct genetic materials from each parent, but the distribution of crossovers along meiotic chromosomes remains difficult to identify.
compared to other snp-based algorithms , fewer uninformative snps were derived with the use of pst.
