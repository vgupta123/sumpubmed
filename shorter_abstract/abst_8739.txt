a soybean near-isogenic line  pair contrasting in seed protein and differing in an introgressed genomic segment containing the lg i protein qtl was used as a resource to demarcate the qtl region and to study variation in transcript abundance in developing seed.
the lg i qtl region was delineated to less than  <dig>  mbp of genomic sequence on chromosome  <dig>  using affymetrix® soy genechip and high-throughput illumina® whole transcriptome sequencing platforms,  <dig> genes displaying significant seed transcript accumulation differences between nils were identified that mapped to the  <dig>  mbp lg i protein qtl region.
this study identifies gene candidates at the lg i protein qtl for potential involvement in the regulation of protein content in the soybean seed.
the results demonstrate the power of complementary approaches to characterize contrasting nils and provide genome-wide transcriptome insight towards understanding seed biology and the soybean genome.
a quantitative trait locus  on linkage group i  of soybean  merrill) has a striking effect on seed protein content.
the nutritional and economic value of many crops is effectively a function of seed protein and oil content.
