commercial packages are expensive and closed source, hence they do not allow end users to modify algorithms and add custom functionality.
bioclipse is released under eclipse public license , an open source license which sets no constraints on external plugin licensing; it is totally open for both open source plugins as well as commercial ones.
existing open source projects are more focused on providing a framework for integrating existing, separately installed bioinformatics packages, rather than providing user-friendly interfaces.
it provides 2d-editing, 3d-visualization, file format conversion, calculation of chemical properties, and much more; all fully integrated into a user-friendly desktop application.
the rich functionality, intuitive user interface, and powerful plugin architecture make bioclipse the most advanced and user-friendly open source workbench for chemo- and bioinformatics.
there is a need for software applications that provide users with a complete and extensible toolkit for chemo- and bioinformatics accessible from a single workbench.
