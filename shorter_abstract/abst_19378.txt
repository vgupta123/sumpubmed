the expression of recombinant ppg <dig> -vp <dig> and ppg <dig> -vp4-ltb was confirmed by sds-page and western blot analysis and surface-displayed expression on l. casei was verified by immunofluorescence.
mice orally immunized with recombinant protein-expressing l. casei produced high levels of serum immunoglobulin g  and mucosal iga.
these results demonstrated that vp <dig> administered in the context of an l. casei expression system is an effective method for stimulating mucosal immunity and that ltb served to further stimulate mucosal immunity suggesting that this strategy can be adapted for use in pigs.
immune responses associated with protection are primarily mucosal in nature and induction of mucosal immunity is important for preventing porcine rotavirus infection.
the induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on rv infection.
porcine rotavirus infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the swine industry necessitating the development of effective vaccines for the prevention of infection.
lactobacillus casei expressing the major protective antigen vp <dig> of porcine rotavirus  or vp4-ltb   fusion protein was used to immunize mice orally.
