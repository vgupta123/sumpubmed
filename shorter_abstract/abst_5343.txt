the analysis of the paternal genetic structure of equatorial west africans carried out to date leaves their origins and relationships unclear, and raises questions about the existence of major demographic phenomena analogous to the large-scale bantu expansions.
despite the overall homogeneity in a multiethnic sample, which contrasts with their social structure, minor clusters suggest the imprints of multiple peoples at different timescales: traces of ancestral inhabitants in haplogroups a-m <dig> and b-m <dig>  today typical of hunter-gatherers; north african influence in e3b1-m <dig> y chromosomes, probably due to trans-saharan contacts; and r1b-p <dig> lineages reflecting european admixture via the north atlantic slave trade.
the predominance and high diversity of haplogroup e3a*-m <dig> suggests a demographic expansion in the equatorial western fringe, possibly supported by a local agricultural center.
to address this, we have analysed the variation of  <dig> binary and  <dig> microsatellite markers on the non-recombining portion of the y chromosome in guinea-bissau samples of diverse ethnic affiliations, some not studied before.
the guinea-bissau y chromosome pool is characterized by low haplogroup diversity , with the predominant haplogroup e3a*-m <dig> shared among the ethnic clusters and reaching a maximum of  <dig> % in the mandenka people.
the paternal background of the felupe-djola and papel ethnic groups suggests a better conserved ancestral pool deriving from east africa, from where they have supposedly migrated in recent times.
the geographic and ethnolinguistic differentiation of many african y-chromosomal lineages provides an opportunity to evaluate human migration episodes and admixture processes, in a pan-continental context.
