repeated low dose aerosol exposures to commercial bt based biopesticides can induce sub-chronic lung inflammation in mice, which may be the first step in the development of chronic lung diseases.
balf cytology showed an acute inflammatory response dominated by neutrophils  <dig> hours after instillation of biopesticide.
inhalation of bt aerosols does not induce airway irritation, which could explain why workers may be less inclined to use a filter mask during the application process, and are thereby less protected from exposure to bt spores.
seventy days after end of the aerosol exposures,  <dig> out of  <dig> mice had interstitial lung inflammation.
control mice were instilled with sterile water.
endpoints were lung inflammation evaluated by presence of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , clearance of bacteria from the lung lumen and histological alterations of the lungs.
each mouse received  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu bt israelensis or  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu bt kurstaki per exposure.
cfu could be recovered from  <dig> out of  <dig> mice  <dig> days after exposure to aerosolised bt kurstaki.
the balfs were also subjected to cfu counts.
plethysmography showed that inhalation of bt aerosol did not induce airway irritation.
balfs were collected and the inflammatory cells were counted and differentiated.
four days after instillation, the neutrophil number was normalised and inflammation was dominated by lymphocytes and eosinophils, whereas  <dig> days after instillation, the inflammation was interstitially located with few inflammatory cells present in the lung lumen.
the aim of the present study was to assess possible health effects of airway exposures to bacillus thuringiensis  based biopesticides in mice.
to gain further knowledge with relevance for risk assessment, mice were exposed to aerosols of biopesticide one hour per day for  <dig> ×  <dig> days.
