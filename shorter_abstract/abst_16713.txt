then, the optimum conditions  were determined for cassava protoplast transient gene expression.
in this work we optimized the main influencing factors and developed an efficient mesophyll protoplast isolation and peg-mediated transient gene expression in cassava.
we validated the applicability of the system for studying the subcellular localization of mestp <dig>  with our transient expression protocol and a heterologous arabidopsis transient gene expression system.
we optimized the main influencing factors and developed an efficient mesophyll protoplast isolation and transient gene expression in cassava, which will facilitate large-scale characterization of genes and pathways in cassava.
in addition, the reliability of the established protocol was confirmed for subcellular protein localization.

although stable gene expression have been used for transgenic breeding and gene function study, a quick, easy and large-scale transformation platform has been in urgent need for gene functional characterization, especially after the cassava full genome was sequenced.
fully expanded leaves from in vitro plantlets of manihot esculenta were used to optimize the concentrations of cellulase r- <dig> and macerozyme r- <dig> for obtaining protoplasts with the highest yield and viability.
the suitable enzyme digestion system was established with the combination of  <dig> % cellulase r- <dig> and  <dig> % macerozyme r- <dig> for 16 h of digestion in the dark at 25 °c, resulting in the high yield  and vitality  of mesophyll protoplasts.
