overexpression of foreign genes in escherichia coli cells is an efficient means to obtain recombinant proteins.
the present study suggested a new strategy to increase the solubilization of overexpressed recombinant proteins in e. coli cells.
after codon optimization, we synthesized the adi gene of pseudomonas putida and constructed it for overexpression in e. coli cells.
the enzymatic and conversion characteristics of the radi products were further determined.
combined addition of l-arginine and d-glucose in the lb medium significantly improved in vivo solubility of radi proteins.
co-expression with the groes-groel chaperone team increased approximately 5-fold of the radi activity.
the radi products were mainly in inclusion body forms.
the technique is, however, often hampered by misfolding, degradation, aggregation and formation in inclusion bodies of products.
in this study, we reported that in vivo solubility of overexpressed arginine deiminases  improved by changing the cultivation conditions.
in addition the combination of l-arginine and d-glucose in the luria-bertani  growth medium further increased the total activity to about  <dig> times.
