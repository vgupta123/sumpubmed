in the second comparison, the pathogen-responsive tdfs from the partially resistant cultivar were compared to the cdna library from inoculated leaves of rvi <dig> -transformed ‘gala’ lines  and revealed both common physiological events, and notably differences in the regulation of defense response, the regulation of hydrolase activity, and response to dna damage.
this study highlights possible candidate genes that may play a role in the partial scab resistance mechanisms of ‘président roulin’ and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the partial resistance against apple scab.

this study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the partial resistance of the old belgian apple cultivar ‘président roulin’ against v. inaequalis.
differentially expressed genes were sorted into functional categories according to their gene ontology annotation and this expression signature was compared to published apple cdna libraries by gene enrichment analysis.
the first comparison was made with two cdna libraries from malus x domestica uninfected leaves, and revealed in both libraries a signature of enhanced expression in ‘président roulin’ of genes involved in response to stress and photosynthesis.
a global gene expression analysis was conducted in ‘président roulin’  and in ‘gala’  challenged by v. inaequalis by using the cdna-aflp method .
tdfs were in silico mapped on the ‘golden delicious’ apple reference genome and significant co-localizations with major scab r genes, but not with quantitative trait loci  for scab resistance nor resistance gene analogues  were found.
