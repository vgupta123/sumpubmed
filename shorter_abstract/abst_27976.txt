our results suggest that fungal hsp <dig> proteins are the major glo <dig> that may have some role in protecting cells from rcs toxicity in fungi.
our results also support the view that the glo <dig> activity of hsp <dig> proteins may have evolved independently from that of dj- <dig> proteins.
reactive carbonyl species , such as methylglyoxal  and glyoxal , are synthesized as toxic metabolites in living systems.
hsp <dig> and dj- <dig> proteins are weakly homologous to each other and belong to two different subfamilies of the dj-1/hsp31/pfpi superfamily.
s. pombe dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization.
overexpression of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig> could confer mg and go resistance on either wild-type s. pombe cells or glo <dig> deletion of s. pombe.
mechanisms of rcs detoxification include the glutathione -dependent system consisting of glyoxalase i  and glyoxalase ii , and gsh-independent system involving glyoxalase iii .
phylogenetic analysis revealed that fungal and metazoan dj- <dig> proteins and bacterial yajl proteins are most closely related and together form a sister clade to bacterial and fungal hsp <dig> proteins.
we showed that two schizosaccharomyces pombe hsp <dig> proteins  and one saccharomyces cerevisiae hsp <dig> protein  displayed significantly higher in vitro glo <dig> activity than s. pombe dj- <dig> .
