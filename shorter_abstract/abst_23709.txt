although csra mutations compensate for many known gaca mutant defects, not all csra suppressors restore symbiotic colonization.
most mutations that restored multiple phenotypes were non-null mutations that mapped to conserved domains in or altered expression of csra, a post-transcriptional regulator that mediates gaca effects in a number of bacterial species.
symbiosis defective gaca-mutant derivatives of vibrio fischeri are growth impaired thereby creating a selective advantage for growth-enhanced spontaneous suppressors.
different substitutions at the same amino acid residue were identified allowing comparisons of effects such as at the r <dig> residue, which conferred relative differences in luminescence and siderophore levels.
the mutations were identified by targeted and whole genome sequencing.
suppressors were isolated and characterized for effects of the mutations on gaca-mutant defects of growth, siderophore activity and luminescence.
most csra mutations enhanced luminescence more than siderophore activity, which was especially evident for mutations predicted to reduce the amount of csra.
siderophore regulation was less sensitive to stoichiometry of csra consistent with higher affinity for the targets of this trait.
in addition to its established role in regulation of central metabolism, the csra regulator represses luminescence and siderophore as an intermediate of the gaca regulatory hierachy.
the lack of csra null-mutant recovery implied these mutations do not enhance fitness of gaca mutants and alluded to this gene being conditionally essential.
