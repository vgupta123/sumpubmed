here we report the crystal structure of selenomethionine substituted nucleotide-free aathep <dig> at  <dig>  Ã… resolution using a multiple anomalous dispersion phasing protocol.
although annotated as a nucleotide kinase, such an activity could not be confirmed for aathep <dig> experimentally and the in vivo function of aathep <dig> is still unknown.
aathep <dig>  the gene product of aq_ <dig> from aquifex aeolicus, shows sequence homology to proteins from most thermophiles, hyperthermophiles, and higher organisms such as man, mouse, and fly.
