we have manually curated the lambda literature and compiled a total of  <dig> interactions that have been found among lambda proteins.
the lambda protein network connects  <dig> proteins of unknown function with well characterized proteins, which should shed light on the functional associations of these uncharacterized proteins.
we set out to find out how many protein-protein interactions remain to be found in this phage.
although it is probably the best-characterized phage there are still about  <dig> poorly understood open reading frames in its 48-kb genome.
in order to map lambda's interactions, we have cloned  <dig> out of  <dig> lambda open reading frames  into gateway vectors and systematically tested all proteins for interactions using exhaustive array-based yeast two-hybrid screens.
all previously found and new interactions are combined into structural and network models of phage lambda.
we conclude that we could not find all the known interactions because they require chaperones, post-translational modifications, or multiple proteins for their interactions.
bacteriophage lambda is a model phage for most other dsdna phages and has been studied for over  <dig> years.
phage lambda serves as a benchmark for future studies of protein interactions among phage, viruses in general, or large protein assemblies.
