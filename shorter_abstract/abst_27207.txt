the accuracy of the program, called poly site sleuth or pass, has been demonstrated by the prediction of many validated poly sites.
in plants, there is little sequence conservation among these signal elements, which makes it difficult to develop an accurate algorithm to predict the poly site of a given gene.
these signals are generally tri-part sequence patterns around the cleavage site that serves as the future poly site.
the algorithm will be useful in gene annotation because a poly site signifies the end of the transcript.
pass also predicted the changes of poly site efficiency in poly signal mutants that were constructed and characterized by traditional genetic experiments.
based on our current working model and the profile of nucleotide sequence distribution of the poly signals and around poly sites in arabidopsis, we have devised a generalized hidden markov model based algorithm to predict potential poly sites.
