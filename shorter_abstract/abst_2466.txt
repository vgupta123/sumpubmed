here we present a web-based tool that can be used for fast rotavirus genotype differentiation of all  <dig> group a rotavirus gene segments according to the new guidelines proposed by the rotavirus classification working group .
with the increasing sequencing efforts that are being conducted around the world to unravel complete rotavirus genomes of human and animal origin, this tool will be of great help to analyze and correctly classify the large amount of new data.
the use of this classification system will help to elucidate the role of gene reassortments in the generation of genetic diversity, host range restriction, co-segregation of certain gene segments, and in adaptation to a new host species.
group a rotaviruses are the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and children worldwide and continue to have a major global impact on childhood morbidity and mortality.
