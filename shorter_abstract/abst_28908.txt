experiments in simulated data demonstrated that gatk-lodn increased both specificity and sensitivity of gatk results.
we also showed the advantage of combining standard algorithms to create the gatk-lodn method, that increased specificity and sensitivity of gatk results.
we aimed to develop a pipeline which detects a wide range of single nucleotide mutations with high validation rates.
we presented a pipeline that detects a wide range of somatic single nucleotide variants, with good validation rates, from exome sequencing data of cancer samples.
however, gatk-lodn filtered more variants in the hematological samples than in the solid tumors.
the software mutect presented the highest validation rate  for mutation detection, but limited number of somatic mutations detected.

we combined two standard tools – genome analysis toolkit  and mutect – to create the gatk-lodn method.
however, many research groups reported low concordance among different methods.
this pipeline can be helpful in discovery studies aimed to profile the somatic mutational landscape of cancer genomes.
detecting somatic mutations in whole exome sequencing data of cancer samples has become a popular approach for profiling cancer development, progression and chemotherapy resistance.
