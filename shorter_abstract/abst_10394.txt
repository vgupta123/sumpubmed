the data were generated from  <dig> independent studies employing a wide range of molecular and biocomputational approaches.
the mammalian retina is a valuable model system to study neuronal biology in health and disease.
with the goal to assemble a first genome-wide reference transcriptome of the adult mammalian retina, referred to as the retinome, we have extracted  <dig>  non-redundant annotated genes from nearly  <dig>  published datasets on redundant retina/retinal pigment epithelium  transcripts.
comparison to known retina-/rpe-specific pathways and established retinal gene networks suggest that the reference retinome may represent up to 90% of the retinal transcripts.
to make this unique resource freely available we have built a database providing a query interface to the reference retinome  <cit> .
