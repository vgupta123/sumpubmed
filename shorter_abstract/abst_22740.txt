cch also decreased the paired-pulse inhibition of field potentials and the inhibitory conductances mediated by gabaa and gabab receptors.
the inhibitory conductances were unaltered by xanomeline , yet the cch-induced depression was antagonized by af-dx  <dig>  linopirdine, a selective m-current blocker, mimicked the effect of cch on neuronal firing.
these data indicate that the three effects are mediated by different machrs, the increase in firing being mediated by m <dig> machr, decrease of inhibition by m <dig> machr and depression of excitatory transmission by m <dig> machr.
however, linopirdine had no effect on the amplitude of epsp or on the paired-pulse inhibition, indicating that m-current is involved in the increase of neuronal excitability but neither in the depression of epsp nor paired-pulse inhibition.
pirenzepine reversed the depressant effect of cch on excitatory postsynaptic potential  but had marginal effects when applied before cch.
cch increased neuronal firing but reduced synaptic transmission.
the depression of paired-pulse inhibition was antagonized or prevented by af-dx  <dig> or atropine but only marginally by pirenzepine.
cholinergic transmission has been implicated in learning, memory and cognition.
