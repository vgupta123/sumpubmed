recent studies performed on model plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana, have suggested that the cuticle may be involved in drought stress adaptation, preventing non-stomatal water loss.
this aspect was investigated in a conifer, maritime pine , in a factorial design with two genetic units  and two treatments , in field conditions.
although forest trees will face more intense drought stresses  with global warming, very few studies on the role of the cuticle in drought stress adaptation in these long-lived organisms have been so far reported.
the higher cuticular wax content observed in the non-irrigated treatment associated with strong modifications in products from the decarbonylation pathway suggest that cuticular wax may be involved in drought stress adaptation in maritime pine.

needles were sampled three times per year for cuticular wax  and transcriptome  analysis.
non-irrigated saplings  had a higher cuticular wax content than irrigated saplings and  overexpressed most of the genes studied.
