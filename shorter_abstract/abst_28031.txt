further extension of the proposed theory has the potential to lead in a unifying framework for the simultaneous network minimization and information flow analysis across various “omics” levels.
biological networks tend to have high interconnectivity, complex topologies and multiple types of interactions.
given a regulatory biological network, a set of source  nodes and optionally a set of sink  nodes, our task is to find  the minimal sub-network that encodes the regulatory program involving all input and output nodes and  the information flow from the source to the sink nodes of the network.
the method of network flooding proves to be a useful, practical approach towards information flow analysis in gene regulatory networks.
this paper introduces the theory of network flooding, which aims to address the problem of network minimization and regulatory information flow in gene regulatory networks.

in addition, we generally lack scalable methods that can reveal the information flow in gene regulatory and biochemical pathways.
scalability and sensitivity analysis show that the proposed method scales well with the size of the network, and is robust to noise and missing data.
