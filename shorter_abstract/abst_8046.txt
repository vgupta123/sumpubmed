anopheles albimanus  is an important malaria vector in the americas.
to better understand the biological basis of malaria transmission and to develop novel and effective means of vector control, there is a need to explore the mosquito biology beyond the an.
we identified protein-coding transcripts involved in biological processes that may be relevant to the plasmodium lifecycle and can serve as the starting point for searching targets for novel control strategies.
the divergence time between anopheles gambiae, the main malaria vector in africa, and the neotropical vectors has been estimated to be  <dig> my.
by combining sanger,  <dig> and illumina sequences from cdna libraries derived from the midgut, cuticular fat body, dorsal vessel, salivary gland and whole body, we generated a single, high-quality assembly containing  <dig>  transcripts, 92% of which mapped to the an.
darlingi genome and covered 90% of the core eukaryotic genome.
we have explored the adult female transcriptome of one important new world malaria vector, an.
more than half of the transcripts had a match to proteins in other insect vectors and had an interpro annotation.
among more than  <dig> anopheline species, only a few species from different branches of the mosquito evolutionary tree transmit malaria, suggesting that their vectorial capacity has evolved independently.
the data reported in this manuscript is accessible to the community via the vectorbase website .
albimanus several hundred-fold, and will facilitate molecular research in medical entomology, evolutionary biology, genomics and proteomics of anopheline mosquito vectors.
