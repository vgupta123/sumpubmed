two cell biological defects that have been described in mliv fibroblasts are a hyperacidification of lysosomes and a delay in the exit of lipids from lysosomes.
mucolipidosis type iv is currently characterized as a lysosomal storage disorder with defects that include corneal clouding, achlorhydria and psychomotor retardation.
mucolipin- <dig> functions in the efficient exit of molecules, destined for various cellular organelles, from lysosomal compartments.
using stable rnai clones, we show that mucolipin- <dig> is required for the exit of lipids from these compartments, for the transport of endocytosed molecules to terminal lysosomes, and for the transport of the major histocompatibility complex ii to the plasma membrane.
we show that mucolipin- <dig> localizes to lysosomal compartments in raw <dig>  mouse macrophages that show subcompartmental accumulations of endocytosed molecules.
