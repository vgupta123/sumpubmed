we give a heuristic that reconstructs the duplication history of these sequences, using divergent strains to discriminate between mutations that occurred before and after speciation, or lineage divergence.
the tape measure protein got its name because the length of the corresponding gene is proportional to the length of the phage's tail: a fact shown by actually copying or splicing out parts of dna in exemplar species.
such units would allow us to retrace the evolution of tape measure proteins using their duplication/loss history.
here we describe a subset of phages whose tape measure proteins contain variable numbers of an  <dig> amino acids sequence repeat, aligned with sequence similarity, structural properties, and simple arithmetics.
a large family of viruses that infect bacteria, called phages, is characterized by long tails used to inject dna into their victims' cells.
finally, we present a method that allows, when possible, to discriminate between duplication and loss events.

a natural question is whether there exist units for these tape measures, and if different tape measures have different units and lengths.
