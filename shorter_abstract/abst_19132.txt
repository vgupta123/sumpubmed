a small space between rays  <dig> and  <dig> evolved once in the stem species of the elegans super-group; a narrow fan and spiral copulation evolved once in the stem species of c. angaria, c. sp.
by obtaining sequence data for two rrna and nine protein-coding genes, we determined the likely phylogenetic relationships among the  <dig> species in culture.
caenorhabditis nematodes were found to be proliferating in rotten fruits, flowers and stems.
only ten caenorhabditis species were available in culture at the onset of this study.
by collecting a large worldwide set of such samples,  <dig> new caenorhabditis species were discovered.
many of them, like c. elegans, were mostly isolated from artificial compost heaps, and their more natural habitat was unknown.
for example, hermaphroditism evolved three times independently in c. elegans, c. briggsae and c. sp.
at the global level, some species have a cosmopolitan distribution: c. briggsae is particularly widespread, while c. elegans and c. remanei are found mostly or exclusively in temperate regions, and c. brenneri and c. sp.
the new species are part of two well-resolved sister clades that we call the elegans super-group and the drosophilae super-group.
we further scored phenotypic characters such as reproductive mode, mating behavior and male tail morphology, and discuss their congruence with the phylogeny.
the  <dig> new species provide a resource and their phylogeny offers a framework for further studies into the evolution of genomic and phenotypic characters.
caenorhabditis are "fruit worms", not soil nematodes.
other species have limited distributions, for example c. sp.
<dig> appears to be restricted to china, c. sp.
<dig> to west africa and c. sp.
