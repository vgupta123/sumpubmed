design of specific primers and probe was achieved based on comparison of  <dig> published bifidobacterial 16s rdna sequences with the recently published sequence of the human faecal isolate b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  specificity of the primer was tested in silico by similarity search against the sequence database and confirmed experimentally by pcr amplification on  <dig> bifidobacterium strains, representing  <dig> different species, and two lactobacillus strains.
because bifidobacterium thermophilum was only recently isolated from human faeces until now, no specific real-time pcr  assay has been developed for detection of this species as component of the bifidobacterial community of the human intestinal flora.
the 16s rdna sequence of this isolate is  <dig> % similar to that of b. thermophilum rbl <dig> and confirmed the applicability of the new qpcr assay in faecal samples.
a new b. thermophilum-specific qpcr assay was developed based on species-specific target nucleotides in the 16s rdna.
the qpcr assay developed was linear for b. thermophilum rbl <dig> dna quantities ranging from  <dig>  ng/μl to  <dig> ng/μl and showed a detection limit of  <dig> cells per gram faeces.
the application of this new qpcr assay allowed to detect the presence of b. thermophilum in one sample from a 6-month old breast-fed baby among  <dig> human faecal samples tested.
until recently, b. thermophilum was considered as a species of animal origin, but here we confirm with the application of this new pcr assay the presence of b. thermophilum strains in the human gut.
