mocapy++ is a toolkit for parameter learning and inference in dynamic bayesian networks .
in particular, it supports the kent distribution on the sphere and the bivariate von mises distribution on the torus.
these distributions have proven useful to formulate probabilistic models of protein and rna structure in atomic detail.
it supports a wide range of dbn architectures and probability distributions, including distributions from directional statistics .
mocapy++ is especially suitable for constructing probabilistic models of biomolecular structure, due to its support for directional statistics.
