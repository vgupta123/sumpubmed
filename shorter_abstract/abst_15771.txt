a high mutation density  was achieved by repeating the ems treatment.
two screening strategies for high resolution melting  analysis and indexed amplicon sequencing were designed to retrieve the mutants; the mutations were confirmed by sanger sequencing as the final step.
based on whole-genome re-sequencing analysis of  <dig> mutant lines, the average number of base changes was  <dig>  per line.
in comparison with hrm screening of several genes, indexed amplicon sequencing allows one to scan a longer sequence range and skip screening steps and to know the sequence information of mutation because it uses systematic dna pooling and the index of ngs reads, which simplifies the discovery of mutants with amino acid substitutions.
thus, our mutant library and the indexed amplicon sequencing will be useful for functional studies of soybean genes and have a potential to yield useful mutant alleles for soybean breeding.
a soybean mutant library with a high mutation density was developed.
to increase the mutation density, seeds of the japanese elite soybean cultivar enrei were treated with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate ; m <dig> seeds produced by m <dig> plants were treated with ems once again.

a mutant library with a high mutation density would be helpful for functional studies and for identification of novel alleles useful for breeding.
on average,  <dig> and  <dig> per line were missense and nonsense mutations, respectively.
functions of most genes predicted in the soybean genome have not been clarified.
the mutation density of our library is sufficiently high to obtain a plant in which a gene is nonsense mutated.
the resultant library, which consisted of dna and seeds from  <dig> plants, revealed large morphological and physiological variations.
