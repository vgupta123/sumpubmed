there are twenty- two ggdef/eal domain proteins in the genome of s. typhimurium.
the secondary messenger cyclic di-gmp promotes biofilm formation by up regulating the expression of csgd, encoding the major regulator of rdar biofilm formation in salmonella typhimurium.
with the exception of the eal domain of stm <dig>  solely, diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities are required to regulate csgd mediated rdar biofilm formation.
the ggdef/eal domain proteins regulate the c-di-gmp turnover.
the enzymatic activity and the protein scaffold of ggdef/eal domain proteins regulate csgd expression.
identification of corresponding phosphodiesterases and diguanylate cyclases interacting in the csgd regulatory network indicates various levels of regulation by c-di-gmp.
thereby, c-di-gmp adjusts csgd expression at multiple levels presumably using a multitude of input signals.

among twelve ggdef domains, two proteins upregulate and among fifteen eal domains, four proteins down regulate csgd expression.
in this study, we dissect the role of individual ggdef/eal proteins for csgd expression and rdar biofilm development.
we identified two additional ggdef proteins required to promote optimal csgd expression.
