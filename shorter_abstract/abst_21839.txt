the strings appear to exert a pulling force along their longitudinal axis.
in addition, cells overexpressing a member of the iro-c contact one another and become organized in a network of thin strings that surrounds and isolates large groups of non-overexpressing cells.
this effect probably underlies formation of the fold that separates the notum and wing hinge territories.
the organization of the different tissues of an animal requires mechanisms that regulate cell-cell adhesion to promote and maintain the physical separation of adjacent cell populations.
apposition of cells expressing and non-expressing the iro-c, as it occurs in the notum-wing hinge border of the drosophila wing disc, influences cell behaviour.
this is a complex and unique phenotype that might be important for the generation of a straight notum-wing hinge border.
the mechanism by which these two cell populations are kept separate is unclear.
here we show that the iro-c genes participate in keeping the notum and wing cell populations separate.
these effects probably account for keeping the prospective notum and wing hinge cell populations separate and underlie epithelial fold formation.
we also show that apposition of iro-c expressing and non-expressing cells induces invagination and apico-basal shortening of the iro-c- cells.
in the drosophila imaginal wing disc the iroquois homeobox genes are expressed in the notum anlage and contribute to the specification of notum identity.
indeed, within the notum anlage, cells not expressing iro-c tend to join together and sort out from their iro-c expressing neighbours.
cells that overexpress a member of the iro-c and that confront non-expressing cells establish contacts between themselves and become organized in a network of thin strings.
these genes are not expressed in the adjacent wing hinge territory.
