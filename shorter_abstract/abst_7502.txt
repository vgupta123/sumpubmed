low-cost dna sequencing allows organizations to accumulate massive amounts of genomic data and use that data to answer a diverse range of research questions.
presently, users must search for relevant genomic data using a keyword, accession number of meta-data tag.
to improve access to massive genomic data resources, we have developed a fast search engine, gemini, that uses a genomic profile as a query to search for similar genomic profiles.
we tested gemini on breast and ovarian cancer gene expression data from the cancer genome atlas project and show that it achieves a query time that scales as the logarithm of the number of records in practice on genomic data.
gemini is a fast search engine that uses a query genomic profile to search for similar profiles in a very large genomic database.
gemini implements a nearest-neighbor search algorithm using a vantage-point tree to store a database of n profiles and in certain circumstances achieves an o expected query time in the limit.
