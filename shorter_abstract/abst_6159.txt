the methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, offers the possibility to generate a high amount of recombinant proteins in a fast and easy way to use expression system.
the study explained that it was possible to use mannanase activity as a measure of the expression level of the protein of interest.
a visual method for rapid selection of high-producing clones based on mannanase reporter system was developed.
high-producing target protein clones were directly selected based on the size of hydrolysis holes in the selected plate.
a novel methodology is proposed for obtaining the high-producing clones of proteins of interest, based on the mannanase reporter system.
as an example, the target gene  was expressed and purified in pichia pastoris using this technology.
being a single-celled microorganism, p. pastoris is easy to manipulate and grows rapidly on inexpensive media at high cell densities.
