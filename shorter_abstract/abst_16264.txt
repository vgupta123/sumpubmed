the 10-fold cross validation accuracy of the smo  model on training dataset was  <dig> , and the accuracy on independent test dataset was  <dig> .
since the hapmap project, large-scale genotype data from caucasian, african and asian population samples have been available.
many differences between different ethnic groups have been observed, such as skin color, eye color, height, susceptibility to some diseases, and response to certain drugs.
however, as an unsupervised method, pca does not measure the differences in each single nucleotide polymorphism  among populations.
in-depth functional analysis of these snps and their nearby genes revealed the genetic bases of skin and eye color differences among populations.
we applied an advanced mutual information-based feature selection method to detect associations between snp status and ethnic groups using the latest hapmap phase  <dig> release version  <dig>  which included more sub-populations.
