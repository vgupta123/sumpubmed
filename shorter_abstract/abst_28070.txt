the  <dig> maps and java programs are freely available on the web and by request.
a major constraint in the use of these sequenced and annotated genomes is divergent evolution.
a total of  <dig> maps of f. graminearum sequence scaffolds, annotated exonic fragments and associated f. virguliforme sequences resulted.
reference genome sequences within the major taxa can be used to assist the development of genomic tools for related organisms.
a series of programs were written to prepare  <dig> mbp of fusarium graminearum sequence in  <dig> scaffolds as a reference genome.
the main power of this method lay in its ability to align diverged sequences.
this work is unique in that discontinuous sequences were used for the analysis and information not readily apparent, such as match direction, are presented.
