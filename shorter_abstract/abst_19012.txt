in combination with mouse-rat sequence conservation, this algorithm detected  <dig>  strong mirna-encoding candidates, and for  <dig> of these we obtained experimental evidence for the existence of their corresponding mature microrna by microarray and stem-loop rt-pcr.
whereas the functional properties of these ml-ncrnas are beginning to be unravelled, no functional information is available for the large majority of these transcripts.
a few ml-ncrna have been shown to have genomic loci that overlap with microrna loci, leading us to suspect that a fraction of ml-ncrna may encode micrornas.
sequence analysis of the microrna-encoding rnas revealed an internal motif, whose presence correlates strongly  with the occurrence of stem-loops with characteristics of known pre-mirnas, indicating the presence of a larger number microrna-encoding rnas  in the ml-ncrnas population.
