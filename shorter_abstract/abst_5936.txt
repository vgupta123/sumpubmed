we also compare the rate of change in female morphological characters with the rate of fast-evolving, molecular and behavioral characters.
it is associated with the opening of the spermathecal ducts and is often distinct even among sister species .
the internal female genitalia, in sharp contrast, remain poorly studied.
we find the internal female genitalia are diverse in sepsidae and diagnostic for all species.
the first is the ventral receptacle, which is a secondary sperm storage organ.
in particular, fast-evolving structures like the ventral receptacle and dorsal sclerite are likely involved in post-copulatory sexual selection.
in comparison to behavioral and molecular data, the female structures are evolving 2/ <dig> as fast as the non-constant third positions of the coi barcoding gene.
the second structure is the dorsal sclerite, which is present in all sepsids except orygma luctuosum and ortalischema albitarse.
they display less convergent evolution in characters  than the third positions or sepsid mating behavior .
we describe the ectodermal parts of the female reproductive tract for  <dig> species representing  <dig> of the  <dig> described genera and define  <dig> morphological characters with discontinuous variation found in eight structures that are part of the reproductive tract.
here, we present the first comparative study of the internal reproductive system of sepsidae.
the species-specificity of male genitalia has been well documented in many insect groups and sexual selection has been proposed as the evolutionary force driving the often rapid, morphological divergence.
using a well-resolved molecular phylogeny based on  <dig> genes, we reconstruct the evolution of these characters across the family .
we test the species-specificity of the female genitalia by comparing recently diverged sister taxa.
