mutations resulting in the disruption of protein function are the underlying causes of many genetic diseases.
here, we analyze to which extent the functional effect of a mutation can be predicted from the effect on protein stability.
however, we also show that the knowledge of stability changes in no way suffices to predict functional changes and that many function changing mutations have no effect on stability.
we find that simple sequence-based methods succeed in predicting functional effects of nssnps.
our results confirmed that stability change is somehow related to function change.
single amino acid substitutions as caused by non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  often disrupt function by altering protein structure and/or stability, but can also wreak havoc by directly impacting functional binding sites.
however, experimental 3d structures are available for only 1% of all known proteins; the magnitude of stability change caused by a given mutation is more widely available.
