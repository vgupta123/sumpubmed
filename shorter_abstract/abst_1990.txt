the proposed ensemble method obtains the best performance with youden’s index of  <dig> , using the hybrid feature space of pseknc, dct, bi-gram pssm, and disorder information by 10-fold cross validation.
aptamer-protein interacting pairs play a variety of physiological functions and therapeutic potentials in organisms.
encouragingly, our proposed method performs better than previous study with a sensitivity of  <dig>  and a youden’s index of  <dig> .
we investigate predictive capabilities of various feature spaces.
to evaluate the prediction performance objectively, an independent testing dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method.
the features for aptamers are extracted from pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition  while the features for proteins incorporate discrete cosine transformation , disorder information, and bi-gram position specific scoring matrix .
these results suggest that the proposed method can be a potential candidate for aptamer-protein interacting pair prediction, which may contribute to finding novel aptamer-protein interacting pairs and understanding the relationship between aptamers and proteins.
rapidly and effectively predicting aptamer-protein interacting pairs is significant to design aptamers binding to certain interested proteins, which will give insight into understanding mechanisms of aptamer-protein interacting pairs and developing aptamer-based therapies.
in this study, an ensemble method is presented to predict aptamer-protein interacting pairs with hybrid features.
