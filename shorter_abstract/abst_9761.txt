the genomes of an increasing number of species are being investigated through generation of expressed sequence tags .
many current solutions for est translation require a large number of full-length gene sequences for training purposes, a resource that is not available for the majority of est projects.
prot4est provides a portable est translation solution and can be usefully applied to >95% of est projects to improve downstream annotation.
it incorporates freely available software to produce final translations that are more accurate than those derived from any single method.
