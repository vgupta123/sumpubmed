here we show that an internal deletion in mouse notch <dig> of egf repeats 8â€“ <dig>  including the putative ligand binding domain , is an inactivating mutation in vivo.
in embryonic stem  cells, notch1lbd was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type notch <dig>  but delta <dig> binding was reduced to the same level as in notch <dig> null cells.
mouse notch <dig> lacking the ligand binding domain is expressed at the cell surface but does not signal in response to the canonical notch ligands delta <dig> and jagged <dig>  homozygous notch1lbd/lbd mutant embryos die at ~e <dig> similar to notch <dig> null embryos.
notch signaling is highly conserved in the metazoa and is critical for many cell fate decisions.
however, the notch1lbd/lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type notch <dig> in notch1lbd/lbd es cells and embryos at e <dig> , indicating that notch <dig> signaling is not essential for the notch <dig> gene to be expressed.
in vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor  repeats  <dig> and  <dig> as the ligand binding domain of drosophila notch.
notch1lbd/lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from notch <dig> null mutants.
