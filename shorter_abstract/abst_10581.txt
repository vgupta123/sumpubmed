the direction of those shifts, towards  or away  from the adapter depends mostly on adaptation duration.
indeed, those regions have a more diverse orientation distribution of local inputs that could account for the three properties above.
in adult cat primary visual cortex, orientation-selective neurons shift their preferred orientation after being adapted to a non-preferred orientation.
this anisotropy of adaptation-induced plasticity, comparable to that of the visual cortex itself, could have important implications for our understanding of visual adaptation at the psychophysical level.
our results suggest that recording sites with both attractive and repulsive shifts following adaptation may be located in close proximity to iso-orientation domain boundaries or pinwheel centers.
our results suggest that the direction and amplitude of orientation preference shifts in v <dig> depend on location within the orientation map.
several response properties of v <dig> neurons depend on their location within the cortical orientation map.
how the adaptive behavior of a neuron is related to that of its neighbors remains unclear.
