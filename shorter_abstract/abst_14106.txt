remarkably, despite replacement of the asp ligand, zinc binding is retained at the s100a <dig> dimer interface with distorted tetrahedral geometry and a chloride ion serving as an exogenous fourth ligand.
of the seven divergent residues that differentiate s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  four cluster in a zinc-binding region and the remaining three localize to a predicted receptor-binding surface.
while the majority of human s <dig> proteins share 25-65% sequence similarity, s100a <dig> and its recently identified paralog, s100a <dig>  display 93% sequence identity.
to investigate the structural and functional consequences of these divergent clusters, we report the x-ray crystal structures of s100a <dig> and s100a7d24g, a hybrid variant where the zinc ligand asp <dig> of s100a <dig> has been substituted with the glycine of s100a <dig>  to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively.
collectively, these data provide novel insight into the structural and functional consequences of the divergent surfaces between s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> that may be exploited for targeted therapies.
the altered surface chemistry between s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> that localizes to the predicted receptor binding site is likely responsible for the differential recognition of distinct protein targets.
here we demonstrate that s100a <dig> retains the ability to coordinate zinc through incorporation of an exogenous ligand resulting in a unique zinc-binding site among s <dig> proteins.
