therefore, the gpa method has a major advantage in that it can be applied to diverse types of array sets, especially to the boutique array where the majority of genes may be differentially expressed.
the assessment of these methods is based on three different empirical criteria: across-slide variability, the kolmogorov-smirnov  statistic and the mean square error .
compared with other methods, the gpa method performs effectively and consistently better in reducing across-slide variability and removing systematic bias.
using experimental and simulated normal microarray data and boutique array data, we systemically evaluate the ability of the gpa method in normalization compared with six other popular normalization methods including global, lowess, scale, quantile, vsn, and one boutique array-specific housekeeping gene method.
the gpa method is an effective normalization approach for microarray data analysis.
normalization is essential in dual-labelled microarray data analysis to remove non-biological variations and systematic biases.
however, all these popular approaches have critical assumptions about data distribution, which is often not valid in practice.
many normalization methods have been used to remove such biases within slides  and across slides .
in particular, it is free from the statistical and biological assumptions inherent in other normalization methods that are often difficult to validate.
