zebrafish were treated in 96- or 384-well plates, and the phenotypes were analyzed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post fertilization .
the results reported here of the effects on zebrafish suggest that this newly developed method may be used to screen novel gsis and other leads for a variety of therapeutic indications.
the expression levels of notch target gene her <dig> were also measured by in situ hybridization and the co-relationship between the levels of notch inhibition by dapt and ad <dig> and the severity of phenotypes were determined.
these compounds were first tested in a cell-based assay and the effective concentrations of these compounds that blocked aβ generation were quantitated.
this enzyme mediates the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein  to generate amyloid β protein, aβ, the pathogenic protein in ad.
several γ-secretase inhibitors  are in clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer's disease .
we have developed a method to examine live zebrafish that were each treated with γ-secretase inhibitors , dapt {n- -s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester}, gleevec, or fragments of gleevec.
