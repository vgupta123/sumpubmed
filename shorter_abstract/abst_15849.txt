analysis of the genomic localization of the digestion-resistant fragments revealed their non-random distribution.
the gene starts are depleted of the digestion-resistant fragments, suggesting that these genomic regions are more exposed than genomic sequences on average.
the nuclease expression was under the control of arac repressor, which enabled us to perform an inducible digestion of bacterial nucleoid inside a living cell.
our results suggest that dna is packaged in the bacterial nucleoid in a non-random way that facilitates interaction of the dna binding factors with regulatory regions of the genome.
to this end, we transformed e. coli cells with a plasmid expressing micrococcal nuclease.
it is unclear how dna is packaged in a bacterial cell in the absence of nucleosomes.
to investigate the initial level of dna condensation in bacterial nucleoid we used in vivo dna digestion coupled with high-throughput sequencing of the digestion-resistant fragments.
