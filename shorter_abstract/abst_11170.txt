group a had a significantly lower relative abundance of actinobacteria , chloroflexi , gemmatimonadetes  and proteobacteria  and a greater relative abundance of firmicutes  than group b. within group b, alphaproteobacteria was the most common class of proteobacteria , while caulobacteraceae , pseudomonadaceae , hyphomicrobiaceae , alcaligenaceae  and xanthomonadaceae  were the most abundant families.
the intestinal tract harbours a complex and diverse microbial population that is important for health, yet has been poorly described in many species.
no operational taxon units  were found in all samples at a relative abundance of 1% or greater.
no otus were found at that abundance in all group b sample, but an unclassified lachnospiraceae was present in 20/ <dig>  and clostridium cluster xi and brevundimonas were found in  <dig>  samples.
the twenty  most abundant genera accounted for 71% of sequences.
this study explored the fecal microbiota of semi-free-ranging wood bison .
the fecal microbiota of wood bison is rich and diverse.
twenty-one different phyla were identified; however, only firmicutes and proteobacteria, actinobacteria accounted for >1% of sequences.
two distinct population clusters  were evident based on both community membership and population structure.
catchall analysis of richness predicted a mean of  <dig> species per sample .
one otu  was present at 1% or more in all group a samples, with two other clostridium cluster xi otus in 18/ <dig>  samples.
