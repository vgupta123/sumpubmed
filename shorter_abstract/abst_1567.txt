furthermore, morphological differences produced along these two axes are quite similar.
interestingly, and despite the fact that they were extracted as independent factors , evolutionary allometry  and ontogenetic allometry  are correlated within these two genera.
cebus and saimiri are aligned along the same evolutionary allometry and have parallel ontogenetic allometry trajectories.
how are morphological evolution and developmental changes related?
these results are consistent using both approaches, classical and geometric morphometrics.
geometric morphometrics allows the precise separation of absolute size, shape variation associated with size , and shape variation non-associated with size.
cebus and saimiri share the same basic allometric patterns in skull traits, a result robust to sexual and ontogenetic variation.
this rather old and intriguing question had a substantial boost after the 70s within the framework of heterochrony  and nowadays has the potential to make another major leap forward through the combination of approaches: molecular biology, developmental experimentation, comparative systematic studies, geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics.
here i take an integrated approach combining life-history comparative analyses, classical and geometric morphometrics applied to ontogenetic series to understand changes in size and shape which happen during the evolution of two new world monkeys  sister genera.
many life-history changes are correlated or may be the causal agents in such evolution, such as delayed on-set of reproduction in cebus and larger neonates in saimiri.
