upstream motifs  <dig> and  <dig> do not drive gfp expression, and termination at consecutive t runs suggests transcription by rna polymerase iii.
the um <dig> loci appear to act in concert with other upstream sequences, whereas the transcriptional activities of the um <dig> and um <dig> are confined to the motifs themselves.
characterizing the transcriptional activity of ncrna promoters is therefore a critical step toward understanding the complex cellular roles of ncrnas.
transcriptional activity of all three motifs has been demonstrated, and mutational analysis revealed differential contributions of different parts of each motif.
the um <dig> sequence can drive expression of gfp, which allows for the use of um1::gfp fusion constructs to study temporal-spatial expression patterns of um <dig> ncrna loci.
we showed that upstream motif  <dig>  can drive the expression of green fluorescent protein , and utilized this for detailed analysis of temporal and spatial expression patterns of  <dig> sl <dig> rnas.
the um <dig> sequence resembles the trna promoter, and is actually embedded within its own short-lived, primary transcript.
