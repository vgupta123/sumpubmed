our results present comprehensive gene expression information about the cranberry fruit transcriptome that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fruit development in cranberries.
although it will be necessary to validate the functions carried out by these genes, these results could be used to improve the quality of breeding programs for the cranberry and related species.
among them, many candidate genes were involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, transport and regulation.
furthermore, digital gene expression  analysis identified  <dig>  unigenes that were differentially expressed between the two fruit developmental stages.
of these,  <dig>  unigenes mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways, with the metabolic pathways, secondary metabolites, glycerophospholipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism being well represented.
in addition,  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  were detected.
our main goals were to identify putative genes for major metabolic pathways of bioactive compounds and compare the expression patterns between white fruit  and red fruit  in cranberry.
in this study, two cdna libraries of w and r were constructed.
