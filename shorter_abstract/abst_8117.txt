moreover, intensification of imprinting in modern rodents seems to have shifted the evolutionary fate of imprinted genes towards strong purifying selection.
here, we aimed at assessing the evolutionary history of imprinted genes.
in contrast to the majority of mammalian genes, imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed with the choice of the active allele depending on its parental origin.
it is contrasted by strong conservation of paternally expressed genes in mouse and rat.
in this study, we investigated the conservation of imprinted genes in vertebrate genomes and their exposition to natural selection.
the apparent degeneration of maternally expressed genes may reflect a relaxation of selective pressure due to counteracting effects on maternal and embryonic fitness.
in a genome-wide comparison, orthologs of imprinted genes show a stronger divergence on cdna and protein level in mammals.
functional redundancy provided by the presence of highly conserved  paralogs may have facilitated the divergence.
