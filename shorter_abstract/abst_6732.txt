both proteins are encoded by a highly conserved lutabc operon, which has been implicated in lactate utilization in bacteria.
jcsg solved the first crystal structure  from the lud domain family: lutc protein, encoded by orf dr_ <dig>  of deinococcus radiodurans.
we have observed that the lud domain has an increased abundance in the human gut microbiome.
the significance of lud-containing proteins in the human gut microbiome, and the implication of lactate metabolism in the radiation-resistance of deinococcus radiodurans are discussed.
based on our analysis of its sequence, structure, and recent experimental evidence reported by other groups, we hereby redefine duf <dig> as the lud domain family.
we propose a model for the substrate and cofactor binding and regulation in lud domain.
a novel highly conserved protein domain, duf <dig> , can be mapped to two proteins: lutb and lutc.
