cryptophytes are highly compartmentalized organisms, expressing a secondary minimized eukaryotic genome in the nucleomorph and its surrounding remnant cytoplasm, in addition to the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion and the plastid.
orf <dig>  one of the uncharacterized nucleomorph-specific open reading frames of the cryptophyte guillardia theta, shows homology to slr <dig> of synechocystis sp.
pcc  <dig> and indicate that after separating from a common ancestor protein, the phycoerythrin lyase from guillardia theta has retained its capacity to couple a bilin group to other phycobiliproteins.
finally, our results indicate that the phycocyanin-β155-bilin lyase of synechocystis sp.
pcc  <dig> was characterized to encode a phycocyanin-β155-bilin lyase.
pcc  <dig> slr1649-encoded protein also acts as a bilin lyase, and additionally contributes to linker attachment and/or stability of phycobilisomes.
therefore the functions of nucleomorph-encoded proteins must be elucidated indirectly by application of methods in genetically accessible organisms.
here we show by insertion mutagenesis that the synechocystis sp.
our data show that the loss of phycocyanin-lyase function causes pleiotropic effects in synechocystis sp.
pcc  <dig>  recently a further homolog from synechococcus sp.
