<dig> out of  <dig> ests from safflower and  <dig> of  <dig> ests from artichoke showed at least one predicted mirna target.
<dig> and  <dig> ests of safflower and artichoke organized in cos shared  <dig> different mirna targets, considered functionally conserved, and statistically significant when compared with random sequences .
most of the mirna targets appeared highly/moderately conserved, highlighting an important and conserved function.
after statistical analysis  <dig> targets, found on the cos regions and belonging to  <dig> mirna families, have a signal to noise ratio >  <dig>  with â‰¥  <dig>  specificity.
the putative mirnas identified belong to  <dig> dicotyledon plants and to  <dig> families only in monocotyledon.
plant mirnas show imperfect but extensive complementarity to mrna targets, making their computational prediction possible, useful when data mining is applied on different species.
in this study we introduce a stringent parameter for the comparative sequence analysis, represented by the identification of the same target in the cos region.
micrornas  are small rnas  providing an rna-based system of gene regulation highly conserved in plants and animals.
mature mirnas and targets were predicted within est sequences of safflower and artichoke.
