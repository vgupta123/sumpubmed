traditionally, this process has been characterized by a number of parameters providing global information about shape changes, which are insufficient to distinguish phenotypes based on local pseudopodial activities that typify amoeboid motility.
the ability of a cell to change shape is crucial for the proper function of many cellular processes, including cell migration.
it involves a series of automatic algorithms including image segmentation, boundary smoothing, skeletonization and branch pruning, and takes into account the cell shape changes between successive frames to detect protrusion and retraction activities.
one type of cell migration, referred to as amoeboid motility, involves alternating cycles of morphological expansion and retraction.
thus, the method provides a powerful tool for investigating amoeboid motility.
we illustrate the algorithms on movies of chemotaxing dictyostelium cells and show that our method makes it possible to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics as well as the stochastic features of the pseudopodial behavior.
we developed a method that automatically detects and characterizes pseudopodial behavior of cells.
