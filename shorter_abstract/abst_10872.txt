recently, we reported that in be-c human neuroblastoma cells , chronic epi treatment  produced a dramatic β-adrenoceptor-dependent desensitization of the α2a-ar response.
stable clones of sh-sy5y cells transfected to stably express functional β2-ars  were selected to compare sensitivity of α2-ar to epi in the presence or absence of β2-ars.
we now report that after transfection of functional β2-ar into sh-sy5y cells , chronic treatment with modest levels of epi desensitizes the α2a-ar.
the aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a β2-ar to a second neuroblastoma cell line , that normally expresses only α2a-ars that are not sensitive to  <dig> nm epi exposure, would suddenly render α2a-ars in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same epi concentration.
several studies suggest that the α2-ar responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epinephrine  or norepinephrine  exposure may vary, depending on the β-ar activity present there.
a series of molecular, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicated that the difference between the cell lines could not be attributed to α2-ar heterogeneity.
these studies employed rt-pcr, receptor binding and inhibition of camp accumulation to confirm α2-ar subtype expression.
this effect results from a β2-ar dependent down-regulation of native α2a-ars by epi accompanied by enhanced translocation of grk <dig> and grk <dig> to the membrane .
