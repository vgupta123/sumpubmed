transmembrane receptor kinases play critical roles in both animal and plant signaling pathways regulating growth, development, differentiation, cell death, and pathogenic defense responses.
as a resource for the in-depth analysis of this important protein family, the complementary dna sequences  of  <dig> lrr-rlks were cloned into the gatewayr donor vector pdonr/zeor and analyzed by dna sequencing.
most of the arabidopsis lrr-rlk genes have been isolated and the sequence analysis showed a number of alternatively spliced variants.
the generated resources, including cdna entry clones, expression constructs and transgenic plants, will facilitate further functional analysis of the members of this important gene family.
