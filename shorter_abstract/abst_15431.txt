violent content in video games evokes many concerns but there is little research concerning its rewarding aspects.
it is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it.
it was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine release.
we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging  with individual affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a video game.
we found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the players.
thirteen male german volunteers played a first-person shooter game  during fmri measurement.
the rtp may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' mood.
affect was measured directly before and after game play using the positive and negative affect schedule .
failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus.
a negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right temporal pole .
the deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward .
