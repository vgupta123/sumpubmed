available linkage maps have low marker density due to limitation in available markers; therefore new technologies that detect genome-wide polymorphisms are still needed to discover a large number of new markers for construction of high-resolution maps.
a high-resolution map is a critical tool for gene isolation, molecular breeding and genomic research.
the new high-density map constructed in this study will be a useful tool for genetic and genomic research in wheat.
map positions of a selected set of sfps were validated by mapping single nucleotide polymorphism using snapshot and comparing with expressed sequence tags mapping data.
the affymetrix array is a cost-effective platform for sfp discovery and sfp mapping in wheat.
the b genome had the most sfps, and the d genome had the least.
the wheat genome has not yet been sequenced due to its huge genome size  and high levels of repetitive sequences; the whole genome sequence may not be expected in the near future.
this study was conducted to explore the feasibility of using the affymetrix genechip to discover and map sfps in the large hexaploid wheat genome.
six wheat varieties of diverse origins  were analyzed for significant probe by variety interactions and  <dig> probe sets with sfps were identified.
