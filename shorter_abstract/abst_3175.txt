the observed effects suggest that sex specific mitonuclear selection contributes to the maintenance of mtdna polymorphism and to mitonuclear linkage disequilibrium in this model system.
further, we demonstrate a significant mitonuclear genetic effect on adult sex ratio, as well as a sex × mtdna × nudna interaction for adult longevity.
here, we use mitonuclear introgression lines to assess differences in a series of key life-history traits  in drosophila subobscura fruit flies carrying one of three different sympatric mtdna haplotypes.
a number of recent studies have shown that the pattern of mitochondrial dna variation and evolution is at odds with a neutral equilibrium model.
we found functional differences between these sympatric mtdna haplotypes, but these effects were contingent upon the nuclear genome with which they were co-expressed.
theory has suggested that selection on mitonuclear genotypes can act to maintain stable mitonuclear polymorphism within populations.
