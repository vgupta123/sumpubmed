dasminer enables full exploration of these resources, and can be used to deploy applications and create integrated views of biological systems using the information deposited in das repositories.
dasminer is composed by a browser application and an api that work together to facilitate gathering of data from different das sources, which can be used for creating enriched datasets from multiple sources.
the browser is used to formulate queries and navigate data contained in das sources.
the api component of dasminer may be used for programmatic access of das sources by programs in matlab.
these enriched datasets were built by retrieving and integrating distributed genomic and proteomic das sources using the api.
the support of the das protocol allows that hundreds of molecular biology databases to be treated as a federated, online collection of resources.
for this reason, the browser can interrogate any das source, independently of the type of data being served.
using the source's metadata provided by the das registry, the browser's layout adapts to expose only the set of commands and coordinate systems supported by the specific source.
