polymorphisms in the gene encoding baff were associated with the antibody response to ascaris but not to mite allergens.
these findings suggest that differences in baff levels are related to the strength of the antibody response to ascaris.
individuals with specific ige levels to ascaris >75th percentile had lower levels of soluble baff; those with specific igg levels to ascaris >75th percentile had reduced baff mrna.
in the present study we evaluated the relationship between baff and specific antibodies against ascaris and mites in  <dig> controls and  <dig> asthmatics.
soluble baff was measured by elisa and baff mrna by qpcr.
b-cell activating factor  is a cytokine regulating antibody production.
there were no differences in soluble baff or mrna levels between asthmatics and controls.
total ige and specific ige to mites were not related to baff levels.
there was an inverse relationship between the cell-surface expression of baff-r on cd19+ b cells and baff levels at the transcriptional and protein level.
