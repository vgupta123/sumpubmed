selected integration sites that had been flanked with heterologous recombinase target sites  were targeted by flp recombinase mediated cassette exchange .
upon considering the specific requirements of chromosomal sites this method provides a unique tool to exploit such sites for predictable expression of biotechnologically relevant proteins such as antibodies.
the results give proof of principle for consistent protein expression upon rmce.
antibody production was found to be highly consistent within the individual cell clones as expected from their isogenic nature.
we explored antibody expression upon targeting diverse expression constructs into previously tagged loci in cho-k <dig> and hek <dig> cells that exhibit high reporter gene expression.
both, retroviral infection and plasmid transfection with egfp or antibody expression cassettes were employed for tagging.
upon targeting antibody expression cassettes 90-100% of all resulting cell clones showed correct integration.
rmce provides a powerful method to specifically design vectors for optimized gene expression with high accuracy.
the tagged cell clones were screened for expression and single copy integration.
cell clones producing >  <dig> pg/cell in  <dig> hours could be identified.
recombinant protein expression in mammalian cells is mostly achieved by stable integration of transgenes into the chromosomal dna of established cell lines.
