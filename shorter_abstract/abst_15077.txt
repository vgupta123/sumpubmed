we examine the heme-binding pockets and explore the versatility of the α + β barrels ability to accommodate heme or heme-related moieties, such as siroheme, in at least three different sites, namely, the mode seen in isdg/oxda, cld/dyp/efeb/hemq and siroheme decarboxylase barrels.
the barrel architecture of these proteins is formed by either homo-/hetero-dimerization or duplication and fusion of ferredoxin-like domains.
our comparative structural analysis of these heme-binding barrels reveals two distinct modes of packing of the ferredoxin-like domains to constitute the α + β barrel, which is typified by the type-1/isdg-like and type-2/oxda-like proteins, respectively.
several members of this superfamily bind heme in order to carry out their functions.
the α + β barrel superfamily of the ferredoxin-like fold consists of a functionally diverse group of evolutionarily related proteins.
