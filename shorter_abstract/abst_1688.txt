psoriasis is an immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by chronic inflammation and hyperproliferation of the epidermis.
in this study, we applied weighted gene coexpression network analysis  on rna-seq data from psoriasis patients and healthy controls.

using wgcna, we identified  <dig> network modules that were significantly correlated with psoriasis and  <dig> network modules significantly correlated with biologic treatment, with only 16 % of the psoriasis-associated and 5 % of the treatment-associated coexpressed genes being identified by differential expression analysis.
enrichment analysis of these correlated modules revealed that short-chain fatty acid metabolism and olfactory signaling are amongst the top pathways enriched for in modules associated with psoriasis, while regulation of leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity and regulation of cell killing are amongst the top pathways enriched for in modules associated with biologic treatment.
rna-seq was performed on skin samples from  <dig> psoriasis patients  and  <dig> healthy controls, generating an average of  <dig>  million 100-bp paired-end reads per sample.
differential expression analysis of microarray or rna-seq data have shown that thousands of coding and non-coding genes are differentially expressed between psoriatic and healthy control skin.
however, differential expression analysis may fail to detect perturbations in gene coexpression networks.
this study has identified several networks of coding and non-coding genes associated with psoriasis and biologic drug treatment, including networks enriched for short-chain fatty acid metabolism and olfactory receptor activity, pathways that were not previously identified through differential expression analysis and may be dysregulated in psoriatic skin.
