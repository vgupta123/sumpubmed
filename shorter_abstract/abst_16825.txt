we exposed poorly-fed and well-fed females to multiple males offering nutritive gifts and well-fed females to males offering worthless gifts.
this confirms that female receptivity is independent of their nutritional state, i.e.
we therefore propose that the dependence of female receptivity on hunger state may have evolved in species with predominantly nutritive gifts but is absent in species with predominantly worthless gifts.
in the spider paratrechalea ornata, 70% of gifts in nature are worthless.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
we therefore predicted female receptivity to be independent of hunger in this species.
in the spider pisaura mirabilis, in which the majority  of gifts in nature are nutritive, female receptivity depends on hunger.

polyandry is commonly maintained by direct benefits in gift-giving species, so females may remate as an adaptive foraging strategy.
though the treatments strongly affected fecundity, females of all groups had similar number of matings.
