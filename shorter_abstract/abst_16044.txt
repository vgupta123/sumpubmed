we also generated a knockout of the upc <dig> transcriptional regulator, and we found that similar to c. albicans, upc <dig> is required for conferring resistance to azole drugs, and for regulation of expression of the ergosterol pathway in hypoxia.
this is the first report of 3' utr introns in the saccharomycotina.
we used both rna-seq and microarray analysis to determine the transcriptional profile of cells grown in normoxic and hypoxic conditions in rich media, and we showed that there was a high correlation between the approaches.
we found that the transcription factor upc <dig> role has a conserved role as a major regulator of the hypoxic response in c. parapsilosis and c. albicans.
we provide the first detailed annotation of the c. parapsilosis genome, based on gene predictions and transcriptional analysis.
the transcriptional response of c. parapsilosis to hypoxic  conditions, such as those encountered in the host, is also relatively unexplored.
however, the genome sequence annotation was made without experimental validation and little is known about the transcriptional landscape.
we used next generation sequencing  to determine the transcriptional profile of c. parapsilosis growing in several conditions including different media, temperatures and oxygen concentrations.
