lr <dig> was previously mapped to the telomeric region of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2b.
six snp markers exhibited high quality clustering in the kasp assay and are suitable for mas of lr <dig> in wheat breeding programs.
lr <dig> is a widely deployed leaf rust resistance gene in wheat  that is highly effective against the north american puccinia triticina population when pyramided with the gene lr <dig>  lr <dig> is a seedling leaf rust resistance gene conditioning an incompatible interaction with a distinct necrotic ring surrounding the uredinium.
forty-three snp markers were developed and mapped on chromosome 2bs tightly linked with the resistance gene lr <dig> across four mapping populations representing a total of  <dig> gametes.
six snp markers were consistent with the lr <dig> phenotype and are accurately predictive of lr <dig> for all wheat lines/cultivars in the panel.
resistance gene analogs  linked with the lr <dig> locus were identified and rga-based snp markers were developed.
lr <dig> was mapped relative to snp markers in four populations.
the diagnostic potential of the snps co-segregating with lr <dig> was evaluated in a diverse set of  <dig> cultivars and breeding lines.
