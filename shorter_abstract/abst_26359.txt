thus many organisms have developed a complex regulatory circuit that governs the expression of enzymes involved in sulphur assimilation and metabolism.
unlike other fungi, growth of h. jecorina is not inhibited by selenate under low sulphur conditions, suggesting altered regulation of sulphur metabolism.
upon growth on cellulose, the uptake of sulphate is dependent on the light status and essential for growth in light.
our data indicate that the significance of the sulphate/methionine-related signal with respect to cellulase gene expression is dependent on the light status and reaches beyond detection of sulphur availability.
transcription of lim <dig> is specifically up-regulated upon sulphur limitation and responds to cellulase inducing conditions.
analyses of proteins binding to the cellulase activating element  within the promotor of the cellobiohydrolase cbh <dig> gene led to the identification of a putative e <dig> ubiquitin ligase protein named limpet , which is an orthologue of the sulphur regulators scon- <dig> of neurospora crassa and met30p of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
further, lim <dig> transcriptionally reacts to a switch from constant darkness to constant light and is subject to regulation by the light regulatory protein envoy.
in addition, light dependent stimulation/shut down of cellulase gene transcription by methionine in the presence of sulphate was observed.
sulphur compounds like cysteine, methionine and s-adenosylmethionine are essential for the viability of most cells.
thus lim <dig>  despite its function in sulphur metabolite repression, responds both to light as well as sulphur- and carbon source.
phylogenetic analysis of the five sulphate permeases found in the genome of h. jecorina revealed that the predominantly mycelial sulphate permease is lacking, thus supporting this hypothesis.
in the filamentous fungus hypocrea jecorina  little is known about the participants in this circuit.
