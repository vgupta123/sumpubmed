these proteins are involved in apoptosis, extracellular matrix structure, immune system, metabolism, mechanical function, and oxygen transport.
altered proteins were identified using mass spectrometry .
furthermore, gilt, a protein involved in the immune system, is changed in phosphorylation state which is linked to its activation.
we identified and cloned a novel rana larval type i keratin, rlk i, which  may be a target for caspase-mediated proteolysis upon exposure to t <dig>  in addition, the rlk i transcript is reduced during t3-induced and natural metamorphosis which is consistent with a larval keratin.
to this end, we developed a cell and protein fractionation method combined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and phosphoprotein-specific staining.
thyroid hormones  are vital in the maintenance of homeostasis and in the control of development.
in addition, there is increasing evidence that changes in the phosphoproteome influence th action.
one postembryonic developmental process that is principally regulated by ths is amphibian metamorphosis.
we have demonstrated the ability to derive proteomics-based information from a model species for postembryonic development for which no genome information is currently available.
using a complementary ms technique for the analysis of differentially-expressed proteins, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation  revealed  <dig> additional proteins whose levels were altered upon t <dig> treatment.
the present study identifies proteins whose levels and/or phosphorylation states are altered within  <dig> h of the induction of tadpole tail regression prior to overt remodeling of the tail.
