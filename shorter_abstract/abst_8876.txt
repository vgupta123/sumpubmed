in contrast to earlier approaches to ppi extraction, the introduced all-paths graph kernel has the capability to make use of full, general dependency graphs representing the sentence structure.
we show that the graph kernel approach performs on state-of-the-art level in ppi extraction, and note the possible extension to the task of extracting complex interactions.
these include incorrect cross-validation strategies and problems related to comparing f-score results achieved on different evaluation resources.
we evaluate the proposed method on five publicly available ppi corpora, providing the most comprehensive evaluation done for a machine learning based ppi-extraction system.
automated extraction of protein-protein interactions  is an important and widely studied task in biomedical text mining.

cross-corpus results provide further insight into how the learning generalizes beyond individual corpora.
our method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance with respect to comparable evaluations, with  <dig>  f-score and  <dig>  auc on the aimed corpus.
we propose a graph kernel based approach for this task.
further, we identify several pitfalls that can make evaluations of ppi-extraction systems incomparable, or even invalid.
we additionally perform a detailed evaluation of the effects of training and testing on different resources, providing insight into the challenges involved in applying a system beyond the data it was trained on.
