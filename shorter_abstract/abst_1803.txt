the findings suggest that the interaction between mef <dig> and ppar factors may provide a molecular basis for interspecies differences in the transcriptional regulation of the bcmo <dig> gene.
mutation of both promoter elements abrogated the expression of intestinal cell bcmo <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays and transcription factor co-expression in tc- <dig> cells showed mef2c and pparÎ³ bind to their respective dna elements and synergistically transactivate bcmo <dig> expression.
we demonstrate that the proximal promoter sequence, nt - <dig> to + <dig>  confers basal transcriptional activity of the human bcmo <dig> gene.
we identified and functionally characterized the human bcmo <dig> promoter sequence and determined the transcriptional regulation of the bcmo <dig> gene in a bcmo <dig> expressing human intestinal cell line, tc- <dig>  several functional transcription factor-binding sites were identified in the human promoter that are absent in the mouse bcmo <dig> promoter.
site-directed mutagenesis of the myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  binding elements resulted in decreased basal promoter activity.
