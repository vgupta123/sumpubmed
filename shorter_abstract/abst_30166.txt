here, we report that short guanosine monotonic oligonucleotides capable of adopting a g-quartet structure, are effective inhibitors of aggregation.
taken together, our results suggest that a monotonic g-oligonucleotide, capable of adopting a g-quartet conformation is an effective inhibitor of aggregation.
subsequent testing in a cell-based assay revealed that hdg was an effective inhibitor of aggregation of a fusion protein, comprised of a mutant htt fragment and green fluorescent protein .
this oligonucleotide can also enable cell survival in pc <dig> cells overexpressing a mutant htt fragment fusion gene.
single-stranded dna oligonucleotides capable of forming stable g-quartets can inhibit aggregation of the mutant htt fragment protein.
the pathogenesis of the disease appears to center on the development of protein aggregates that arise initially from the misfolding of the mutant hd protein.
our results reveal a new class of agents that could be developed as a therapeutic approach for huntington's disease.
