an epitope conservancy analysis tool was developed to analyze the variability or conservation of epitopes.
conversely, in a diagnostic and disease monitoring setting, epitopes that are specific to a given pathogen strain, for example, can be used to monitor responses to that particular infectious strain.
the tool was implemented as a component of the immune epitope database and analysis resources , and is directly accessible at .
to assist in the selection of epitopes with the desired degree of conservation, we have developed a new tool to determine the variability of epitopes within a given set of protein sequences.
