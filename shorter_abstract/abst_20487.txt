the amino acid sequences of chloroplast prxii are widely conserved between the investigated species.
in contrast to most cormophytes, our results predict that chloroplast apx activity is restricted to the stroma in chlamydomonas and to thylakoids in physcomitrella.
throughout plant evolution, there was a strong selective pressure on maintaining the activity of all three investigated types of peroxidases in chloroplasts.
the exon-intron-structures of 2cp genes differ between chlorophytes and streptophytes indicating an independent evolution.
the moss gene is of retrotransposonal origin.
stromal and thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidases  share common splice sites demonstrating that they evolved from a common ancestral gene.
the similarity of splice sites also demonstrates that streptophyte glutathione peroxidases  are of common origin.
here, the genomes of the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii and the seed plant arabidopsis thaliana were screened for orfs encoding chloroplast peroxidases.
a conserved splice site indicates also a common origin of chlorobiont prxq.
the enzymes of the chloroplast antioxidant system are exclusively nuclear encoded.
according to amino acid sequence characteristics only the a-isoform of chlamydomonas 2cp may be functionally equivalent to streptophyte 2cp, while the weakly expressed b- and c-isoforms show chlorophyte specific surfaces and amino acid sequence characteristics.
besides a less related cysteine-type gpx, chlamydomonas encodes two selenocysteine-type gpx.
oxygenic photosynthesis is accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species , which damage proteins, lipids, dna and finally limit plant yield.
the identified genes were compared for their amino acid sequence similarities and gene structures.
