our study revealed that the different serovars primarily infect monocytes and dcs in a comparable fashion, however undergo differential infection outcome, serovar l <dig> being the only candidate to inflict active infection.
monocytes are considered to disseminate this pathogen throughout the body while dendritic cells  play an important role in mediating immune response against bacterial infection.
our results demonstrate that the host pathogen interaction in chlamydia infection is not only serovar specific but manifests cell specific features, inducing separate immune response cascade in monocytes and dcs.
to determine the fate of c. trachomatis within human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs, these two sets of immune cells were infected with serovars ba, d and l <dig>  representative of the three biovariants of c. trachomatis.
moreover, the c. trachomatis serovars ba and d become persistent in monocytes while the serovars predominantly suffer degradation within dcs.
chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacteria which consist of three biovariants; trachoma , urogenital  and lymphogranuloma venereum , causing a wide spectrum of disease in humans.
the heightened levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted by the chlamydial infection in dcs compared to monocytes seemed to be instrumental for this consequence.
the immune genes induced in monocytes and dcs against chlamydial infection involves a different set of toll-like receptors, indicating that distinct intracellular signalling pathways are adopted for immune response.
