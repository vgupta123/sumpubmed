the proteases were purified partially using ion-exchange chromatography and their effects were tested in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier using human brain microvascular endothelial cells .
however, the serine protease exhibited hbmec monolayer disruptions  suggesting a role in blood-brain barrier perturbations.
using an encephalitis isolate belonging to t <dig> genotype, we observed two major proteases with approximate molecular weights of  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd on sds-page gels using gelatin as substrate.
overall, these data suggest that acanthamoeba proteases digest ecm, which may play crucial role in invasion of the brain tissue by amoebae.
the  <dig> kd protease was inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  suggesting that it is a serine protease, while the  <dig> kd protease was inhibited with  <dig>  10-phenanthroline suggesting that it is a metalloprotease.
neither the serine nor the metalloprotease exhibited hbmec cytotoxicity.
these proteases degrade extracellular matrix , which provide structural and functional support to the brain tissue, as shown by the degradation of collagen i and iii , elastin , plasminogen , as well as casein and haemoglobin.
both proteases exhibited maximal activity at neutral ph and over a range of temperatures, indicating their physiological relevance.
