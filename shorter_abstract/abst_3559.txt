a discriminant analysis using the morphometric variables reliably assigns individuals into their respective species groups.
our results suggest that epigenetic variation might be one of the drivers of the phenotypic divergence between diploid and tetraploid taxa and discuss that intergenome silencing offers a plausible mechanistic explanation for the observed phenotypic divergence between these microspecies.
however, whilst there was little separation possible between ploidy levels on the basis of genetic profiles, there was clear and pronounced interploidy discrimination on the basis of epigenetic profiles.
the extent of morphological differentiation between these species was assessed using ten diagnostic morphometric characters.
these results also suggest that epigenetic profiling offer an additional tool to infer ploidy level in stored specimens and that stable epigenetic change may play an important role in apomict evolution and species recognition.
we found that only modest genetic and epigenetic differentiation was revealed between species by methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism .
