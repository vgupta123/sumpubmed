principal component analysis of gene expression and analysis of the number of degs suggested that the ail had a transcriptomic response more similar to the fayoumi than the broiler line during acute heat stress.
the number of degs also suggested that acute heat stress had greater impact on the broiler liver transcriptome than chronic heat stress.
high ambient temperatures cause stress in poultry, especially for broiler lines, which are genetically selected for rapid muscle growth.
ingenuity pathway analysis  created a novel network that combines the heat shock protein family with immune response genes.
we investigated the effects of acute  and chronic  heat stress on the liver transcriptome of 3-week-old chicks of a heat-susceptible broiler line, a heat-resistant fayoumi line, and their advanced intercross line .
contrasting genetic lines under similar heat treatments, the highest number of degs appeared between fayoumi and broiler lines.
this study extends our understanding of the liver transcriptome response to different heat exposure treatments in distinct genetic chicken lines and provides information necessary for breeding birds to be more resilient to the negative impacts of heat.
