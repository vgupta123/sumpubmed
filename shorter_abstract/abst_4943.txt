in this paper, we analyzed a  <dig> -year-old bison schoetensaki bone sample from the sir√©jol cave  and a cave hyena coprolite  found in a nearby cave and containing large amounts of bovinae dna.
despite extensive genetic studies carried out on the steppe and european bison, no remains from the fossil record morphologically identified as bison schoetensacki has been analyzed up to now.
this clade only includes ancient bison specimens without taxonomic identification and displays a sister relationship with the extant european bison.
bison schoetensacki remains are documented in eurasian middle pleistocene sites, but their presence in upper pleistocene sites has been questioned.
this work provides genetic evidence supporting the continuing presence of bison schoetensacki up to the upper pleistocene.
bison schoetensacki turns out to be a sister species of bison bonasus, excluding the steppe bison bison priscus as a direct ancestor of the european bison.
the european bison , now found in europe and the caucasus, has been proposed to originate either from the extinct steppe/extant american bison lineage or from the extinct bison schoetensacki lineage.
the genetic proximity of bison schoetensacki with specimens from this clade is corroborated by the analysis of nuclear dna single nucleotide polymorphisms.
