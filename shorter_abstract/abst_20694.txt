the experimental results show that the current programs show better performance on fischer and novotny's benchmark datasets, than state of the art programs, e.g.
finally, the sequence neighborhood based program was used in extensive fold and non-topological similarity detection experiments.
a novel and fast technique for comparing sequence neighborhoods is also developed.
the accuracy of the fold detection experiments with the new measure of similarity was found to be similar or better than that of the standard algorithm ce.
our programs were also found to calculate correct alignments for proteins with huge amount of indels and internal repeats.
a new method for computing equivalences having non-topological similarities from pairwise similarity score is described.
in this article, we describe a protein structure comparison scheme, which is capable of detecting correct alignments even in difficult cases, e.g.
a new scheme, resulting in two algorithms, have been developed, implemented and tested.
