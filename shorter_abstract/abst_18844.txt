we show the utility of this approach by identifying a putative rock <dig> substrate, elongation initiation factor-1-α <dig>  we further show that the major site of rock <dig> phosphorylation of eif1α <dig> is thr <dig>
the analog sensitive protein, m160a rock <dig>  was highly active and could phosphorylate proteins from a cellular homogenate with
