however, the arrangement of the two receptor subunits is essential for the inhibitory activity.
we found mosm induced stat <dig> phosphorylation to be suppressed only when the mosmr fragment was fused in front of the mgp <dig> fragment.
since mosm-rfp is encoded by a single gene it offers numerous possibilities for specific cytokine inhibition in gene delivery approaches based on viral vectors, transgenic animals and finally gene therapy.
we constructed receptor fusion proteins  consisting of the ligand binding domains of the murine oncostatin m  receptor subunits mosmr and mgp <dig> connected by a flexible linker as potential mosm inhibitors.
most cytokines signal through heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of two or more different receptor subunits.
fusion proteins of the extracellular parts of receptor subunits turned out to be promising cytokine inhibitors useful in anti-cytokine therapy and cytokine research.
