a web interface to biana providing basic functionalities is also available.
biana is a python framework designed to achieve two major goals: i) the integration of multiple sources of biological information, including biological entities and their relationships, and ii) the management of biological information as a network where entities are nodes and relationships are edges.
without good integration strategies, it is difficult to analyze the whole set of available data and its properties.
in particular, there is an important need for data unification in the study and use of protein-protein interactions.
biana's approach to data unification solves many of the nomenclature issues common to systems dealing with biological data.
the unification protocol allows biana to be a flexible tool suitable for different user requirements: non-expert users can use a suggested unification protocol while expert users can define their own specific unification rules.
we introduce biana , a tool for biological information integration and network management.
the analysis and usage of biological data is hindered by the spread of information across multiple repositories and the difficulties posed by different nomenclature systems and storage formats.
