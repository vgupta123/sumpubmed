by combining escience and bayesian methods, we retrieve scientific information and data from multiple sources and coherently incorporate them into large models.
however, bayesian methods are in general computationally demanding and require specification of possibly thousands of prior distributions.
the escience-bayes thus approach permits us to fully leverage on the advantages of bayesian methods, resulting in models with improved predictive performance that gives more information about the underlying biological system.
analysis of omics data is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, resulting in imprecise estimates of model parameters and performance.
moreover, the integration of omics data with other data sources is difficult to shoehorn into classical statistical models.
we present a general approach to omics data analysis that alleviates these problems.
bayesian statistics provide the flexibility to tailor statistical models to the complex data structures in omics biology as well as permitting coherent integration of multiple data sources.
this has resulted in ad hoc approaches to address specific problems.
