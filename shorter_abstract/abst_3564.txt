the nitrogenase post-translational control by ammonium was studied and the results showed that the glnk mutant is partially defective in nitrogenase inactivation upon addition of ammonium while the glnb mutant has a wild-type phenotype.
the glnb gene is monocistronic and its expression is constitutive, while glnk is located in the nlmaglnkamtb operon and is expressed under nitrogen-limiting conditions.
in herbaspirillum seropedicae, two pii-like proteins , encoded by the genes glnb and glnk, were identified.
in order to determine the involvement of the h. seropedicae glnb and glnk gene products in nitrogen fixation, a series of mutant strains were constructed and characterized.
our results indicate that glnk is mainly responsible for nifa activity regulation and ammonium-dependent post-translational regulation of nitrogenase in h. seropedicae.
the glnk- mutants were deficient in nitrogen fixation and they were complemented by plasmids expressing the glnk protein or an n-truncated form of nifa.
the pii protein family comprises homotrimeric proteins which act as transducers of the cellular nitrogen and carbon status in prokaryotes and plants.
