although a complete understanding of cellular processes will be dependent on an explicit characterization of the intermolecular interactions that underlie these assemblies and mediate molecular recognition, these are not well described by standard representations.
distance and angle terms are used to distinguish  <dig> different interaction types, including van der waals contacts, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts.
here we present piccolo, a comprehensive relational database capturing the details of structurally characterized protein-protein interactions.
this is exemplified by an analysis of residue propensity and interface contact preferences derived from a much larger data set than previously reported.
the current piccolo database comprises more than  <dig> million interacting atom pairs from  <dig>  protein complexes.
interactions are described at the level of interacting pairs of atoms, residues and polypeptide chains, with the physico-chemical nature of the interactions being characterized.
the explicit aim of piccolo is to underpin large-scale analyses of the properties of protein-protein interfaces.
