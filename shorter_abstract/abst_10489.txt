we confirmed the well known relationship between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases but also identified statistically significant relationships with respect to cancer and aging.
moreover, significant metabolic pathways such as apoptosis, cancer and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction have also been identified by enrichment analysis.
several indexes of centrality have been explored for hubs detection as well as the enrichment statistical analysis of metabolic pathway and disease.
more must be done in this area to resolve the identification of unknown interactions of proteins/genes and also for a better integration of metabolic pathways and diseases.
we obtained flt <dig>  vegfa, fn <dig>  f <dig> and pgf genes with the highest scores by hubs analysis; however, we also found other genes as pdia <dig>  lyn, sh2b <dig> and ndrg <dig> with high scores.
from this dataset the associated protein-protein interaction network has been obtained.
