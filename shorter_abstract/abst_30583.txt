our results contribute to previous observations showing that a major component of adaptation in microbial evolution experiments is toward restoration to the unstressed state.
phenotypic variation associated statistically with genetic variation, demonstrating a genetic basis for phenotypic change.
most  phenotypic variation was restorative, shifting the phenotype from the acclimated state back toward the unstressed state.
novel phenotypes were more rare, comprising between  <dig> and 18 % of informative phenotypic variation.
in addition, we found that a large deletion strongly affected phenotypic variation.
we explored associations between biolog phenotypes and genotypes, and we also investigated phenotypic differences between clones that have one of two adaptive genetic trajectories: one that is typified by mutations in the rna polymerase β-subunit  and another that is defined by mutations in the rho termination factor.
the mutations that accrue during adaptation may contribute to completely novel phenotypes, or they may instead act to restore the phenotype from a stressed to a pre-stress condition.
finally, we demonstrated that the two genetic trajectories leading to thermal adaptation encompass different phenotypes.
finally, clones with rpob mutations differed in phenotype from those with rho mutations, largely due to differences in chemical sensitivity.
in the short-term, organisms acclimate to stress through phenotypic plasticity, but in the longer term they adapt to stress genetically.
