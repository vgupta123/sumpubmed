alanine substitutions of two or more of four critical leucine residues within the c-terminal heptad repeats completely eliminate the cby-cby interaction.
more importantly, cby homodimerization is required for its efficient interaction with the nuclear import receptor importin-α and subsequent nuclear translocation.
our comprehensive mutational analysis of the cby coiled-coil domain reveals that the four heptad leucine residues play an essential role in mediating cby homodimerization.
chibby  is an evolutionarily conserved molecule that physically interacts with the key downstream coactivator β-catenin and represses its transcriptional activation potential.
although monomeric cby is sufficient to bind to β-catenin and block β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation, homodimer formation of cby is indispensable for its efficient nuclear import.
although cby harbors a predicted coiled-coil motif in the c-terminal region, its molecular nature and functional importance remain largely unexplored.
the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays crucial roles in embryonic development and in maintenance of organs and tissues in adults.
furthermore, we found that dimerization-deficient cby mutants still retain the ability to bind to β-catenin and to repress β-catenin-dependent gene activation.
the cby oligomer predominantly exists as a homodimer.
here we report that cby forms a stable complex with itself.
