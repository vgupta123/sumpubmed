the gene families, including dcl, hen <dig>  se, hyl <dig>  hst, rdr, nrpd <dig>  nrpd2/nrpe <dig>  nrpe <dig>  and ago, were analyzed for gene structures, phylogenetic relationships, and protein motifs.
many organisms including plants use rna silencing to regulate development and physiology, and to maintain genome stability.
the gene expression was validated using rna-seq, expressed sequence tags , and reverse transcription pcr .
the frameworks of mirna and sirna pathways have been established in the model plant, arabidopsis thaliana .
rna silencing is a process triggered by 21– <dig> small rnas to repress gene expression.
plants possess two classes of small rnas: micrornas  and small interfering rnas .
