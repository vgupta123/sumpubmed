to estimate the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history, we employed bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze data supermatrices comprising  <dig> mitochondrial genes  from  <dig> species across  <dig> genera and  <dig> nuclear genes  from  <dig> genera.
many taxa were only partially represented, with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mitochondrial genes per species and per genus, respectively, and  <dig>  nuclear genes per genus.
we present an up-to-date, comprehensive estimate of the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history.
date estimates for nodes within each family and genus are presented, with estimates for key splits including: strepsirrhini-haplorrhini  <dig> million years ago , lemuriformes-lorisiformes  <dig> mya, platyrrhini-catarrhini  <dig> mya and cercopithecoidea-hominoidea  <dig> mya.
although considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of the primate phylogeny, increased data sampling, particularly from nuclear loci, will be able to provide further resolution.
within haplorrhini, we find support for the primary divergence of pitheciidae in platyrrhini, and our results suggest a sister grouping of african and non-african colobines within colobinae and of cercopithecini and papionini within cercopthecinae.
our analyses of mitochondrial dna place tarsiiformes as the sister group of strepsirrhini.
composite estimates for the entire order have been infrequently attempted, with the last phylogenetic reconstruction spanning the full range of primate evolutionary relationships having been conducted over a decade ago.
