here we develop and implement a new markov chain simulation algorithm to generate simple, connected random graphs that have a specified degree sequence and level of clustering, but are random in all other respects.
these graphs allow for systematic study of the impacts of connectivity and redundancies on network function and dynamics.
finding appropriate null models is crucial in bioinformatics research, and is often difficult, particularly for biological networks.
this process is a key step in unraveling the functional consequences of the structural properties of empirical biological systems and uncovering the mechanisms that drive these systems.
the implementation of the algorithm  provides the generation of random graphs optimized according to a local or global, and relative or absolute measure of clustering.
as we demonstrate, the networks generated by clustrnet can serve as random controls when investigating the impacts of complex network features beyond the byproduct of degree and clustering in empirical networks.
networks of biochemical interactions among proteins, epidemiological contacts among hosts, and trophic interactions in ecosystems, to name a few, have provided useful insights into the dynamical processes that shape and traverse these systems.
