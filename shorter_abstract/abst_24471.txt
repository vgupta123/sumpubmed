we have built an informatics framework based on these atlases for the representation of neuroanatomical knowledge.
each data-map in this system is simply a stack of vector images with one image per atlas level, so any set of accurate drawings made onto a supported atlas  could be uploaded into neuart ii.
presently the database is populated with a corpus of high-quality neuroanatomical data from the laboratory of dr larry swanson .
neuart ii, the neuroinformatics tool presented here, provides an accurate and powerful way of representing neuroanatomical data in the context of commonly-used brain atlases for visualization, comparison and analysis.
neuart ii also permits users to view multiple levels on multiple atlases at once.
herein we take selective examples from these data to demonstrate the features of neuart ii.
the neuart ii tool operates within a bioinformatics knowledge management platform  either as a standalone or a plug-in application.
published neuroanatomical atlases provide a spatial framework for these studies.
this framework not only captures current methods of anatomical data acquisition and analysis, it allows these studies to be collated, compared and synthesized within a single system.
anatomical studies of neural circuitry describing the basic wiring diagram of the brain produce intrinsically spatial, highly complex data of great value to the neuroscience community.
