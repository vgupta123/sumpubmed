recent studies indicate that mast cells may play roles in adaptive and innate immunity, suggesting an innovative view of the regulation of immune responses.
we confirmed that ige alone does not trigger mast cell-immediate responses, such as calcium signals, degranulation or protein-phosphorylation.
here, we profiled the transcriptome of human mast cells sensitized with ige alone, or stimulated by fcÎµri aggregation.
this report represents a substantial advance in our understanding of the genome wide effects triggered by "passive sensitization" or active stimulation of human mast cells, supporting mast cells' potential involvement in a wide range of inflammatory responses.
our data was validated using real-time-pcr; elisa and western blot.
mast cells are well established effectors of ige-triggered allergic reactions and immune responses to parasitic infections.
our data show that among  <dig>  genes examined,  <dig> genes are differentially regulated in stimulated mast cells when compared with resting/unstimulated mast cells.
