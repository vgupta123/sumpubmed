while this pathogen is considered as extremely clonal and resistant to horizontal gene exchange, there are many facts supporting the hypothesis that on the early stages of evolution the development of pathogenicity of ancestral mtb has started with a horizontal acquisition of virulence factors.
if so, what is the role of horizontal gene transfer in this process?

it was shown that the ancient genomic islands from m. tuberculosis still may be rooted to the pool of mobile genetic vectors distributed among mycobacteria.
mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most dangerous human pathogens, the causative agent of tuberculosis.
recent activation of genetic vectors circulating among mycobacteria potentially may lead to emergence of new pathogens from environmental and conditionally pathogenic mycobacteria.
episodes of infections caused by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria reported worldwide may suggest a potential for new pathogens to appear.
availing of accessibility of complete genomes sequences of multiple pathogenic, conditionally pathogenic and saprophytic mycobacteria, a genome comparative study was performed to investigate the distribution of genomic islands among bacteria and identify ontological links between these mobile elements.
a frequent exchange of genes was observed between m. marinum and several saprophytic and conditionally pathogenic species.
the species which require monitoring are m. marinum and m. avium as they eagerly acquire genes from different sources and may become donors of virulence gene cassettes to other micro-organisms.
among them m. avium was the most promiscuous species acquiring genetic materials from diverse origins.
