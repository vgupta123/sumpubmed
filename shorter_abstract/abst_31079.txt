cortisol measures, collected in two large samples of horses using both plasma sampling as well as faecal sampling , therefore do not indicate that stereotypic horses cope better, at least in terms of adrenocortical activity.
attempts to link stereotypic behaviours with glucocorticoids however have yielded contradictory results.
results showed that 1) plasma cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites concentrations did not differ between horses displaying stereotypic behaviours and non-stereotypic horses and 2) both oral and motor stereotypic behaviour levels did not predict plasma cortisol or faecal cortisol metabolites concentrations.
here we investigated correlates of oral and motor stereotypic behaviours and glucocorticoid levels in two large samples of domestic horses , kept in sub-optimal conditions , and already known to experience poor welfare states.
among the different hypotheses, the coping hypothesis predicts that stereotypic behaviours provide a way for animals in unfavourable environmental conditions to adjust.
each horse was observed in its box using focal sampling  and instantaneous scan sampling .
as such, they are expected to have a lower physiological stress level  than non-stereotypic animals.
repetitive behaviours induced by frustration, repeated attempts to cope and/or brain dysfunction, are intriguing as they occur in a variety of domestic and captive species without any clear adaptive function.
plasma samples  but also non-invasive faecal samples  were retrieved in order to assess cortisol levels.
