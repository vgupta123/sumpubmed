variant gli binding sites with relatively low affinity can within natural promoters lead to strong transcriptional activation.
we quantified transcriptional activation by gli using ptch <dig> promoter based luciferase reporters containing all single substitutions of the gli consensus binding site.
the affinity of variant single substitutions in gli binding sites has been measured systematically, but the affinities of the variant binding sites appears low compared to the frequency of occurrence of variant sites in known gli target gene promoters.
the gli transcription factors, mediators of the hedgehog signal bind with high affinity to the consensus sequence gaccaccca.
