pseudoplusia includens single nucleopolyhedrovirus  is a baculovirus recently identified in our laboratory, with high pathogenicity to the soybean looper, chrysodeixis includens  .
the circular double-stranded dna genome is  <dig> Â bp in length, with a gc content of  <dig>  % and contains  <dig> open reading frames .
the p <dig> phylogenetic tree suggests that this gene was obtained from three independent acquisition events within the baculoviridae family.
p <dig> is thought to be required for optimal virion occlusion in the occlusion bodies , but its function is not well characterized.
the presence of a signal peptide only in the psinsnpv p26a/orf- <dig> homolog indicates distinct function between the two p <dig> proteins.
in brazil, the c. includens caterpillar is an emerging pest and has caused significant losses in soybean and cotton crops.
the complete genome sequence of psinsnpv will provide a valuable resource, contributing to studies on its molecular biology and functional genomics, and will promote the development of this virus as an effective bioinsecticide.
psinsnpv possesses the  <dig> conserved baculovirus core genes,  <dig> genes found in other baculoviruses and  <dig> unique orfs.
the psinsnpv genome was determined and the phylogeny of the p <dig> gene within the family baculoviridae was investigated.
the homologous repeats  are absent from the psinsnpv genome, which is also the case in chchnpv and tnsnpv.
two p <dig> gene homologs  were found in the psinsnpv genome.
two baculovirus repeat orfs  homologs, bro-a  and bro-b , were identified and compared with chrysodeixis chalcites nucleopolyhedrovirus  and trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus  bro genes and showed high similarity, suggesting that these genes may be derived from an ancestor common to these viruses.
