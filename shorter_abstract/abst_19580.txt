we identified a novel qtl, qach controlling chill haze of beer, and two key haze active proteins, bati-cmb and bati-cmd.
in bright beer, haze formation is a serious quality problem, degrading beer quality and reducing its shelf life.
bioinformatics analysis showed that bati-cmb and bati-cmd had the same position as qach in the chromosome.
in this study, the genetic mechanism of the factors affecting beer haze stability in barley was studied.
one qtl, named as qach, was detected for ach, and it was located on the position of about 108 cm in chromosome 4h and can explain about 20 % of the phenotypic variation.
polymorphism comparison between yerong and franklin in the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of bati-cmb and bati-cmd detected the corresponding gene specific markers, which could be used in marker-assisted selection for malt barley breeding.
and further analysis showed that bati-cmb and bati-cmd might be the candidate genes associated with beer chill haze.
the quality of barley  malt, as the main raw material for beer brewing, largely affects the colloidal stability of beer.
it may be deduced that bati-cmb and bati-cmd are candidate genes for qach, controlling colloidal stability of beer.
quantitative trait loci  analysis of alcohol chill haze  in beer was carried out using a franklin/yerong double haploid  population.
two key haze active proteins, bati-cmb and bati-cmd were identified by proteomics analysis.
