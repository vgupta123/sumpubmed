using a standard approach to represent protein subsequences by their evolutionary profile, we trained neural networks to predict multiclass target vectors corresponding to  <dig> possible contacting dinucleotide subsequences.
we analyzed basic statistics of amino acid-dinucleotide contacts in protein-rna complexes and found their pairing preferences could be identified.
a web server predicting the 16-dimensional contact probability matrix directly from a user-defined protein sequence was implemented and made available at: http://tardis.nibio.go.jp/netasa/srcpred.
dinucleotide-specific contact predictions have also been extended to the prediction of interacting protein and rna fragment pairs, which shows the applicability of this method to predict targets of rna-binding proteins.
interaction preferences of protein subsequences and dinucleotides can be inferred from protein-rna complex structures, enabling a training-based prediction approach.
