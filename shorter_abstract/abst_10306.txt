whilst the frequency of vessels was reduced in tension wood tissue , the total vessel volume was significantly increased.
variation in the reaction wood  response has been shown to be a principle component driving differences in lignocellulosic sugar yield from the bioenergy crop willow.
the phenotypic cause behind these differences in sugar yield, beyond their common elicitor, however, remain unclear.
major architectural alterations were successfully quantified in 3d and attributed to rw induction.
the remodelling suggests an important physiological compromise between structural and hydraulic architecture necessary for extensive alteration of biomass and helps to demonstrate the power of improving our perspective of cell and tissue architecture.
here we use x-ray micro-computed tomography  to investigate rw-associated alterations in secondary xylem tissue patterning in three dimensions .
