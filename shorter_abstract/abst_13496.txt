for our dataset neither age of the historic data, nor the number of observation years impacted the algorithm.
we also explore how characteristics of the matrix interact with the algorithm, and how best to predict the probability of observing a previously unseen species.
point counts of birds taken at stanford university's jasper ridge biological preserve between  <dig> and  <dig> were used to examine the algorithm.
historic observation data from the census geographic area helps minimize question volume.
we sketch our species identification tool for palm sized computers that helps knowledgeable observers with census activities.
for rare birds the history based algorithms did not impose a noticeable penalty in the number of questions required for identification.
we explore how much historic data is required to boost performance, and whether the use of history negatively impacts identification of rare species.
we found that laplace smoothing performed better for rare species than simple good-turing, and that, contrary to expectation, the technique did not then adversely affect identification performance for frequently observed birds.
historic data improved identification speed, but only impacted the top 25% most frequently observed birds.
intrinsic differences in identifying different birds did affect the algorithm, but the differences affected the baseline method of not using historic data to exactly the same degree.
