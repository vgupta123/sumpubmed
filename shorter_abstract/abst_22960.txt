some orthologous groups were enriched with our positive predictions.
a second example is the orthologous group of the eif4g repression protein sbp1p, which has two homologous genes known to be translated by this cap-independent mechanism, one in mice and the other in yeast.
currently, only a limited number of these regulatory elements have been experimentally identified.
these examples emphasize the wide conservation of these regulatory elements as a result of selective pressure.
the initiation of translation via cellular internal ribosome entry sites plays an important role in the stress response and certain physiological conditions in which canonical cap-dependent translation initiation is compromised.

a remarkable example of this functional association is our prediction of internal ribosome entry sites elements in three components of the rna polymerase ii mediator complex.
in addition, we performed a protein-protein interaction network characterization of the gene products of our positive predictions using saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, which revealed a highly connected and modular topology, suggesting a functional association.
our analysis suggests that fungi show evolutionary conservation and functional association of proteins translated by this cap-independent mechanism.
additionally, we performed a comparative analysis and characterization of the functional relationships among the gene products predicted to be translated by this cap-independent mechanism.
