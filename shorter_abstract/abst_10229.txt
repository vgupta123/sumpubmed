these data were compared to similar data available for a different ty <dig> isolate  and essential genes identified in e. coli k- <dig> .
four of these genes  are not found in e. coli.
the contribution of a gene to the fitness of a bacterium can be assayed by whether and to what degree the bacterium tolerates transposon insertions in that gene.
of  <dig> genes considered essential in eco, all had syntenic homologs in stm <dig>  sty <dig>  and sty <dig>  and all but nine genes were either devoid of transposon insertions or had very few.
further differences in fitness profiles among shared genes can be expected in other selective environments, with potential relevance for comparative systems biology.
comparisons among transposon integration profiles from different members of a species and among related species, all grown in similar conditions, identify differences in gene contributions to fitness among syntenic homologs.
we use this fact to compare the fitness of syntenic homologous genes among related salmonella strains and thereby reveal differences not apparent at the gene sequence level.
an additional  <dig> genes were almost entirely devoid of transposon integrations in all three salmonella strains examined, including many genes associated with protein and dna synthesis.
a transposon tn <dig> derivative was used to construct mutants in salmonella typhimurium atcc <dig>  and salmonella typhi ty <dig> , which were then grown in rich media.
for three of these nine genes, part of the annotated gene lacked transposon integrations .
