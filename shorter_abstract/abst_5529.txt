by high throughput sequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic dna we have identified cggbp <dig> to be a negative regulator of cpg methylation at repetitive dna sequences.
cggbp <dig> is a repetitive dna-binding transcription regulator with target sites at cpg-rich sequences such as cgg repeats and alu-sines and l1-lines.
at cpg-rich sequences cytosine methylation is a major mechanism of transcriptional repression.
concordantly, gene-rich regions typically carry lower levels of cpg methylation than the repetitive elements.
the results clearly show that cggbp <dig> is a possible bidirectional regulator of cpg methylation at alus, and acts as a repressor of methylation at l <dig> retrotransposons.
the role of cggbp <dig> as a possible mediator of cpg methylation however remains unknown.
it is well known that at interspersed repeats alu-sines and l1-lines high levels of cpg methylation constitute a transcriptional silencing and retrotransposon inactivating mechanism.
here, we have studied genome-wide cpg methylation with or without cggbp1-depletion.
in addition, we have studied cpg methylation alterations on alu and l <dig> retrotransposons in cggbp1-depleted cells using a novel bisulfite-treatment and high throughput sequencing approach.
