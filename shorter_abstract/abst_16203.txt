its performance is demonstrated for different applications including the prediction of disordered regions in partially unfolded proteins and of interacting regions in protein complexes.
the method is not restricted to nmr data, but is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of information.
this can be achieved by comparing experimental data of the same protein in two different states .
