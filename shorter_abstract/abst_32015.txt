interestingly, there was a significant difference when we compared the expression variation of the  <dig> lincrnas with the  <dig>  known selected protein-encoding genes found in all muscle samples.
using a computational pipeline, we defined a stringent set of  <dig> different lincrnas with  <dig> lincrnas found in all nine muscle samples.
as for the first time, our study identified lincrnas from nine different samples from the same tissue, it is possible to analyse the inter-individual variability of the gene expression level of the identified lincrnas.
to identify lincrnas, we used paired-end rna sequencing  to explore the transcriptomes of longissimus thoraci from nine limousin bull calves.
some of the lincrnas expressed in muscle are located within quantitative trait loci for meat quality traits.
it may prove useful to elucidate their effect on mechanisms underlying the genetic variability of meat quality traits.
in the present study, we performed a survey in bovine longissimus thoraci of lincrnas .
bovine lincrnas share characteristics seen in their mammalian counterparts: relatively short transcript and gene lengths, low exon number and significantly lower expression, compared to protein-encoding genes.
to our knowledge, this represents the first such study in bovine muscle.
our study provides a glimpse into the lincrna content of bovine muscle and will facilitate future experimental studies to unravel the function of these molecules.
this catalog will complement the list of lincrnas already discovered in cattle and therefore will help to better annotate the bovine genome.
