furthermore, we showed that this effect is mediated by a modification of rna pol ii binding on the promoters tested and that ie <dig> phosphorylation was essential for these effects.
using transient transfection assays, ie <dig> has been shown to repress viral and cellular promoters containing typical tata boxes by interacting with general transcription factors.
varicella zoster virus immediate early  <dig> protein  has been shown to be essential for vzv replication, and critical for latency establishment.
in mewo cells, the number of genes whose transcription was modified by ie <dig> was somewhat higher, including genes implicated in signal transduction, transcription, immunity, and heat-shock signalling.
while ie <dig> did not modify the basal expression of several nf-κb dependent genes such as il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα, it modulates transcription of these genes upon tnfα induction.
we found that ie <dig> modulates the transcription of only a few genes in hela cells including genes implicated in transcription or immunity.
while ie <dig> only affected transcription of a small number of cellular genes, it interfered with the tnf-inducibility of several nf-κb dependent genes by the accelerated resynthesis of the inhibitor iκbα.
