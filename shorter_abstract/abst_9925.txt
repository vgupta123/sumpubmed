the chicken genome was sequenced because of its phylogenetic position as a non-mammalian vertebrate, its use as a biomedical model especially to study embryology and development, its role as a source of human disease organisms and its importance as the major source of animal derived food protein.
we analysed eight chicken tissues and improved the chicken genome structural annotation by providing experimental support for the in vivo expression of  <dig>  computationally predicted proteins, including  <dig> chicken proteins that were only electronically predicted or hypothetical translations in human.
to improve functional annotation , we mapped these identified proteins to their human and mouse orthologs and used this orthology to transfer gene ontology  functional annotations to the chicken proteins.
these experimentally-supported predicted proteins were further annotated by assigning the proteins with standardized nomenclature and functional annotation.
this method is widely applicable to a diverse range of species.
the  <dig>  orthology-based go annotations that we produced represent an 8% increase in currently available chicken go annotations.
