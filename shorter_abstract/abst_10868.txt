the problem of computing the minimum number of such events to explain discordance between two phylogenetic trees is a hard computational problem.
as a spin-off from our simulations we also present terminusest, which is the fastest exact method currently available that can handle nonbinary trees: this is used to measure the accuracy of the nonbinarycyclekiller algorithm.
even for binary trees, exact solvers struggle to solve instances with reticulation number larger than 40- <dig>
