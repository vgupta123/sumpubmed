in the present study, neutral lipid  metabolism and angiogenesis were investigated in hhv8-infected huvec cells.
lipid droplets  were higher in all phases and nl staining  combined with viral-antigen detection  demonstrated a nl content increase in infected cells.

human herpesvirus  <dig> , the causative agent of kaposi’s sarcoma, induces an intense modification of lipid metabolism and enhances the angiogenic process in endothelial cells.
in particular, triglyceride synthesis increases in the lytic phase, whereas cholesteryl ester synthesis rises in the latent one.
