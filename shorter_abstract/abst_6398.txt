molecular data identified the fungus as neofusicoccum parvum .
streptomycetes from the rhizosphere of araucariaceae produce exudates which can suppress the development of pathogenic fungi in their seeds.
the pathogenic fungus from araucaria angustifolia seeds was identified by morphological markers  as belonging to the pezizomycotina.
co-cultures on agar of this fungus with certain streptomycete isolates from the rhizosphere, and from the surface of araucaria roots significantly reduced the growth of the fungus.
