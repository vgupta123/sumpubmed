the feasibility of these vectors was tested with  <dig> putative membrane proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis.
this expression platform features high throughput cloning, high flexibility for different constructs, and high efficiency for membrane protein overexpression, and is expected to be useful in membrane protein structural and functional studies.
the efficiency for direct cloning of these target genes from pcr products was 95% .
for those proteins which showed no expression, three protein fusion partners were prepared and it was found that each of the target proteins could be overexpressed by at least one of these fusions, resulting in the overexpression of two thirds of the cloned genes.
