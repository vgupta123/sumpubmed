showing similarities to the already described vph <dig> and stv <dig> vacuolar atpase subunits from yeast, vha-a revealed a bipartite structure with  a less conserved cytoplasmically orientated n-terminus and  a membrane-spanning c-terminus with a higher extent of conservation including all amino acids shown to be essential for proton translocation in the yeast.
the paper addresses the question of sub-cellular localisation and subunit composition of plant v-atpase in vivo and in vitro mainly by using colocalization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques .
vacuolar h+-atpases are large protein complexes of more than  <dig> kda that acidify endomembrane compartments and are part of the secretory system of eukaryotic cells.
all three sets of results show that v-atpase contains vha-a protein that interacts in a specific manner with other subunits.
immuno-localisation of vha-a shows that the recognized subunit is exclusively located on the endoplasmic reticulum.
this result is in agreement with the hypothesis that the different isoforms of vha-a may localize on distinct endomembrane compartments, as it was shown for its yeast counterpart vph <dig>
