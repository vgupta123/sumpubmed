accuracy of snp identification declines log-linearly with sequence divergence from the reference, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  errors per snp in the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, respectively.
in the gorilla genome, which differs from the human reference by 10%, and in which 46% of these 25b regions contain  <dig> or more snp differences from the reference, only 88% of the sequence is recoverable.
to determine the pattern and limits of such interspecific hybridization, we compared the efficiency of sequence recovery and accuracy of snp identification by a  <dig> -base human-specific microarray challenged with human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and codfish mtdna genomes.
efficiency of sequence recovery declines with the increase of the number of interspecific snps in the 25b interval tiled by the reference oligonucleotides.
such a strategy requires that cross-hybridization between the experimental dnas and reference oligos from the different species not interfere with the accurate recovery of species-specific data.
