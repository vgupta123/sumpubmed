to improve the hybrid system performance, the zuker algorithm is optimally implemented with special methods for cpu and gpu architecture.
prediction of ribonucleic acid  secondary structure remains one of the most important research areas in bioinformatics.
the zuker algorithm is one of the most popular methods of free energy minimization for rna secondary structure prediction.
in this paper, a cpu-gpu hybrid computing system that accelerates zuker algorithm applications for rna secondary structure prediction is proposed.
to the best of our knowledge, no implementation combines both cpu and extra accelerators, such as gpus, to accelerate the zuker algorithm applications.
more than 14% of the sequences are executed on cpu in the hybrid system.
speedup of  <dig> Ã— over optimized multi-core simd cpu implementation and performance advantage of 16% over optimized gpu implementation are shown in the experimental results.
the system combining cpu and gpu to accelerate the zuker algorithm is proven to be promising and can be applied to other bioinformatics applications.
thus far, few studies have been reported on the acceleration of the zuker algorithm on general-purpose processors or on extra accelerators such as field programmable gate-array  and graphics processing units .
performance differences between the cpu and the gpu in the task-allocation scheme are considered to obtain workload balance.
