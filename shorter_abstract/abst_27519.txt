alarm pheromones are commonly looked upon as a system in predator/prey communication, but here we show that alarm pheromones may be used as multipurpose signals such as decreasing the risk of nymphal mating by males.
we report that the aldehydes and 4-oxo--2-hexenal are detected by olfactory receptor neurons housed in smooth and grooved peg sensilla, respectively, on the adult antennae, at biologically relevant concentrations.
behavioural experiments showed that application of 4-oxo--2-hexenal or the two aldehydes at a nymph-emitted ratio, to a male/female pair during mounting initiation, decreased mating frequency to a rate comparable to that of a male/nymph pair.
in support of our hypothesis, nymphs experienced the same percentage of mating with sperm transfer as females if they were unable to emit -2-hexenal, -2-octenal 4-oxo--2-hexenal and 4-oxo--2-octenal, from their dorsal abdominal glands.
abdominal wounding by traumatic insemination and the lack of a long distance attraction pheromone set the scene for unusual sexual signalling systems.
