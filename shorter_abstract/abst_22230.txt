model version control for pathway models shares some of the features of software version control but has a number of differences that warrant a specific solution.
we present a model version control method, along with a prototype implementation, based on xml patches.
trying to produce these results without such methods results in slow and cumbersome development that is prone to frustration and human error.
computational modelling has become an important tool in understanding biological systems such as signalling pathways.
