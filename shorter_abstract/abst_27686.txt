moreover, the type of wastes analysed during this study, namely a mixture of fresh cattle manure, bedding and rumen content, needs a longer storage period or, alternatively, of specific chemical, biological or thermal treatments for stabilization.
the documented overload situation seems to lay the basis for an ongoing environmental contamination by enteric organisms and opportunistic pathogens circuit faecal-oral route.
microbial analyses highlighted the massive presence of faecal indicators in all samples: mean counts of escherichia coli and enterococci were always above eu limits for marketable processed manure products.
the hygienic evaluation of manure and slurry coming from a plant that collects cattle livestock wastes from a big slaughterhouse was carried out.
conventional isolation techniques failed to detect members of the mycobacterium genus, while by means of is <dig> and f <dig> pcr real-time system on dna directly extracted from environmental samples, the pathogen was detected in all cases.
cultures referable to the genus brucella spp.
de-contamination may be conducted by extended storage, until field conditions are suitable for application to land as source of agricultural nutrients.
