our study for the first time at a genome-wide scale reveals the enhanced transcriptional activity of cell-type-specific tcf7l <dig> intragenic enhancers in regulating gene expression.
we evaluated t-cep on a tcf7l2-omics data.
we further used sirna knockdown, co-transfection, rt-qpcr and luciferase reporter assay not only to validate the accuracy and efficiency of prediction by t-cep, but also to confirm the functionality of tcf7l2-regulated enhancers in both mcf <dig> and panc <dig> cells respectively.
here, we developed a novel computational method, t-cep, for annotating chromatin states associated with a specific tf.
unexpectedly, our method has uncovered a novel set of tcf7l2-regulated intragenic enhancers missed by other software tools, where the associated genes exert the highest gene expression.
t-cep is composed of three key consecutive modules:  data preprocessing,  hmm training, and  potential tf-states calling.
recent studies have suggested that combinations of multiple epigenetic modifications are essential for controlling gene expression.
despite numerous computational approaches have been developed to decipher the combinatorial epigenetic patterns or “epigenetic code”, none of them has explicitly addressed the relationship between a specific transcription factor  and the patterns.
