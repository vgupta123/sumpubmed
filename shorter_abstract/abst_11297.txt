xp <dig> and op <dig> are phages of xanthomonas oryzae pv.
the g+c contents of op <dig>  and xop <dig> and xp <dig>  are less than that of the host .
the three phages exhibit different patterns of domain duplication in the n-terminus of the tail fiber, which are involved in determination of the host range.
some repeated sequences may be involved in duplication/loss of the domains in the tail fiber genes.
geographical separation may have confined lateral gene transfer among the xoo phages.
oryzae , the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice plants, which were isolated in  <dig> in taiwan and in  <dig> in japan, respectively.
the 9-bp 3'-overhangs  in xop <dig> and xp <dig> are absent from op <dig>  more of the deduced xop <dig> proteins share higher degrees of identity with xp <dig> than with op <dig> proteins, while the right end of the genomes of xp <dig> and op <dig>  containing all predicted promoters, share stronger homology.
while the hnn-ap <dig> type endonuclease genes dispersed in the genome, the hnh type endonuclease genes, each with a unique copy, were located within the same genome context.
mass spectrometry and n-terminal sequencing showed nine xop <dig> coat proteins, among which three were identified, six were assigned as coat proteins  and conserved phage proteins  in xp <dig>  the major coat protein, in which only the n-terminal methionine is removed, appears to exist in oligomeric forms containing  <dig> to  <dig> subunits.
xop <dig>  xp <dig>  and op <dig> contain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> freestanding hnh endonuclease genes, respectively.
