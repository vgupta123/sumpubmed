the assembled t. absoluta transcriptome contained  <dig>  contigs with an average size of  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  % of which presented positive blast hits, with  <dig>   annotated by gene ontology.
to explore rna interference  against t. absoluta, sequence information on potential target genes is necessary, but only a few sequences are available in public databases.
from the transcriptome, most of the core genes of the rnai mechanism of lepidoptera were identified indicating the potential suitability of t. absoluta for gene silencing.
five of these genes were evaluated using in vitro transcribed dsrna absorbed by tomato leaflets, which were fed to 1st instar t. absoluta larvae, resulting in significant reduction of larval body weight while exhibiting significant knockdown for three of the genes.
the transcriptome we generated represents a valuable genomic resource for screening potential gene targets that affect the development or survival of t. absoluta larvae.
comparisons of transcript profiles among stages revealed  <dig>  genes differentially expressed at earlier larval stages, from which potential gene targets were identified.
five novel genes that showed greater expression at the 1st larval stage were demonstrated to be effective potential rnai targets by reducing larval weight and can be considered good candidates for use in rnai-mediated crop protection.
a critical step of this technology is the screening of effective target genes essential for insect development and/or survival.
we sequenced six libraries from rna samples from eggs, adults, and larvae at four stages, obtaining an overall total of around  <dig> million reads.
genes from the juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathways were identified, representing potential target genes for systemic silencing.
no contigs displayed significant similarity with a rna-dependent rna polymerase.
