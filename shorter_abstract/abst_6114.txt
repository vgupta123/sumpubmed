we analyzed 16s rrna sequencing data sampled from the microbiota of three different animal species by jeraldo et al.
looking at the model parameters we were able to discriminate between different animal species, giving also a biological explanation.
moreover, the biodiversity estimator obtained by volkov’s model also differentiates the animal species and is in good agreement with the first and second order hill’s numbers, that are common evenness indexes simply based on the fraction of individuals per species.
the rsas, plotted in the form of preston plot, were fitted with volkov’s model.
moreover, the ability to separate different animals with the model parameters and biodiversity number are promising results if we think about future applications on human data, in which the microbiota composition and biodiversity are in close relationships with a variety of diseases and life-styles.
the model fits well the microbiota rsa, except in the tail region, that shows a deviation from the neutrality assumption.
we conclude that the neutrality assumption is a good approximation for the microbiota dynamics and the observation that volkov’s model works for this ecosystem is a further proof of the rsa universality.
these correspond to bacterial species considered at a given phylogenetic level defined by the similarity threshold used in the clustering procedure.
in particular, a simple stochastic neutral model was proposed by volkov et al.
through a clustering procedure , we built the operational taxonomic units.
relying on population dynamics and was proved to fit the coral-reefs and rain forests rsa.
interest in understanding the mechanisms that lead to a particular composition of the gut microbiota is highly increasing, due to the relationship between this ecosystem and the host health state.
