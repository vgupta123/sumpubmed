the results suggest that iaa retards tomato ripening by affecting a set of  key regulators, such as rin, ethylene and aba, and  key effectors, such as genes for lycopene and β-xanthophyll biosynthesis and for chlorophyll degradation.
application of an ethylene precursor  or of an auxin antagonist  to tomato fruits accelerated the color shift, the accumulation of lycopene, α-, β-, and δ-carotenes and the disappearance of β-xanthophylls and chlorophyll b. by contrast, application of auxin  delayed the color shift, the lycopene accumulation and the decrease of chlorophyll a. combined application of iaa + acc led to an intermediate phenotype.
tomato fruit ripening is controlled by ethylene and is characterized by a shift in color from green to red, a strong accumulation of lycopene, and a decrease in β-xanthophylls and chlorophylls.
correlation network analyses suggest that aba, may also be a key regulator of several responses to auxin and ethylene treatments.
