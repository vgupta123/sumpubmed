ubiquitylation plays an important role in regulating protein functions.
ubipred can screen promising ubiquitylation sites from putative non-ubiquitylation sites using prediction scores.
ubipred can predict ubiquitylation sites accompanied with a prediction score each to help biologists in identifying promising sites for experimental verification.
results show that the set of used  <dig> physicochemical properties and support vector machine  are the best kind of features and classifier respectively that their combination has a prediction accuracy of  <dig> % using leave-one-out cross-validation.
to efficiently explore more undiscovered ubiquitylation sites, this study aims to develop an accurate sequence-based prediction method to identify promising ubiquitylation sites.
by applying ubipred,  <dig> promising ubiquitylation sites were identified from an independent dataset of  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites, which were also validated by using the obtained prediction rules.
we have proposed an algorithm ipma for mining informative physicochemical properties from protein sequences to build an svm-based prediction system ubipred.
a prediction system ubipred was implemented by using an svm with the feature set of  <dig> informative physicochemical properties selected by ipma, which can improve the accuracy from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.
consequently, an informative physicochemical property mining algorithm  is proposed to select an informative subset of  <dig> physicochemical properties.
we established an ubiquitylation dataset consisting of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites and  <dig> putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from  <dig> proteins in the ubiprot database.
ubipred has been implemented as a web server and is available at .
to further analyze the informative physicochemical properties, a decision tree method c <dig>  was used to acquire if-then rule-based knowledge of predicting ubiquitylation sites.
recently, experimental methods were developed toward effective identification of ubiquitylation sites.
this study first evaluates promising sequence-based features and classifiers for the prediction of ubiquitylation sites by assessing three kinds of features  and three classifiers .
