this study suggests that mycobacteria depend on tftrs for the transcriptional control of a number of metabolic functions yet the physiological role of the majority of these regulators remain unknown.
analyses of divergent genes indicated that the tftrs control diverse biochemical functions not limited to efflux pumps.
the c-terminal ligand binding domain from the tftr complement in m. tuberculosis showed great diversity in amino acid sequence but with an overall architecture common to other tftrs.
we used interpro to classify the entire complement of transcriptional regulators in  <dig> mycobacterial species and these analyses showed that tftrs are the most abundant family of regulators in all species.
in this study we focused on the tetr family of transcriptional regulators  in mycobacteria.
