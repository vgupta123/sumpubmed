however they have limited applicability to some areas such as data mining because mapreduce has poor performance on problems with an iterative structure present in the linear algebra that underlies much data analysis.
further we have released the open source twister iterative mapreduce and benchmarked it against basic mapreduce  and mpi in information retrieval and life sciences applications.
these are linked to mpi applications for final stages of the data analysis.
