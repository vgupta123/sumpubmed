efficient parallelisation using simd on standard hardware makes it possible to run smith-waterman database searches more than six times faster than before.
in the new tool swipe, residues from sixteen different database sequences are compared in parallel to one query residue.
using a  <dig> residue query sequence a speed of  <dig> billion cell updates per second  was achieved on a dual intel xeon x <dig> six-core processor system, which is over six times more rapid than software based on farrar's 'striped' approach.
the fastest approach to parallelisation with simd technology has previously been described by farrar in  <dig>  the aim of this study was to explore whether further speed could be gained by other approaches to parallelisation.
the software is designed for  <dig> bit linux on processors with ssse <dig>  source code is available from http://dna.uio.no/swipe/ under the gnu affero general public license.
other applications that require optimal local alignment scores could also benefit from improved performance.
the smith-waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment is more sensitive than heuristic methods for database searching, but also more time-consuming.
the approach described here could significantly widen the potential application of smith-waterman searches.
