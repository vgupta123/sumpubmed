representatives of the fast-evolving and slow-evolving symbiont lineages exhibit the same localization, migration, and transmission patterns in their hosts, implying direct replacement.
the two remaining candidate clades in our study exhibit high levels of nucleotide substitution, suggesting accelerated molecular evolution due to relaxed purifying selection or smaller effective population size, which is typical of many vertically transmitted insect symbionts.
evolutionary simulations indicate that this topology is characteristic of a process of repeated symbiont replacement over a brief time period.
our findings suggest that repeated, independent symbiont replacements have taken place over the course of the relatively recent radiation of columbicola spp.
symbionts revealed the presence of three candidate clades, with the most species-rich clade having a comb-like topology with very short internodes and long terminal branches.
these results are compatible with the notion that lice and other insects have the capability to acquire novel symbionts through the domestication of progenitor strains residing in their local environment.
here we show that bacteria living in a single genus of feather lice, columbicola , present an exception to this typical pattern.
