spo <dig> protein triggers recombination by introducing dna double stranded breaks at discreet areas of the genome called recombination hotspots.

in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisae, which lacks a prdm <dig> gene, meiotic breaks are formed opportunistically in the regions of accessible chromatin, primarily at gene promoters.
the hotspot locations are largely determined by the dna binding specificity of the prdm <dig> protein in human, mice and most other mammals.
the effect is particularly striking at the pseudoautosomal region of the x and y chromosomes â€“ normally the hottest region in the genome.
homologous recombination is the key process that generates genetic diversity and drives evolution.
