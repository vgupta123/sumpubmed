the mechanisms by which ctgf/ccn <dig> contributed to lactogenic differentiation include direct binding of ctgf/ccn <dig> to integrin complexes and ctgf/ccn2-induced matrix protein expression resulting in elevated integrin functionality.
connective tissue growth factor , a known matrix-associated protein, is required for the lactogenic differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells.
tetracycline-regulated expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> in hc <dig> cells enhanced multiple markers of lactogenic differentiation including β-casein transcription and mammosphere formation.
in hc <dig> cells the elevated levels of ctgf/ccn <dig> diminished the requirement for extracellular matrix proteins in the activation of β-casein transcription, indicating that ctgf/ccn <dig> contributed to lactogenic differentiation through the regulation of matrix dependent cell adhesion.
ctgf/ccn <dig> expression in hc <dig> cells led to an increase in multiple markers of lactogenic differentiation.
ctgf/ccn <dig> expression in hc <dig> cells increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins and integrins, enhanced the formation of focal adhesion complexes, and increased survival signaling.
in a separate measure of mammary differentiation the addition of ctgf/ccn <dig> to cultures of mcf10a cells increased the development of acini in vitro.
