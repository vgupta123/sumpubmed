organotypic co-cultures of spinal cord slices and peripheral nerve grafts resembled the results of the dispersed primary cell cultures.
magnetic nanoparticles  offer a large range of applications in life sciences.
furthermore, we compared the uptake in pc <dig> cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, which is often used as a neuronal cell model, with primary neuronal cells.
this difference indicates that pc <dig> cells are not a suitable model for natural neuronal uptake of nanoparticles and qualify previous results in pc <dig> cells.
primary mixed schwann cell/fibroblast cultures showed similar mnp uptake of both cell types, but the schwann cell number decreased after mnp incubation.
here we present a systematic study on the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles  by primary cells of the nervous system.

we assessed the internalization in different cell types with confocal and electron microscopy.
it can be assumed that in vivo application would induce immune system reactivity, too.
previously studies mostly reported cellular uptake in cell lines.
additionally, we found that pc <dig> cells took up significantly more mnps than primary neurons.
the commercial mnps used activated microglial phagocytosis in both disperse and organotypic culture systems.
