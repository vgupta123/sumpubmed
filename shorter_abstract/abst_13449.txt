transmission models can aid understanding of disease dynamics and are useful in testing the efficiency of control measures.
the proposed framework for stochastic sir models was successfully implemented to estimate transmission rate parameters for salmonella typhimurium in swine field data.
the aim of this study was to formulate an appropriate stochastic susceptible-infectious-resistant/carrier  model for salmonella typhimurium in pigs and thus estimate the transmission parameters between states.
the number of infectious pigs not detected by the parallel testing was treated as unknown, and the probability of non-detection was estimated using information about the sensitivity and specificity of the bacteriological and serological tests.
cohort random effects were incorporated into these models to allow for unobserved cohort-specific variables as well as unobserved sources of transmission, thus enabling a more realistic estimation of the transmission parameters.
in the case of the transition from susceptible to infectious, the cohort random effects were also time varying.
the transmission parameters were estimated using data from a longitudinal study of three danish farrow-to-finish pig herds known to be infected.
the model adequately fitted the data, allowing for both observed and unobserved sources of uncertainty , so leading to more reliable estimates of transmission parameters.
