neither comt alleles nor genotypes were independent risk factors for ad or mci.
comt  polymorphism is not an independent risk factor for ad or mci, but shows a synergistic effect with apoe ε <dig> allele that proves greater in women with ad.
the aim of this study is to examine the influence of the catechol-o-methyltranferase  gene  as a risk factor for alzheimer's disease  and mild cognitive impairment of amnesic type , and its synergistic effect with the apolipoprotein e gene .
the high activity genotypes  showed a synergistic effect with apoe ε <dig> allele, increasing the risk of ad .
in mci patients such as synergistic effect was only found between ag and apoe ε <dig> allele  and was greater in men .
the dna bank of the university of the basque country   determined comt val <dig> met and apoe genotypes using real time polymerase chain reaction  and polymerase chain reaction , and restriction fragment length polymorphism , respectively.
a total of  <dig> mci patients,  <dig> ad and  <dig> healthy controls were analyzed.
clinical criteria and neuropsychological tests were used to establish diagnostic groups.
