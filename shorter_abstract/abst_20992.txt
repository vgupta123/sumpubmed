this is in contrast to a previous analysis of the arabidopsis proteome which identified  <dig> hrgps consisting of  <dig> agps,  <dig> exts, and  <dig> prps.
poplar was observed to have fewer classical exts, to have more fasciclin-like agps, plastocyanin agps and ag peptides, and to contain a novel class of prps referred to as the proline-rich peptides.
chimeric and hybrid hrgps, however, also exist.
a bioinformatics approach is employed here to identify and classify agps, exts, prps, chimeric hrgps, and hybrid hrgps from the proteins predicted by the completed genome sequence of poplar .
the newly identified poplar hrgps can now be examined to determine their respective structural and functional roles, including their possible applications in the areas plant biofuel and natural products for medicinal or industrial uses.
this bioinformatics approach is based on searching for biased amino acid compositions and for particular protein motifs associated with known hrgps with a newly revised and improved bio ohio  <dig>  program.
additionally, other plants whose genomes are sequenced can now be examined in a similar way using this bioinformatics program which will provide insight to the evolution of the hrgp family in the plant kingdom.
this superfamily contains three members: the highly glycosylated arabinogalactan-proteins , the moderately glycosylated extensins , and the lightly glycosylated proline-rich proteins .
