the gene ontology  provides a controlled vocabulary for describing the functions of genes and can be used to evaluate the functional coherence of gene sets.
to implement this approach to functional assessment, we present gfd , a novel dissimilarity measure for evaluating groups of genes based on the most relevant functions of the whole set.
therefore, an identification of the most common function for all of the genes involved in a biological process is important in evaluating the functional similarity of groups of genes and a quantification of functional coherence can helps to clarify the role of a group of genes working together.
an roc analysis reveals that the performance of gfd in evaluating the functional dissimilarity of gene sets is very satisfactory.
the measure assigns a numerical value to the gene set for each of the three go sub-ontologies.
results show that gfd performs robustly when applied to gene set of known functionality .
many functional coherence measures consider each pair of gene functions in a set and produce an output based on all pairwise distances.
