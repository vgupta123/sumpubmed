while a nearly complete flagellar gene cluster was identified in one of the sequenced xtg strains, phenotypic analysis pointed to swimming-deficiency as a common trait of the pathovar graminis.
as the causal agent of bacterial wilt in italian ryegrass , x. translucens pv.
subsequent comparative analysis with previously published genome data of seven non-graminis x. translucens strains including the pathovars arrhenatheri, poae, phlei, cerealis, undulosa, and translucens was conducted to identify candidate genes linked to the host adaptation of xtg to italian ryegrass.
our study suggests that host adaptation of x. translucens pv.
phylogenetic analysis revealed a tight clustering of xtg strains, which were found to share a large core genome.
sequence deviations of pathogen-associated molecular patterns , as observed for the pilins of the t4p and t3ss, are moreover likely to impede perception by the plant defense machinery and thus facilitate successful host colonization of italian ryegrass.
the genomes of six xtg strains from switzerland, norway, and new zealand were sequenced in order to gain insight into conserved genomic traits from organisms covering a wide geographical range.
conserved genomic traits included a non-canonical type iii secretion system  and a type iv pilus , which both revealed distinct primary structures of the pilins when compared to the non-graminis x. translucens strains.
graminis may be conferred by a combination of pathovar-specific effector proteins, regulatory mechanisms, and adapted nutrient acquisition.
xtg-specific traits that had no homologues in the other x. translucens strains were further found to comprise several hypothetical proteins, a tonb-dependent receptor, transporters, and effector proteins as well as toxin-antitoxin systems and dna methyltransferases.
