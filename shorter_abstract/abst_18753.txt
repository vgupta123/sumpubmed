this study describes differential expression of the ube2v <dig> and znf <dig> genes in brains of aggressive and non-aggressive dogs.
it also reports differential expression for eight of the studied genes across four different brain tissues .
based on quantitative real-time pcr  in  <dig> brains, obtained from  <dig> dogs euthanised because of aggressive behaviour and nine non-aggressive dogs, we studied expression of nine genes identified in an initial screening by subtraction hybridisation.
with the intentions of identifying gene-specific expression in particular brain parts and comparing brains of aggressive and non-aggressive dogs, we studied amygdala, frontal cortex, hypothalamus and parietal cortex, as these tissues are reported to be involved in emotional reactions, including aggression.
although the ube2v <dig> and znf <dig> genes have no known function in regulation of aggressive behaviour, this study contributes to preliminary data of differential gene expression in the canine brain and provides new information to be further explored.
elucidating the genetic background of adverse behaviour can provide valuable information to breeding programs and aid the development of drugs aimed at treating undesirable behaviour.
the study showed significant differences in gene expression between brain compartments for most of the investigated genes.
aggressive behaviour in dogs also represents an animal welfare problem and a public threat.
