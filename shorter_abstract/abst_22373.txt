our in vivo proteolysis data identified more than  <dig> signal peptide and n-terminal methionine cleavage events critical for protein function.
we also characterized post-translational features in the salmonella genome, including chemical modifications and proteolytic cleavages.
we find that bacteria have a much larger and more complex repertoire of chemical modifications than previously thought including several novel modifications.
furthermore, gene prediction programs provide no information on biologically important post-translational processing events critical for protein function.
additionally, we uncovered  <dig> non-annotated genes missed by gene prediction programs, as well as evidence suggesting a role for one of these novel orfs in salmonella pathogenesis.
the data provide protein-level experimental validation for approximately half of the predicted protein-coding genes in salmonella and suggest revisions to several genes that appear to have incorrectly assigned translational start sites, including a potential novel alternate start codon.
this work highlights several ways in which application of proteomics data can improve the quality of genome annotations to facilitate novel biological insights and provides a comprehensive proteome map of salmonella as a resource for systems analysis.
we experimentally annotated the bacterial pathogen salmonella typhimurium  <dig>  using "shotgun" proteomics to accurately uncover the translational landscape and post-translational features.
