the bacterial homologues are bilobed like pepsin, implying that if no horizontal gene transfer has occurred the duplication and fusion event might be very ancient indeed, preceding the divergence of bacteria and eukaryotes.
it is unclear whether all the bacterial homologues are derived from horizontal gene transfer, but those from the plant symbionts probably are.
the bacterial homologues are all predicted to be intracellular proteins, unlike the eukaryotic enzymes.
the presence of a pepsin homologue in a prokaryote might give insights into the evolution of the pepsin family.
no pepsin homologues could be detected in any archaean genome.
the bacterial homologues, unlike those from eukaryotes, do not possess signal peptides, and would therefore be intracellular acting at neutral ph.
the bacterial homologues have thr <dig> replaced by asp, a change which in renin has been shown to confer activity at neutral ph.
the tertiary structure of pepsin shows two lobes with similar folds and it has been suggested that the gene has arisen from an ancient duplication and fusion event.
peptidase family a <dig>  to which pepsin belongs, had been assumed to be restricted to eukaryotes.
the human immunodeficiency virus peptidase, retropepsin, from peptidase family a <dig> also has a similar fold but consists of one lobe only and has to dimerize to be active.
the peptidase family a <dig> is found in some species of bacteria as well as eukaryotes.
the homologues from oceanic bacteria are most closely related to memapsins , but are so divergent that they are close to the root of the phylogenetic tree and to the division of the a <dig> family into two subfamilies.
the bacterial homologues fall into two groups, one from oceanic bacteria and one from plant symbionts.
the only sequence similarity between the lobes is restricted to the motif around the active site aspartate and a hydrophobic-hydrophobic-gly motif.
