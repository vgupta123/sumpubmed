further analysis of predicted nucleosomes reveals characteristic patterns in nucleosome sequences and placement.
chipseqr is shown to improve sensitivity and spatial resolution over existing methods while maintaining high specificity.
the use of high-throughput sequencing in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation  has enabled the study of genome-wide protein binding at high resolution.
although several algorithms for the analysis of chip-seq data have been published they focus almost exclusively on transcription factor studies and are usually not well suited for the analysis of other types of experiments.
