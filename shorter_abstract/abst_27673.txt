the goal of this study was to evaluate age and hypertension related changes of the basal lamina in cerebral microvessels of individuals, who died from non-cerebral causes.
basal lamina changes of the cerebral microvessels were determined in the putamen using antibodies against collagen type iv and by quantitative analysis of vessel number, total stained area of collagen, thickness of the vessel wall and lumen, and relative staining intensity using immunofluorescence.
the present data show age-related changes of the cerebral microvessels in sections of human putamen for the first time.
due to the accumulation of collagen, microvessels thicken and show a reduction in their lumen.
the total number of collagen positive vessels per microscopic field was reduced in old compared to young subjects .
we examined  <dig> human brains:  <dig> young and  <dig> old patients.
old patients were divided into two subgroups, those with hypertension  and those without hypertension .
these findings might represent a precondition for the development of vascular cognitive impairment.
besides this, the number of vessels decreases.
