here, we provide evidence for the evolution of two ancient avian mhc class iib  lineages by a duplication event prior to the radiation of all extant birds > <dig> million years ago, and document the role of concerted evolution in eroding the footprints of the avian mhciib duplication history.
through the presence of a range of intermediate evolutionary stages along the homogenizing process of concerted evolution, the avian mhciib provides a remarkable illustration of the erosion of multigene family duplication history.
gene duplication has led to a most remarkable adaptation involved in vertebrates’ host-pathogen arms-race, the major histocompatibility complex .
our results suggest that eroded footprints of gene duplication histories may mimic birth-death evolution and that in the avian mhc the presence of the two lineages may have been masked by elevated rates of concerted evolution in several taxa.
