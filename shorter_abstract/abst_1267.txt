pooled fecal samples were collected from  <dig> privately-own farms, as well as individual fecal samples from  <dig> animals at the teaching and research farm of the university of dschang, and examined for parasite eggs and oocysts/cysts.
and paraspidodera uncinata  were found at farm level.
oocysts of eimeria caviae and eggs of paraspidodera uncinata were found in  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of examined animals respectively.
preventive measures should be put in practice to avoid their presence on farms due to their harmful effect on cavy rearing.
the main objective of this study was to investigate the species of gastrointestinal parasites in cavy husbandry in the western highlands of cameroon and to detect external parasites in those animals affected with dermatological disorders.
the overall infection rate with both helminthes and arthropods was  <dig>  %.
concerning ectoparasites, cordylobia anthropophaga and pulex sp.
the parasites are apparently composed of host-specific species in the original habitat  and species acquired later from other mammals.
domestic cavies  are increasingly reared in rural areas of cameroon for meat and income generation.
eggs of graphidium strigosum , trichostrongylus sp.
