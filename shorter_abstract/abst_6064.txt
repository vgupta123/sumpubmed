the human innate immune system uses a system of extracellular toll-like receptors  and intracellular nod-like receptors  to match the appropriate level of immune response to the level of threat from the current environment.
the specific functional roles of lrr domains in nlrs and tlrs are thus defined by their detailed surface features.
we report a quantitative, comparative analysis of the surface features of lrr domains in human nlrs and tlrs, using predicted three-dimensional structures for nlrs.
while experimental crystal structures of four human tlrs have been solved, no structure data are available for nlrs.
despite differences in structural and genomic organization, comparison of lrr surface features in nlrs and tlrs allowed us to hypothesize about their possible functional similarities.
we find agreement between predicted surface similarities and similar functional roles in nlrs and tlrs with known agonists, and suggest possible binding partners for uncharacterized nlrs.
our results illustrate diversity of surface features of innate immunity receptors and provide hints for function of nlrs whose specific role in innate immunity is yet unknown.
specifically, we calculated amino acid hydrophobicity, charge, and glycosylation distributions within lrr domain surfaces and assessed their similarity by clustering.
