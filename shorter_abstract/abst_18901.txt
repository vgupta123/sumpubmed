thus, ra functions both upstream and downstream of wnt signalling.
while retinoic acid  is the most potent small molecule enhancer of skeletal myogenesis in stem cells, the stage and mechanism of its function has not yet been elucidated.
ra can enhance skeletal myogenesis in stem cells at the muscle specification/progenitor stage by activating rars bound directly to mesoderm and skeletal muscle progenitor genes, activating β-catenin function and inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein  signalling.
thus, a signalling pathway can function at multiple levels to positively regulate a developmental program and can function by abrogating inhibitory pathways.
in contrast, it functions downstream of bmp <dig>  as it abrogates bmp <dig> inhibition of myogenesis and meox <dig>  pax <dig>  and myod expression.
thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which ra enhances skeletal myogenesis and interacts with wnt and bmp <dig> signalling during p <dig> or mouse embryonic stem  cell differentiation.
treatment of p <dig> or mouse es cells with low levels of ra led to an enhancement of skeletal myogenesis by upregulating the expression of the mesodermal marker, wnt3a, the skeletal muscle progenitor factors pax <dig> and meox <dig>  and the myogenic regulatory factors  myod and myogenin.
in the presence of a dominant negative β-catenin/engrailed repressor fusion protein, ra could not bypass the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis nor upregulate meox <dig> or myod.
by chromatin immunoprecipitation, ra receptors  bound directly to regulatory regions in the wnt3a, pax <dig>  and meox <dig> genes and ra activated a β-catenin-responsive promoter in aggregated p <dig> cells.
