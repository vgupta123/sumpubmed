evidence was also found for hypervariable regions and multiple regions showing intrastrain heterogeneity in the t. pallidum chromosome.
on the proteome level, the highest frequency of amino acid-altering substitution polymorphisms was in novel genes, while the lowest was in housekeeping genes, as expected by their evolutionary conservation.
gaps in the resulting sequence were filled with targeted dideoxy-terminators  sequencing and the sequence was confirmed by whole genome fingerprinting .
when compared to the nichols strain,  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions ,  <dig> deletions, and  <dig> insertions were found.
