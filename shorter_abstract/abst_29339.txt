we then developed a biochemically realistic mathematical model of the phospho-relay, which suggested that robustness is due to buffering by a large excess pool of ypd <dig>  we confirmed experimentally that depletion of the ypd <dig> pool results in inappropriate activation of the hog pathway.
we identified buffering by an intermediate component in excess as a novel mechanism through which a phospho-relay can achieve robustness.
the hog pathway is rapidly activated under conditions of elevated osmolarity and regulates transcriptional and metabolic changes within the cell.
under normal growth conditions, however, a three-component phospho-relay consisting of the histidine kinase sln <dig>  the transfer protein ypd <dig>  and the response regulator ssk <dig> represses hog pathway activity by phosphorylation of ssk <dig>  this inhibition of the hog pathway is essential for cellular fitness in normal osmolarity.
nevertheless, the extent to and mechanisms by which inhibition is robust to fluctuations in the concentrations of the phospho-relay components has received little attention.
we established that the sln1-ypd1-ssk <dig> phospho-relay is robust—it is able to maintain inhibition of the hog pathway even after significant changes in the levels of its three components.
