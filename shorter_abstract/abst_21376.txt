the dense subgraphs are identified by a cellular automaton-like algorithm; each subgraph defines a cluster composed of similar inextensible words from different genomes.
the evolutionary distance between apicomplexans can be very high, in particular, due to the positive selection pressure on them.
specifically, the algorithm does not rely on genome alignments, nor pre-identified perfectly conserved elements; instead, it performs a fast search for pairs of words  of maximum length with the difference below the specified edit distance.
such pair defines an edge whose weight equals the maximum  length of words assigned to its ends.
the algorithm is applied to the nuclear genomes of the superphylum alveolata, and the corresponding phylogenetic tree is built and discussed.
it is based on the identification of dense subgraphs in a specially built multipartite graph .
perfectly or highly conserved dna elements were found in vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants by various methods.
a novel algorithm is developed to identify highly conserved dna elements.
