circular dichroism revealed that rrd <dig> mediates structural changes onto the c-terminal domain  of the large subunit of rna polymerase ii  in response to rapamycin, although this appears to be independent of the overall phosphorylation status of the ctd.
mutants devoid of rrd <dig>  a protein possessing in vitro peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity, display striking resistance to the drug, although how rrd <dig> activity is linked to the biological responses has not been elucidated.
consistent with this, we demonstrated that rrd <dig> is required to alter rna polymerase ii occupancy on rapamycin responsive genes.
in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the immunosuppressant rapamycin engenders a profound modification in the transcriptional profile leading to growth arrest.
