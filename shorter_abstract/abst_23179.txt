however, showing a role for porphryins would require sensitive detection methods that work in complex samples such as feces.
we devised a highly sensitive semi-quantitative porphyrin detection method  that can be used to assay pure or complex biological samples, based on bacteroides growth stimulation.
a highly sensitive method to detect porphyrins based on bacterial growth is devised and is functional in complex biological samples.
the test revealed that healthy colonized or non-colonized murine and human hosts provide porphyrins in feces, which stimulate bacteroides growth.
host feces, independently of their microbiota, and e. coli, which are present in the intestine, are shown to be porphryin donors.
