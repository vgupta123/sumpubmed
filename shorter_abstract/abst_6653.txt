network parameters effectively characterize pre-mirna secondary structure, which improves our prediction model in both prediction ability and computation efficiency.
network parameters are used to construct prediction model, achieving an area under the receiver operating curves  value of  <dig> .
in the present work, a pre-mirna stem-loop secondary structure is translated to a network, which provides a novel perspective for its structural analysis.
current methods have extracted feature information at different levels, among which the characteristic stem-loop structure makes the greatest contribution to the prediction of putative mirna precursor .
moreover, by repeating the same method on two independent datasets, accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are achieved, respectively.
