bayespi2+ can be run in either a serial computation model or a parallel ensemble learning framework.
analysing esr <dig> and spib in breast carcinoma and activated b cell-like diffuse large b-cell lymphoma cell lines, respectively, revealed that the concerted binding to high and low affinity sites correlates best with gene expression.
a new biophysical model of protein-dna interactions, bayespi2+, was developed to address the above-mentioned challenges.
high-throughput in vivo protein-dna interaction experiments are currently widely used in gene regulation studies.
it is evaluated in both synthetic and real in vivo protein-dna binding experiments.
the program and output results are publicly available at: http://folk.uio.no/junbaiw/bayespi2plus.
