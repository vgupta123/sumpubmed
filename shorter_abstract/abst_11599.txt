the prediction and analysis of syntenic blocks and duplication events within gene families of interest can be used to link functional biology to insights from an evolutionary viewpoint.
the phylogeny showed two major clades of receptor kinases and soluble kinases, each of which was divided into functional subclades.
here, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the arabidopsis kinase complement, the kinome, with particular focus on gene duplication events.
the approach undertaken here can be applied to any gene family in any organism with an annotated genome.
protein kinases constitute a particularly large protein family in arabidopsis with important functions in cellular signal transduction networks.
classification of gene duplications within these protein kinases revealed that representatives of cytosolic subfamilies showed a tendency to maintain segmentally duplicated genes, while some subfamilies of the receptor kinases were enriched for tandem duplicates.
in general, a significant enrichment of essential genes was found among genes encoding for protein kinases.
based on this phylogeny, association of yet uncharacterized kinases to families was possible which extended functional annotation of unknowns.
at the same time arabidopsis is a model plant with high frequencies of gene duplications.
we matched arabidopsis proteins to a hidden-markov model of eukaryotic kinases and computed a phylogeny of  <dig> arabidopsis protein kinase domains and mapped their origin by gene duplication.
although functional diversification is observed throughout most subfamilies, some instances of functional conservation among genes transposed from the same ancestor were observed.
