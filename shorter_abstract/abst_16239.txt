in such experiments, the most frequently used dyes are cy <dig> and cy <dig>  recent improvements in the technology  allow hybridization up to four samples simultaneously.
the proposed normalization procedure is effective: the technical biases are reduced, the number of false positives is under control in the analysis of differentially expressed genes, and the triple-target experiments are more powerful than the corresponding two-color experiments.
we propose a two-step normalization procedure for triple-target experiments.
there is room for improving the microarray experiments by simultaneously hybridizing more than two samples.
then the signal in each channel is normalized using a generalized lowess procedure to correct a global dye bias.
the normalization procedure is validated using triple-self experiments and by comparing the results of triple-target and two-color experiments.
moreover the lowess correction of the global dye effect is available for only two-color experiments, and even if its application can be derived, it does not allow simultaneous correction of the raw data.
although the focus is on triple-target microarrays, the proposed method can be used to normalize p differently labelled targets co-hybridized on a same array, for any value of p greater than  <dig>
the two additional dyes are alexa <dig> and alexa <dig>  the triple-target or four-target technology is very promising, since it allows more flexibility in the design of experiments, an increase in the statistical power when comparing gene expressions induced by different conditions and a scaled down number of slides.
