we identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between paired udder halves on day  <dig> but exhibited a reversal of differential expression on day  <dig>  among those genes, we identified four clusters characterized by similar temporal patterns of differential expression.
we obtained mammary biopsies from both udder halves on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lactation.
the lactating mammary gland responds to changes in milking frequency by modulating milk production.
this response is locally regulated and, in dairy cows, the udder is particularly sensitive during early lactation.
changes in milking frequency during early lactation did not alter mammary cell population dynamics, but were associated with coordinated changes in mammary expression of at least  <dig> genes.
we hypothesized that the milk yield response would be associated with increased mammary cell turnover and changes in gene expression during frequent milking and persisting thereafter.
two clusters  were positively correlated with changes in milk yield and were differentially expressed on day  <dig> of lactation only, indicating involvement in the initial milk yield response.
twenty-nine of those genes were differentially expressed 19Â days after cessation of treatment, implicating them in the persistent milk yield response.
we conclude that we have identified a novel transcriptional signature that may mediate the adaptive response to changes in milking frequency.
relative to udder halves milked twice-daily, those milked four-times produced more milk during ufm; the difference in milk yield declined acutely upon cessation of ufm after day  <dig>  but remained significantly elevated thereafter.
two other clusters  were negatively correlated with changes in milk yield.
mammary cell proliferation and apoptosis were not affected by milking frequency.
