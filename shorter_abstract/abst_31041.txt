the immune response to trauma has traditionally been modeled to consist of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome  followed by the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome .
neutrophil numbers were observed to be elevated in trauma patients as compared to healthy controls.
these consist of a hyper-inflammatory response by the innate arm of the immune system concurrent with a hypo-inflammatory response by the adaptive arm.
consistent with these results, upon activation, trauma patient t cells were observed to have decreased t cell receptor mediated signaling.
these results suggest that following trauma, there are concurrent and divergent immunological responses.
in direct contrast, blood from trauma patients contained decreased na√Øve t cell numbers.
upon activation with a t cell specific mitogen, trauma patient t cells produced less ifn-gamma as compared to those from healthy controls.
we investigated these responses in a homogenous cohort of male, severe blunt trauma patients admitted to a university hospital surgical intensive care unit .
further, neutrophils isolated from trauma patients had increased raft formation and phospho-akt.
