in s. furcifera, sfspo was cloned and the conservation of sfspo is valid.
sfspo showed three expression peaks in late second-, third- and fourth-instar stages.
in contrast, the expression levels were lower and formed three troughs in the newly-molted second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs.
up to now, however, the involvement of the halloween genes in ecdysteroid synthesis has not been confirmed in hemipteran insect species.
dietary introduction of double-stranded rna  of sfspo into the second instars successfully knocked down the target gene, and greatly reduced expression level of ecdysone receptor  gene.
five cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , encoded by halloween genes, have been documented to be involved in the ecdysteroidogenesis in insect species of diverse orders such as diptera, lepidoptera and orthoptera.
on day  <dig> of the fourth-instar nymphs, sfspo clearly had a high transcript level in the thorax where pgs were located.
in the present paper, a halloween gene spook  was cloned in the hemipteran sogatella furcifera.
furthermore, application of 20-hydroxyecdysone on sfspo-dsrna-exposed nymphs did not increase sfspo expression, but could almost completely rescue sfecr expression, and relieved the negative effects on nymphal survival and development.
temporal and spatial expression patterns of sfspo were evaluated by qpcr.
