gene ontology and cluster of orthologous groups of proteins annotations revealed that these transcripts were broadly representative of the p. polyphylla embryo transcriptome.
using blastx searches of public databases,  <dig>   unique transcripts were identified.
gene annotation and quantitative rt-pcr expression analysis identified  <dig> transcripts that may be involved in phytohormone catabolism and biosynthesis, hormone signal, seed dormancy, seed maturation, cell wall growth and circadian rhythms.
in this study, massive parallel pyrosequencing on the roche 454-gs flx titanium platform was used to generate a substantial sequence dataset for the p. polyphylla embryo.
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes assigned  <dig> of the unique sequences to specific metabolic pathways.
the molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy remain unclear, and little genomic or transcriptome data are available for this plant.
in particular, the relative expression analysis of sixteen genes  in embryo and endosperm and at two temperatures indicated that these related genes may be candidates for clarifying the molecular basis of seed dormancy in p. polyphlla var.
seed dormancy is one of the main factors restricting artificial cultivation.
