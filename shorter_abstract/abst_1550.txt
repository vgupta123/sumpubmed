in both networks over 98% of the connected nodes formed a single giant weak component.
degree distributions show scale-free behaviour over a limited range only, due to the heterogeneity of locations: farms, markets, shows, abattoirs.
this will enable the construction of generic networks with similar properties with which to assess the impact of small changes in  network structure on disease dynamics.
these data can be used to form a network in which each cattle-holding location is represented by a single node and links between nodes are formed if there is a movement of cattle between them in the time period selected.
two networks are constructed assuming  a 7-day and  a 14-day infectious period using british cattle movement service  data from  <dig> and  <dig>  during this time period there were  <dig> , <dig> movements that could be derived from the database.
