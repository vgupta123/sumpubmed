to minimize the technical noise in single-cell rt-qpcr, the mrna should be analyzed with a single rt reaction, and a single qpcr reaction per gene.
importantly, the model allows us to determine the rt efficiency without using artificial rna as a standard.
quantitative reverse transcription pcr  is the most accessible method which provides sufficiently accurate measurements of mrna in single cells.
the accuracy of the measurements was determined by a quantitative noise-model of the reverse transcription and pcr.
gene expression has a strong stochastic element resulting in highly variable mrna levels between individual cells, even in a seemingly homogeneous cell population.
access to fundamental information about cellular mechanisms, such as correlated gene expression, motivates measurements of multiple genes in individual cells.
low concentration of guanidine thiocyanate was used to fully lyse single pancreatic Î²-cells followed by rt-qpcr without the need for purification.
the noise is insignificant for initial copy numbers > <dig> while at lower copy numbers the noise intrinsic of the pcr increases sharply, eventually obscuring quantitative measurements.
noise in single-cell rt-qpcr is insignificant compared to biological cell-to-cell variation in mrna levels for medium and high abundance transcripts.
