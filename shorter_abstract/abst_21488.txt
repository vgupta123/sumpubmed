these data suggest that osclp, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens.
the expression of this gene was examined at the transcriptional/translational levels during compatible and incompatible interactions, and the biochemical activity of this protein was also examined.
however, recombinant osclp did not display inhibitory activity against endo- <dig> -Î²-xylanase enzymes from aureobasidium pullulans  or trichoderma viride .
the transcription and translation of osclp were highly induced when rice was exposed to pathogens in an incompatible interaction.
taken together, our results demonstrate that osclp may have antifungal activity.
instead, an in-gel activity assay revealed strong chitinase activity.
sequence alignment revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of osclp shares a high degree of similarity with that of other plant taxi-type xips.
this protein may directly inhibit pathogen growth by degrading fungal cell wall components through chitinase activity.
during rice blast fungal attack, plant xylanase inhibitor proteins  that inhibit fungal xylanase activity are believed to act as a defensive barrier against fungal pathogens.
to understand the role of xips in rice, a xylanase inhibitor was cloned from rice.
