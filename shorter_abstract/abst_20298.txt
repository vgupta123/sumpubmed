babesia species infect erythrocytes and can be transmitted through blood transfusion.
direct detection of babesia relies upon microscopic examination of patient blood smears, which is labor intensive, difficult to scale up, requires specific expertise and is hence, often not performed.
we examined blood samples from  <dig> patients who visited clinics during the active tick-borne diseases season, using a newly developed qpcr assay that uses the specific molecular beacon probe.
in fact, a clinical laboratory examined only  <dig> of  <dig> blood samples obtained from two different counties by microscopy.
by considering individuals positive for babesia infection when results from currently available microscopy, fish or serological tests were positive, we found that our qpcr is highly sensitive  and showed a specificity of  <dig> % for babesia.
due to the absence of clear symptomology, clinical laboratories did not test  <dig> samples by ifa, fish or microscopic examination of giemsa-stained blood smears.
whole blood and blood products, which are not tested for babesia, can cause transfusion-transmitted babesiosis  resulting in severe consequences in the immuno-compromised patients.
babesia infection was detected in all age groups by fish and microscopy; notably patients > <dig> years of age represented 64% of tested samples and 13% were younger patients.
the use of a nucleic acid amplification test based screening of blood and blood products could prevent ttb.
of  <dig> samples that were positive by fish,  <dig>  were also positive by qpcr indicating high congruency between nucleic acid based tests.
