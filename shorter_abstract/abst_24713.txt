no• coordinates a highly integrated program of cell cycle arrest that regulates a large number of genes, but does not require signaling through cgmp.
differentiated u <dig> cells  were exposed to s-nitrosoglutathione, a no• donor, or glutathione alone  for  <dig> h without or with dibutyryl-camp , and then harvested to extract total rna for microarray analysis.
no• activated p <dig> mapk, stabilizing p <dig> mrna  and increasing p <dig> protein; this increased protein binding to cde/chr promoter sites of p <dig> target genes, repressing key g2/m phase genes, and increasing the proportion of cells in g2/m.
stress kinase signaling and alterations in mrna stability appear to be major pathways by which no• regulates the transcriptome.
no• regulated  <dig> transcripts that annotated disproportionately to the cell cycle and cell proliferation  and more frequently than expected contained au-rich, post-transcriptional regulatory elements .
cell cycle genes induced by no• annotated to g1/s  and included e2f <dig> and p21/waf1/cip1;  <dig> of these  <dig> were e2f target genes involved in g1/s transition.
here, cgmp-independent effects of no• on gene expression were globally examined in u <dig> cells, a human monoblastoid line that constitutively lacks soluble guanylate cyclase.
a comparison of no• and bt2camp effects showed that no• regulation of cell cycle genes was independent of its ability to interfere with camp signaling.
bt2camp regulated  <dig> genes; cell cycle gene enrichment did not reach significance.
regulatory functions of nitric oxide  that bypass the second messenger cgmp are incompletely understood.
in humans, antiproliferative effects of no• may rely substantially on cgmp-independent mechanisms.
