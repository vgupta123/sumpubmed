a myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions have been proposed, although it is difficult to point the best solution for each application.
the intent of this work is to provide an open-source multiplataform graphical environment for bioinformatics problems, which supports many feature selection algorithms, criterion functions and graphic visualization tools such as scatterplots, parallel coordinates and graphs.
besides, the environment can be used in different pattern recognition applications, although the main concern regards bioinformatics tasks.
the proposed feature selection environment allows data analysis using several algorithms, criterion functions and graphic visualization tools.
our experiments have shown the software effectiveness in two distinct types of biological problems.
