cmn markedly reduced elevated levels of tbars, significantly attenuated renal dysfunction increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes in csa treated rats and normalized the altered renal morphology.
csa administration for  <dig> days produced elevated levels of tbars and marked depletion of renal endogenous antioxidant enzymes and deteriorated the renal function as assessed by increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen  and decreased creatinine and urea clearance as compared to vehicle treated rats.
traditional indian medicine claims the use of its powder against biliary disorders, anorexia, coryza, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorder, rheumatism and sinusitis.
oxidative stress in kidney tissue homogenates was estimated using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , reduced glutathione  content, superoxide dismutase , and catalase .
this study was designed to examine the possible beneficial effect of cmn in preventing the acute renal failure and related oxidative stress caused by chronic administration of cyclosporine  in rats.
in conclusion our study showed that cmn through its antioxidant activity effectively salvaged csa nephrotoxicity.
nitrite levels were estimated in serum and tissue homogenates.
