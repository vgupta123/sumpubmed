in addition, pathogenicity assays showed that Δfatbca- <dig> exhibited decreased virulence on wheat head and on non-host tomato.
these results indicate that fatbca is involved in cell division under cold stress  in f. asiaticum.
taken together, results of this study indicate that fatbca plays crucial roles in vegetative growth, conidiation, temperature sensitivity and virulence in f. asiaticum.
microscopic observation found that hyphae of Δfatbca- <dig> exhibited blebbing phenotypes after shifting from  <dig> to 4°c for 1- or 3-day incubation and approximately 72% enlarged nodes contained several nuclei after 3-day incubation at 4°c.
however, hyphae of the wild type incubated at 4°c were phenotypically indistinguishable from those incubated at 25°c.
tubulin cofactor a , one of the members of tubulin cofactors, is of great importance in microtubule functions through participating in the folding of α/β-tubulin heterodimers in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
the deletion of fatbca caused dramatically reduced mycelial growth and abnormal conidiation.
unexpectedly, Δfatbca- <dig> did not exhibit increased sensitivity to the anti-microtubule drug carbendazim although quantitative real-time assays showed that the expression of fatbca was up-regulated after treatment with carbendazim.
however, little is known about the roles of tbca in filamentous fungi.
the fatbca deletion mutant  showed increased sensitivity to low temperatures and even lost the ability of growth at 4°c.
in this study, we characterized a tbca orthologue fatbca in fusarium asiaticum.
