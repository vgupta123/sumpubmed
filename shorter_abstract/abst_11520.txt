histone post-translational modifications  including acetylation and methylation have been recognized as playing a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of plant growth and development.
finally, we explored s. pennellii introgression lines  and integrated the map position of hms, their expression profiles and the phenotype of ils.
in this study, we reveal the structure, phylogeny and spatial expression of members belonging to the classical families of hms in tomato.
comprehensive analysis of the protein domain architecture and phylogeny revealed the presence of non-canonical motifs and new domain combinations, thereby suggesting for hats the existence of a new family in plants.
we thereby proved that the strategy was useful to identify hm candidates involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in tomato fruits.
the transcription profiles of hms within tomato organs revealed a broad functional role for some hms and a more specific activity for others, suggesting key hm regulators in tomato development.
