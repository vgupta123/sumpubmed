gd offers significant improvement over the manual inspection method to detect relative yeast colony size differences.
using gd, we successfully detected a genetic linkage between the molecular activity of the plant-derived antifungal compound berberine and gene expression components, among other cellular processes.
the results demonstrate the usefulness of gd for yeast functional genomics research.
it distinguishes true yeast colonies in a digital image and provides an accurate coordinate oriented map of the colony areas.
manual inspection of the yeast colonies that are grown under different conditions is often used as a method to detect such growth differences.
the speed and accuracy associated with gd makes it an ideal choice for large-scale functional genomics investigations.
some of these techniques are based on yeast growth differences under different conditions, such as those generated by gene mutations, chemicals or both.
a novel association for the yeast mek <dig> gene with dna damage repair was also identified by gd and confirmed by a plasmid repair assay.
