this was accompanied by a significant reduction in systemic helminth-specific th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine responses and significantly reduced local th <dig> and th <dig> responses in comparison to t. muris-only infected mice.
we investigated whether co-infection with the gastrointestinal tract-restricted helminth, trichuris muris, and the intracellular bacterium, mycobacterium bovis  bcg, would alter host immune responses to, or the pathological effect of, either infection.
interestingly, prior m. bovis bcg infection significantly delayed helminth clearance and increased intestinal crypt cell proliferation in balb/c mice.
t. muris infection influenced non-specific and pathogen-specific immunity to m. bovis bcg by down-regulating pulmonary th <dig> and treg responses and inducing systemic th <dig> responses.
in spite of local and systemic decreases in th <dig> and increases in th <dig> responses co-infected mice clear m. bovis bcg at the same rate as bcg only infected animals, whereas prior mycobacterial infection initiates prolonged worm infestation in parallel to decreased pathogen-specific th <dig> cytokine production.
