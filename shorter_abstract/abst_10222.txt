thirty-one bac clones localized to multiple chromosomal locations in several different hybridization patterns.
an accurately annotated zebrafish reference genome serves as a valuable resource for investigating the molecular basis of human diseases using zebrafish mutant models.
here, we cytogenetically define the zebrafish genome by first estimating the size of each linkage group  chromosome using flow cytometry, followed by the cytogenetic mapping of  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome  clones onto metaphase chromosomes.
cytogenetic approaches provide "anchors" that can be integrated with accumulating genomic data.
to facilitate analysis of the zebrafish genome, genetic maps have been constructed and sequence annotation of a reference zebrafish genome is ongoing.
<dig> % of these clones were assigned to a specific lg chromosome location using fluorescence in situ hybridization  and compared to the lg chromosome assignment reported in the zebrafish genome databases.
of the  <dig> bac clones,  <dig> clones localized to apparently unique chromosomal locations.
from these data, a refined second generation probe panel for each lg chromosome was also constructed.
the syntenic conservation between the zebrafish and human genome allows one to investigate the function of human genes using the zebrafish model.
