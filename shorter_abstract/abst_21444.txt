in addition to the pro ontology, the annotation of pro terms is released as a separate pro association file, which contains, for each given pro term, an annotation from the experimentally characterized sub-types as well as the corresponding database identifiers and sequence coordinates.
the components of pro extend from a classification of proteins on the basis of evolutionary relationships at the homeomorphic level to the representation of the multiple protein forms of a gene, including those resulting from alternative splicing, cleavage and/or post-translational modifications.
pro provides a framework for the formal representation of protein classes and protein forms in the obo foundry.
it is designed to enable data retrieval and integration and machine reasoning at the molecular level of proteins, thereby facilitating cross-species comparisons, pathway analysis, disease modeling and the generation of new hypotheses.
the current release of pro is based upon experimental data from mouse and human proteins wherein equivalent protein forms are represented by single terms.
splice and allelic variants, gene fusion products and modified protein forms are all represented as entities in the ontology.
manual curation ensures that the treatment of the protein classes and the internal and external relationships conform to the pro framework.
whenever possible, equivalent forms in other species are listed to facilitate cross-species comparison.
the protein ontology  is designed as a formal and principled open biomedical ontologies  foundry ontology for proteins.
