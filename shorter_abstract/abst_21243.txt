our model consists of three dior-trinucleotide profiles identified through principle component analysis, and the predicted nucleosome occupancy flanking the poly sites.
when we applied one model from one species to predict poly sites from other species, the sensitivity scores correlate with phylogenetic distances.
a four-feature model geared towards small motifs was sufficient to accurately learn and predict poly sites across eukaryotes.
we validated our model using two machine learning methods: logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.
we propose a poly site model that employs minimal features to capture the essence of poly sites, and yet, produces better prediction accuracy across diverse species.
results show that models achieve 85-92% sensitivity and 85-96% specificity in seven animals and plants.
we surveyed nine poly site prediction methods published between  <dig> and  <dig>  all methods exploit the skewed nucleotide profile across the poly sites, and the highly conserved poly signal as the primary features for recognition.
