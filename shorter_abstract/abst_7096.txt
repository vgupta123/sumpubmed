inoculation of cp, mp or both agents in c57bl/ <dig> apoe ko male mice caused aggravation of experimental atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol-enriched diet, with distinct characteristics.
the mean and standard deviation of plaque height, % luminal obstruction, external diameter, the plaque area/intimal surface ratio and the adventitial inflammation values are the following for each group: mp , cp , mp + cp  and sham .
a wider area of plaque/intimal surface was observed in mp + cp inoculated groups  as well as an increased plaque height in cp  in comparison with sham group.
adventitial inflammation in mp + cp inoculated group was higher than mp, cp and the sham groups .
cp inoculation increased the plaque height with positive vessel remodeling and co-inoculation of mp + cp caused the highest adventitial inflammation measures.
in the most severely obstructed segment, vessel diameter, plaque height, percentage of luminal obstruction and the degree of adventitial inflammation were analyzed.
there was also an increased luminal obstruction  in cp inoculated group in comparison to sham group.
the adventitial inflammation was semiquantified .
thirty male apoe ko mice aged eight weeks fed by a diet containing 1% cholesterol until  <dig> weeks of age were divided into four groups: the first was inoculated with cp , the second with mp , the third with both cp + mp , and the fourth with saline .
