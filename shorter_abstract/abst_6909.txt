environmental factors strongly affected global gene expression.
temperature strongly affects global gene expression and may be the common regulator of fertility in pgms/tgms rice lines.
some genes important for pollen development were strongly repressed in tgms-co <dig> at high temperature.
it includes many meiosis stage-related genes that are probably important for thermosensitive male sterility in tgms-co <dig>  inter alia: arg/ser-rich domain -containing zinc finger proteins, polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins , dead/deah box rna helicases, zos , at least one polyadenylate-binding protein and some other rna recognition motif  domain-containing proteins involved in post-transcriptional processes, eukaryotic initiation factor 5b , ribosomal proteins , aminoacyl-trna synthetases , eukaryotic elongation factor tu  and a peptide chain release factor protein involved in translation.
the differential expression of  <dig> degs that are important for pollen development, low temperature responses or tgms was validated by quantitative rt-pcr .
the identified expression changes reflect perturbations in the transcriptomic regulation of pollen development networks in tgms-co <dig>  findings from this and previous studies indicate that sets of genes involved in post-transcriptional and translation processes are involved in thermosensitive male sterility transitions in tgms-co <dig>
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility transitions in most pgms/tgms rice lines are unclear.
in the recently developed tgms-co <dig> line, the male sterility is based on co-suppression of a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene , but further study is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.
this cluster was found to be essential for sterility transition.

more significantly, series-cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes  between tgms-co <dig> plants grown under the two conditions showed that low temperature induced the expression of a gene cluster.
