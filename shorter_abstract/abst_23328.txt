these results could indicate that these gene groups could influence an effective response from the host to smallpox.
smallpox is a lethal disease that was endemic in many parts of the world until eradicated by massive immunization.
this technique provided additional insights about the host response to this disease, such as increased expression of the cytokines and ecm receptors in the individuals with higher survival times.
here we analyze publicly available microarray data to further understand survival of smallpox infected macaques, using systems biology approaches.
