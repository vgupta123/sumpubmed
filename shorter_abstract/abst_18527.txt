low allelic diversity in f. noatunensis isolates from outbreaks in cod culture compared to isolates wild cod, indicate that transmission of these isolates may be a result of human activity.
however, the high genetic similarity within the francisella spp.
since francisella noatunensis was first isolated from cultured atlantic cod in  <dig>  it has emerged as a global fish pathogen causing disease in both warm and cold water species.
these vntr-loci were sequenced in f. noatunensis isolates collected from atlantic cod  from norway , three-line grunt  from japan , tilapia  from indonesia  and atlantic salmon  from chile .
a strain typing system for use in studies of f. noatunensis epizootics would be an important tool for disease management.
the aim of this study is to identify possible useful vntrs in the genome of f. noatunensis.
seven polymorphic vntr loci were identified in the preliminary genome sequence of f. noatunensis ssp.
vntrs can be used to separate isolates belonging to both subspecies of f. noatunensis.
the norwegian isolates presented in this study show both nine allelic profiles and clades, and that the majority of the farmed isolates belong in two clades only, while the allelic profiles from wild cod are unique.
these loci are known as variable numbers of tandem repeat .
the sequence based mlva system presented in this study should provide a good starting point for further development of a genotyping system that can be used in studies of epizootics and disease management of francisellosis.
