recent studies indicate a central role for the il-23/il- <dig> axis in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis  but the importance in the context of treatment outcome is unknown.
baseline levels of il- <dig> were higher in patients with persisting active nephritis  after treatment, i.e.
fifty-two patients with active ln were included.
renal biopsies were performed at baseline and after immunosuppressive treatment.
serum levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β were analysed at both biopsy occasions and in  <dig> healthy controls.
immunostaining of renal tissue revealed il- <dig> expression in inflammatory infiltrates.
baseline levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ  were increased in patients vs. controls.
improvement of  <dig> grades in renal bilag was regarded complete response, and  <dig> grade partial response.
il- <dig> expression in renal tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
biopsies were evaluated regarding who-classification and renal disease activity was estimated using the bilag-index.
