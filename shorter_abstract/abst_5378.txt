alternative gene splicing is a common phenomenon in which a single gene gives rise to multiple transcript isoforms.
therefore, understanding the mechanism of alternative splicing and identifying the difference in splicing events between diseased and healthy tissue is crucial in biomedical research with the potential of applications in personalized medicine as well as in drug development.
the proposed model was applied to three case studies concerning both exon and hta arrays.

based on a set of scores, an exon score and an array score, a decision regarding alternative splicing can be made.
