we describe the methodology for automatic curation of biological association networks  derived by a natural language processing technology called medscan.
biological association networks extracted by medscan technology contain sufficient information for constructing thousands of mammalian signaling pathways for multiple tissues.
the automatically generated regulome pathways and manually curated pathways used for their validation are available free in the resnetcore database from ariadne genomics, inc.  <cit> .
formalization of this knowledge is necessary for computational analysis and is achieved by automatic fact extraction using various text-mining algorithms.
the medscan technology is also available for evaluation using the free demo version of pathwaystudio software.
the automatically curated medscan data is adequate for automatic generation of good quality signaling networks.
scientific literature is a source of the most reliable and comprehensive knowledge about molecular interaction networks.
