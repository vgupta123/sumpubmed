hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, an immune-mediated pathogenesis is discussed.
a seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer  <dig>  the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30– <dig> years.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of tgf-β expression in acute hantavirus infection.
we retrospectively studied  <dig> patients hospitalised with acute puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in germany in  <dig>  hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-puumala hantavirus igg and igm.
high serum crp and low serum tgf-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease.
our results support the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in hantavirus infection.
based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease.
patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease .
however, c-reactive protein  was significantly higher in patients with severe disease .
