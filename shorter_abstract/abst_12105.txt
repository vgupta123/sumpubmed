high molecular weight glutenin subunits , encoded by the genes at glu- <dig> loci in wheat and its related species, are significant in the determination of grain processing quality.
the unequal crossover events are the most likely mechanism of variations in glutenin subunits.
as hmw-gss play a key role in wheat baking quality, these large sitopsis glutenin subunits can be used as special genetic resources for wheat quality improvement.
the s genome-encoded subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * have independent origins, although they share similar evolutionary mechanism.
the orfs of sitopsis glu- <dig> genes are approximately  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb for x-type and y-type subunits, respectively.
although the primary structures of sitopsis hmw-gss are similar to those of previously reported ones, all six x-type or y-type subunits have the large fragment insertions.
our comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences verified that aegilops section sitopsis species encode novel hmw-gss with their molecular weights larger than almost all other known hmw-gss.
such large subunits are resulted from the duplications of repetitive domains in sitopsis hmw-gss.
our phylogenetic analyses by both network and nj tree indicated that there is a close phylogenetic evolutionary relationship of x-type and y-type subunit between s and d genome.
both open reading frames  and promoter regions of these glu- <dig> alleles were sequenced and characterized.
the glu- <dig> promoter sequences share the high homology among s genome.
the large molecular weight of hmw-gss from s genome is a unique feature identified in this study.
however, the diversity and variations of hmw-gss are relatively low in bread wheat.
