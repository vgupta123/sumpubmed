a  <dig> kb dna fragment containing a plasmid replicon was isolated from b. thuringiensis subsp.
the replication and stability features of the pbmb <dig> from b. thuringiensis subsp.
by southern blot analysis, this replicon region was determined to be located on pbmb <dig>  the largest detected plasmid  of strain ybt- <dig>  deletion analysis revealed that a replication initiation protein , an origin of replication  and an iteron region were required for replication.
the presence of five transposable elements or remnants thereof in close proximity to and within the replicon control region led us to speculate that genetic exchange and recombination are potentially responsible for the divergence among the replicons of this plasmid family.
bacillus thuringiensis belongs to the bacillus cereus sensu lato group of gram-positive and spore-forming bacteria.
as far as we know, the replicon of the plasmid pbmb <dig> is the first instance of a plasmid replicon being isolated from subsp.
most isolates of b. thuringiensis can bear many endogenous plasmids, and the number and size of these plasmids can vary widely among strains or subspecies.
