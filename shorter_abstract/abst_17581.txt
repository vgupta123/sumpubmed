l-ornithine , is an intermediate metabolite in the urea cycle that plays a significant role in humans.
after a careful analysis of its catalytic conditions, immobilized arg i was employed to catalyze the conversion of l-arg to l-orn under optimal condition of 1 % glutaraldehyde, 1 mm mn2+, 40 °c, ph <dig> and an l-arginine  concentration of 200 g/l, achieving a highly converted content of  <dig> g/l l-orn.
then the expressed arg i was immobilized on the crosslinked chitosan particles, and the enzymatic properties of both the free and immobilized enzymes were evaluated.
the results indicated that these two states both exhibited optimal activity under the same condition of ph <dig> at 40 °c.
the recombinant human arginase i  was obtained using an optimized method with the pichia pastoris gs <dig> as the host strain.

the immobilized enzyme technology can overcome the difficulties in recovery, recycling and long-term stability that result from the use of free enzyme.
however, the immobilized arg i exhibited the remarkable thermal and long-term stability as well as broad adaptability to ph, suggesting its potential for wide application in future industry.
at last, the immobilized arg i was employed to catalyze l-arg to l-orn.
the pichia pastoris expression system offers the possibility of generating a large amount of recombinant protein.
