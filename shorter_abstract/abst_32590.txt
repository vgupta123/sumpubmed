we used logistic regression to build a multivariate model that identified the most influential functional annotations for trait-association status of genome-wide significant variants.
annotations associated with chromatin state together with prior knowledge of the existence of a local expression qtl  were the most important factors in the final logistic regression model.

we assessed enrichment and depletion of variants in publicly available annotation classes such as genic regions, regulatory features, measures of conservation, and patterns of histone modifications.
we established odds ratios of functional annotations that are more likely to contain significantly trait-associated snps, for the purpose of prioritizing gwas hits for further studies.
here, we introduce and apply novel methods to rigorously identify annotation classes showing enrichment or depletion of trait-associated variants taking into account the underlying associations due to co-location of different functional annotations and linkage disequilibrium.
surprisingly, despite the widespread use of evolutionary conservation to prioritize variants for study we find only modest enrichment of trait-associated snps in conserved regions.
for most associations the causal variants and the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis remain unknown.
genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of snp variants associated with hundreds of phenotypes.
