we found that single-gene, gene-set and network methods yielded similar error rates in melanoma and ovarian cancer data.
for all methods we performed  <dig> rounds of 5-fold cross-validation under  <dig> different classifiers.
the second approach focuses on identification of informative sub-networks .
our findings indicate there is value in the way in which different subspaces of the patient sample are captured differently among the various methods, highlighting the possibility of 'combination' classifiers capable of identifying which patients will be more accurately classified by one particular method over another.
we considered two kinds of network approaches.
classical approaches to predicting patient clinical outcome via gene expression information are primarily based on differential expression of unrelated genes  or genes related by, for example, biologic pathway or function .
next-generation methods of gene expression signature modelling harness data from external networks and are foreshadowed as a standard mode of analysis.
crucially, however, our novel and detailed patient-level analyses revealed that the different methods were correctly classifying alternate subsets of patients in each cohort.
the first of these identifies informative genes using gene expression and network connectivity information combined, the latter drawn from prior knowledge of protein-protein interactions.
we also found that the network-based netrank feature selection method was the most stable.
we have seen this clearly for the first time because of our in-depth analysis at the level of individual patients.
