the efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with three well-known motif finding tools.
existing algorithms for finding network motifs are extremely costly in cpu time and memory consumption and have practically restrictions on the size of motifs.
we present a new algorithm , for finding k-size network motifs with less memory and cpu time in comparison to other existing algorithms.
for comparison, the cpu time, memory usage and the similarities of obtained motifs are considered.
we evaluated our algorithm on biological networks of e. coli and s. cereviciae, and also on non-biological networks: a social and an electronic network.
our algorithm is based on counting all k-size sub-graphs of a given graph .
motifs in networks are small connected sub-graphs that occur significantly in higher frequencies than in random networks.
