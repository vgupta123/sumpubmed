bovine spongiform encephalopathy , a member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , primarily affects cattle.
these findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread to europe of cwd from north america as this may necessitate even more extensive testing of animal tissues destined for human consumption within the eu.
transmission is via concentrate feed rations contaminated with infected meat and bone meal .
western immunoblot analysis of brain material showed a similar glycosylation pattern to that of bse derived from infected cattle and experimentally infected sheep with respect to protease-resistant prp isoforms.
here we show that european red deer  are susceptible to intra-cerebral  challenge with bse positive cattle brain pool material resulting in clinical neurological disease and weight loss by 794â€“ <dig> days and the clinical signs are indistinguishable to those reported in deer with cwd.
this study shows that deer are susceptible to bse by intra-cerebral inoculation and display clinical signs and vacuolar pathology that are similar to those of cwd.
spongiform changes typical of tse infections were present in brain and accumulation of the disease-associated abnormal prion protein  was present in the central and peripheral nervous systems, but not in lymphoid or other tissues.
chronic wasting disease , also a tse, naturally infects several cervid species in north america and is spreading rapidly in both captive and free-ranging populations.
although the absence of prpd in lymphoid and other non-neurological tissues potentially limits the risk of transmission to humans, the replication of tse agents in peripheral tissues following intra-cerebral challenge is often limited.
