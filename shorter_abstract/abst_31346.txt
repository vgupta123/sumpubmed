we determined an optimal window for the amplification of the albumin  gene  at which we report that spermidine acts as a pcr facilitator  for sg rt-pcr.
difficulty in eliminating pcr inhibitors of this body fluid has been extensively reported.
here, spermidine is presented as pcr facilitator for the detection of stool dna methylation biomarkers using qm-msp.
we contend that spermidine greatly reduces the problems of pcr inhibition in stool samples.
using quantitative methylation-specific pcr  is a promising method for colorectal cancer  diagnosis from stool samples.
