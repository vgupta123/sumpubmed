human, chimpanzee and macaca mulatta genomes were aligned to study the projected effects of substitutions and indels on human sequence evolution within both mri regions and control regions of average nucleotide composition.
mid-range inhomogeneity or mri is the significant enrichment of particular nucleotides in genomic sequences extending from  <dig> up to several thousands of nucleotides.
substitutions were grouped according to their fixation within human populations: fixed substitutions , major snps , medium snps , minor snps , and rare snps .
mri regions have comparable levels of de novo mutations to the control genomic sequences with average base composition.
data on short  and medium-length  insertions and deletions within mri regions and appropriate control regions were analyzed for the effect of indels on the expansion or diminution of such regions as well as on changing nucleotide composition.
de novo substitutions rapidly erode mri regions, bringing their nucleotide composition toward genome-average levels.
various types of mri regions are 4- <dig> times enriched in mammalian genomes compared to their occurrences in random models.
all in all, the observed fixation bias for mutations helps to preserve mri regions during evolution.
this paper explores how different types of mutations change mri regions.
they include  <dig>  mb substitutions and  <dig>  mb indels within mri regions.
