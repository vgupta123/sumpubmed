the proposed trex method achieves consistently good performance in all  <dig> simulated settings considered.
finally, we applied trex and the comparison methods to a hi-c dataset for which fish measurements are available to evaluate estimation accuracy.
application of the methods to the human lymphoblastoid cell line data on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> further substantiates the superior performance of trex: the constructed 3d structure from trex is consistent with the fish measurements, and the corresponding distances predicted by trex have higher correlation with the fish measurements than any of the comparison methods.
this conclusion is based on observations made in terms of 3d structure estimation accuracy and preservation of topologically associated domains.
it is not only robust to resolution level and underlying parameters, but also insensitive to model misspecification.
for such data, one of the key features is the high proportion of “0” contact counts among all available data, in other words, the excess of zeros.
as technology becomes more sophisticated, higher-and-higher resolution data are being produced, going from the initial  <dig> megabases  resolution to the current  <dig> kilobases  or even  <dig> kb resolution.
their behaviors are thus unknown for higher resolution data.
we then assess the performance of trex and a number of leading existing methods for recovering the underlying chromatin 3d structure.
