a southwest asian origin and dispersal to north africa in the early upper palaeolithic era has been inferred in previous studies for mtdna haplogroups m <dig> and u <dig>  both haplogroups have been proposed to show similar geographic patterns and shared demographic histories.
u <dig> and m <dig> frequencies in north africa, the middle east and europe do not follow similar patterns, and their sub-clade divisions do not appear to be compatible with their shared history reaching back to the early upper palaeolithic.
our high-resolution phylogenetic dissection of both haplogroups and coalescent time assessments suggest that the extant main branching pattern of both haplogroups arose and diversified in the mid-later upper palaeolithic, with some sub-clades concomitantly with the expansion of the iberomaurusian industry.
the bayesian skyline plots testify to non-overlapping phases of expansion, and the haplogroups’ phylogenies suggest that there are u <dig> sub-clades that expanded earlier than those in m <dig>  some m <dig> and u <dig> sub-clades could be linked with certain events.
for example, u6a <dig> and m1b, with their coalescent ages of ~ <dig> – <dig>  years ago and earliest inferred expansion in northwest africa, could coincide with the flourishing of the iberomaurusian industry, whilst u6b and m1b <dig> appeared at the time of the capsian culture.
carriers of these maternal lineages have been later absorbed into and diversified further during the spread of afro-asiatic languages in north and east africa.
