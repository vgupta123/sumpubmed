in the present study, we examined acetaldehyde reaction with human carbonic anhydrase  isozyme ii, which has several features that make it a suitable target protein: it is widely expressed, its enzymatic activity can be monitored, its structural and catalytic properties are known, and it contains  <dig> lysine residues, which are accessible sites for aldehyde reaction.
however, functional consequences of such modification remain poorly defined.
the acetaldehyde-modified protein showed decreased ca enzymatic activity.
the acetaldehyde-derived modifications in ca ii molecule may have physiological consequences in alcoholic patients.
acetaldehyde treatment in the absence and presence of a reducing agent ) caused shifts in the pi values of ca ii.
high-resolution mass spectra of ca ii, measured with and without nabh <dig>  indicated the presence of an unmodified protein, as expected.
mass spectra of ca ii treated with acetaldehyde revealed a modified protein form , consistent with a "schiff base" formation between acetaldehyde and one of the primary nh <dig> groups  in the protein structure.
in reducing conditions, each ca ii molecule had reacted with 9â€“ <dig>  acetaldehyde molecules , consistent with further reduction of the "schiff bases" to substituted amines .
sds-page indicated a shift toward a slightly higher molecular mass.
