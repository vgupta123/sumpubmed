it approximates the movie matrix by non-negative combinations of the extreme vectors.
motivated by a data-specific, non-negative mixture model, the algorithm aims to select the generating extreme vectors of a convex cone that contains the data.
evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm can identify the relevant biological signals on imaging data from the honeybee al, as well as it can recover implanted source signals from artificial data.
these correspond to pure glomerular signals that are not mixed with neighbour signals.
the main algorithm behind imagebee is a matrix factorisation approach.
optical imaging with calcium-sensitive dyes allows us to record these activity patterns and to gain insight into olfactory information processing in the brain.
in the antennal lobe, a dedicated olfactory center of the honeybee brain, odours are encoded as activity patterns of coding units, the so-called glomeruli.
imagebee enables automated data processing and visualisation for optical imaging data from the insect al.
