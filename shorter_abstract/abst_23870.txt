however, the reliability of tis annotation in widely used databases such as refseq is uncertain due to the lack of experimental benchmarks.
based on a homogeneity assumption that gene translation-related signals are uniformly distributed across a genome, we have established a computational method for a large-scale quantitative assessment of the reliability of tis annotations for any prokaryotic genome.
the method is applied to estimate the accuracy of tis annotations that are provided on public databases such as refseq and protisa and by programs such as easygene, genemarks, glimmer  <dig> and tico.
large-scale computational evaluation of tis annotation has been achieved.
the method consists of modeling a positional weight matrix  of aligned sequences around predicted tiss in terms of a linear combination of three elementary pwms, one for true tis and the two others for false tiss.
finally, we have established a new tis database, suptisa, based on the best prediction of all the predictors; suptisa has achieved an average accuracy of 92% over all  <dig> complete genomes.
a new tis database much better than refseq has been constructed, and it provides a valuable resource for further tis studies.
with convincing proofs, we show two general preferential biases in the refseq annotation, i.e.
the three elementary pwms are obtained using a reference set with highly reliable tis predictions.
a generalized least square estimator determines the weighting of the true tis in the observed pwm, from which the accuracy of the prediction is derived.
accurate annotation of translation initiation sites  is essential for understanding the translation initiation mechanism.
