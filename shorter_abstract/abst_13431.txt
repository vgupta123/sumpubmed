however, the role of mir- <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis remains unclear.
mir- <dig> may be involved in the post-transcription regulation of mrnas such as ncor <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis.
microrna- <dig>  has been shown to be mainly expressed in the testis and brain, and that its expression levels are by far the highest in the testis.
specifically, mir- <dig> expression was restricted to the germ cells from spermatogonia to round spermatids.
overexpression of mir- <dig> promoted the proliferation of a germ cell line, gc-1spg.
