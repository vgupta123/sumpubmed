these plants  showed enhanced biomass yield, reduced internodal length, increased shoot branching and trichome density, and a delay in flowering time.
this is the first report of changes in global gene expression in response to mir <dig> overexpression in alfalfa.
the gene ontology terms characterized electron transporter, starch synthase activity, sucrose transport, sucrose-phosphate synthase activity, chitin binding, sexual reproduction, flavonoid biosynthesis and lignin catabolism correlate well to the phenotypes of mir156oe alfalfa plants.
the discovered mir156-targeted spl genes belonging to different clades indicate mir <dig> plays fundamental and multifunctional roles in regulating alfalfa plant development.
a total of  <dig> genes  were selected for quantitative real-time pcr  validation, which showed that gene expression levels were largely consistent between qrt-pcr and rna-seq data.
in addition to the established spl genes msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig>  four new spls; msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig> were also down-regulated significantly in both mir156oe plants.
these seven spl genes belong to genes phylogeny clades vi, iv, viii, v and vii, which have been reported to be targeted by mir <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana.
a total of  <dig>  transcripts were generated using trinity de novo assembly and  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed genes were detected in mir156oe plants a11a and a <dig> using the medicago truncatula genome as reference.
medicago sativa  is a low-input forage and potential bioenergy crop, and improving its yield and quality has always been a focus of the alfalfa breeding industry.

to further illustrate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mir <dig> in alfalfa, two mir156oe genotypes  were subjected to next generation rna sequencing with illumina hiseq.
