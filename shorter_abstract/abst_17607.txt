branching is unaffected by similar laser power delivered to the immediately adjacent non-neural mesodermal tissue, by blocking cholinergic receptors or by blocking synaptic transmission with botulinum toxin a. because adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation also contribute to branching in the vertebrate lung, the direct dependence on nerves for airway branching was tested by deleting neurons in drosophila embryos.
this system confirmed that even in the absence of a vasculature or epithelial proliferation, airway branching is still disrupted by neural lesioning.
the need for innervation persists in the fly, wherein adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation are absent.
in the vertebrate lung, deleting enhanced green fluorescent protein -labeled intrinsic neurons using a two-photon laser leaves adjacent cells intact, but abolishes branching.
parasympathetic signaling has been inferred to regulate epithelial branching as well as organ regeneration and tumor development.
together, this shows that airway morphogenesis requires local innervation in vertebrates and invertebrates, yet neurotransmission is dispensable.
