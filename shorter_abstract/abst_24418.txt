our study presents the most extensive profiling of erythrocyte rnas to date, and describes primate-specific interactions between the key modulator mir-4732-3p and tgf-β signaling during human erythropoiesis.
human erythrocytes are terminally differentiated, anucleate cells long thought to lack rnas.
furthermore, mir-4732-3p represses smad2/4-dependent tgf-β signaling, thereby promoting cell proliferation during erythroid differentiation.
joint analysis of both short and long rnas identified several loci with co-expression of both micrornas and long rnas spanning microrna precursor regions.
within the mir-144/ <dig> locus previously implicated in erythroid development, we observed unique co-expression of several primate-specific noncoding rnas, including a lncrna, and mir-4732-5p/-3p.
to comprehensively define the erythrocyte transcriptome, we used high-throughput sequencing to identify both short  and long  rnas in mature erythrocytes.
analysis of the short rna transcriptome with mirdeep identified  <dig> known and  <dig> putative novel micrornas.
we show that mir-4732-3p targets both smad <dig> and smad <dig>  two critical components of the tgf-β pathway implicated in erythropoiesis.
additionally, the erythrocyte long rna transcriptome is significantly enriched in the erythroid progenitor transcriptome.
unexpectedly, we also uncover an extensive repertoire of long erythrocyte rnas that encode many proteins critical for erythrocyte differentiation and function.
