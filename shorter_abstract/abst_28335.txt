consequently, several molecular targets based on the sequences of housekeeping genes, non-functional rna and structural ribosomal rnas have been proposed for the detection and identification of mycobacteria in clinical or environmental samples.
genomes in order to design sensitive and specific molecular targets.
while certain of these targets were proposed as specific for this genus, most are prone to false positive results in complex environmental samples that include related, but distinct, bacterial genera.
the environment is the likely source of many pathogenic mycobacterial species but detection of mycobacteria by bacteriological tools is generally difficult and time-consuming.
the real-time pcr method we developed was successfully used to detect mycobacteria in tap water and lake samples.
the results indicate that this real-time pcr method targeting the atpe gene can serve for highly specific detection and precise quantification of mycobacterium spp.
consequently, we conducted an in silico search for proteins exclusive to mycobacterium spp.
among the  <dig> predicted proteins from m. tuberculosis h37rv, only  <dig> proteins showed 80% to 100% of similarity with mycobacterium spp.
based on dna sequence alignments, we designed primer pairs and a probe that specifically detect the atpe gene of mycobacteria, as verified by quantitative real-time pcr on a collection of mycobacteria and non-mycobacterial species.
