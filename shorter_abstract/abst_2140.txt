the aim of the present work was to develop a set of functional microsatellite  markers, via an in silico analysis of publicly available dna sequence.
as a results of blastn analyses, several eggplant ssrs were found to have homologous counterparts in the phylogenetically related species, which carry microsatellite motifs in the same position.
their high level of transferability to other solanaceae species can be used to provide anchoring points for the integration of genetic maps across species.
from > <dig>  genic dna sequences,  <dig> ssr-containing candidates suitable for primer design were recovered.
few analyses have been carried out to determine the genetic diversity of eggplant at the dna level, and linkage relationships have not been well characterised.
the usefulness of the ssr assays for diversity analysis and taxonomic discrimination was demonstrated by constructing a phylogeny based on ssr polymorphisms, and by the demonstration that most were also functional when tested with template from tomato, pepper and potato.
as for the other solanaceae crop species , the level of intra-specific polymorphism appears to be rather limited, and so it is important that an effort is made to develop more informative dna markers to make progress in understanding the genetics of eggplant and to advance its breeding.
