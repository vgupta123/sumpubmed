three developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil -added drinking water from gestational day   <dig> till postnatal day   <dig>  then, the total and phorsporylated erk1/ <dig> and total and phorsporylated creb in the hippocampus were detected with western blot on pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig> and pn <dig>
here, we show that hippocampal extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and camp response element-binding protein  are implicated in the impaired learning and memory in lactational and adolescent rat hippocampus following developmental id and hypothyroidism.
developmental id and hypothyroidism down-regulate hippocampal erk1/ <dig> and creb in lactational and adolescent rats.
