this simulation pipeline allows direct comparisons of simulated and observed data in a controlled environment.
using the same raw read genomic data as input, there are several different approaches being used to infer phylogenetic tree.
using phylogenomic analysis tools for tracking pathogens has become standard practice in academia, public health agencies, and large industries.

however, despite extensive validation on benchmark datasets and comparison with other pipelines, we lack methods for fully exploring the effects of multiple parameter values in each pipeline that can potentially have an effect on whether the correct phylogenetic tree is recovered.
