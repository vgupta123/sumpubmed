bacteria isolated in different probiotic prospecting studies, using de man, rogosa and sharpe medium , were typed at species level by pcr amplification of 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacers using universal primers that anneal within 16s and 23s genes, followed by restriction digestion analyses of pcr products.
lactobacillus isolates and several other strains of bacteria co-isolated on mrs medium from gastrointestinal ecosystem and fermented food products could be identified using dna fingerprints generated by restriction endonucleases.
the in silico predictions of restriction patterns generated by the lactobacillus shorter spacers digested with  <dig> restriction enzymes with  <dig> bp specificities allowed us to distinguish almost all isolates at the species level but not at the subspecies one.
the accurate identification of lactobacillus and other co-isolated bacteria during microbial ecological studies of ecosystems such as the human or animal intestinal tracts and food products is a hard task by phenotypic methods requiring additional tests such as protein and/or lipids profiling.
simultaneous theoretical digestions of the three spacers  with the same set of enzymes provided more complex patterns and allowed us to distinguish the species without purifying and cloning of pcr products.
