in addition, p. cinnabarinus possesses a complete versatile enzymatic arsenal for lignin breakdown.
the distribution of lignocellulolytic enzymes in the secretomes was strongly dependent on growth conditions, especially for lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases.
p. cinnabarinus presents a typical distribution of all the specific families found in the white-rot life style.
in-depth analyses were carried out for the numerous enzyme families involved in lignocellulosic biomass breakdown, for protein secretion and glycosylation pathways, and for mating type.
with its available genome sequence, p. cinnabarinus is now an outstanding model system for the study of the enzyme machinery involved in the degradation or transformation of lignocellulosic biomass.
the  <dig>  megabase genome of p. cinnabarinus was sequenced and assembled, and the  <dig>  predicted genes were functionally annotated using a phylogenomic procedure.
the p. cinnabarinus genome sequence revealed a consistent repertoire of genes shared with wood-decaying basidiomycetes.
p. cinnabarinus is thus fully equipped with the classical families involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, whereas its pectinolytic repertoire appears relatively limited.
growth profiling of p. cinnabarinus was performed on  <dig> carbon sources including simple and complex substrates to study substrate utilization and preferences.
p. cinnabarinus grew faster on crude plant substrates than on pure, mono- or polysaccharide substrates.
finally, proteomic analyses were conducted from liquid and solid-state fermentation to analyze the composition of the secretomes corresponding to growth on different substrates.
the wood-decayer pycnoporus cinnabarinus is a model fungus for the study of plant cell wall decomposition and is used for a number of applications in green and white biotechnology.
