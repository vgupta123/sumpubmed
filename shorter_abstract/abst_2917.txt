we analyzed the influence of filtering by fraction present calls introduced by j.n.
we show that filtering by fraction present calls increased correlations for all  <dig> preprocessing algorithms.
the use of the more recent annotation improves the results in both types of studies, encouraging re-analysis of old data.
the main goal of these methods is to remove effects of non-specific hybridization, and to optimally combine information from multiple probes annotated to the same transcript.
affymetrix genechip microarrays are popular platforms for expression profiling in two types of studies: detection of differential expression computed by p-values of t-test and estimation of fold change between analyzed groups.
the methods are benchmarked by comparison with reference methods, such as quantitative reverse-transcription pcr .
we present a comprehensive analysis of agreement between affymetrix genechip and qrt-pcr results.
because of evolution of genome sequence annotations since the time when microarrays were designed, we also studied the effect of the annotation release date.
we observed the difference in performance of pm-mm and pm-only methods: using mm probes increased correlations in fold change studies, but pm-only methods proved to perform better in detection of differential expression.
we recommend using gc-rma for detection of differential expression and plier for estimation of fold change.
