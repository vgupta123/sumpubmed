the apparently conservative nature of this trait means that changes in chondrogenetic patterns may serve as useful phylogenetic characters at higher taxonomic levels in tetrapods.
we aim to examine the potential relation of changes in developmental timing  to the origin of limb morphological diversity in an explicit comparative and quantitative framework.
this pattern is either retained or re-evolved in eulipotyphlan insectivores  and taken to its extreme in marsupials.
major heterochronic changes in early limb development and chondrogenesis were absent within major clades except lissamphibia, and their presence across vertebrate phylogeny are not easily correlated with adaptive phenomena related to morphological differences in the adult fore- and hindlimbs.
tetrapods exhibit great diversity in limb structures among species and also between forelimbs and hindlimbs within species, diversity which frequently correlates with locomotor modes and life history.
our results highlight the more important role generally played by allometric heterochrony in this instance to shape adult morphology.
in the primitive condition, as seen in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, the forelimb/pectoral fin develops earlier than the hindlimb/pelvic fin.
an overall pattern of change across tetrapods can be discerned and appears to be relatively clade-specific.
although exceptions are known, the two anurans we examined reversed the pattern and displayed a significant advance in hindlimb development.
