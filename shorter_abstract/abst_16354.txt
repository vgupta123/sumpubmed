subsets of b-cells containing cell numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and with frequencies varying between  <dig>  and  <dig> percent were sorted, subjected to mrna purification, amplified by the nugen protocol and finally analysed by the affymetrix platform.
this included steps for cell sorting, cell lysis/stabilization, rna isolation, rna concentration and amplification for microarray analysis.
finally, in normal bone marrow and tonsil samples, eight evaluated genes were expressed in accordance with the biology of lymphopoiesis , which enabled the generation of a gene-specific b-cell atlas.
the workflow described in this report will enable the generation of microarray data from minor sorted b-cell subsets.
first, an analysis of four cancer cell lines on affymetrix arrays, using either 100 ng rna labelled with the ambion standard protocol or 1 ng rna amplified and labelled by the nugen protocol, revealed a significant correlation of gene expressions .
normal lymphoid tissues from blood, tonsils, thymus and bone marrow were immunophenotyped by the 8-colour euroflow panel using multiparametric flow cytometry.
comparison of qpcr data in samples with or without amplification for  <dig> genes showed that a relative difference between six cell lines was preserved .
this report describes a method for the generation of global gene expression profiles from low frequent b-cell subsets by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and rna amplification.
third, the identity of the b-cell subsets validated by the cluster of differentiation  membrane profile was highly concordant with the transcriptional gene expression .
