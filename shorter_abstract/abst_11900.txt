in addition, cug2-deficient embryos contained mitotically arrested cells displaying abnormal spindle formation and chromosome misalignment in the neural plate.
therefore, our findings suggest that cug <dig> is required for normal mitosis during early neurogenesis and has functions in neuronal cell maintenance, thus demonstrating that the cug <dig> deficient embryos may provide a model system for human neurodegenerative disorders.
morpholino-mediated knockdown of cug <dig> resulted in apoptosis throughout the cns and the development of neurodegenerative phenotypes.
however, the in vivo function of cug <dig> has not been studied in animal models.
we recently identified a novel oncogene, cancer-upregulated gene  <dig> , which is essential for kinetochore formation and promotes tumorigenesis in mammalian cells.
