axenic multiplication and differentiation processes of this protozoan parasite can be reproduced in vitro, enabling the isolation and study of the different evolutionary forms.
although there are several publications attempting the cultivation of t. cruzi under chemically defined conditions, in our experience none of the published media are capable of maintaining t. cruzi in continuous growth.
the establishment of a defined medium for t. cruzi cultivation is an important tool for basic biological research allowing several different approaches, providing new perspectives for further studies related to cell biology of this parasite.
the resulting lm <dig> and lm14b defined media enabled cultivation of five different strains of t. cruzi for more than forty passages until now.
trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of chagas disease, alternates between distinct morphological and functional forms during its life cycle.
the parasite’s biological characteristics such as morphology and differentiation to metacyclic trypomastigotes were maintained when defined media is used.
