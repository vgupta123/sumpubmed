in previous microarray analyses, several genes have been identified that are downregulated in sterile mutants compared to the wild type.
analysis of tap <dig> transcript levels in the wild type under conditions allowing only vegetative growth compared to conditions that lead to fruiting body development showed that tap <dig> is not only downregulated in developmental mutants but is also upregulated in the wild type during fruiting body development.
transformation of the s. macrospora wild type with this construct resulted in a tap <dig> deletion strain where tap <dig> had been replaced by the hph cassette.
the knockout strain displayed no phenotypic differences under conditions of vegetative growth and sexual development when compared to the wild type.
the tap <dig> transcript is strongly upregulated during sexual development in s. macrospora; however, analysis of a tap <dig> knockout strain shows that tap <dig> is not essential for fruiting body formation in s. macrospora.
we have cloned and sequenced a  <dig>  kb fragment of genomic dna containing the tap <dig> open reading frame and adjoining sequences.
to determine whether tap <dig> is involved in fruiting body development in s. macrospora, a knockout construct was generated in which the tap <dig> open reading frame was replaced by the hygromycin b resistance gene hph under the control of fungal regulatory regions.
the genomic region comprising tap <dig> is syntenic to its homologous region in the closely related filamentous fungus neurospora crassa.
double mutants carrying the Î”tap <dig> allele in several developmental mutant backgrounds were phenotypically similar to the corresponding developmental mutant strains.
