highly expressed aox transgenic tomato and petunia plants were selfed and transgenic r <dig> seedlings from  <dig> tomato lines and  <dig> petunia lines were used for bioassay.
in all assayed transgenic tomato lines, a higher percentage of transgenic progeny had lower tswv levels than non-transgenic plants after challenge with tswv, and the significantly increased resistant levels of tomato and petunia lines identified in this study indicate that altered expression levels of aox in tomato and petunia can affect the levels of tswv resistance.
we show here that the over-expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase  in tomato and petunia is related to tswv resistance.
tomato spotted wilt virus  has a very wide host range, and is transmitted in a persistent manner by several species of thrips.
