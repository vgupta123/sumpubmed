the grn model proposed vasohibin- <dig>  as one of the candidate master-regulators of ec apoptosis with numerous downstream mrnas.
numerous gene expression studies of ec apoptosis have also been performed, however few attempts have been made to use gene expression data to identify the molecular relationships and master regulators that underlie ec apoptosis.
when generating the grn, this ec time course data was supplemented by a library of microarray data from ec treated with sirnas targeting over  <dig> signalling molecules.
we have utilised bayesian grn modelling to identify a novel candidate master regulator of ec apoptosis.
ecs were induced to undergo apoptosis using serum withdrawal and followed over a time course in triplicate, using microarrays.
this study demonstrates how grn technology can complement traditional methods to hypothesise the regulatory relationships that underlie important biological processes.
