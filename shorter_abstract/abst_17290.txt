motor performance, longevity, and motor neuron counts were measured in treated and disease controls.
kd fed mice lost 50% of baseline motor performance  <dig> days later than disease controls.
the cause of neuronal death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is uncertain but mitochondrial dysfunction may play an important role.
kd animals weighed  <dig>  g more than disease control animals at study endpoint; the interaction between diet and change in weight was significant .
in spinal cord sections obtained at the study endpoint, there were more motor neurons in kd fed animals .
these effects may be due to the ability of ketone bodies to promote atp synthesis and bypass inhibition of complex i in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
because mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in neuronal cell death in als, we also studied the effect that the principal ketone body, d-Î²- <dig> hydroxybutyrate , has on mitochondrial atp generation and neuroprotection.
dbh prevented rotenone mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex i but not malonate inhibition of complex ii.
blood ketones were >  <dig>  times higher in kd fed animals compared to controls.
rotenone neurotoxicity in smi- <dig> immunopositive motor neurons was also inhibited by dbh.
sod1-g93a transgenic als mice were fed a ketogenic diet  based on known formulations for humans.
