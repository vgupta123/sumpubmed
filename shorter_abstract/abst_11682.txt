in a network analysis, these genes were part of insulin signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling and extracellular matrix pathways.
hierarchical clustering of all  <dig> genes differentially regulated between young and old wt and young and old ercc1-/Δ mice showed cluster formation between young wt and ercc1-/Δ as well as old wt and ercc1-/Δ samples.
here, we compared the glomerular transcriptome of young and aged ercc1-deficient mice to young and aged wt mice in order to establish a novel model for research of aging-related kidney disease.
go term enrichment analysis revealed these genes to be involved in immune and inflammatory response, cell death, and chemotaxis.
in a principal component analysis, age and genotype emerged as first and second principal components.
at the level of the transcriptome, the pattern of gene activities is similar in the progeroid ercc1-/Δ mouse model constituting a valuable tool for future studies of aging-associated glomerular pathologies.
