these co-expressed mrnas were enriched in development-related biological processes such as muscle system processes, regulation of cell growth, muscle cell development, regulation of transcription, and embryonic morphogenesis.
notably, in pairwise comparisons between the libraries of skeletal muscle at the different development stages, a total of  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  which were validated by qpcr using randomly selected six lncrna genes.
additionally, pearson’s correlation coefficients of co-expression levels suggested  <dig> lncrnas and  <dig>  mrnas were possibly in trans-regulatory relationships .
the identified goat lncrnas shared some characteristics, such as fewer exons and shorter length, with the lncrnas in other mammals.
we also found  <dig> lncrnas genes were neighbored  <dig> protein-coding genes  and functionally enriched in transcriptional regulation and development-related processes, indicating they may be in cis-regulatory relationships.
however, there are few reports on the characterization of lncrnas covering all the development stages of skeletal muscle in livestock.
among them,  <dig> lncrna transcripts corresponding to  <dig> lncrna genes were identified, including  <dig> intergenic lncrnas and  <dig> anti-sense lncrnas.
rna libraries constructed from developing longissimus dorsi muscle of fetal  and postnatal  goat  were sequenced.
large numbers of lncrnas have been identified in mouse, rat, and human, and some of them have been shown to play important roles in muscle development and myogenesis.
this study provides a catalog of goat muscle-related lncrnas, and will contribute to a fuller understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning muscle development in mammals.
