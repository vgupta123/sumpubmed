we have replaced arginine residues on the face of glycan-free recombinant hrp opposite to the active site by lysines.
with conventional immobilisation techniques, the enzyme adheres in random orientation: the active site may face the solid phase rather than bulk medium, impeding substrate access and leading to sub-optimal catalytic performance.
directional, orientated, immobilisation of rhrp mutants onto an activated, modified polyethersulfone membrane has been achieved with excellent retention of catalytic activity; however, re-engineering of acceptable stability characteristics into the "immobilisation mutants" will determine their applicability in diagnosis and biosensor development.
a greater degree of immobilisation on cnbr-activated sepharoseâ„¢ was noted with increased lysine content; however, only marginal gains in solvent stability resulted from immobilisation on this latter matrix.
orientated hrp immobilisation was demonstrated using a modified polyethersulfone  membrane; the protein was forced to orientate its active site away from the membrane and towards the bulk solution phase.
our strategy differs from previous reports of specific hrp immobilisation via an engineered affinity tag or single reactive residue.
the ability to immobilise hrp in a directional manner, such that the active site would always face outwards from the insoluble matrix, would maximise the immobilised enzyme's catalytic potential and could increase hrp's range of actual and potential applications.
these conservative arg-to-lys substitutions provide a means of multipoint covalent immobilisation such that the active site will always face away from the immobilisation matrix.
while most mutants were less stable in free solution than wild type rhrp, the quadruple revertant regained some stability over its mutant counterparts.
