the value of precision varies from 29% to 90%.
this is still very useful for narrowing down the range of the disease gene location.
to our knowledge, no algorithm can give good results for this case.
we propose a model using the parsimony principle that can be viewed as an extension of the model first proposed by dan gusfield.
our heuristic algorithm uses clarkâ€™s inference rule to infer haplotype segments.
linkage analysis is the first step in the search for a disease gene.
in this paper, we study a very important case, where the sampled individuals are closely related, but the pedigree is not given.
experiments show that our program performs well.
linkage studies have facilitated the identification of several hundred human genes that can harbor mutations leading to a disease phenotype.
the recall value is from 90% to 99% in various cases.
to solve this problem, we first developed some heuristic algorithms for haplotype inference without any given pedigree.
we ran our program both on the simulated data and a set of real data from the phase ii hapmap database.
this implies that the program can report more than 90% of the true mutation regions.
when the precision is 29%, the size of the reported regions is three times that of the true mutation region.
