following a period of differential feeding, body-weight and liver weight were  <dig> and 4 kg higher, respectively, for adlib compared with res animals.
the data were compared with those of control animals offered the same diet on an ad libitum basis throughout .
greater expression of cell cycle and cell proliferation genes during cg was associated with a 100 % recovery of liver weight during re-alimentation.
degs indicated down-regulation of processes including nutrient transport, cell division and proliferation in res.
this study aimed to uncover the molecular mechanisms regulating the hepatic expression of cg in cattle, utilising rnaseq.
at this time rnaseq analysis of liver tissue revealed  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes  between the two treatments.
rnaseq was performed on hepatic tissue of bulls following 125 days of dietary restriction  and again following 55 days of subsequent re-alimentation during which the animals exhibited significant cg.
elucidation of the molecular control of cg may yield critical information on genes and pathways which could be targeted as putative molecular biomarkers for the selection of animals with improved cg potential.
compensatory growth  is an accelerated growth phenomenon observed in animals upon re-alimentation following a period of dietary restriction.

the subsequent 55 days of ad libitum feeding for both groups resulted in the body-weight difference reduced to 84 kg, with no difference in liver weight between treatment groups.
in particular, hepatic expression of cell proliferation and growth genes were greater in animals undergoing cg.
