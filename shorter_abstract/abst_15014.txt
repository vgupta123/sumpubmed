a phylogenetic tree based on rdrp amino acid sequences was constructed, and eight monophyletic groups were defined.
the same groups identified in the rdrp phylogenetic tree were retrieved by a clustering analysis of the melting curves data obtained from rnaheat.
these findings are a robust basis for the development of in vitro systems to ssrna melting curves detection.
alignments of rdrp rna sequences from each group were screened to identify rna regions with conserved secondary structure.
furthermore, conserved rna structures may be determined from analysis of individuals that are phylogenetically related, and these regions may be used to support the reconstitution of their phylogenetic groups.
until now, the secondary structure of single-stranded nucleic acids has not been exploited to develop identification systems based on pcr.

this family comprises double-stranded rna virus, with a genome constituted by two orfs, orf <dig> and orf <dig>  which encodes the capsid/rna binding proteins and an rna-dependent rna polymerase , respectively.
moreover, the same approach was used to successfully discriminate different variants of trichomonas vaginalis virus, which was not possible by the visual comparison of the double stranded melting curves generated by meltsim.
afterwards, each dna or rna sequence was denatured in silico using the softwares meltsim and rnaheat that generate melting curves considering the denaturation of a double stranded dna and single stranded rna, respectively.
to test the potential of single-strand rna denaturation as a new alternative to detect specific nucleic acid variations, sequences from viruses of the totiviridae family were compared using a new in silico melting curve approach.
