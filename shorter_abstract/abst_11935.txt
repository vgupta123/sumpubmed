given that all six receptor families  can be found in representatives of the two major clades of bilateria, the protostomes and the deuterostomes, all six receptors must have coexisted in the last common ancestor of the protostomes and deuterostomes.
in the protostomes platynereis dumerilii  and priapulus caudatus , we have identified and pharmacologically characterized adrenergic α <dig> and α <dig> receptors that coexist with octopamine α, octopamine β, tyramine type  <dig>  and tyramine type  <dig> receptors.
in the deuterostome saccoglossus kowalevskii , we have identified and characterized octopamine α, octopamine β, tyramine type  <dig>  and tyramine type  <dig> receptors, representing the first examples of these receptors in deuterostomes.
using phylogenetic analysis and receptor pharmacology, here we have established that norepinephrine, octopamine, and tyramine receptors coexist in some marine invertebrates.
in phylogenetic analysis, we have also identified adrenergic and tyramine receptor orthologs in xenacoelomorphs.
our results clarify the history of monoamine signaling in bilaterians.
adrenergic receptors were lost from most insects and nematodes, and tyramine and octopamine receptors were lost from most deuterostomes.
however, the evolutionary relationships and origin of these transmitter systems remain unclear.
these receptors represent the first examples of adrenergic receptors in protostomes.
s. kowalevskii also has adrenergic α <dig> and α <dig> receptors, indicating that all three signaling systems coexist in this animal.
