teneurin- <dig> is a member of a family of type ii transmembrane proteins conserved from c.elegans to vertebrates.
closer analysis of the conserved region around the newly identified transcription start revealed promoter activity that was induced by emx <dig>  mutation of a predicted homeobox binding site decreased the promoter activity in different reporter assays in vitro and in vivo in electroporated chick embryos.
based on their distinct, complementary expression a possible function in the establishment of proper connectivity in the brain was postulated.
teneurin expression in vertebrates is best studied in mouse and chicken, where the four members teneurin- <dig> to - <dig> are predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system in area specific patterns.
a study of emx <dig> knock-out mice suggested a role of emx <dig> in regulating patterned teneurin expression.
however, the transcription factors contributing to these distinctive expression patterns are largely unknown.
