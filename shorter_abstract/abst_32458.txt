further analysis revealed that momyb <dig> has an important role in the cell wall biosynthesis pathway.
inoculation with mycelia mats displayed that the virulence of the Δmomyb <dig> mutant was not changed on rice leaves but was non-pathogenic on rice roots in comparison to the wild type guy <dig>  in addition, ∆momyb <dig> mutants showed increased resistance to osmotic stresses but more sensitive to cell wall stressor calcofluor white .
this study provides the evidence that momyb <dig> is a key regulator involved in conidiogenesis, stress response, cell wall integrity and pathogenesis on rice roots in the filamentous phytopathogen m. oryzae.

targeted gene deletion of momyb <dig> resulted in a significant reduction in vegetative growth and showed defects in conidiation and conidiophore development.
we identified the saccharomyces cerevisiae bas <dig> homolog myb <dig> in m. oryzae, named momyb <dig>  momyb <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids and has two sant domains and is well conserved in various organisms.
the myb super-family of proteins contain a group of functionally diverse transcriptional activators found in plant, animal and fungus.
myb proteins are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and have crucial roles in telomeres.
quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that the transcription levels of several conidiophore-related genes were apparently decreased in the Δmomyb <dig> mutant.
