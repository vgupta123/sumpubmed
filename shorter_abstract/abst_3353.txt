here we describe microbial intestinal communities of eleven individual atlantic cod  caught at a single location based on an extensively  <dig> sequenced 16s rrna library of the v <dig> region.
this high variation among specimens suggests that a complex combination of factors influence the species distribution of these intestinal communities.
this variation is further illustrated by community diversity estimates that fluctuate several orders of magnitude among specimens.
the shared otus belong to the orders of vibrionales, which quantitatively dominate the atlantic cod intestinal microbiota, followed by variable numbers of bacteroidales, erysipelotrichales, clostridiales, alteromonadales and deferribacterales.
the observation that specific members of the microbial intestinal community can be shared among vertebrate hosts has promoted the concept of a core microbiota whose composition is determined by host-specific selection.
