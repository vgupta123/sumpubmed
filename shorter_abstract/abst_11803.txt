in analyzing snps that modulate drug response, we found a variation that predicts a favorable response to metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes.
in this study we have sequenced and analyzed the genome of a south asian indian female  from the indian state of kerala.
with over  <dig>  billion people, india is estimated to contain three times more genetic diversity than does europe.
the availability of this complete genome and variants will further aid studies aimed at understanding genetic diversity, identifying clinically relevant changes and assessing disease burden in the indian population.
while genomes from people of european and asian descent have been sequenced, only recently has a single male genome from the indian subcontinent been published at sufficient depth and coverage.
we assessed the saif genome for snps with health and disease consequences and found that the individual was at a higher risk for multiple sclerosis and a few other diseases.
in addition, we report the presence of several additional snps of medical relevance.
comparison of the saif genome with several published personal genomes revealed that this individual shared ~50% of the snps with each of these genomes.
next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the understanding of diversity by enabling whole genome sequencing at greater speed and lower cost.
this is the first study to report the complete whole genome sequence of a female from the state of kerala in india.
