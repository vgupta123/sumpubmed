previous studies in ascomycetes have shown that the function of gene families of which the size is considerably larger in extant pathogens than in non-pathogens could be related to pathogenicity traits.
moreover, most studies which consider gene families in extant species only tend to explain observed differences in gene family sizes by gains rather than by losses, hereby largely underestimating the impact of gene loss during genome evolution.
by analyzing the evolutionary history of gene families we found that most gene families with an enlarged size in pathogens were present in an ancestor common to both pathogens and non-pathogens.
in our study we used a selection of recently published genomes of ascomycetes to analyze how gene family gains, duplications and losses have affected the origin of pathogenic traits.
however, by only comparing gene inventories in extant species, no insights can be gained into the evolutionary process that gave rise to these larger family sizes in pathogens.
we further show that expansion of gained or already existing families in a species-specific way is important to fine-tune the specificities of the pathogenic host-fungus interaction.
non-pathogen-specific losses largely outnumbered pathogen-specific losses.
species that did not develop pathogenicity seemed to have reduced their genetic complexity compared to their ancestors.
the majority of these families were selectively maintained in pathogenic lineages, but disappeared in non-pathogens.
