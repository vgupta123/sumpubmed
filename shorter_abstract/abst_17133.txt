using a wide variety of experimental data sets, we show that our algorithm consistently yields higher quality and more biologically meaningful clusters than current state-of-the-art methodologies.
post-genomic molecular biology has resulted in an explosion of data, providing measurements for large numbers of genes, proteins and metabolites.
we present a generative model-based bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm for microarray time series that employs gaussian process regression to capture the structure of the data.
by incorporating outlier measurements and replicate values, this clustering algorithm for time series microarray data provides a step towards a better treatment of the noise inherent in measurements from high-throughput genomic technologies.
outlier measurements at one or more time points present a significant challenge, while potentially valuable replicate information is often ignored by existing techniques.
the method automatically learns the optimum number of clusters and can incorporate non-uniformly sampled time points.
we demonstrate the importance of including replicate information, which we find enables the discrimination of additional distinct expression profiles.
by using a mixture model likelihood, our method permits a small proportion of the data to be modelled as outlier measurements, and adopts an empirical bayes approach which uses replicate observations to inform a prior distribution of the noise variance.
