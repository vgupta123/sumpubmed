comparative orthologous sequences  with other plant gene models were identified and allow to unravel the oak paleo-history.
our results suggest a good coverage of genes involved in these traits.
blast search against the swiss-prot database revealed putative homologs for  <dig>   unigene elements, but more extensive search with pfam, refseq_protein, refseq_rna and eight gene indices revealed homology for  <dig> % of them.
the est catalogue was examined for putative homologs of candidate genes involved in bud phenology, cuticle formation, phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and cell wall formation.
simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  were searched, resulting in  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  snps.
following clustering and assembly using tgicl pipeline,  <dig> , <dig> est sequences collapsed into  <dig>  tentative contigs and  <dig>  singletons, providing  <dig>  non-redundant sequences .
here, we describe the development of an est catalogue that will support ecosystem genomics studies, where geneticists, ecophysiologists, molecular biologists and ecologists join their efforts for understanding, monitoring and predicting functional genetic diversity.
we generated  <dig>  sequence reads from  <dig> cdna libraries using the sanger method.
this genomic resource provides a unique tool to discover genes of interest, study the oak transcriptome, and develop new markers to investigate functional diversity in natural populations.
