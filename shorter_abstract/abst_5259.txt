a phylogenetic tree based on the predicted amino acid sequences of the fibrinogen-related domains demonstrates that tenascin-c and tenascin-r are the most closely related vertebrate tenascins, with the most conserved repeat and domain organization.
both pufferfish genomes encode five tenascin genes: two tenascin-c paralogs, a tenascin-r with domain organization identical to mammalian and avian tenascin-r, a small tenascin-x with previously undescribed gk repeats, and a tenascin-w. four tenascin genes corresponding to tenascin-c, tenascin-r, tenascin-x and tenascin-w were also identified in the x. tropicalis genome.
in order to learn more about their origins and relationships to each other, as well as to clarify the nomenclature used to describe them, the tenascin genes of the urochordate ciona intestinalis, the pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis and takifugu rubripes and the frog xenopus tropicalis were identified and their gene organization and predicted protein products compared with the previously characterized tenascins of amniotes.
tenascins are a family of glycoproteins found primarily in the extracellular matrix of embryos where they help to regulate cell proliferation, adhesion and migration.
a single tenascin gene was identified in the genome of c. intestinalis that encodes a polypeptide with domain features common to all vertebrate tenascins.
the presence of a tenascin gene in urochordates but not other invertebrate phyla suggests that tenascins may be specific to chordates.
