whilst the numbers of reads and assembled contigs were comparable to similar sized studies of other non-model species, here a high proportion of novel genes were discovered across a wide range of putative function and localisation.
the use of 2gs technology for the development of markers is superior to previously described methods, in both numbers of markers and biological informativeness of those markers.
additionally, the data enabled identification of  <dig>  novel est-ssrs.
a subset of polymorphic snps was selected to develop a 384-snp opa assay using the illumina beadxpress platform.
large-scale snp discovery was undertaken in blackcurrant  using transcriptome-based 2gs  <dig> sequencing on the parental genotypes of a reference mapping population, to generate large numbers of novel markers for the construction of a high-density linkage map.
a relatively high proportion of visually monomorphic snps were investigated further by quantitative trait mapping of theta score outputs from beadstudio analysis, and this enabled additional snps to be placed on the two maps.
deep-level second generation sequencing  technologies are now being applied to non-model species as a viable and favourable alternative to sanger sequencing.
