based on a ‘concept of modality’, we give possible explanations how evolution can favor specialized defenses over a general defense.
in our study we question that thought and address the issue of how multiple predators affect the expression and evolution of inducible defenses.
we found for the first time that two invertebrate predators induce different shapes of the same morphological defensive traits in daphnia, rather than showing gradual or opposing reaction norms.
furthermore, the concept includes optimal responses and costs of maladaptions of prey phenotypes in environments where both predators co-occur or where they alternate.
this heterogeneity is often used synonymously to quantitative changes in predation risk, depending on the abundance and impact of predators.
we exposed d. barbata to chemical cues released by triops cancriformis and notonecta glauca, respectively.
our concept categorizes two-predator-prey systems into three major groups .
with d. barbata, we introduce a new multipredator-prey system with a wide array of morphological inducible defenses.
inducible defenses are a common and widespread form of phenotypic plasticity.
with that, we suggest that ‘modality’ matters as an important factor in understanding and explaining the evolution of inducible defenses.
additionally, we investigated the adaptive value of those defenses in direct predation trials, pairing each morphotype  against the other two and exposed them to one of the two predators.
however, differences in ‘modality’, that is, the qualitative aspect of natural selection caused by predators, can also cause heterogeneity.
