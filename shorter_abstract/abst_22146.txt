we measured the expression of  <dig> individual murine mirnas by bead-based flow-cytometric profiling of whole mouse mammary glands throughout a 16-point developmental time course, including juvenile, puberty, mature virgin, gestation, lactation, and involution stages.
the differential expression pattern of micrornas  during mammary gland development might provide insights into their role in regulating the homeostasis of the mammary epithelium.
our aim was to analyse these regulatory functions by deriving a comprehensive tissue-specific combined mirna and mrna expression profile of post-natal mouse mammary gland development.
one third  of all murine mirnas analysed were detected during mammary gland development.
micrornas were expressed in likely co-regulated clusters during mammary gland development.
for most detected mirna families we did not observe systematic changes in the expression of predicted targets.
for mirna families whose targets did show changes, we observed inverse patterns of mirna and target expression.
global mirna and mrna expression was significantly reduced during lactation and the early stages of involution after weaning.
in parallel whole-genome mrna expression data were obtained.
