the aim of the current work was to confirm the production of the main hemo- and immunoregulatory cytokines in human enc from bm.
cytokine production by erythroid nuclear cells suggests that these cells might be involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic and immunocompetent cells in human bm.
erythroid nuclear cells  of the bone marrow  have not previously been considered as important producers of wide spectrum of haemo- and immunoregulatory cytokines.
quantitative differences in tgf-β <dig> and tnf-α production were found between gl a+ and ag-eb+ bm enc.
thus, gl a+ and ag-eb+ enc produce il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tgf-β <dig> and tnf-α.
gl a+ enc also produce il- <dig>
we for the first time have shown, that the unstimulated erythroblasts  produced a wide spectrum of immunoregulatory cytokines.
we used native human bm enc in our experiments.
human bm enc produce cytokines such as interleukn -1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  interferon -γ, transforming growth factor -β <dig>  tumor necrosis factor -α and il- <dig>  they can be sub-divided into glycophorin a positive  and erythroblast antigen positive  cells.
