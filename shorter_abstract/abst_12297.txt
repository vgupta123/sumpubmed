we present and discuss the results of simulations that show that faast, through the use of the novel algorithm, can gain several percentage points of accuracy compared to smith-waterman-gotoh alignments, depending on the  <dig> data quality.
we suggest a novel algorithm for calculating the optimal local alignment which utilises flowpeak information in order to improve alignment accuracy.
