we assessed the quality of this reference transcriptome by annotating a ubiquitous gene family - ribosomal proteins - as well as gene families that have a more constrained spatio-temporal expression and are involved in development, immunity and olfaction.
we also provide a time-course of expression that we used to characterize the transcriptional regulation of the gene families studied.
similarly, we observed an interesting interplay of gene families involved in immunity between fat bodies and antennae.
in this study, we constructed a reference transcriptome assembly  of rna sequences obtained from more than 35â€‰s. frugiperda developmental time-points and tissue samples.
we conclude that the sf_tr2012b transcriptome is a valid reference transcriptome.
that allowed us to explore the spatial and temporal expression of genes and to observe that some olfactory receptors are expressed in antennae and palps but also in other non related tissues such as fat bodies.
many research groups are using s. frugiperda as a model organism to investigate questions such as plant adaptation, pest behavior or resistance to pesticides.
in addition, the sf <dig> cell line, widely used in biochemistry for in vitro protein production, is derived from s. frugiperda tissues.
