pure females presented parameters that were similar to those previously reported for m. americana; however, the parameters for hybrid females were different.
the results support the existence of well-established reproductive isolation among the most distant karyotype lineages and elucidates the need to define all karyotype variants and their geographical ranges in order to define the number of species of red brocket.
the red brocket deer, mazama americana, has at least six distinct karyotypes in different regions of south america that suggest the existence of various species that are today all referred to as m. americana.
this study sought to prove the existence of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in deer offspring between distinct chromosome lineages.
from an evolutionary perspective, the red brockets are a relatively recent clade that has gone through intense diversification.
