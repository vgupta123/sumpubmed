however, when fatty acid synthesis was chemically inhibited, polymer accumulated in m cells.
in this study, we provide evidence that access to substrate and neither poor targeting nor insufficient activity of the phb biosynthetic enzymes may be the limiting factor for polymer production in mesophyll chloroplasts of c <dig> plants.
phb enzyme activity was retained following targeting to m plastids and was equivalent to that found in the bs plastids.
the small subunit of rubisco from pea effectively targeted the phb biosynthesis enzymes to both m and bs chloroplasts of sugarcane and switchgrass.
here we explore various factors which might affect polymer accumulation in mesophyll cells, including targeting of the phb pathway enzymes to the mesophyll plastid and their access to substrate.
leaf total fatty acid content was not affected by phb production.
