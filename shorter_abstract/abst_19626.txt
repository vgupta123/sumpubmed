the results presented are potentially of great interest to resume the currently available expression data, exploiting the power of in silico analysis filtered by evolutionary conservation.
we have focused on pparα, a ligand-activated transcription factor functioning as fatty acid sensor controlling the gene expression regulation of a large set of genes in various metabolic organs such as liver, small intestine or heart.
moreover, a screening of the mdegs for all known transcription factor binding sites and the comparison with a human genome-wide screening of peroxisome proliferating response elements , enabled us to identify,  <dig> new potential candidate genes that show, both binding site, both change in expression in the condition studied.
to further investigate the function of pparα, we have applied a cross-species meta-analysis approach to integrate sixteen microarray datasets studying high fat diet and pparα signal perturbations in different organisms.
we identified  <dig> genes  that were differentially expressed in a constant way in response to a high fat diet or to perturbations in ppars signalling.
the function of pparα is strictly connected to the function of its target genes and, although many of these have already been identified, major elements of its physiological function remain to be uncovered.
currently, the availability of the large amounts of expression data in public repositories has opened up new challenges on microarray data analyses.
