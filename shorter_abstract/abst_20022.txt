pcr amplification and high-throughput sequencing theoretically enable the characterization of the finest-scale diversity in natural microbial and viral populations, but each of these methods introduces random errors that are difficult to distinguish from genuine biological diversity.
we demonstrate performance on control data sequenced on rocheâ€™s  <dig> platform, and compare the results to the most accurate denoising software currently available, ampliconnoise.
without training data, dada infers both the sample genotypes and error parameters that produced a metagenome data set.
it eliminates the need for training data to establish error parameters, fully utilizes sequence-abundance information, and enables inclusion of context-dependent pcr error rates.
