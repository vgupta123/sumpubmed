our approach has the advantage of being fast and scalable, while structure is very time-consuming because of the nature of mcmc in parameter estimation.
handling genotype data typed at hundreds of thousands of loci is very time-consuming and it is no exception for population structure inference.
therefore, we propose to apply pca to the genotype data of a population, select the significant principal components using the tracy-widom distribution, and assign the individuals to one or more subpopulations using generic clustering algorithms.
we investigated k-means, soft k-means and spectral clustering and made comparison to structure, a model-based algorithm specifically designed for population structure inference.
therefore, we suggest choosing the proper algorithm based on the application of population structure inference.
the results on four simulated datasets and two real datasets indicate that our approach performs comparably well to structure.
for the simulated datasets, structure and soft k-means with bic produced identical predictions on the number of subpopulations.
