rna sequencing revealed an open reading frame weakly transcribed in cow dung, coding for  <dig> residues and embedded completely in the − <dig> reading frame of citc in enterohemorrhagic e. coli.
this gene is designated novel overlapping gene, nog <dig>  the promoter region fused to gfp exhibits specific activities and 5’ rapid amplification of cdna ends indicated the transcriptional start 40-bp upstream of the start codon.
overprinting allows entirely novel proteins to evolve de novo, i.e., formerly non-coding open reading frames within functional genes become expressed.
gene duplication is believed to be the classical way to form novel genes, but overprinting may be an important alternative.
since nog <dig> is of recent origin, non-essential, short, weakly expressed and only marginally involved in e. coli’s central metabolism, we propose that this gene is in an initial stage of evolution.
only three cases have been described for escherichia coli.
this nog1-mutant showed a phenotype in competitive growth against wild type in the presence of mgcl <dig>  small differences in metabolite concentrations were also found.
