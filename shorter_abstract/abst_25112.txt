analyses of predicted ensembl protein sequences of nine deuterostome  and two protostome species  have revealed that the absence of expected signal peptides and violation of domain integrity account for the majority of mispredictions.
the current version of the mispred approach uses five distinct routines for identifying abnormal, incomplete or mispredicted entries based on the principle that a sequence is likely to be incorrect if some of its features conflict with our current knowledge about protein-coding genes and proteins:  conflict between the predicted subcellular localization of proteins and the absence of the corresponding sequence signals;  presence of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains and the absence of transmembrane segments;  co-occurrence of extracellular and nuclear domains;  violation of domain integrity;  chimeras encoded by two or more genes located on different chromosomes.
we suggest that application of the mispred approach will significantly improve the quality of gene predictions and the associated databases.
