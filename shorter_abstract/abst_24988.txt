the characterization of the hoxa <dig> interactome presented here suggests unexplored roles for hox proteins in cell-to-cell communication and cell physiology.
forty-one interactions were detectable in live cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation which revealed distinctive intracellular patterns for these interactions consistent with the selective recruitment of hoxa <dig> by subgroups of partner proteins at vesicular, cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments.
hox proteins are transcription factors involved in crucial processes during animal development.
while other families of transcription factors, like smad or stat, are known cell signaling transducers, such a function has never been squarely addressed for hox proteins.
fifty nine interactors were identified of which  <dig> could be confirmed by affinity co-purification in animal cell lines.
many hoxa <dig> interactors are proteins involved in cell-signaling transduction, cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking.
