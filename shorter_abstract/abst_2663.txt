to study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci  mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics.
sequence homologies of  <dig> homologous markers allowed to match  <dig> b. terrestris with a. mellifera lgs, five of them as composites.
the high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the b. terrestris genome on  <dig> linkage groups  and has a length of 2' <dig> cm with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm.
the bumblebee bombus terrestris is an ecologically and economically important pollinator and has become an important biological model system.
this study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both a. mellifera and b. terrestris and a long divergence time of about  <dig> million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved.
comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous lg.
we here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the apis mellifera genome using homologous markers.
based on a genome size of ~  <dig> mb, the recombination rate estimate is  <dig>  cm/mb.
this reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees.
