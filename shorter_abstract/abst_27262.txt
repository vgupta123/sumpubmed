in addition, the germination properties of the dag1rga <dig> double mutant are different from those of the dag <dig> and rga <dig> single mutants, suggesting that rga and dag <dig> act in independent branches of the pil5-controlled germination pathway.
based on the properties of gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> mutant seeds, we show here that the absence of rga severely increases dormancy, while lack of gai only partially compensates rga inactivation.
the transcription factor dof affecting germination <dig>  is a repressor of seed germination acting downstream of the master repressor phytocrome interacting factor3-like  <dig> .
rather than overlapping functions as previously suggested, we show that rga and gai play distinct roles in seed germination, and that gai interacts with dag <dig> in embryo development.
surprisingly, the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant proved embryo-lethal, suggesting an unexpected involvement of  dag <dig> and gai in embryo development.
