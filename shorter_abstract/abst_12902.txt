thus, automatic systems for the identification of citations of allelic variants of genes in biomedical texts are required.
our group has previously reported the development of osiris, a system aimed at the retrieval of literature about allelic variants of genes .
as an example, the application of the system for collecting literature citations for the allelic variants of genes related to the diseases intracranial aneurysm and breast cancer is presented.
here we describe the development of a new version of osiris  which incorporates a new entity recognition module and is built on top of a local mirror of the medline collection and hgenetinfodb: a database that collects data on human gene sequence variations.
the new entity recognition module is based on a pattern-based search algorithm for the identification of variation terms in the texts and their mapping to dbsnp identifiers.
the performance of osirisv <dig>  was evaluated on a manually annotated corpus, resulting in 99% precision, 82% recall, and an f-score of  <dig> .
single nucleotide polymorphisms, among other type of sequence variants, constitute key elements in genetic epidemiology and pharmacogenomics.
osirisv <dig>  can be used to link literature references to dbsnp database entries with high accuracy, and therefore is suitable for collecting current knowledge on gene sequence variations and supporting the functional annotation of variation databases.
