this study presents a first genome-wide analysis of these two species, based on two large collections of bac end sequences representing approximately 19% of the tomato genome and 10% of the potato genome.
on the other hand, simple sequence repeats are more abundant in potato than in tomato.
when the complete genome sequences of these species become available, whole-genome comparisons and protein- or repeat-family specific studies may shed more light on the observations made here.
the tomato genome has a higher repeat content than the potato genome, primarily due to a higher number of retrotransposon insertions in the tomato genome.
the findings in this paper present a first glimpse into the evolution of solanaceous genomes, both within the family and relative to other plant species.
moreover, the p <dig> superfamily appears to have expanded spectacularly in both species compared to arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting an expanded network of secondary metabolic pathways in the solanaceae.
major gene families such as cytochrome p <dig> mono-oxygenases and serine-threonine protein kinases are significantly overrepresented in potato, compared to tomato.
both tomato and potato appear to have a low level of microsynteny with a. thaliana.
