reconciliation analysis quantified the scale of duplication and gene loss, as well as identifying further apparent orthology sets, which lacked conservation of genomic position.
however, reconciliation analysis demonstrated that unilateral expansions of gene number through tandem gene duplication, transposition of gene duplicates to otherwise well conserved genomic positions, and differential patterns of gene loss have produced largely customised and idiosyncratic aat repertoires in all three species.
not least in t. brucei, which seems to have retained fewer ancestral loci and has acquired novel loci through a complex mix of tandem and transpositive duplication.
despite their importance to cell function and parasite development, the repertoires of aat loci in trypanosomatid parasites are relatively fluid in both complement and gene dosage.
large amino acid transporter gene families were identified from the genome sequences of three parasitic protists, trypanosoma brucei, trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania major.
this study provides a comprehensive phylogenetic account of the origins of these genes, redefining each locus according to a positional criterion, through the integration of phyletic identity with comparative gene order information.
other analyses identified clear instances of evolutionary rate changes post-duplication, the effects of concerted evolution within tandem gene arrays and gene conversion events between syntenic loci.
bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenies were in general agreement on systematic relationships and confirmed several 'orthology sets' of genes retained since divergence from the common ancestor.
each locus was individually specified by its surrounding gene order and associated with homologs showing the same position  in other species, where available.
