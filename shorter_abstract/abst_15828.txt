while attempting to reanalyze published data from agilent  <dig> Ã—  <dig> human expression chips, we found that some of the 60-mer olignucleotide features could not be interpreted as representing single human genes.
<dig>  reporters did not have a meaningful identifier, mapped to the wrong chromosome, or did not pass basic alignment tests preventing us from correlating the expression values of these reporters with a unique annotated human gene.
this evaluation can be done systematically and semi-automatically, but one must recognize that data sources are frequently updated leading to slightly changing validation results over time.
we decided to check the annotations for all autosomes and the x chromosome systematically using bioinformatics methods.
the remaining  <dig>  reporters could be associated with either a unique gene or a unique intergenic location, but could not be mapped to a transcript in refseq.
