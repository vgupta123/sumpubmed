after cloning of scfv cdna from the enriched sub-library, scfv specificity was validated by elisa for binding to recombinant protein from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources and ultimately naturally presented human protein on the cell membrane of human hepatocellular cell lines.
glypican- <dig>  is a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan frequently expressed on the cell membrane of malignant hepatocytes in hepatocellular carcinoma.
specificity was confirmed using non-expressing cell lines and shrna knockdown.
ultimately, five unique scfv with affinity ec <dig> ranging from  <dig> - <dig> nm were identified.
using a paired display/secretory yeast library, five novel and unique scfvs for potential humoral or chimeric therapeutic development in human hepatocellular carcinoma were isolated and characterized.
we hypothesized that we could utilize a recently described paired display/secretory yeast library to isolate human-derived scfv against glypican- <dig> for potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic application.
