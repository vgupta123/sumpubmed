autoimmunity plays an important role in this pathology outcome and body's own immune system attacks on the myelin sheath causing the damage.
other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.
results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease.
multiple sclerosis  is a disease of central nervous system that causes the removal of fatty myelin sheath from axons of the brain and spinal cord.
it gave useful insights that support the hypothesis of a breakdown of teff-treg cross balancing mechanisms.
we presented the results obtained using  <dig> genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the teff-treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level.
for simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both teff and treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates.
