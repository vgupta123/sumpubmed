the goal of our work was to provide new information about the dissection of normal bone marrow progenitor cells based upon the simultaneous detection by flow cytometry of aldh and early hematopoietic antigens, with particular attention to the expression of aldh on erythroid precursors.
to the best of our knowledge this finding is new and could be useful for basic studies about normal erythropoietic differentiation as well as for enabling the employment of aldh as a red cell marker in polychromatic flow cytometry characterization of bone marrow from patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia.
as compared to aldh-cd34+ cells, aldh+cd34+ cells expressed the phenotypic profile of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, with brighter expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  accompanied by lower display of cd <dig> and cd45ra.
to this aim, we used three kinds of approach: i) multidimensional analytical flow cytometry, detecting aldh and early hematopoietic antigens in normal bone marrow; ii) fluorescence activated cell sorting of distinct subpopulations of progenitor cells, followed by in vitro induction of erythroid differentiation; iii) detection of aldh+ cellular subsets in bone marrow from pure red cell aplasia patients.
aldehyde dehydrogenase  is a cytosolic enzyme highly expressed in hematopoietic precursors from cord blood and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood, as well as in bone marrow from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia.
as regards human normal bone marrow, detailed characterization of aldh+ cells has been addressed by one single study .
in normal bone marrow, we identified three populations of cells, namely aldh+cd34+, aldh-cd34+ and aldh+cd34- .
our study, comparing surface antigen expression of aldh+/cd34+, aldh-/cd34+ and aldh+/cd34- progenitor cell subsets in human bone marrow, clearly indicated that aldh+cd34- cells are mainly committed towards erythropoiesis.
first of all, aldh+cd34- cells showed a cd71bright, cd105+, cd45- phenotype.
finally, aldh+cd34- precursors were not detectable in patients with pure red cell aplasia .
