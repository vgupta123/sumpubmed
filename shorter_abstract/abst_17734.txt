we used lentivectors encoding green fluorescent protein  driven by the liver-specific apoliprotein a-ii  promoter to purify human hepatic progenitors.
we evaluated both integrating and integration-defective lentivectors in combination with an hiv integrase inhibitor.
a human embryonic stem cell line was differentiated into hepatic progenitors using a chemically defined protocol.
human pluripotent stem cells  hold great promise for applications in regenerative medicine.
we have developed an effective strategy to purify human hepatic cells from cultures of differentiating hpscs, producing a novel tool that could be used not only for cell therapy but also for in vitro applications such as drug screening.
however, the safety of cell therapy using differentiated hpsc derivatives must be improved through methods that will permit the transplantation of homogenous populations of a specific cell type.
subsequently, cells were transduced and sorted at day  <dig> of differentiation to obtain a cell population enriched in hepatic progenitor cells.
