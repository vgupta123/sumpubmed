here, we investigate the respective contributions of these activities to notch signaling in drosophila.
we show that expression of an isoform lacking fucosyltransferase activity, ofut1r245a, rescues the requirement for ofut <dig> in embryonic neurogenesis.
our results establish that notch does not need to be o-fucosylated for fringe-independent notch signaling in drosophila; the chaperone activity of ofut <dig> is sufficient for the generation of functional notch.
o-fucosyltransferase <dig>  is a conserved er protein essential for notch signaling.
lack of requirement for o-fucosylation is further supported by the absence of embryonic phenotypes in gmd mutants, which lack all forms of fucosylation.
ofut <dig> also possesses a chaperone activity that promotes the folding and secretion of notch.
