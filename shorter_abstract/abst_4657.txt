additionally, an interface that allows easy extension by a new module is provided.
this fundamental step is referred to as peak extraction.
current state-of-the-art peak extraction methods require human interaction, such as hand-picking approximate peak locations, assisted by a visualization of the data matrix.
in a high-throughput context, however, it is preferable to have robust methods for fully automated peak extraction.
we introduce peax, a modular framework for automated peak extraction.
combining the modules in all reasonable ways leads to a large number of peak extraction methods.
the automatically obtained results keep up with the results provided by current state-of-the-art peak extraction methods.
each peak in an mcc/im measurement represents a certain compound, which may be known or unknown.
our software peax is able to automatically extract peaks from mcc/im measurements within a few seconds.
for clustering and classification of measurements, the raw data matrix must be reduced to a set of peaks.
