we overexpressed snd <dig> in arabidopsis and analyzed homozygous lines with regards to stem chemistry, biomass and fibre secondary cell wall thickness.
our results reveal phenotypic differences in the effect of snd <dig> overexpression between woody and herbaceous stems and emphasize the importance of expression thresholds in transcription factor studies.
nac family member snd <dig> is an indirect target of a principal regulator of fibre secondary cell wall formation, snd <dig>  a previous study showed that overexpression of snd <dig> produced a fibre cell-specific increase in secondary cell wall thickness in arabidopsis stems, and that the protein was able to transactivate the cellulose synthase <dig>  promoter.
however, the full repertoire of genes regulated by snd <dig> is unknown, and the effect of its overexpression on cell wall chemistry remains unexplored.
only minor alterations in cell wall chemistry were detected.
we found evidence for upregulation of biosynthetic genes associated with cellulose, xylan, mannan and lignin polymerization in this line, in agreement with significant co-expression of these genes with native snd <dig> transcripts according to public microarray repositories.
this study supports a function for snd <dig> in the regulation of cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthetic genes in addition of those involved in lignin polymerization and signalling.
nac domain transcription factors initiate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in arabidopsis fibres and vessels by activating numerous transcriptional regulators and biosynthetic genes.
