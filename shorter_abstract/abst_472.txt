ap-2α is a transcription factor essential for neural crest cell migration and its mutation results in apoptosis within this cell population, as demonstrated by genetic models.
we down-modulated ap-2α expression in gn- <dig> neurons by rna interference and observe reduced neuron migration following the activation of a specific genetic programme including the adhesion related kinase  gene.
neuronal migration is a crucial process that allows neurons to reach their correct target location to allow the nervous system to function properly.
analysis of migration in ap-2α null mouse embryo fibroblasts also reveals an essential role for ap-2α in cell movement via the activation of a distinct genetic programme.
we show that ap-2α plays an essential role in cell movement via the activation of cell-specific genetic programmes.
