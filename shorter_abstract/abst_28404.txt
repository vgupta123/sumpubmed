the asymmetric unit contains two ncs molecules, and the intact tetramer generated by crystallographic symmetry may be functionally important.
here, we report the crystal structure of mj <dig>  solved by the mad procedure and refined to final r-factor and r-free values of  <dig>  &  <dig> %, respectively, at  <dig>  Ã… resolution.

the conservation of functional residues in the binding site for the co-factor, adomet, and in the putative precorrin- <dig> binding pocket suggested that mj <dig> may also possess cbit activity.
the overall tertiary structure and the tetrameric arrangements are highly homologous to those found in mt0146/cbit from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.
in the anaerobic pathway of cobalamin  synthesis, the cbit enzyme plays two roles, as a cobalt-precorrin- <dig> c15-methyltransferase and a c12-decarboxylase, to produce the intermediate, cobalt-precorrin  <dig>
