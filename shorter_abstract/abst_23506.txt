strain-dependent mechano-/signal-transduction in pdl cells involves abundance and activity of fak, map-kinases p42/ <dig>  and p <dig> stress kinase in conjunction with the amount of mmp- <dig>  and integrin subunits β <dig> and β <dig>  identifying the activated state of p42/ <dig> and p <dig> as critical for mmp- <dig> expression may indicate the mechanistic contribution of mechano-transducing molecules on executioners of ecm homeostasis.
mrna analysis by pathway-specific rt-profiler arrays revealed up- and/or down-regulation of genes assigning to map-kinase signalling and cell cycle, ecm and integrins and growth factors.
phosphorylated state responsible for the expression of mmp- <dig>  this finding may point to the obedience in the expression of this mmp as extracellular matrix  remodelling executioner from the activation state of mechano-transducing molecules.
among others, genes down-regulated are those of col- <dig> and col- <dig>  suggesting that strain-dependent mechano-transduction may transiently perturbate ecm homeostasis.
on the mechanistic level, molecules involved in this mechano-transduction process in pdl cells are not yet completely elucidated.
in the present study we show by western blot  analysis and/or indirect immunofluorescence  that mechanical strain modulates the amount of the matrix metalloproteinase mmp- <dig>  and induces non-coherent modulation in the amount and activity of signal transducing molecules, such as fak, map-kinases p42/ <dig>  and p <dig> stress kinase, suggesting their mechanistic role in mechano-transduction.
