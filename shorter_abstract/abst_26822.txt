it can be used to predict the effects of altered pathway components, collective actions of multiple mediators and the potential impact to various diseases.
based on the published ordinary differential equation models of the pathway components, we developed an integrated model of thrombin-, histamine-, and vegf-mediated mlc activation pathways.
similar to the published models of other pathways, our model can potentially be used to identify important disease genes through sensitivity analysis of signalling components.
our model was validated against experimental data for calcium release and thrombin-, histamine-, and vegf-mediated mlc activation.
the simulated effects of par- <dig>  rho gtpase, rock, vegf and vegfr <dig> over-expression on mlc activation, and the collective modulation by thrombin and histamine are consistent with experimental findings.
our model was used to predict enhanced mlc activation by cpi- <dig> over-expression and by synergistic action of thrombin and vegf at low mediator levels.
endothelial permeability is involved in injury, inflammation, diabetes and cancer.
these may have impact in endothelial permeability and metastasis in cancer patients with blood coagulation.
our model was validated against a number of experimental findings and the observed synergistic effects of low concentrations of thrombin and histamine in mediating the activation of mlc.
