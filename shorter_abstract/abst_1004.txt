sin <dig> is highly conserved in vertebrates , which possess an interferon system, suggesting that it has been subjected to powerful evolutionary constraint that has limited its diversification.
since sapk pathways are ancient and the ifn system is confined to vertebrates, the organization of the sin <dig> gene and the sequences of the sin <dig> protein have been compared across a wide taxonomic range of species.
the coding region of the vertebrate sin <dig> gene encompasses  <dig> exon and  <dig> introns, while in c. elegans the gene consists of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns organized distinctly from those of vertebrates.
recently, sin <dig> has also been shown to interact with the carboxyl terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain of the ovine type i interferon receptor subunit  <dig> .
sin <dig> possesses at least two unique sequences in its ifnar2-interacting region that are not represented in insects and other invertebrates.
scd iii, which is approximately  <dig> amino acids in length, is particularly highly conserved and is present in all the species examined, suggesting a conserved function from fungi to mammals.
