these results suggest that c57bl/ <dig> mice can be used as an experimental model to evaluate virulence differences among denv clinical isolates.
two strategies of intraperitoneal infection, which were based on the concept of the antibody dependent enhancement phenomenon, were used.
we showed that denv isolates could infect immunocompetent c57bl/ <dig> mice, which have has been previously used to study some aspect of dengue disease when infected with laboratory adapted strains.
several experimental animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis of dengue disease; however, most of the studies used laboratory-adapted viruses, which lack the virulence of viruses circulating in humans.
denv genome was detected in the same organs found in humans when autopsy and biopsy samples were analyzed, showing that c57bl/ <dig> mice reproduce some aspects of the denv tropism observed in humans.
the main difference observed between the d3/br/sl3/ <dig> and d2/br/rp/rmb/ <dig> clinical isolates was the neuroinvasive ability of the first one.
the d3/br/sl3/ <dig> isolate showed a higher ability of infection  in the experimental model compared to both the d2/br/rp/rmb/ <dig> isolate and a laboratory adapted denv- <dig> strain , regardless of the infection strategy used.
neuroinvasiveness has been described in some denv infected cases and is common for other members of the flavivirus genus.
