sampling and simulation show that the physics-based model is more specific for fold-defining interactions that vary less among residue type.
we find that both models violate the assumption of the native sequence being close to a thermodynamic optimum, causing directional selection away from the native state.
the informational model diffuses further in sequence space with fewer barriers and tends to provide less support for an invariant sites model, although amino acid substitutions are generally conservative.
this is partly due to improper packing of the hydrophobic core.
we suggest possible improvements on the representation of structure, folding energy, and binding function, as regards both native and non-native conformations, and describe a large number of possible applications for such a model.
