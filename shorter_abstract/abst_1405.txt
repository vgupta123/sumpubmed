alternatively, it is possible that pcsk <dig> may still play a critical role in nkx <dig> -expressing cardiac progenitors, with persistence of mrna or protein accounting for the lack of effect of deletion on heart development.
using a conditional deletion strategy, we find that there is an essential and specific requirement for pcsk <dig> in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for cardiogenesis, but not for conotruncal septation or any other aspect of embryonic development.
surprisingly, deletion of pcsk <dig> in cardiogenic or pharyngeal mesodermal progenitors that form later from the cranio-cardiac mesoderm does not affect heart development.
our results suggest that pcsk <dig> may have an essential and early role in the cranio-cardiac mesoderm for heart development.
loss of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type  <dig>  results in multiple developmental anomalies including cardiac malformations, caudal regression, pre-sacral mass, renal agenesis, anteroposterior patterning defects, and tracheo-oesophageal and anorectal malformations, and is a model for vacterl/caudal regression/currarino syndromes .
using magnetic resonance imaging , we examined heart development in mouse embryos with zygotic and cardiac specific deletion of pcsk <dig>  we show that conditional deletion of pcsk <dig> in all epiblastic lineages recapitulates all developmental malformations except for tracheo-esophageal malformations.
neither is pcsk <dig> essential in the neural crest, which drives conotruncal septation.
