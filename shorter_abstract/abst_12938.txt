two entomopathogenic fungi, isaria fumosorosea and metarhizium anisopliae, and one bacterium, bacillus thuringiensis, were tested for their ability to cause mortality of formosan subterranean termites , coptotermes formosanus , after liquid exposure, and for their lack of propensity to repel fst.
i. fumosorosea did not repel termites at  <dig> nor  <dig> spores/g in sand, soil or sawdust.
the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis did not cause significant mortality on days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  when termites were exposed to cells of b. thuringiensis in sawdust and when termites were exposed to a mixture of spores and cells in sand, a significantly higher number remained in the control tubes.
repellency was not seen with b. thuringiensis spores alone, nor with the above treatments in the other substrates.
the fungus metarhizium anisopliae at  <dig> spores/ml caused  <dig> % mortality on day  <dig>   <dig> % mortality on day  <dig> and 100% mortality on day  <dig>
on all three days the rate of mortality was significantly higher than that of the control and  <dig> spores/ml treatment with i. fumosorosea.
neither i. fumosorosea nor m. anisopliae caused repellency of fst in sand, soil or sawdust.
the fungus isaria fumosorosea at  <dig> spores/ml caused  <dig> % mortality on day  <dig>  significantly higher than the control and  <dig> spores/ml treatment.
