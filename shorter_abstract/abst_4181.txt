the rgd motif folds into a  <dig> helix that is involved in the formation of a homodimer in the crystal which is mainly stabilized by salt bridges.
analytical ultracentrifugation studies revealed a moderate dissociation constant of  <dig> μm at physiological ionic strength, suggesting that apeg- <dig> dimerisation is only transient in the cell.
the rgd motif is crucial for the interaction of extracellular proteins and plays a role in cell adhesion.
our data suggests that the rgd motif might play a role not only in the adhesion of extracellular proteins but also in intracellular protein-protein interactions.
the structure adopts a greek-key β-sandwich fold and belongs to the i  set of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
good quality crystals that were suitable for x-ray crystallographic studies were obtained following the truncation of the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of apeg- <dig>  a region predicted to be disordered.
the residues lying between the β-sheets form a hydrophobic core.
human aortic preferentially expressed protein- <dig>  is a novel specific smooth muscle differentiation marker thought to play a role in the growth and differentiation of arterial smooth muscle cells .
