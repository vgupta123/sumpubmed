by comparing two dcns between the normal and cancer states, we found some great changes in hub genes and topological structure, which suggest that the modules of two different dcns change a lot.
especially, we screened some hub genes of a differential subnetwork between the normal and the cancer states and then do bioinformatics analysis for them.
through constructing and analyzing two differential co-expression networks at different states using the screened degs, we found some hub genes associated with the bladder cancer.
the results of the bioinformatics analysis for those hub genes will support the biological experiments and the further treatment of the bladder cancer.
bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system and it is a heterogeneous disease with both superficial and invasive growth.
and it is indispensable to find key genes or modules causing the bladder cancer.
employing an integrated strategy,  <dig> up-regulated differentially expressed genes  and  <dig> down-regulated degs were selected and main functions of those degs are cellular physiological precess and cellular metabolism .
