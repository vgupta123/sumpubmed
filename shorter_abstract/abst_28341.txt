we have developed tprpred, a profile-based method which uses a p-value-dependent score offset to include divergent repeat units and which exploits the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem.
tprpred detects not only tpr-like repeats, but also the related pentatrico peptide repeats  and sel1-like repeats.
tprpred performs significantly better in detecting divergent repeats in tpr-containing proteins, and finds more individual repeats than the existing methods.
solenoid repeat proteins of the tetratrico peptide repeat  family are involved as scaffolds in a broad range of protein-protein interactions.
we benchmarked the performance of tprpred in detecting tpr-containing proteins and in delineating the individual repeats therein, against currently available resources.
several resources are available for the prediction of tprs, however, they often fail to detect divergent repeat units.
the corresponding profiles were generated through iterative searches, by varying the threshold parameters for inclusion of repeat units into the profiles, and the best profiles were selected based on their performance on proteins of known structure.
