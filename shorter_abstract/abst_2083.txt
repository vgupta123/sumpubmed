mapping out changes of mutual information on the protein structure then allows visualizing how distal communication is achieved.
as a result, our method provides a means to directly map the exchange of biological information on the structure of protein domains, making it clear how binding triggers conformational changes in the protein structure.
as such it provides a structural road, next to the existing attempts at sequence level, to predict long-range interactions within protein structures.
although often associated with large allosteric movements, more subtle changes in protein dynamics can also induce long-range correlations.
here we introduce a method to analyze protein dynamics within the framework of information theory and show that signal transduction within proteins can be considered as a particular instance of communication over a noisy channel.
our analysis reveals that the fyn sh <dig> domain forms a noisy communication channel that couples residues located in the phosphopeptide and specificity binding sites and a number of residues at the other side of the domain near the linkers that connect the sh <dig> domain to the sh <dig> and kinase domains.
we find that for this particular domain, communication is affected by a series of contiguous residues that connect distal sites by crossing the core of the sh <dig> domain.
in particular, we analyze the conformational correlations between protein residues and apply the concept of mutual information to quantify information exchange.
however, an appropriate formalism that directly relates protein structural dynamics to information exchange between functional sites is still lacking.
