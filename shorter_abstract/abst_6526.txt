we identify motifs that are frequent at systematic error sites, and describe a classifier that distinguishes heterozygous sites from systematic error.
our classifier is designed to accommodate data from experiments in which the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites are not necessarily  <dig>  , and can be used with single-end datasets.
systematic errors can easily be mistaken for heterozygous sites in individuals, or for snps in population analyses.
systematic errors are particularly problematic in low coverage experiments, or in estimates of allele-specific expression from rna-seq data.
a feature common to all dna sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads.
we characterize and describe systematic errors using overlapping paired reads from high-coverage data.
we conclude that correction of systematic errors is important to consider in the design and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing experiments.
