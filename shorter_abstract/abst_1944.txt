the aim of this study was to identify mirnas differentially expressed between mild and moderately emphysematous lung, as well as their functional target mrnas.
copd patients had mean  age  <dig>  years, fev <dig>  <dig> % predicted and gas transfer   <dig> % predicted.
differences in mirna expression are associated with emphysema severity in copd patients.
in vitro upregulation of mir-34c in respiratory cells led to down-regulation of predicted target mrnas, including serpine <dig>  map4k <dig>  znf <dig>  aldoa and hnf4a.
mir-34c modulates expression of its putative target gene, serpine <dig>  in vitro in respiratory cell lines and ex vivo in emphysematous lung tissue.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression.
five mirnas  were significantly down-regulated in lung from patients with moderate compared to mild emphysema as defined by gas transfer .
