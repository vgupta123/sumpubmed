in addition, capillary density increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> /mm <dig> in the hgf gene group to  <dig>  ±  <dig> /mm <dig> in hgf+mb/us group .
compared with the egfp gene group, an average  <dig> -fold enhancement in gene expression was achieved in the egfp+mb/us group .
compared with the hgf gene group, an average  <dig> -fold enhancement in gene expression was achieved in the hgf+mb/us group .
to enhance myocardial angiogenic gene expression, a novel gene delivery strategy was tested.
direct intramyocardial injection of an angiogenic gene with microbubbles and insonation were applied in a dog animal model.
thus, direct intramyocardial injection of an angiogenic gene in conjunction with microbubbles plus insonation synergistically enhances angiogenesis.
