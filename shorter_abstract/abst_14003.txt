di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of knautia, while hexaploids were sampled in the balkan and iberian peninsulas and the alps.
comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size  variation are, however, still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera.
genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in knautia, even if monoploid genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes.
twenty-four species studied are diploid,  <dig> tetraploid and two hexaploid, whereas ten species possess two, and two species possess three ploidy levels.

here, we explore ploidy and gs variation in knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling.
