pax <dig> is a transcription factor that is crucial to the development of epithelial organs.
the heart or the brain whilst the role of micrornas in the development and maintenance of complex epithelial organs is less well understood.
furthermore most analyses regarding microrna function in epithelial organs employed conditional knockout mouse models of the rnase iii dicer to abrogate microrna biogenesis.
here we analyze the contribution of microrna-dependent transcriptional control in pax8-expressing epithelial cells.
pax8cre-mediated conditional loss of digeorge syndrome critical region  <dig> , an essential component of the nuclear machinery that is required for microrna biogenesis, resulted in severe hypothyroidism, massively reduced body weight and ultimately led to renal failure and death of the animals.
dgcr8 fl/fl; pax8cre+ knockout mice died prematurely, developed massive hypothyroidism and end stage renal disease due to a loss of mirnas in pax <dig> expressing tissue.
