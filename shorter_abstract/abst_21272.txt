our findings imply modulation of oxygen binding via charge-charge interaction at the protein surface, which stabilize quaternary interactions among functional units to reduce detrimental effects of high ph on venous oxygen release.
the prevalence of methionine at this site in polar octopods, implies regulation of oxygen affinity via increased sensitivity to allosteric metal binding.
their oxygen transporter haemocyanin plays a major role in cold tolerance and accordingly has undergone functional modifications to sustain oxygen release at sub-zero temperatures.
high sequence conservation of sites directly involved in oxygen binding indicates that functional modifications of octopod haemocyanin rather occur via more subtle mechanisms, as observed in this study.
at this site, methionine was the dominant amino acid in polar octopods and leucine was dominant in tropical octopods.
analysis of  <dig> partial sequences of the haemocyanin functional units  f and g of  <dig> octopod species of polar, temperate, subtropical and tropical origin revealed natural selection was acting primarily on charge properties of surface residues.
we thus aimed to assess whether natural selection affected molecular and structural properties of haemocyanin that explains temperature adaptation in octopods.
this study has provided the first insight into molecular and structural mechanisms that have enabled octopods to sustain oxygen supply from polar to tropical conditions.
polar octopods contained haemocyanins with higher net surface charge due to decreased glutamic acid content and higher numbers of basic amino acids.
sites directly involved in oxygen binding or quaternary interactions were highly conserved within the analysed sequence.
however, it remains unknown how molecular properties evolved to explain the observed functional adaptations.
within the analysed partial sequences, positive selection was present at site  <dig>  positioned between the active copper binding centre and the fu g surface.
