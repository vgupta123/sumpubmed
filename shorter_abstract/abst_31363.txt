tav4sb operations allow you to perform numerical simulations or model checking of, respectively, deterministic or stochastic semantics of biological models.
the taverna services for systems biology  project provides a set of new web service operations, which extend the functionality of the taverna workbench in a domain of systems biology.
the tav4sb web service provides a set of integrated tools in the domain for which web-based applications are still not as widely available as for other areas of computational biology.
to visualize the results of model analysis a flexible plotting operation is provided as well.
moreover, we extend the dedicated hardware base for computationally expensive task of simulating cellular models.
progress in the modeling of biological systems strongly relies on the availability of specialized computer-aided tools.
as an illustration of possibilities offered by our project we apply the multi-parameter sensitivity analysis.
tav4sb operations are executed in a simple grid environment, integrating heterogeneous software such as mathematica, prism and sbml ode solver.
to that end, the taverna workbench eases integration of software tools for life science research and provides a common workflow-based framework for computational experiments in biology.
