in this marker paper, the swine genome sequencing consortium  sets outs its plans for analysis of the pig genome sequence, for the application and publication of the results.
the current annotated genome assembly  was released with ensembl  <dig> in september  <dig>  a revised assembly  is under construction and will incorporate whole genome shotgun sequence  data providing > 30Ã— genome coverage.
in accordance with the bermuda and fort lauderdale agreements and the more recent toronto statement the data have been released into public sequence repositories  in a timely manner and in advance of publication.
the sequencing strategy followed a hybrid approach combining hierarchical shotgun sequencing of bac clones and whole genome shotgun sequencing.
assemblies of the bac clone derived genome sequence have been annotated using the pre-ensembl and ensembl automated pipelines and made accessible through the pre-ensembl/ensembl browsers.
the pig genome is being sequenced and characterised under the auspices of the swine genome sequencing consortium.
