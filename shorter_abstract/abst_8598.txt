the use in the diet of fruits from a new line or variety introduces much greater changes than the consumption of gm fruits in comparison to its genetic background.
parthenocarpic tomato lines transgenic for the defh9-ri-iaam gene have been cultivated under open field conditions to address some aspects of the equivalence of genetically modified  fruit in comparison to controls .
under open field cultivation conditions, two tomato lines  transgenic for the defh9-ri-iaam gene produced parthenocarpic fruits.
thus parthenocarpy caused by defh9-ri-iaam gene represents also a tool for mitigating gm seeds dispersal in the environment.
gm fruit quality, with the exception of a higher Î²-carotene level, did not show any difference, neither technological  nor chemical , when compared to that of fruits from control line.
parthenocarpic fruits, produced under open field conditions, contained 10-fold less seeds than control fruits.
total yield per plant did not differ between gm and parental line uc  <dig>  fruit number was increased in gm lines, and gm fruit weight was decreased.
