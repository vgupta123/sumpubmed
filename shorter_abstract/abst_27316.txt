this work uses a phylogenetic approach to investigate the premise that the aridification of australia, and subsequent expansion and modification of arid-adapted host flora, has implications for the diversification of insects that specialise on them.
chronological analyses indicated that the approximate age of origin of gall-inducing thrips on acacia might be as recent as  <dig> million years ago during the miocene, as truly arid landscapes first developed in australia.
lineage by time diversification plots indicate gall-thrips that specialise on plurinerves hosts differentially experienced an explosive period of speciation contemporaneous with climatic cycling during the quaternary period.
likelihood ratio tests indicated the possibility of hard molecular polytomies within two co-radiating gall-inducing species complexes specialising on the same set of host species.
significant tree asymmetry is indicated at a branch adjacent to an inferred transition to a plurinerves ancestral host species.
