the intensity fluctuations and noise observed can be characterized by a natural exponential family with quadratic variance function  class of distributions.
bottom-up approaches to preprocessing that emphasize modeling seldi data acquisition are promising avenues of research to find the needed improvements in reproducibility.
with further development, this approach may lead to improved peak prediction reproducibility and nearly automated, high throughput preprocessing of seldi data.
these additional measurements allow our preprocessing program to adapt to changing noise characteristics arising from intralaboratory and across-laboratory factors.
surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  is a proteomics tool for biomarker discovery and other high throughput applications.
