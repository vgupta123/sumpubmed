polar effects were absent in the in-frame deletion mutants c. defragrans Δldi and c. defragrans Δgeoa.
in-frame deletion mutants of genes in the anaerobic β-myrcene degradation revealed novel insights in the in vivo function.
the physiological characterization of the strains demonstrated a requirement of the linalool dehydratase-isomerase for growth on acyclic monoterpenes, but not on cyclic monoterpenes.
growth on cyclic monoterpenes independent of the initial enzyme ldi suggests the presence of a second enzyme system activating unsaturated hydrocarbons.
the initial enzyme linalool dehydratase-isomerase ldi/ldi catalyzes the hydration of β-myrcene to --linalool and its isomerization to geraniol.
a genetic system was for the first time applied for the betaproteobacterium to prove in vivo the relevance of the linalool dehydratase-isomerase and the geraniol dehydrogenase.
the deletion mutants were in trans complemented with the broad-host range expression vector pbbr1mcs-4ldi and pbbr1mcs-2geoa, restoring in both cases the wild type phenotype.
a high-affinity geraniol dehydrogenase geoa/gedh and a geranial dehydrogenase geob/gadh contribute to the formation of geranic acid.
enzyme assays revealed the presence of a second geraniol dehydrogenase.
the deletion of a high-affinity geraniol dehydrogenase hampered, but did not preclude growth on monoterpenes.
a second geraniol dehydrogenase activity was present that contributes to the β-myrcene degradation pathway.
the deletion of geoa resulted in a phenotype with hampered growth rate on monoterpenes as sole carbon and energy source as well as reduced biomass yields.
the anaerobic β-myrcene degradation pathway in castellaniella defragrans strain 65phen differs from well known aerobic, monooxygenase-containing pathways.
