all isolates were confirmed as y. ruckeri by the api 20e system.
isolates from the field study clustered together as pfge type c. according to the results of api 20e, repetitive sequence-based pcrs and pfge, these isolates could be subdivided into  <dig> different groups.
the isolates originated mainly from rainbow trout and were characterised by biochemical profiling, 16s rdna sequencing, repetitive sequence-based pcrs, including 5-pcr, box-pcr, eric-pcr and rep-pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis .
five isolates were additionally confirmed as y. ruckeri by y. ruckeri-specific pcr and 16s rdna sequencing.
enteric redmouth disease , caused by yersinia ruckeri, is one of the most important infectious diseases in rainbow trout  aquaculture in europe.
the aim of this study was to analyse the variation of biochemical and molecular characteristics of y. ruckeri isolates collected in north west germany as a basis for strain differentiation.
the detailed molecular and phenotypic characterisation scheme developed in this study could be used to help trace the dissemination of y. ruckeri isolates, and thus may represent part of improved disease monitoring plans in the future.
