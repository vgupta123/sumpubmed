these methods can be applied to incorporate evolutionary models of insertions and deletions into any hidden markov model or stochastic context-free grammar, in a pair or profile form, for sequence modeling.
ideally we would like these models to be conditional on evolutionary divergence time.
probabilistic models of substitution events are well established, but there has not been a completely satisfactory theoretical framework for modeling insertion and deletion events.
probabilistic models for sequence comparison  often assume a fixed degree of divergence.
given a probabilistic model, we can make all of its emission probabilities  and all its transition probabilities conditional on a chosen divergence time.
to do this, we only need to know the parameters of the model at one particular divergence time instance, as well as the parameters of the model at the two extremes of zero and infinite divergence.
i have developed a method for extending standard markov substitution models to include gap characters, and another method for the evolution of state transition probabilities in a probabilistic model.
