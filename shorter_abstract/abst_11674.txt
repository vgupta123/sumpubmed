transposable elements form a significant proportion of eukaryotic genomes.
conservation of quadruplexes at specific positions of transposable elements implies their importance in their life cycle.
the increasing quadruplex presence in evolutionarily young line- <dig> and sva families makes these elements important contributors toward present genome-wide quadruplex distribution.
here, we searched for pqss in human retrotransposons and found that pqss are specifically localized in the 3â€™-utr of line- <dig> elements, in ltrs of herv elements and are strongly accumulated in specific regions of sva elements.
reported that plant long terminal repeat  retrotransposons often contain potential quadruplex sequences  in their ltrs and experimentally confirmed their ability to adopt four-stranded dna conformations.
evolutionarily young sva elements contained more pqss than older elements and their propensity to form quadruplex dna was higher.
