secondly, mutagenesis, competitive dissociation analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to compare and study the biotin-binding properties as well as the thermal stability of avrs and avidin.
the i109k mutation increased the biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig>  whereas the k109i mutation decreased the biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig>  furthermore, the thermal stability of avr <dig> increased in comparison to the wild-type protein and the k109i mutation led to a decrease in the thermal stability of avr <dig>
in the present study, we have employed multiple biochemical methods to better understand the structure-function relationship of avr proteins focusing on avr <dig>  firstly, we have solved the high-resolution crystal structure of avr <dig> in complex with a bound ligand, d-biotin.
of these gene products, avidin is the best characterized and is known for its extremely high affinity for d-biotin, a property that is utilized in numerous modern life science applications.
altogether, this study broadens our understanding of the structural features determining the ligand-binding affinities and stability as well as the molecular evolution within the protein family.
this novel information can be applied to further develop and improve the tools already widely used in avidin-biotin technology.
