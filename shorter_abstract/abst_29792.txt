in vascular plants, rnai molecules trafficking occur between cells and systemically throughout the plant.
there is also a great interest in applying rnai to pathogenic fungi.
rnai signals can spread systemically throughout a plant, even across graft junctions from transgenic to non-transgenic stocks.
from a biotechnological perspective, silencing of fungal genes by generating sirnas in the host provides a novel strategy for the development of broad fungi-resistance strategies in plants and other organisms.
specific inhibition of gene expression by rnai has been shown to be suitable for a multitude of phytopathogenic filamentous fungi.
the results provide a powerful tool for further studies on molecular plant-microbe and symbiotic interactions.
