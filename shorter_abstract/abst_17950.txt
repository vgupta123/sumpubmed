all  <dig> primer pairs are provided as additional files and the three ril populations will be made available to public upon request for quantitative trait loci  analysis and linkage map improvement.
the construction of genetic linkage maps for cultivated peanut  has and continues to be an important research goal to facilitate quantitative trait locus  analysis and gene tagging for use in a marker-assisted selection in breeding.
the objective of this study was to construct a genetic linkage map of cultivated peanut using simple sequence repeat  markers derived primarily from peanut genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags , and by "data mining" sequences released in genbank.
this composite genetic linkage map is among the first "true" tetraploid peanut maps produced.
the more detailed linkage map with sufficient markers is necessary to be feasible for qtl identification and marker-assisted selection.
segregation distortion in the  <dig> populations was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the markers, respectively.
by comparison, there were potential synteny, collinear order of some markers and conservation of collinear linkage groups among the maps and with the aa genome but not fully conservative.
individual linkage maps were constructed from each of the three populations and a composite map based on  <dig> common loci were created using joinmap.
the total composite map length is  <dig>  cm, with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm.
the composite linkage maps consist of  <dig> composite linkage groups  with  <dig> ssr markers , representing the  <dig> chromosomes of a. hypogaea.
a composite linkage map was constructed from three individual mapping populations with  <dig> ssr markers in  <dig> composite linkage groups.
of the  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> primer pairs  were polymorphic in these populations, respectively, and used in genotyping these ril populations.
this map also consists of  <dig> ssrs that have been used in the published aa genome maps, and could be used in comparative mapping studies.
