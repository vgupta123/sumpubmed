we demonstrated that variation in methylated anthocyanin accumulation is susceptible to involve both transcriptional regulation and structural variation.
in a syrah Ã— grenache progeny, two qtls were detected for variation in level of anthocyanin methylation.
we report here the identification of novel aomt variants likely to cause methylated anthocyanin variation.
these mutations, probably leading to a structural change of the aomt <dig> protein significantly affected the enzyme specific catalytic efficiency for the 3'-o-methylation of delphinidin 3-glucoside.
the integration of qtl mapping and molecular approaches enabled a better understanding of how variation in gene expression and catalytic efficiency of the resulting enzyme may influence the grape anthocyanin profile.
anthocyanin methylation, as a complex trait, is controlled by multiple molecular factors likely to involve multiple regulatory steps.
