we have used the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial operons  to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells using three different strategies.
finally, an adenoviral library of cta mutants was screened to identify a reverse cumate activator , which activates transcription in the presence rather than the absence of cumate.
in the repressor configuration, regulation is mediated by the binding of the repressor  to the operator site , placed downstream of a strong constitutive promoter.
they all have specific characteristics making them more suitable for certain applications than for others.
in the transactivator configuration, a chimaeric transactivator  protein, formed by the fusion of cymr with the activation domain of vp <dig>  is able to activate transcription when bound to multiple copies of cuo, placed upstream of the cmv minimal promoter.
a number of expression systems have been developed where transgene expression can be regulated.
