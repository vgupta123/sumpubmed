the deletion of om within the ra <dig> conjugative module had no effect on transfer if the mobc-nic operon was expressed from the heterologous promoter.
it autoregulates the expression of mobc-nic operon while its presence significantly stimulates transfer efficiency.
mobc forms dimers in solution and autoregulates the expression of mobcp by binding to an imperfect palindromic sequence  located between putative - <dig> and - <dig> motifs of the promoter.
the incu conjugative transfer module represents highly efficient promiscuous system widespread among conjugative plasmids of different incompatibility groups.
conserved lxxugxnlnqiaxxln motif clusters mobc with the clade of conjugative transfer auxilliary proteins of mobp relaxases.
the mobc is an auxiliary transfer protein of dual function.
here we analyzed the putative transfer auxiliary protein mobc of the conjugative plasmid ra <dig> from the incu incompatibility group.
medium-copy number test plasmid containing the orit-mobcp region is mobilized with a high frequency by the ra <dig> conjugative system.
