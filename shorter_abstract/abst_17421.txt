one third of all genes with altered expression under iron limitation showed a response that was independent of oxygen availability.
some r. sphaeroides genes respond to iron limitation irrespective of oxygen availability.
however, the regulation of most of the iron-responsive genes was biased by oxygen availability.
high intracellular levels of unbound iron can contribute to the production of reactive oxygen species  via the fenton reaction, while depletion of iron limits the availability of iron-containing proteins, some of which have important functions in defence against oxidative stress.
oxyr thus provides a regulatory link between the responses to oxidative stress and to iron limitation in r. sphaeroides.
thus, organisms have to coordinate and balance their responses to oxidative stress and iron availability.

the other iron-regulated genes showed different responses in oxic or anoxic conditions and were grouped into six clusters based on the different expression profiles.
for two of these clusters, induction in response to iron limitation under oxic conditions was dependent on the oxyr regulatory protein.
most strikingly, the oxyr-dependent activation of a subset of genes upon iron limitation under oxic conditions, including many genes with a role in iron metabolism, revealed that elevated ros levels were an important trigger for this response.
vice versa increased ros levels lead to the damage of proteins with iron sulphur centres.
