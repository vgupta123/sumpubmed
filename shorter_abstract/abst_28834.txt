furthermore, our current observations entail future implications for developing therapies for pd, and for interfering with the impaired molecular mechanisms that underlie pd and other neurodegenerative and neurological disorders, as well as dbs-treatable conditions in general.
dbs stimulation induced  <dig> as events in  <dig> genes as compared to the pre-dbs state including  <dig> nmd inductions.
here, we report exon arrays analysis of leukocyte mrna as events prior to and following deep brain stimulation  neurosurgery, which efficiently improves the motor symptoms of parkinson’s disease , the leading movement disorder, and is increasingly applied to treat other diseases.
our in-house exon array dataset of leukocyte transcripts was derived from advanced pd patients’ pre- and post-dbs stimulation and matched healthy control volunteers.
a short, one hour electrical stimulus cessation caused  <dig> as changes in  <dig> genes compared to on-stimulus state,  <dig> of these were assessed for nmd.
we also analyzed publicly available exon array dataset of whole blood cells from mixed early and advanced pd patients.
functional analysis highlighted disease-induced dna damage and inflammatory control and its reversal under on and off stimulus as well as alternative splicing in all the tested states.
in comparison, pd patients from our advanced cohort differed from healthy controls by  <dig> as events in  <dig> transcripts, assessed as inducing  <dig> protein-level nmd events.
nmd plays an important regulatory role in brain neurons, but the in vivo dynamics of as and nmd changes in neurological diseases and under treatment were scarcely explored.
