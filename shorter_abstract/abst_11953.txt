this study describes the most extensive proteomic analysis of muscle ageing in humans, and identified  <dig> new potential biomarkers.
in addition to total muscle extracts, low-ionic strength extracts were investigated to remove high abundance myofibrillar proteins and improve the detection of low abundance proteins.
in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle chronological ageing in human, we have undertaken a top-down differential proteomic approach to identify novel biomarkers after the fifth decade of age.
notably, many of the differentially expressed proteins were central for proteostasis, including heat shock proteins and proteins involved in proteolysis .
two-dimensional gel electrophoreses with overlapping ipgs were used to improve the separation of muscle proteins.
our results suggested important modifications in cytosolic, mitochondrial and lipid energy metabolism, which may relate to dysfunctions in old muscle force generation.
a fraction of the differentially expressed proteins were linked to the sarcomere and cytoskeleton , which may account for alterations in contractile properties.
none of them were previously recognized as differentially expressed in old muscles, and each may represent a novel starting point to elucidate the mechanisms of muscle chronological ageing in humans.
overall,  <dig> protein spots were matched between all individuals,  <dig> were differentially expressed and identified by mass spectrometry, and they corresponded to  <dig> different proteins.
in line with muscle contraction, we also identified proteins related to calcium signal transduction .
muscle ageing was further characterized by the differential regulation of several proteins implicated in cytoprotection , ion homeostasis  and detoxification .
