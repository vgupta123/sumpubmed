here we have examined possible explanations for why the lsp1α gene is not dosage compensated.
lsp1α is not modified by the msl complex but is in a region of the x chromosome that is regulated by the msl complex.
phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of the genomes of  <dig> drosophila species shows that lsp1α is only present within the melanogaster subgroup of species.
lsp1α appears to have recently evolved within the melanogaster subgroup of drosophila species.
the most likely explanation for why lsp1α is not dosage compensated is that the gene has not evolved a mechanism to independently recruit the msl complex, possibly because of its recent evolutionary origin, and because there appears to be a low level of bound msl complex in a nearby gene that is active in the same tissue.
an x-linked reporter gene bracketed by lsp1α flanking regions was dosage compensated.
the high activity or tissue-specificity of the lsp1α promoter does not prevent regulation by the msl complex.
x-linked lsp1α promoter-lacz reporter transgenes are enriched for h4k16ac in third instar larval fat body.
unlike control x-linked genes, lsp1α was not enriched for h4k16ac in the third instar larval fat body, the tissue in which the gene is actively expressed.
this gene shows a modest enrichment for h4k16ac but only at the part of the gene most distant from lsp1α.
in drosophila melanogaster dosage compensation of most x-linked genes is mediated by the male-specific lethal  complex, which includes mof.
