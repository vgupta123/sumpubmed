the genome-wide snps and the genetic linkage map developed in this study permitted qtl identification for pea seed mineral nutrients that will serve as important resources to enable marker-assisted selection  for nutritional quality traits in pea breeding programs.
qtl analysis of the ril population across two locations revealed at least one qtl for each of the mineral nutrient traits.
while rich in a range of nutritional components, such as protein, mineral nutrients, carbohydrates and several vitamins, pea , one of the oldest domesticated crops in the world, remains behind many other crops in the availability of genomic and genetic resources.

to further improve mineral nutrient levels in pea seeds requires the development of genome-wide tools.
the objectives of this research were to develop these tools by: identifying genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  using genotyping by sequencing ; constructing a high-density linkage map and comparative maps with other legumes, and identifying quantitative trait loci  for levels of boron, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorous, sulfur, and zinc in the seed, as well as for seed weight.
in total,  <dig> seed mineral concentration qtls,  <dig> seed mineral content qtls, and  <dig> seed weight qtls were discovered.
comparative mapping with other legumes demonstrated that the highest level of synteny was observed between pea and the genome of medicago truncatula.
mapping  <dig> markers including  <dig> previously published markers and  <dig> snps developed from the present study generated a linkage map of size  <dig>  cm.
the qtls explained from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
