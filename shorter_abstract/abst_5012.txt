functional categorization of the annotated unigenes sequences showed that  <dig>  genes were assigned to cellular component category,  <dig>  to biological process, and  <dig>  in molecular function.
similarly, blastx similarity results showed that only  <dig>   out of  <dig>  total unigenes correspond to known proteins in the uniprot database .
modern genomic tools such as molecular markers and candidate genes associated with resistance to these stresses offer the possibility of facilitating pigeonpea breeding for improving biotic stress resistance.
validation of identified biotic stress responsive genes should provide candidate genes for allele mining as well as candidate markers for molecular breeding.
the pigeonpea est dataset generated here provides a transcriptomic resource for gene discovery and development of functional markers associated with biotic stress resistance.
blastn analysis of  <dig>  unigenes showed a significant identity with ests of different legumes , rice , arabidopsis  and poplar .
availability of limited genomic resources, however, is a serious bottleneck to undertake molecular breeding in pigeonpea to develop superior genotypes with enhanced resistance to above mentioned biotic stresses.
with an objective of enhancing genomic resources in pigeonpea, this study reports generation and analysis of comprehensive resource of fw- and smd- responsive expressed sequence tags .
pigeonpea  millsp) is one of the major grain legume crops of the tropics and subtropics, but biotic stresses  are serious challenges for sustainable crop production.
sequence analyses of this dataset have showed conservation of a considerable number of pigeonpea transcripts across legume and model plant species analysed as well as some putative pigeonpea specific genes.
recognition sites for restriction enzymes were identified for  <dig> snps in  <dig> contigs that indicates possibility of assaying snps in  <dig> genes using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences  assay.
further,  <dig> genes were identified differentially expressed between fw- responsive genotypes and  <dig> between smd- responsive genotypes.
generated ests were compiled together with  <dig> ests available in public domain, at the time of analysis, and a set of  <dig>  unigenes were defined that were used for identification of molecular markers in pigeonpea.
as expected, pigeonpea ests are more closely related to soybean  and cowpea ests  than other plant ests.
