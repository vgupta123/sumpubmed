we demonstrate that lineage-specific models significantly outperform universal ones.
we also test the generalization capability of predblp based on independent testing datasets as well as newly deposited blps in uniprot.
experiment on benchmark datasets proves the robustness of predblp.
bioluminescent proteins  widely exist in many living organisms.

to remove potential irrelevant or redundant features, we also introduce fisher markov selector together with sequential backward selection strategy to select the optimal feature subsets.
these features include amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, sequence motifs and physicochemical properties.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
additionally, we design a lineage-specific scheme, which is proved to be more effective than traditional universal approaches.
a web server named predblp, which implements the proposed method, is free available for academic use.
we further prove that the combination of four types of features outperforms any other combinations or individual features.
predblp is proved to be able to exceed many state-of-art methods.
