we also observed a large induction of genes encoded within the cryptic plasmid, pjd <dig>  validation of rna-seq data using translational-lacz fusions or rt-pcr demonstrated the rna-seq results to be very reproducible.
we also confirmed expression and regulation of a small rna, likely a functional equivalent of fnrs in the enterobacteriaceae family.
here we determined that the anaerobic stimulon in gonococci was larger than previous studies would suggest.
we determined that  <dig> chromosomal genes were differentially expressed  in response to anaerobic conditions.
gonococci will be subject to many forms of environmental stress, including oxygen-limitation, during the course of infection.
many new targets for future research have been uncovered, and the results derived from this study may have helped to elucidate factors or mechanisms of virulence that may have otherwise been overlooked.
maintenance of an anaerobic denitrification system in the obligate human pathogen, neisseria gonorrhoeae, suggests that an anaerobic lifestyle may be important during the course of infection.
using the information derived from this sequencing, we discuss the implications of the robust transcriptional response to anaerobic growth.
surprisingly, many genes of prophage origin were induced anaerobically, as well as several transcriptional regulators previously unknown to be involved in anaerobic growth.
furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that reduction of host-produced nitric oxide has several immunomodulary effects on the host.
