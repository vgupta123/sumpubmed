first, traditional homology methods were employed to predict novel transporters based on sequence similarity to known classified proteins in the transporter classification database .
membrane transporters play crucial roles in living cells.
second, machine learning methods were used to integrate a variety of features to refine the initial predictions.
current computational methods for transporter characterization still require extensive curation efforts, especially for eukaryotic organisms.
we developed a novel genome-scale transporter prediction and characterization system called transporttp that combined homology-based and machine learning methods in a two-phase classification approach.
in an independent test using the arabidopsis proteome for training and four recently sequenced plant proteomes for testing, it achieved a recall of  <dig> % and a precision of  <dig> %, according to our manual curation.
