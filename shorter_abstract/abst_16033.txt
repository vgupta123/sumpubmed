the luciferase activity assay indicated that the hccr- <dig> 5'-flanking region at positions - <dig> to + <dig> plays an important role in hccr- <dig> promoter activity.
computational analysis of this region identified two consensus sequences for the t-cell factor  located at - <dig> to - <dig>  and - <dig> to - <dig> .
these findings suggest that the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> promoter is a major element regulating hccr- <dig> expression and abnormal stimulation of this site may induce various human cancers.
finally, we also observed that the transcription factor, tcf, and its cofactor, Î²-catenin, bound to the tcf <dig> site.
mutation at the tcf <dig> site led to a dramatic decrease in promoter activity.
however, it is unknown how hccr- <dig> contributes to the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of human tumorigenesis.
