in over 70% of the chimeric junctions, the 3' termini had initiated priming at complimentary sequences of 2â€“ <dig> nucleotides  in the new templates.
formation of chimeras is an important limitation to the mda method, particularly for whole genome sequencing.
the highly branched dna synthesized in mda can assume many alternative secondary structures.
evidence supports a model in which branch migration can displace 3'-ends freeing them to prime on the new templates.
here, we characterize the major types of chimeras formed by carrying out an mda whole genome amplification from a single e. coli cell and sequencing by the  <dig> life sciences method.
identification of the mechanism for chimera formation provides new insight into the mda reaction and suggests methods to reduce chimeras.
intramolecular rearrangements were favored, with displaced 3'-ends reannealing to single stranded 5'-strands contained within the same branched dna molecule.
the  <dig> sequencing approach used here will provide a rapid method to assess the utility of reaction modifications.
while this has enabled genomic sequencing from one or a few cells of unculturable microorganisms, the process is complicated by the tendency of mda to generate chimeric dna rearrangements in the amplified dna.
