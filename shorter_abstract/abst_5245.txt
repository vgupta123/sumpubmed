the mechanism of action of three of the  <dig> genes were then characterised further by following the transcriptional events associated with apoptosis induction using expression profiling microarrays.
here we describe the construction of a large-scale microarray using expression plasmids containing human genes, its use in screening for genes that induce apoptosis when over-expressed and the characterisation of a number of these genes by following the transcriptional response of cell cultures during their induction of apoptosis.
this data demonstrates a clear pro-apoptotic transcriptional response in cells undergoing apoptosis and also suggests the use of common apoptotic pathways regardless of the nature of the over-expressed protein triggering cell death.
this study reports the design and use of the first truly large-scale cell-based microarrays for over-expression studies.
transcriptome analysis on three of the  <dig> genes demonstrated their use of similar pathways to invoke apoptosis.
high-density cell-based arrays were successfully fabricated using  <dig>  un-tagged open reading frames  taken from the mammalian gene collection  in mammalian expression vectors.
