the sugarcane transcriptome was sequenced using pacbio isoform sequencing  of a pooled rna sample derived from leaf, internode and root tissues, of different developmental stages, from  <dig> varieties, to explore the potential for capturing full-length transcript isoforms.
only 62% of pacbio transcript isoforms matched 67% of de novo contigs, while the non-matched proportions were attributed to the inclusion of leaf/root tissues and the normalization in pacbio, and the representation of more gene content and rna classes in the de novo assembly, respectively.

the transcriptome dataset should contribute to improved sugarcane gene models and sugarcane protein predictions; and will serve as a reference database for analysis of transcript expression in sugarcane.
comparison with de novo contigs from illumina rna-sequencing  of the internode samples from the same experiment and public databases showed that the iso-seq method recovered more full-length transcript isoforms, had a higher n <dig> and average length of largest  <dig>  proteins; whereas a greater representation of the gene content and rna diversity was captured in rna-seq.
about 69% of pacbio transcript isoforms and 41% of de novo contigs aligned with the sorghum genome, indicating the high conservation of orthologs in the genic regions of the two genomes.
most of the sugarcane transcriptomic studies have been based on saccharum officinarum gene indices , expressed sequence tags  and de novo assembled transcript contigs from short-reads; hence knowledge of the sugarcane transcriptome is limited in relation to transcript length and number of transcript isoforms.
the majority of this dataset  matched the plant protein database, while just over 2% was novel transcripts, and over 2% was putative long non-coding rnas.
a total of  <dig>  unique transcript isoforms were obtained, representing about 71% of the total number of predicted sugarcane genes.
about 56% and 23% of total sequences were annotated against the gene ontology and kegg pathway databases, respectively.
