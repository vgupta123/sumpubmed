administration of nandrolone for  <dig> days beginning either concomitantly with sciatic nerve transection  or  <dig> days later  attenuated denervation atrophy at  <dig> but not  <dig> days.
we reasoned that this model could be used to identify genes that are regulated by nandrolone and slow denervation atrophy, as well as genes that might explain the time-dependence of nandrolone effects on such atrophy.
at  <dig> days, correlations between mrna levels and the size of denervated muscle were negative for rcan <dig>  and positive for apod.
nandrolone selectively altered expression of  <dig> genes at  <dig> days and  <dig> genes at  <dig> days, with only  <dig> genes being regulated at both time points.
anabolic steroids, such as nandrolone, slow muscle atrophy, but the mechanisms responsible for this effect are largely unknown.
their effects on muscle size and gene expression depend upon time, and the cause of muscle atrophy.
comparison of gene expression at  <dig> and  <dig> days after denervation revealed marked alterations in the expression of  <dig> transcriptional coregulators, including ankrd <dig> and  <dig>  and many transcription factors and kinases.
affymetrix microarrays were used to profile gene expression changes due to nandrolone at  <dig> and  <dig> days and to identify major gene expression changes in denervated muscle between  <dig> and  <dig> days.
marked changes in the expression of genes regulating transcription and intracellular signaling may contribute to the time-dependent effects of nandrolone on gene expression.
