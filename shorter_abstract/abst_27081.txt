the targeted capture and sequencing of genomic regions has rapidly demonstrated its utility in genetic studies.
using down-sampling of  <dig> deeply sequenced exomes and a set of gold-standard single nucleotide variant  genotype calls for each sample, we developed an empirical model relating the read depth at a polymorphic site to the probability of calling the correct genotype at that site.
we find that measured sensitivity in snv detection is substantially worse than that predicted from the naive expectation of sampling from a binomial.
to fully interpret the polymorphisms identified in a genetic study it is often essential to both detect polymorphisms and to understand where and with what probability real polymorphisms may have been missed.
non-reference alleles in the heterozygote state have a high chance of being missed when commonly applied read coverage thresholds are used despite the widely held assumption that there is good polymorphism detection at these coverage levels.
such alleles are likely to be of functional importance in population based studies of rare diseases, somatic mutations in cancer and explaining the “missing heritability” of quantitative traits.
at a mean on-target read depth of 20x, commonly used for rare disease exome sequencing studies, we predict 5–15% of heterozygous and 1–4% of homozygous snvs in the targeted regions will be missed.
