the present results show that the pattern and velocity of the trafficking of fluorescence protein-tagged bdnf are different between axons and dendrites, and suggest that the anterograde transport in axons may be the dominant stream of bdnf to release sites.
brain-derived neurotrophic factor , which is sorted into a regulated secretory pathway of neurons, is supposed to act retrogradely through dendrites on presynaptic neurons or anterogradely through axons on postsynaptic neurons.
to address this issue, we analyzed movements of green fluorescent protein -tagged bdnf in axons and dendrites of living cortical neurons by time-lapse imaging.
we found that bdnf tagged with gfp or cfp was expressed in a punctated manner in dendrites and axons in about two-thirds of neurons into which plasmid cdnas had been injected, while ngf tagged with gfp or yfp was diffusely expressed even in dendrites in about 70% of the plasmid-injected neurons.
on the other hand, 64% of bdnf-gfp puncta in dendrites did not move at all or fluttered back and forth within a short distance.
in neurons in which bdnf-gfp was expressed as vesicular puncta in axons,  <dig> and 23% of the puncta were moving rapidly in the anterograde and retrograde directions, respectively.
