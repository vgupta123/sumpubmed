the two ebv genomes with estimated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold sequence coverage respectively, designated k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv , are characteristic of type- <dig> ebv.
sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis among k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv and the ebv genomes previously reported to genbank as well as the na <dig> ebv genome assembled from database of the  <dig> genome project showed that these  <dig> ebvs are most closely related to b95- <dig>  an ebv previously isolated from a patient with infectious mononucleosis and wt-ebv.
overall  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> total reads in one lymphocyte line  and  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> reads in the other lymphocyte line  were identified as ebv sequences.
we conducted genomic sequencing to identify epstein barr virus  genomes in  <dig> human peripheral blood b lymphocytes that underwent spontaneous immortalization promoted by mycoplasma infections in culture, using the high-throughput sequencing  illumina miseq platform.
they are less similar to ebvs associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma  from hong kong and china as well as the akata strain of a case of burkittâ€™s lymphoma from japan.
