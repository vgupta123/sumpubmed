the analysis of the mirna-related snps and their effects provided insights into the effects of snps on mirna biogenesis and function.
by comparing low- and high-rate egg production chickens,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified as differentially expressed .
in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> reciprocally expressed mirna-target pairs were identified by rna-seq in pituitary and hypothalamic tissues, respectively and randomly selected candidate mirna and mirna-target pairs were validated by rt-qpcr in jiuyuan black fowl.
as endogenous small non-coding rnas, mirnas regulate a variety of biological processes.
these differentially expressed mirnas and their predicted target genes, especially identified reciprocally expressed mirna-target pairs, advance the study of mirna function and egg production associated mirna identification.
tissue mirna expression studies have discovered numerous functions for mirnas in various tissues of chicken, but the regulation of mirnas in chicken pituitary and hypothalamic development related to high and low egg-laying performance has remained unclear.
six differentially expressed known mirnas, which are expressed in both tissues, were used in rt-qpcr validation and snp detection.
gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway annotation illustrated that a large number of egg laying-related pathways were enriched in the high-rate egg production chickens, including ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis.
among them, seven snps in two mirna precursors  were found that might enhance or reduce the production of the mature mirnas.
in this study, using high-throughput sequencing technology, we sequenced two tissues  in  <dig> high- and  <dig> low-rate egg production luhua chickens at the age of 300Â days.
