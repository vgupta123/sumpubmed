moreover, the test results have shown that the proposed comparison-based approach, by exploiting the interrelation between different images and color channels, has successfully overcome most of the inherent limitations possibly occurring during the sample preparation and image acquisition phase.
variations occur mainly for blurred out-of-focus imagery exhibiting larger degrees of cell overlaps in clusters of erythrocytes.
in particular the results from the proposed approach are generally within one standard deviation of the counts provided by a comparison group of malariologists yielding a correlation of  <dig> .
the assessment was also carried out in terms of precision and recall and combined in the f-measure providing results generally in the range of 92% to 97% for a variety of smears.
in this context the observed trade-off relation between precision and recall guaranteed stable results.
eventually, this can be seen as an opportunity for developing low-cost solutions for mass screening.
in this study reliable parasitemia counts were achieved even for sub-standard smear and image quality.
the outcome was assessed through comparisons with manual evaluations of more than  <dig> sample smears and related to the complexity of cell overlaps.
finally, relating the f-measure with the degree of cell overlaps, showed that up to 50% total cell overlap can be tolerated if the smear image is well-focused and the smear itself adequately stained.
manual evaluation of giemsa-stained thin blood smears under the microscope is onerous, time consuming and subject to human error.
