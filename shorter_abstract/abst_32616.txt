the inducer response was also investigated as a function of the experimental conditions and a number of parameters such as the growth media, plasmid arrangement of the lttr-encoding genes, promoter and gfp reporter gene, and the presence of a his6-tag were shown to affect the inducer response in e.coli dh5Î±.
optimization of the growth conditions and gene arrangement resulted in improved responses to nitro-aromatic inducers.
furthermore, the response upon addition of both salicylate and 4-nitrobenzoate to the growth media was larger than the sum of responses upon addition of each of the compounds, which suggests the presence of a secondary binding site, as previously reported for other lttrs.
these three regulators are all involved in regulation of genes identified in pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds.
the results from this study show that ntdr has the broadest inducer specificity, responding to several nitro-aromatic compounds.
the transcriptional regulators dntr, nagr and ntdr have a high sequence identity and belong to the large family of lysr type transcriptional regulators .
