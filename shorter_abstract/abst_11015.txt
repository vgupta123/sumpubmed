the focus of the current study is two folds: 1) predicting to which peptides a pdz domain will bind and 2) classification of pdz domains, as class i, ii or i-ii, given the primary sequences of the pdz domains.
pdz domains can bind to the c-terminal peptides of different proteins and act as glue, clustering different protein complexes together, targeting specific proteins and routing these proteins in signaling pathways.
binding specificities of pdz domains are very crucial in order to understand the complexity of signaling pathways.
using  <dig> pdz domains and  <dig> peptides, our model reaches high prediction accuracy  for binary interaction prediction which outperforms previously investigated similar methods.
also, we can predict classes of pdz domains with an accuracy of  <dig> %.
we propose three critical amino acid sequence motifs that could have important roles on specificity pattern of pdz domains.
the method can be further used as a virtual screening technique to reduce the search space for putative candidate target proteins and drug-like molecules of pdz domains.
trigram and bigram amino acid frequencies are used as features in machine learning methods.
our model on pdz interaction dataset shows that our approach produces encouraging results.
pdz domain is a well-conserved, structural protein domain found in hundreds of signaling proteins that are otherwise unrelated.
