hence, we aimed at identifying the domains mediating ankle <dig> shuttling and investigating whether cellular localization is affected during dna damage response.
the predominant localization of ankle <dig> in the cytoplasm, however, does not change upon induction of several dna damage response pathways throughout the cell cycle.
we identified the domains mediating nuclear import and export of ankle <dig>  ankle1â€™s cellular localization was not affected following dna damage.
unlike most other lem proteins, ankle <dig> is not an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
sequence analysis predicts the presence of two canonical nuclear import and export signals in ankle <dig>  immunofluorescence microscopy of cells expressing wild-type and various mutated ankle1-fusion proteins revealed a c-terminally located classical monopartite nuclear localization signal and a centrally located crm1-dependent nuclear export signal that mediate nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of ankle <dig>  these sequences are also functional in heterologous proteins.
ankyrin repeats and lem domain containing protein  <dig>  belongs to the lem protein family, whose members share a chromatin-interacting lem motif.
we hypothesized that ankle <dig> may have a similar function and its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling may contribute to the regulation of ankle <dig> activity.
resolvase activity is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner during the cell cycle.
the mammalian genome encodes only one other giy-yig domain protein, termed slx <dig>  slx <dig> has been described as a resolvase that processes holliday junctions during homologous recombination-mediated dna double strand break repair.
