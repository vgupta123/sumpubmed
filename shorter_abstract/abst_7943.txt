by integrating deep neural network and stacked ensembling, from simple sequence composition features, ipminer can automatically learn high-level abstraction features, which had strong discriminant ability for rna-protein detection.
non-coding rnas  play crucial roles in many biological processes, such as post-transcription of gene regulation.
the experimental results indicate that ipminer achieves superior performance on the tested lncrna-protein interaction dataset with an accuracy of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> , specificity of  <dig> , precision of  <dig>  and matthews correlation coefficient of  <dig> , respectively.
ipminer achieved high performance on our constructed lncrna-protein benchmark dataset and other rna-protein datasets.
we further comprehensively investigate ipminer on other rna-protein interaction datasets, which yields better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, and the performance has an increase of over  <dig> % on some tested benchmarked datasets.
in this study, we propose a computational method ipminer  to predict ncrna-protein interactions from sequences, which makes use of deep learning and further improves its performance using stacked ensembling.

finally, stacked ensembling is used to integrate different predictors to further improve the prediction performance.
one of the ipminerâ€™s typical merits is that it is able to mine the hidden sequential interaction patterns from sequence composition features of protein and rna sequences using stacked autoencoder, and then the learned hidden features are fed into random forest models.
in addition, we further apply ipminer for large-scale prediction of ncrna-protein network, that achieves promising prediction performance.
