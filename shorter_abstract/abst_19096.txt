microarray and qpcr analyses were performed to follow transcriptome changes during adipogenesis in the primary culture of adipose stromo-vascular fraction  of atlantic salmon.
notably, expression changes of a panel of genes that belong to different immune pathways were seen throughout adipogenesis.
marked regulation of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and pathways producing nadph and glycerol-3-phosphate  was seen during the terminal differentiation, also characterised by diverse stress responses.
the induction of ap <dig> , which is a master regulator of stress responses, culminated by the end of adipogenesis, concurrent with the maximal observed lipid deposition.
proliferative activity and subsequent cell cycle arrest were reflected in the fluctuations of pro- and anti-mitotic regulators.
stress imposed on adipocytes by ld formation and expansion is prominently reflected in the er compartment and the activated upr response could have an important role at visceral obesity in fish.
in addition, increased lipid accumulation may impose considerable stress on adipocytes leading to adipocyte activation and production and secretion of inflammatory mediators, as observed in mammals.
activation of the glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant systems and changes in the iron metabolism suggested the need for protection against oxidative stress.
our data point to an intimate relationship between metabolic regulation and immune responses in white adipocytes of a cold-blooded vertebrate.
