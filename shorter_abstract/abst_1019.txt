gene ontology  provides rich information and a convenient way to study gene functional similarity, which has been successfully used in various applications.
we propose a novel integrative measure called intego <dig> to automatically select appropriate seed measures and then to integrate them using a metaheuristic search method.
the experiment results show that intego <dig> significantly improves the performance of gene similarity in human, arabidopsis and yeast on both molecular function and biological process go categories.
