analysis of single-cell suspensions suggested that the frequency of v-ecs among the total microvascular ec pool varies considerably between different tissues.
accordingly, intravital microscopy showed that adhesive leukocyte-endothelial interactions were restricted to darc+ venules.
immunostaining of endothelial darc allows the identification and isolation of intact v-ecs from multiple murine tissues.

using this reagent, we characterized darc expression and distribution in the microvasculature of murine tissues.
intravascular leukocyte recruitment in most vertebrate tissues is restricted to postcapillary and collecting venules, whereas capillaries and arterioles usually support little or no leukocyte adhesion.

this strategy may be useful to dissect the mechanisms underlying segmental microvascular specialization in healthy and diseased tissues and to characterize the role of ec subsets in tissue-homeostasis, immune surveillance, infection, inflammation, and malignancies.
we hypothesized that the atypical chemokine receptor darc  may distinguish v-ecs versus nv-ecs in mice.
