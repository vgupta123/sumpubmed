while morphologically diverse, solanaceae species such as potato, tomato, pepper, and eggplant share not only genes but also gene order thereby permitting highly informative comparative genomic analyses.
comparative analyses between tomato and potato at the gene level revealed a high level of conservation of gene content, genic feature, and gene order although discordances in synteny were observed.
genomic level analyses of potato and tomato confirm that gene sequence and gene order are conserved between these solanaceous species and that this conservation can be leveraged in genomic applications including cross-species annotation and genome sequencing initiatives.
the gc content of potato is very similar to solanum lycopersicon  and other dicotyledonous species yet distinct from the monocotyledonous grass species, oryza sativa.
the solanaceae family contains a number of important crop species including potato  which is grown for its underground storage organ known as a tuber.
parallel analyses of repetitive sequences in potato and tomato revealed substantial differences in their abundance,  <dig> % in potato versus  <dig> % in tomato, which is consistent with the increased genome size per haploid genome of these two solanum species.
specific classes and types of repetitive sequences were also differentially represented between these two species including a telomeric-related repetitive sequence, ribosomal dna, and a number of unclassified repetitive sequences.
while tomato and potato share genic features, they differ in their repetitive sequence content and composition suggesting that repetitive sequences may have a more significant role in shaping speciation than previously reported.
