the piwi protein-associated small rnas  guide piwi proteins to retrotransposon transcripts, which are degraded and thereby post-transcriptionally silenced through a ping-pong amplification process.
this suggests that the processing of the 5' product of pirna-guided cleavage occurs while the pirna target is engaged by the piwi protein.
cleavage of the retrotransposon transcript defines at the same time the 5' end of a secondary pirna that will in turn guide a piwi protein to a primary pirna precursor, thereby amplifying primary pirnas.
although several studies provided evidence that this mechanism is conserved among metazoa, how the process is initiated and what enzymatic activities are responsible for generating the primary and secondary pirnas are not entirely clear.
here we analyzed small rnas from three mammalian species, seeking to gain further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the pirna amplification loop.
they will enable more accurate identification of pirna loci in deep sequencing data sets.
