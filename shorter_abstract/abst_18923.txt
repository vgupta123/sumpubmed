combined with strain collections, such as the gfp fusion collection for budding yeast, our methodology allows quantitative measurements of protein levels of up to hundreds of genes and therefore provides complementary data to high throughput studies of transcription.
further, we quantify protein levels of over  <dig> genes, again over  <dig> hours, after cells experience a change in carbon source .
experiments typically use variants of green fluorescent protein , and time-series measurements require specialist expertise if single cells are to be followed.
to connect gene expression with cellular physiology, we need to follow levels of proteins over time.

fluorescence plate readers, however, a standard in many laboratories, can in principle provide similar data, albeit at a mean, population level.
we illustrate the method by following the induction of the gal genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae for over  <dig> hours in different sugars and argue that the order of appearance of the leloir enzymes may be to reduce build-up of the toxic intermediate galactose-1-phosphate.
here we propose a general method for correcting plate reader measurements of fluorescent proteins that uses spectral unmixing and determines both the fluorescence per cell and the errors on that fluorescence.
