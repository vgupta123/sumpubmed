swine h1n1/n <dig> viruses that sporadically infected humans featured both the swine and the human interaction pattern.
substitutions f71s, t128s, e302k, m314l in ha <dig> of swine h1n <dig> viruses from north america are identified as critical for the human interaction pattern of a/h1n <dig> and residues d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> are predicted to be "hot-spots" for polymorphisms which could increase infectivity of a/h1n <dig> virus.
analyses by ism bioinformatics platform of the ha <dig> protein of north american swine h1n1/n <dig> viruses and the new a/h1n <dig> showed that both groups of viruses differed in conserved characteristics that reflect a distinct propensity of these viruses to undergo a specific interaction with swine or human host proteins or receptors.
our results  contribute to better understanding of the origin of the novel a/h1n <dig> influenza virus,  provide a tool for monitoring its molecular evolution  predicts hotspots associated with enhanced infectivity in humans and  identify therapeutic and diagnostic targets for prevention and treatment of a/h1n <dig> infection.
in  <dig> the a/h1n <dig> virus acquired the capacity to spread efficiently by human to human transmission.
