we show that specific residues within the litaf domain interact with phosphoethanolamine  head groups, and that the introduction of the v144m cmt1c-associated pathogenic mutation leads to protein aggregation in the presence of pe.
litaf encodes a 17 kda protein containing an n-terminal proline-rich region followed by an evolutionarily-conserved c-terminal ‘litaf domain’, which contains all reported cmt1c-associated pathogenic mutations.
our structural model demonstrates that litaf is a monotopic zinc-binding membrane protein that embeds into intracellular membranes via a predicted hydrophobic, in-plane, helical anchor located within the litaf domain.
in addition to the structural characterisation of litaf, these data lead us to propose that an aberrant litaf-pe interaction on the surface of intracellular membranes contributes to the molecular pathogenesis that underlies this currently incurable disease.
here, we report the first structural characterisation of litaf using biochemical, cell biological, biophysical and nmr spectroscopic approaches.
