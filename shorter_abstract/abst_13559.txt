this bccl <dig> protein formed dimers and higher-order oligomers in solution.
partial loss of alpha-helical content and dissociation of dimers occurred at 42°c, with the residual alpha helices remaining stable up to 80°c.
these results indicate that the b-box  <dig>  coiled-coil and linker  <dig> regions of trim5α form a core dimerization motif that exhibits a high level of alpha-helical content.
approximately 40% of the bccl <dig> secondary structure consisted of alpha helices.
like all tripartite motif  proteins, the retroviral restriction factor trim5α consists of ring, b-box  <dig> and coiled-coil domains, with a c-terminal b <dig>  domain.
