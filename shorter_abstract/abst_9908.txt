the molecular basis of host resistance to a. tenuissima has not been studied as yet in any detail.
a substantial body of chrysanthemum transcriptomic sequence was generated, which led to a number of insights into the molecular basis of the host response to a. tenuissima infection.
read frequency was used as a measure of transcript abundance and therefore as an identifier of differential transcription in the four libraries.
the transcriptomic data was acquired using rna-seq technology, based on the illumina hiseqâ„¢  <dig> platform.
the differentially transcribed genes identified were involved in photosynthesis, pathogen recognition, reactive oxygen species generation, cell wall modification and phytohormone signalling; in addition, a number of varied transcription factors were identified.
a selection of  <dig> of the genes was transcription-profiled using quantitative rt-pcr to validate the rna-seq output.

here, high throughput sequencing was taken to characterize the transcriptomic response of the chrysanthemum leaf to a. tenuissima inoculation.
