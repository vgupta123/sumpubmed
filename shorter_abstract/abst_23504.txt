reduced expression in immortalised cells  interferes with sgta dimerization and rescues ar signalling.
mammalian two-hybrid and halo-tagged pull-down assays showed that canine reic/dkk- <dig> interacted with sgta and interfered with sgta dimerization.
therefore, we confirmed the interaction between canine sgta and reic/dkk- <dig>  as well as their role in ar signalling.
our results suggest that this interaction might contribute to the development of a novel strategy for androgen-independent prostate cancer treatment.

both canine and human androgen receptor  signalling are inhibited by overexpression of the dimerized co-chaperone small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α , which is considered to cause the development of androgen-independency.
