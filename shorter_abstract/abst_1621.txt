the extended 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that the initial composition of the infant gut microbiota is a key determinant in the development of atopic disease.
several studies have demonstrated that the microbiota of allergic and non-allergic infants are different even before the development of symptoms, with a critical time window during the first  <dig> months of life.
fecal colonisation at age  <dig> weeks with either a bacteroides fragilis subgroup or a clostridium coccoides subcluster xiva species is an early indicator of possible asthma later in life.
these findings need to be confirmed in a new longitudinal follow-up study.
a final dgge model, including both bands, allowed correct classification of 73%  of the cases.
a bacteroides fragilis subgroup band was also significantly associated with a positive api.
in a prospective birth cohort,  <dig> children were classified according to the api .
a positive index included wheezing during the first three years of life combined with eczema in the child in the first years of life or with a parental history of asthma.
the asthma predictive index was positive in 24/ <dig>  of the children.
using universal v <dig> primers a band corresponding to a clostridum coccoides xiva species was significantly associated with a positive api.
