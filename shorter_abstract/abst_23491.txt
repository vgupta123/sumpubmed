the data were used to investigate the relevance, specificity, criterion validity and inter- and intra-observer reliability of each item on the pain scale, and to evaluate construct validity and responsiveness of the scale.
inter- and intra-observer reliability for the items was only satisfactory.
construct validity was demonstrated by the observed differences in scores between the groups, four hours after anaesthetic recovery and before administration of systemic analgesia in the gc group.
in order to refine and validate an acute pain scale for horses a prospective, randomized, blinded study was conducted.
one investigator, unaware of the treatment group, assessed all horses at time-points before and after intervention and completed the pain scale.
subsequently the pain scale was refined, based on results for relevance, specificity and total item correlation.
after further validation for reliability, these may be used to evaluate pain under clinical and experimental conditions.
twenty-four client owned adult horses were recruited and allocated to one of four following groups: anaesthesia only ; pre-emptive analgesia and anaesthesia ; anaesthesia, castration and postoperative analgesia ; or pre-emptive analgesia, anaesthesia and castration .
