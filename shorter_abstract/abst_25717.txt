the fact that levels of fa in traits likely to be important in the context of predator evasion were elevated in ponds compared to marine populations suggests that relaxed selection for homeostasis in ponds lacking predatory fish may be responsible for the observed habitat difference in levels of fa.
pond sticklebacks had on average three times higher levels of fa than marine fish and this difference was highly significant.
hence, while differences in strength of selection, rather than in the degree of genetic stress could be argued to explain habitat differences in levels of fa, the hypothesis that increased fa in ponds is caused by genetic stress cannot be rejected.
this inference also aligns with the observation that the levels of genetic variability across the populations did not explain population differences in levels of fa after correcting for habitat effect.
