we propose a color-coding approach for the representation of three-way comparisons.
we propose a novel color-coding approach for intuitive visualization of three-way comparisons of omics data.
however, the current color-codings limit the visualizations to single datasets or pairwise comparisons.
if all three compared values are different, the resulting hue is selected from a color gradient running between the hues of the two most distant values  according to the relative position of the third value between the two.
the saturation of the color representing the three-way comparison reflects the amplitude  of the numerical difference between the two most distant values according to a scale of interest.
the hue value representing the three-way comparison is calculated according to the distribution of three compared values.
the brightness is set to a maximum value by default but can be used to encode additional information about the three-way comparison.
density plot visualizations  are widely used in different fields including large-scale omics studies in biological sciences.
