host srnas were mapped to the published aedine transcriptome and subjected to analysis using edger .
triplicate biological replicates were used so that rigorous statistical metrics could be applied.
changes to host srna profiles indicate that specific cellular processes are affected during denv infection, such as mitochondrial function and ncrna levels.
we found that srna profiles are altered early in denv <dig> infection, and mrna targets from mitochondrial, transcription/translation, and transport functional categories are affected.
these data implicate the piwi pathway in anti-viral defense.
