each s. pyogenes genome contained up to nine individual ssrs, encompassing all described strain-specific prophages.
the stability of this ssr, combined to its presence in all sequenced s. pyogenes sequenced genome, suggests that it results from an ancient acquisition.
thus, this non-phagic ssr is compatible with a pathogenicity island, acquired before s. pyogenes speciation.
in contrast, the cumulative ta-skew presented a v-shape, which segments were interrupted by several steep slopes regions , indicative of a different nucleotide composition bias.
in addition to a high content in virulence-related genes and to a peculiar nucleotide bias, this ssr, which is  <dig> kb-long in a m1gas strain, harbors direct repeats and a trna gene, suggesting a mobile element.
the cumulative gc-skew plot presented an inverted v-shape composed of two symmetrical linear segments, where the minimum and maximum corresponded to the origin and terminus of dna replication.
this core includes the m-protein, other mga-related factors and other virulence genes, totaling ten intrinsic virulence genes.
here we analyzed the twelve sequenced genomes of streptococcus pyogenes by a na√Øve approach that examines the preferential nucleotide usage along the chromosome, namely the usage of g versus c  and t versus a .
its potential excision might bear relevance for vaccine development, because vaccines targeting m-protein might select for m-protein-negative variants that still carry other virulence determinants.
