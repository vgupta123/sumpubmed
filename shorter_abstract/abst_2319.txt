spa typing was performed and revealed thirty-two unique spa gene patterns and eight small clusters comprising nineteen isolates.
in contrast, alpha toxin production rates between distinct clonal complexes clearly differed.
this was due to the presence of gamma toxin, as proven by inhibition experiments using antisera raised against the respective recombinant proteins.
functional assessment of alpha toxin activity by a rabbit erythrocyte lysis assay revealed that supernatants lacking alpha toxin still displayed hemolysis.
agr types i to iv were identified, but did not allow a prediction of high or low production rates.
blood isolates were compared with colonisation strains to determine similarities and differences of single strains and clusters.
blood isolates and colonising strains showed comparable amounts of secreted proteins within a wide range.
production rates of the three most prevalent exotoxins varied within both groups of blood isolates and colonising strains.
comparative studies of genomic information and production rates are needed to assess the pathogenic potential of isolated strains.
recognised spa-typing clusters displayed highly similar production rates.
sequence analysis identified mutated open reading frames in hla in  <dig> Â % of all strains, in selw  and in selx .
all corrupted genes were associated with specific clonal complexes.
fifty-one fresh isolates obtained from colonised individuals  and s. aureus bacteremia  patients  were investigated.
by comparing genotypes and secretion, we found that identical complex gene patterns did not allow predictions of toxin production and function.
genotypic and phenotypic profiling of clinical and colonising isolates of s. aureus was used to characterise the release of exotoxins.
alpha toxin, sec, and tsst <dig> production was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on supernatants of all hla, sec, and tst positive isolates.
