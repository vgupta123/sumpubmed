using 3d fish in porcine fetal liver cells, we compared the nuclear organization of the two parental alleles  of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , a paternally imprinted gene located on chromosome  <dig>  we investigated whether its nuclear positioning favors specific locus associations.
our results show that trans-associations occur between three imprinted genes igf <dig>  dlk <dig> and meg <dig> both in fetal liver and muscle cells.
the paternally expressed allele was tagged with nascent rna.
to explore the relationship between spatial genome organization and gene expression in the interphase nucleus, we used a genomic imprinting model, which offers parental-specific gene expression.
this igf2- association also occurred in a high percentage of fetal muscle cells .
we screened them and abcg <dig>  osbp <dig>  osbpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  nf <dig>  zar <dig>  sep <dig>  gpc <dig> for associations with igf <dig> in liver cells.
this gene association was confirmed by 3d fish , revealing also the close proximity of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .
all three expressed alleles associated in muscle cells.
our findings suggest that the 3d nuclear organization is linked to the transcriptional state of these genes.
