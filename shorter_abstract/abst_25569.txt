microarray data for putative switchgrass scw mybs indicate that many maintain similar expression patterns with the arabidopsis scw regulators.
here, we describe the results of applying phylogenic, orthomcl, and sequence identity analyses to classify the r2r <dig> myb family proteins from the annotated proteomes of arabidposis, poplar, rice, maize and the initial genome  and translated transcriptome of switchgrass .
r2r <dig> myb proteins constitute one of the largest plant transcription factor clades and regulate diverse plant-specific processes.
several r2r <dig> myb proteins act as regulators of secondary cell wall  biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana , a dicotyledenous plant.
we find that the r2r <dig> myb proteins of the five species fall into  <dig> subgroups, including three dicot-specific, six grass-specific, and two panicoid grass-expanded subgroups.
we observe four classes of phylogenetic relationships within the subgroups of known scw-regulating myb proteins between arabidopsis and rice, ranging from likely one-to-one orthology  to no homologs identifiable .
this comparative analysis of the r2r <dig> myb family will facilitate transfer of understanding of regulatory mechanisms among species and enable control of scw biosynthesis in switchgrass toward improving its biomass quality.
furthermore, some switchgrass representatives of grass-expanded clades have gene expression patterns consistent with regulating scw development.
