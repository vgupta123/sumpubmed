the expression of tclec <dig> was higher in dedifferentiated cells competent for somatic embryogenesis , compared to non-embryogenic calli.
transient overexpression of tclec <dig> in immature zygotic embryos resulted in changes in gene expression profiles and fatty acid composition.
collectively, our evidence supports the conclusion that tclec <dig> is a functional ortholog of atlec <dig> and that it is involved in similar genetic regulatory networks during cacao somatic embryogenesis.

tclec <dig> overexpressing cotyledon explants exhibited a very high level of embryogenic competency and when cultured on hormone free medium, exhibited an iterative embryogenic chain-reaction.
tclec <dig> could potentially be used as a biomarker for the improvement of the se process and screen for elite varieties in cacao germplasm.
ectopic expression of tclec <dig> in cacao leaves changed the expression levels of several seed related genes.
lec <dig> exerts significant impacts on determining embryogenic potential and various metabolic processes through a complicated genetic regulatory network.
the arabidopsis thaliana lec <dig> gene encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor, which plays critical roles during both zygotic and somatic embryogenesis.
