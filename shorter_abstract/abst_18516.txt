the apparent association constants  indicate greater affinity of igg from retinopathic t1d patients  followed by nephropathic  and uncomplicated  t1d patients for ros-gad <dig> compared to n-gad <dig>
these results were further proven by competitive elisa estimations.
however, its association in secondary complications of t1d has not yet been ascertained.
hence regulation of ros-gad65abs could offer novel tools for analysing and possibly treating t1d complications.
uncomplicated t1d subjects also exhibited reactivity towards ros-gad <dig>  however, this was found to be less as compared to the binding recorded from complicated subjects.
increased oxidative stress and blood glucose levels with extended duration of disease in complicated t1d could be responsible for the gradual formation and/or exposing cryptic epitopes on gad <dig> that induce increased production of ros-gad65abs.
from the cohort of samples, serum autoantibodies from t1d retinopathic and nephropathic patients showed high recognition of ros-gad <dig> as compared to native gad <dig> .
