only aplasma and eplasma have a full suite of flagellar genes whereas all but the ferroplasma spp.
for this reason, we used metagenomics to analyze variation in gene content that may contribute to niche differentiation among co-occurring amd archaea.
overall this study reveals shared features of organisms from the thermoplasmatales lineage and provides new insights into the functioning of amd communities.
notably, only aplasma, gplasma and the ferroplasma spp.
all of the uncultivated organisms studied here  are metabolically very similar to characterized ferroplasma spp., differentiating themselves mainly in their genetic capabilities for biosynthesis, motility, and possibly iron oxidation.
metal sulfide mineral dissolution during bioleaching and acid mine drainage  formation creates an environment that is inhospitable to most life.
these results greatly expand genomic information available for this archaeal order.
these results indicate that subtle, but important genomic differences, coupled with unknown differences in gene expression, distinguish these organisms enough to allow for co-existence.
we reconstructed near-complete genomes for uncultivated, relatively low abundance organisms a-, e-, and gplasma, members of thermoplasmatales order, and for a novel organism, iplasma.
have predicted iron oxidation genes and eplasma and iplasma lack most genes for cobalamin, valine, leucine and histidine synthesis.
the thermoplasmatales amd archaea share a large number of metabolic capabilities.
most of the genomes share genes for toxic metal resistance and surface-layer production.
