moreover, known cooperative interactions are retrieved as aggregating pairs of taxa.
we hope that these results stimulate experimental verification of the putative cooperative interactions between cosmopolitan bacteria, and we suggest several groups of aggregated cosmopolitan bacteria that are interesting candidates for such an investigation.
here we investigate the influence of environmental preferences and ecological interactions in the tendency of bacterial taxa to either aggregate or segregate, using a comprehensive dataset of bacterial taxa observed in a wide variety of environments.
due to the coarse grained nature of our data we cannot conclusively reject the hypothesis that many of these aggregations are due to environmental preferences that the null model fails to reproduce.
the analysis of these associations reveals a surprisingly large number of significant aggregations between taxa, with a marked community structure and a strong propensity to aggregate for cosmopolitan taxa.
in particular, most pairs of aggregating taxa co-occur in very different environments, which makes it unlikely that these associations are due to habitat preferences, and many are formed by cosmopolitan taxa without well defined habitat preferences.
we assess significance of taxa associations through a null model that takes into account habitat preferences and the global distribution of taxa across samples.
macroscopic biogeography explores hypothetical ecological interactions through the analysis of species associations.
nevertheless, some observations are better explained by ecological interactions than by habitat filtering.
