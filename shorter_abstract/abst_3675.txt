with the growing availability of full-text articles online, scientists and other consumers of the life sciences literature now have the ability to go beyond searching bibliographic records  to directly access full-text content.
this question is answered by comparing text retrieval algorithms on medlineÂ® abstracts, full-text articles, and spans  within full-text articles using data from the trec  <dig> genomics track evaluation.
however, retrieval based on spans, or paragraphs-sized segments of full-text articles, consistently outperforms abstract-only search.
experimental results also highlight the need to develop distributed text retrieval algorithms, since full-text articles are significantly longer than abstracts and may require the computational resources of multiple machines in a cluster.
this finding affirms the value of full text collections for text retrieval and provides a starting point for future work in exploring algorithms that take advantage of rapidly-growing digital archives.
results suggest that highest overall effectiveness may be achieved by combining evidence from spans and full articles.
the mapreduce programming model provides a convenient framework for organizing such computations.
motivated by this emerging trend, i posed the following question: is searching full text more effective than searching abstracts?
users searching full text are more likely to find relevant articles than searching only abstracts.
two retrieval models are examined: bm <dig> and the ranking algorithm implemented in the open-source lucene search engine.
experiments show that treating an entire article as an indexing unit does not consistently yield higher effectiveness compared to abstract-only search.
