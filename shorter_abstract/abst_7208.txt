we have quantified the expression levels of thirteen cytokine and cytokine related genes in three forms of ovine paratuberculosis using real-time pcr analyses and confirm that sheep pauci- and multibacillary disease are linked to type  <dig> and type  <dig> t cell responses respectively.
the expression patterns of other cytokines shows that both disease forms have an inflammatory aetiology but that the central role for il-1α in bovine paratuberculosis is not seen in the sheep infection.
the paucibacillary form is characterized by an inflammatory, th1-type immune response.
the multibacillary form of the disease, which disseminates the infection, is characterized by macrophage infiltration mediated by a th2-type immune response, and asymptomatic animals have no clinical symptoms or pathology but are infected with map.
the pauci- and multibacillary forms are linked to the differential expression of ifnγ and il- <dig> respectively.
paucibacillary lesions have largely t cell and eosinophil infiltration and are zn negative; multibacillary lesions have macrophage infiltration and large numbers of acid-fast bacteria.
to further understand these differences, we used real-time rt-pcr to compare the expression of thirteen cytokine and cytokine-related genes in ileal tissue from sheep with the three forms of the disease.
asymptomatic animals are is900+ with normal histology but have significantly decreased levels of il- <dig> and increased levels tnfα.
three pathological forms of sheep paratuberculosis were defined on the basis of histopathology, cytochemistry  and is <dig> pcr.
asymptomatic animals are infected and show no pathology but can be distinguished, in terms of cytokine expression pattern, from uninfected controls.
