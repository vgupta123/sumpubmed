by contrast, the nrdna data supported the samples clustered into three groups, which was inconsistent with separate geographical regions supported by cpdna data.
both molecular data and ecological niche modeling indicated that f. suspensa expanded to nearby low-elevation plains in the glacial periods, and retreated to mountaintops during interglacial warmer stages.
despite its high number of endemic deciduous broad-leaved species in china’s warm-temperate zone, far less attention has been paid to phylogeographic studies in this region.
this study thus supported that f. suspensa persisted in situ during the glacial of the pleistocene with enlarged distribution area, contrary to the hypothesis of long distance southward migration or large-scale range contraction.
the cpdna data revealed seven phylogeographical groups corresponding to geographical regions.
ecological niche modeling showed that the climatically suitable area during the cold period was larger than that during the warm period.
