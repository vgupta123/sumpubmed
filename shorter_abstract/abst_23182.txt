our data support an evolutionary scenario where the genome of the mammalian ancestor encoded for at least one ancestral a <dig> gene, and where the genome of the ancestor of placental mammals  already encoded for an a3z1-a3z2-a3z <dig> arrangement.
the human genome encodes for seven a <dig> genes, with multiple splice alternatives.
duplication events of the a <dig> genes have occurred independently in different lineages: humans, cats and horses.
our results provide a time framework for identifying ancestral and derived genomic arrangements in the apobec loci, and to date the expansion of this gene family for different lineages through time, as a response to changes in viral/retroviral/retrotransposon pressure.
in all of them, gene duplication has resulted in changes in enzyme activity and/or substrate specificity, in a paradigmatic example of convergent adaptive evolution at the genomic level.
finally, our results show that evolutionary rates for the three a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> motifs have significantly decreased in the last  <dig> mya.
the apobec <dig>  genes play a key role in innate antiviral defense in mammals by introducing directed mutations in the dna.
