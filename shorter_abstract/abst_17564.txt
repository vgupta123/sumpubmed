multiple alignment showed a premature stop codon, which prevents the encoding of the conserved cysteine residue at the e <dig> active site, and an intron that is spliced in e <dig> homologues, but not in ghgdrp <dig>  the ghgdrp <dig> gene is highly expressed in different organs of cotton plants, and has high transcript levels in roots.
ucea <dig>  shows strong expression levels, equaling or surpassing the expression levels of camv35s.
gus expression levels are decreased 7- to 15-fold when its 5'utr is absent in uceapro <dig>
nucleotide analysis revealed high identity with cotton e <dig> homologues.
ucea <dig>  is a strong constitutive regulatory sequence composed of a promoter  and its 5'utr that will be useful in genetic transformation of dicots, having high potential to drive high levels of transgene expression in crops, particularly for traits desirable in flower and root tissues.
therefore, the characterization of promoters and regulatory regions is also important to achieve high gene expression and/or a specific expression pattern.
its promoter  and the 5'utr compose a regulatory region named ucea <dig> , and were isolated from cotton and studied in arabidopsis thaliana.
