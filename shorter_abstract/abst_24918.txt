this increase was then attributed to accelerated nuclear import of oct- <dig>  assessed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  using green fluorescence protein  tagged oct- <dig> molecule.
we found recently that in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells, oct- <dig> also functions as a sensor for cyclic amp .
we show in this study that inducing oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide  increased nuclear oct- <dig> content in both pancreatic α and β cell lines, as well as in a battery of other cells.
camp elevation leads to increased nuclear exclusion of oct- <dig>  associated with reduced recruitment of nuclear co-repressors to the cdx- <dig> promoter and increased cdx- <dig> expression.
finally, increased oct- <dig> nuclear content upon h2o <dig> treatment in a pancreatic α cell line was associated with reduced cdx- <dig> and gcg mrna expression.
