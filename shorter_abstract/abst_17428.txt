this framework consists of a logical model build with semantic web tools, coupled with a markov process that propagates user operator states.
a computational framework for bioinformatic infrastructure was designed to deal with the heterogeneous data sources and the sensitive mixture of public and private data that characterizes the biomedical domain.
an accompanying open source prototype was developed to meet a series of applications that range from collaborative multi-institution data acquisition efforts to data analysis applications that need to quickly traverse complex data structures.
biomedical research is set to greatly benefit from the use of semantic web technologies in the design of computational infrastructure.
the s3db core model proposed was found to address the design criteria of biomedical computational infrastructure, such as those supporting large scale multi-investigator research, clinical trials, and molecular epidemiology.
