these subversion processes are associated with early orfv gene expression and are accompanied by disturbed carbohydrate trimming of post-er mhc i. the mhc i population remaining on the cell surface shows an extended half-life, an effect that might be partially controlled also by late orfv genes.
here, we describe that orfv infection of permissive cells impairs the intracellular transport of mhc class i molecules  as a result of structural disruption and fragmentation of the golgi apparatus.
the orf virus , a zoonotic parapoxvirus, causes pustular skin lesions in small ruminants .
the presented data demonstrate that orfv down-regulates mhc i surface expression in infected cells by targeting the late vesicular export machinery and the structure and function of the golgi apparatus, which might aid to escape cellular immune recognition.
depending on the duration of infection, we observed a pronounced co-localization of mhc i and cop-i vesicular structures as well as a reduction of mhc i surface expression of up to 50%.
