the observed difference in the effect of mp on il- <dig> and ifn-γ could be important for the understanding of the variability in the efficiency of glucocorticoids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
production of il- <dig> in mitogen-stimulated lymph node cells  from non-treated rats, as well as in myelin basic protein -stimulated draining lnc from rats immunized with spinal cord homogenate and complete freund's adjuvant was significantly reduced by mp.
interleukin- <dig> -producing cells are increasingly considered to be the major pathogenic population in various autoimmune disorders.
in its influence on il- <dig> production mp inhibited ror-γt transcription factor expression, as well as jun phosphorylation, but not erk or p <dig> activation in mitogen-stimulated lnc.
the reduction was dose-dependent, sustained through the follow-up period of  <dig> hours, and was not achieved through anti-proliferative effect.
additionally, mp inhibited il- <dig> production in purified t cells as well, but to less extent than in lnc.
the effects of glucocorticoids, widely used as therapeutics for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, on il- <dig> generation have not been thoroughly investigated so far.
