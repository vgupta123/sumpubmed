kvfinder is a geometry-based method that has an innovative customization of the search space.
kvfinder is also user friendly, as it is available as a pymol plugin, or command-line version.
although the main focus of kvfinder is the steered prospection of cavities, we tested it against a benchmark dataset of  <dig> known drug targets in order to validate our software and compare it with some of the largely accepted methods.
this feature provides the possibility of cavity segmentation, which alongside with the large set of customizable parameters, allows detailed cavity analyses.
we developed kvfinder, a highly versatile and easy-to-use tool for cavity prospection and spatial characterization.
kvfinder presents novel usability features, granting full customizable and highly detailed cavity prospection on proteins, alongside with a friendly graphical interface.
