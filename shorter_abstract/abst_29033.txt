when the number of genes in a gene set is small, we recommend permutation tests based on our nonparametric test statistics to achieve reliable type i error and better power while incorporating unknown correlations between and within-genes.
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has a greater power than other methods for various data distributions and heteroscedastic correlation structures.
the simulation study and the real data application showed that the proposed gene set analysis provides a promising tool for longitudinal microarray analysis.
gene set analysis  has become a successful tool to interpret gene expression profiles in terms of biological functions, molecular pathways, or genomic locations.
in these longitudinal studies, gene expression is repeatedly measured over time such that a gsa needs to take into account the within-gene correlations in addition to possible between-gene correlations.
nowadays, an increasing number of microarray studies are conducted to explore the dynamic changes of gene expression in a variety of species and biological scenarios.
gsa performs statistical tests for independent microarray samples at the level of gene sets rather than individual genes.
r scripts for simulating longitudinal data and calculating the nonparametric statistics are posted on the north dakota inbre website http://ndinbre.org/programs/bioinformatics.php.
raw microarray data is available in gene expression omnibus  with accession number gse <dig>
