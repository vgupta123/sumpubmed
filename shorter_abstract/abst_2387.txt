17- <dig> february  <dig> proceedings of the ninth annual mcbios conference.
we encoded the 3-dimensional structures using pharmacophore fingerprints which are binary strings, and accomplished instance-based embedding using calculated dissimilarity distances.
in this work we aimed to predict bioactive conformers using a variant of supervised learning, named multiple-instance learning.
the goal of the present project is to implement multiple-instance learning in drug activity prediction, and subsequently to identify the bioactive conformers for each molecule.
to validate the ability of the proposed approach to find bioactive conformers,  <dig> small molecules with co-crystallized structures were seeded in one data set.
the approach was also validated as a useful method for pursuit of bioactive conformers.
the proposed approach was proven not to suffer from overfitting and to be highly competitive with classical predictive models, so it is very powerful for drug activity prediction.
1-norm svm was used for joint feature selection and classification.
the predictive abilities of the proposed approach were compared with three classical predictive models without instance-based embedding.
in the context of drug discovery and development, much effort has been exerted to determine which conformers of a given molecule are responsible for the observed biological activity.
<dig> out of  <dig> co-crystallized structures were indeed identified as significant conformers using the proposed approach.
four dissimilarity measures were employed and their performances were compared.
the approach was applied to four data sets, and the best proposed model for each data set was determined by using the dissimilarity measure yielding the smallest number of selected features.
