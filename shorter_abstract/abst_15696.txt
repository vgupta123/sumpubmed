saha pretreatment increased seizure latency and decreased seizure scores.
sprague–dawley rats with kainic acid -induced seizures were treated with saha.
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the h <dig> histone acetylation levels significantly decreased while h3k <dig> levels significantly increased in the ka treatment group.
the h <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation levels returned to control levels after saha  pretreatment.
there was a positive correlation between the expression of tlr <dig> and the acetylation levels of h3k <dig>
this suggests that saha may protect against seizure-induced brain damage.
the expression levels of tlr <dig>  myd <dig>  nf-κb and il-1β increased significantly in both activated microglia and apoptotic neurons after ka treatment.
seizure-induced tlr4/myd <dig> signaling plays a critical role in activating microglia and triggering neuron apoptosis.
histone deacetylase inhibitor saha can suppress seizure-induced tlr4/myd <dig> signaling and inhibit tlr <dig> gene expression through histone acetylation regulation.
