comparable fold-change values were obtained between the affymetrix technology and the rtqpcr method.
indeed, the intracellular development of l. amazonensis amastigote relies on the biogenesis and dynamic remodelling of a phagolysosome, termed the parasitophorous vacuole, primarily within dermal mΦ.
ingenuity pathway analysis software® pinpointed the up-regulation of the sterol biosynthesis pathway  involving several genes , and the modulation of various genes involved in polyamine synthesis and in pro/counter-inflammatory signalling.
using balb/c mouse bone marrow-derived mΦ loaded or not with amastigotes, we analyzed the transcriptional signatures of mΦ  <dig> h later, when the amastigote population was growing.
our findings suggest that the amastigote growth relies on early coordinated gene expression of the mΦ lipid and polyamine pathways.
