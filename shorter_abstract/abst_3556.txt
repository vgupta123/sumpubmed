despite this, all sampled birds were free of overt disease.
eimeria species are present world-wide, and are ubiquitous under intensive farming methods.
however, prevalence of eimeria species is not uniform across production systems.
moderate clustering of positive birds was detected within households, perhaps suggesting common risk factors or exposure pathways.
co-infection with multiple eimeria spp was common and almost half of eimeria positive birds had at least one highly pathogenic species detected.
co-infections were common; 64%  of positive samples contained more than one eimeria spp.
eimeria spp oocysts may be frequently detected in faecal samples from village chickens in ethiopia.
coccidiosis, caused by species of the apicomplexan parasite eimeria, is a major disease of chickens.
although there was no evidence of a difference in the prevalence of oocysts in faecal samples between study regions, there was evidence of variation in the prevalence of some species, perhaps suggesting regional differences in exposure to risk factors associated with the birds, their management and/or location-specific environmental and ecological factors.
eimeria oocyst positivity in may did not significantly affect the likelihood of detecting eimeria oocyst five months later perhaps suggesting infection with different species or immunologically distinct strains.
eimeria oocysts were detected microscopically in  <dig>  52-59%) of the  <dig> faecal samples tested.
eimeria oocysts were detected significantly more frequently in october , following the main rainy season, compared to may .
faecal samples were collected from  <dig> randomly selected chickens in may or october  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> chickens were sampled in both may and october.
