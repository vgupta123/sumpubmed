investigation of tomato genetic resources is a crucial issue for better straight evolution and genetic studies as well as tomato breeding strategies.
the effort performed highlighted varieties relationships and important variants in fruit key processes useful to dissect the path from sequence variant to phenotype.
owing to their economic and social importance is crucial to understand the genetic basis of their unique traits.
traditional vesuviano and san marzano varieties grown in campania region  are famous for their remarkable fruit quality.
distinctive variations in key genes and transcription/regulation factors related to fruit quality have been revealed for both cultivars.
copy genes number and gene location were assessed by mrna transcripts mapping, showing a closer relationship of san marzano with reference genome.
a 40x genome coverage was obtained from a hybrid illumina paired-end reads assembling that combines de novo assembly with iterative mapping to the reference s. lycopersicum genome .
here, we present the draft genome sequences of tomato vesuviano and san marzano genome.
