gene ontology  analysis and kegg analysis revealed that flavone and flavonol biosynthrsis, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were involved in sterility-fertility transition of pa64s.
in this study, using methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing , the global dna methylation patterns were compared in the rice ptgms line pa64s under two different environments .
the hypermethylated bim <dig> gene may suppress some downstream genes in brassinosteroid signaling pathway, and thus affect the male fertility in pa64s.
the results presented here indicated that hypermethylation was observed in pa64s .
however, little studies have been reported about the methylation profiles of photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile  rice during the fertility transition.
dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification that dynamically regulates gene expression during developmental processes.
the profiling of the dna methylation under two different phenotypes  revealed that hypermethylation was observed in pa64s , and  <dig> differentially methylated regions  were found between pa64s  and pa64s .
