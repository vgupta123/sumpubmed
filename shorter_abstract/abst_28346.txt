while barcodes  primarily encode the sample identity of sequenced dna fragments, barcodes made of random sequences  are often used to distinguish between pcr duplicates and transcript abundance in, for example, single-cell rna sequencing .
alternatively, umis can be combined with the sample barcodes into composite barcodes, or with standard illumina® indexing.
here, we present je, a suite of tools that accommodates complex barcoding strategies, extracts umis and filters read duplicates taking umis into account.
the yield obtained from next generation sequencers has increased almost exponentially in recent years, making sample multiplexing common practice.
using je on publicly available scrna-seq and iclip data containing umis, the number of unique reads increased by up to 36 %, compared to when umis are ignored.
