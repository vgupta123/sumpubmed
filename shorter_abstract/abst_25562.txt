a key component of typical machine learning pipelines for omics data is feature selection, which is used to reduce the raw high-dimensional data into a tractable number of features.
the results have shown the rgife feature reduction method to be suitable for analysing both proteomic and transcriptomics data.
feature reduction methods are advantageous for the analysis of omics data in the field of rheumatology, as the applications of such techniques are likely to result in improvements in diagnosis, treatment and drug discovery.
in this paper we propose a heuristic for the selection of very small feature subsets, via an iterative feature elimination process that is guided by rule-based machine learning, called rgife .
investigations into novel biomarkers using omics techniques generate large amounts of data.
our rgife heuristic increased the classification accuracies achieved for all datasets when no feature selection is used, and performed well in a comparison with other feature selection methods.
this balance is crucial when the goal of data analysis is the identification of highly accurate but small panels of biomarkers with potential clinical utility.
using this method the datasets were reduced to a smaller number of genes or proteins, including those known to be relevant to oa, cartilage degradation and joint inflammation.
due to their size and numbers of attributes, these data are suitable for analysis with machine learning methods.
