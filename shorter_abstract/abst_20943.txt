the lack of standardized naming conventions for diastereotopic atoms of small molecules has left the ad hoc names assigned to many of these atoms non-unique, which may create problems in data-mining of the pdb.
nonetheless, the diastereotopic oxygen atoms of diphosphate-containing molecules in the protein data bank  are often given names that do not uniquely distinguish them from each other due to the lack of standardization.
