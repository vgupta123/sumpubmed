adenylate kinase  <dig>  is a phosphotransferase that catalyzes the reversible reaction 2adp ↔ atp + amp and influences cellular energy homeostasis.
ak <dig> knockdown in larvae by rna interference causes larval growth defects, including body weight decrease and development delay.
however, the role of ak <dig> in regulating cell proliferation remains unclear because ak <dig> has been reported to be involved in either cell proliferation or cell apoptosis in different cell types of various organisms.
western blot analysis indicates that ak <dig> constitutively expresses in various tissues during larval development.
the recombinant expressed ak <dig> in e. coli promotes cell growth and viability of haepi cell line by 3-- <dig>  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay.
this study reports ak <dig> promotion of cell proliferation using the lepidopteran insect helicoverpa armigera and its epidermal cell line haepi as models.
the mechanism for such effects might be the suppression of gene transcription involved in insect development caused by ak <dig> knockdown.
these results show that ak <dig> regulates cell growth, viability, and proliferation in insect growth and development.
