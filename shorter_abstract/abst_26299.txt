we showed that alignment posterior probabilities correlate with the reliability of secondary structure predictions, though the strength of the correlation is different for different protocols.
the correspondence between the reliability of secondary structure predictions and alignment posterior probabilities is the closest to the identity function when the secondary structure posterior probabilities are calculated from the posterior distribution of multiple alignments.
we also showed that alignment posterior probabilities correlate with the 3d distances between cÎ± amino acids in superimposed tertiary structures.
alignment posterior probabilities can be used to a priori detect errors in comparative models on the sequence alignment level.
they can highlight the most likely alignment, and above that, they can give posterior probabilities for each alignment column.
we made a comprehensive study on the homstrad database of structural alignments, predicting secondary structures in four different ways.
the prediction is based on a multiple alignment that contains both reference sequences with known structures and the sequence whose unknown structure is predicted.
intensive research has been made to improve the quality of multiple alignments, since misaligned parts of the multiple alignment yield misleading predictions.
stochastic sequence alignment methods define a posterior distribution of possible multiple alignments.
the largest deviation from the identity function has been obtained in the case of predicting secondary structures from a single optimal pairwise alignment.
