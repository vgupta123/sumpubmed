we find that expression levels are better predictors of the evolutionary rate than a protein's connectivity.
detailed analysis of the two organisms also shows that the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are not sufficiently similar to be mutually predictive.
the underlying network structure is incorporated explicitly into the statistical analysis.
the increased phylogenetic resolution, paired with high-quality interaction data, allows us to resolve the way in which protein interaction network structure and abundance of proteins affect the evolutionary rate.
it appears that meaningful inferences about the evolution of protein interaction networks require comparative analysis of reasonably closely related species.
early studies suggested that the position of a protein in the network determines its evolutionary rate but there has been considerable disagreement as to what extent other factors, such as protein abundance, modify this reported dependence.
its position in the interaction networks and its connectivity may modulate this but they appear to have only minor influence on a protein's evolutionary rate.
