robust statistical detection of differences in the bacterial growth rate can be challenging, particularly when dealing with small differences or noisy data.
the method captures the full uncertainty of parameter values, whilst making effective use of prior knowledge about a given system to improve estimation.
we have demonstrated that by making use of existing experimental knowledge, it is possible to significantly improve detection of differences in bacterial growth rate.
we demonstrated the application of bayesian analysis to bacterial growth curve comparison.
a comparison was also made to a more traditional statistical testing method, the f-test, and bayesian analysis was found to perform more conclusively and to be capable of attributing significance to more subtle differences in growth rate.

detection was found to be improved by using prior knowledge from clusters of previously analysed experimental results at similar environmental conditions.
the bayesian approach provides a consistent framework for inferring model parameters and comparing hypotheses.
following extensive testing of the method, the analysis was applied to the large dataset of bacterial responses which are freely available at the web-resource, combase.
