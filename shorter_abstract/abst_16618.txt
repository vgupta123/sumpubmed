however, due to limitation in docking simulation, an in-depth understanding of how sdh interaction occurs across the transmembrane of mitochondria could not be provided.
in this present study, molecular dynamics  simulation of kpn <dig> and sdh chain d in a membrane was performed in order to gain a deeper insight into its molecular role as sdh.
interestingly, water molecules were found to be highly possible in mediating the interaction between ubiquinone  and sdh chain c via interaction with ser <dig> and arg <dig> residues as compared with earlier docking study.
polar residues such as asp <dig> and glu <dig> , asp <dig> and glu <dig>  might have contributed in the creation of a polar environment which is essential for electron transport chain in krebs cycle.
previously, the hypothetical protein, kpn <dig> from klebsiella pneumoniae mgh <dig> was the succinate dehydrogenase  chain c subunit via structural prediction and molecular docking simulation studies.
