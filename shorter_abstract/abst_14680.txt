four of six putative specificity determining positions in plant tes, identified with the use of cpdl, were validated experimentally; a novel colorimetric screen that discriminates between active and inactive tes is also presented.
variants were expressed in e. coli strain k <dig> that allows determination of enzyme activity by gcms analysis of fatty acids released into the medium.
the large amount of available sequence information for the plant acyl-acp thioesterases  made it possible to use a bioinformatics-guided approach to identify amino acid residues involved in substrate specificity.
substitutions at four of the positions  changed substrate specificity to varying degrees while changes at the remaining two positions,  <dig> and  <dig>  essentially inactivated the thioesterase.
six of the fata residue differences identified by cpdl were incorporated into the fatb-like parent via site-directed mutagenesis and the effect of each on te activity was determined.
the conserved property difference locator  program allowed the identification of putative specificity-determining residues that differ between the fata and fatb te classes.
