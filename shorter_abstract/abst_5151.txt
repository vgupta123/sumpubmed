however, this basic fusogenic protein complex may be further specialized to suit the requirements for different neurotransmitter systems, as exemplified by neurons and neuroendocrine cells.
we propose that the snap-25b isoform is predominantly expressed by both mature glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons and serves as a fundamental component of snare complex used for fast synaptic communication in excitatory and inhibitory circuits required for brain function.
voltage-gated calcium channel  mediated calcium transients evoked by depolarization, nevertheless, did not differ between soma of snap- <dig> deficient and control neurons.
in this study, we investigate the effects of snap- <dig> ablation on spontaneous neuronal activity and the expression of functionally distinct isoforms of this t-snare in gabaergic and glutamatergic neurons of the adult brain.
furthermore, we observed that although the expression of snap- <dig> rna transcripts varied among neuronal populations in adult brain, the relative ratio of the transcripts encoding alternatively spliced snap- <dig> variant isoforms was not different in gabaergic and glutamatergic neurons.
moreover, snap- <dig> is required for neurons to establish ap-evoked synchronous network activity, as measured by calcium transients, whereas the loss of this t-snare does not affect voltage-dependent calcium entry.
