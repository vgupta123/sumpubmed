in this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high- and low-pathogenic infections.
the highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity.
highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree.
we compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set.
this signature comprised  <dig> genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury.
