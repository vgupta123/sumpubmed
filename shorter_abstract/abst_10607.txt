our results suggest that the low pathogenicity is common to most of the subtypes of the h <dig> aiv while the high pathogenicity is specific to each subtype.
polybasic cleavage sites of the hemagglutinin  proteins are considered to be the most important determinants indicating virulence of the avian influenza viruses .
there need to exist other sites located on the ha protein outside the cleavage site or on the other proteins expressed by aiv that contribute to the pathogenicity.
our models explicitly define a viral genetic background required for the virus to be highly pathogenic and thus confirm the hypothesis of the presence of pathogenicity markers beyond the cleavage site.
the models were developed using public data and validated on new, unseen sequences.
however, evidence is accumulating that these sites alone are not sufficient to establish high pathogenicity.
