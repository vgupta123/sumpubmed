taken together these data suggest that recombinant human c <dig> can restore classical complement pathway activity and may serve as a potential therapeutic for recurring bacterial infections or sle in c2-deficient patients.
infusions with normal fresh frozen plasma for the treatment of associated disease have demonstrated therapeutic effects but so far protein replacement therapy has not been evaluated.
most prominent are the associations with recurrent serious infections in young children and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus  in adults.
furthermore, rhc <dig> could increase c <dig> fragment deposition on the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae in c2-deficient serum to levels equal to those with normal serum.
it was sensitive to c1s cleavage and restored classical complement pathway activity in c2-deficient serum both in a complement activation elisa and a hemolytic assay.
complement c <dig> deficiency is the most common genetically determined complete complement deficiency and is associated with a number of diseases.
