erythropoietin  and its covalently modified analogs are neuroprotective in various models of brain damage and disease.
we investigated the effect on brain damage and memory performance, of a continuous 3-day intravenous infusion of epo, starting  <dig> min after a transient  <dig> minute period of global cerebral ischemia in the rat.
saline treated injured animals  failed in a test assessing recovery of spatial memory , while epo treated animals had few and none failures .
in contrast, memory performance was significantly improved in the epo treated group.
we conclude that although post-ischemic treatment with epo is not neuroprotective in a model of cardiac arrest brain ischemia, its markedly positive effect on brain plasticity and recovery of memory function warrants consideration as treatment of cardiac arrest patients.
