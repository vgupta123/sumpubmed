low cl and high ehrlichiosis prevalence rates were found in presidente prudente city.
domestic dogs are involved in the transmission cycle and are considered to be the main epidemiologic reservoir of leishmania infantum .
anti-leishmania antibodies were detected using elisa, rk39-immunocromatographic tests , and an indirect fluorescent antibody test .
there was a significant positive association between leishmania and e. canis infection .
serum samples from  <dig> dogs were analyzed.
anti-e. canis antibodies were detected by ifat.
in the follow-up, seroprevalence was  <dig>  % by elisa,  <dig>  % by ifat,  <dig>  % by dpp test, and  <dig>  % for e. canis.
most of the individuals infected in latin america are in brazil.
a follow-up was conducted in dogs that were positive in the elisa at the baseline study.
