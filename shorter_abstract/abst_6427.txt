using a playback experiment, we presented bucks with groans that had been manipulated to alter vocal cues to these male characteristics and compared the response to the same, non-modified  groans.
mammal vocal parameters such as fundamental frequency  and formant dispersion often provide information about quality traits of the producer , suggesting that they are sexually selected.
we found that bucks treated groans with lowered fo , and lowered formant frequencies  as more threatening.
by contrast, groans with raised formant frequencies , and shorter durations  were treated as less threatening.
groan parameters are linked to caller dominance, body size and condition, suggesting that groans are the product of sexual selection.
we experimentally examined the ability of bucks to utilise putative cues to dominance , body size  and condition , when assessing competitors.
our results indicate that intrasexual selection is driving groans to concurrently convey caller dominance, body size and condition.

they represent the first experimental demonstration of the importance of fo in male competition in non-human mammals, and show that bucks have advanced perception abilities that allow them to extract information based on relatively small changes in key parameters.
however, little experimental evidence exists demonstrating the importance of these cues in intrasexual competition, particularly fo.
