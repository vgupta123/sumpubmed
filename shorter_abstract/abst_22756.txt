this technique is advantageous in situations where a cdna library with complete but equalized representation of transcribed sequences, whether polyadenylated or not, is desired.
libraries were prepared from partially degraded  total rna from three different species.
we describe a simple method for making high-quality, directional, random-primed, cdna libraries from small amounts of degraded total rna.
abundant mrnas were less frequent in the self-subtracted libraries compared to a non-subtracted mrna library.
sequencing random clones from the libraries showed that 87% of clones were in the forward orientation with respect to known or predicted transcripts.
a restriction endonuclease site was added to the 3' end during first-strand synthesis using a directional random-priming technique.
70% matched identified or predicted translated rnas in the sequence databases.
the transcribed sequences of a cell, the transcriptome, represent the trans-acting fraction of the genetic information, yet eukaryotic cdna libraries are typically made from only the poly-adenylated fraction.
