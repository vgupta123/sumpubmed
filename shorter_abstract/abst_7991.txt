gene ontology  and kegg pathway analyses indicated seven reliable metabolic pathways are altered in the mutant, including carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids.
the external colour of fruit is a crucial quality feature, and the external coloration of most citrus fruits is due to the accumulation of carotenoids.
in this work, an orange-pericarp mutant  which showed altered pigmentation in the pericarp was used to identify genes potentially related to the regulation of carotenoid accumulation in the pericarp.
high performance liquid chromatography  analysis revealed that the pericarp from mt fruits had a  <dig> -fold increase of β-carotene content over that of the wild type .
the molecular regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in pericarp is limited due to the lack of mutant.
interpretation of differentially expressed genes  revealed new insight into the molecular regulation of β-carotene accumulation in the mt pericarp.
rna-seq analysis of the transcriptome revealed extensive changes in the mt gene expression level, with  <dig> genes down-regulated and  <dig> genes up-regulated.
the transcription factors and genes corresponding to effected metabolic pathways may involved in the carotenoid regulation was confirmed by the qrt-pcr analysis in the mt pericarp.
quantitative real-time pcr  analysis showed that the expression of all downstream carotenogenic genes was lower in mt than in wt, suggesting that down-regulation is critical for the β-carotene increase in the mt pericarp.
