the distribution of taxa was significantly clustered by diet and by phylogenetic group.
here, we tested the ic model in a large selection of taxa from diverse extant and fossil mammalian groups, ranging from the middle jurassic  to the recent.
tooth morphology offers an excellent model system for such ‘evo-devo’ studies, because teeth are well preserved in the fossil record, and are commonly used in phylogenetic analyses and as ecological proxies.
results show that most taxa  fell within the predicted areas of the inhibitory cascade model.
derived from experimental data, the ic model suggests that a balance between mesenchymal activators and molar-derived inhibitors determines the size of the immediately posterior molar, predicting firstly that molars either decrease in size along the tooth row, or increase in size, or are all of equal size, and secondly that the second lower molar should occupy one third of lower molar area.
overall, the ic model was supported as a plesiomorphic developmental system for mammalia, suggesting that mammal tooth size has been subjected to this developmental constraint at least since the divergence of australosphenidans and boreosphenidans approximately  <dig> ma.
moreover, tooth development is relatively well studied, and has provided several testable hypotheses of developmental influences on macroevolutionary patterns.
