verifying protein identity using robust protein characterization is critical to avoid false biomarker discovery when using commercial elisa kits.
our objective was to determine if circulating sirpa levels can serve as a biomarker of cardiac injury in children undergoing open heart surgery.
paired pre- and post-operative serum samples from  <dig> pediatric patients undergoing open heart surgery and from  <dig> pediatric patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery  were tested for sirpa protein levels using commercially available sirpa elisa kits from two manufacturers.
human tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1α  is a surface marker identified in cardiomyocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells.
to verify the identity of the protein detected, recombinant human sirpa protein  was tested on both elisa kits.
we conclude that commercially available elisa kits for sirpa give false-positive results.
post-operative sirpa concentrations were significantly higher in patients after cardiac surgery compared to non-cardiac surgery when tested using sirpa elisa kits from both manufacturers.
the calibrator from both elisa kits was analyzed by western blot as well as by mass spectrometry .
ms analysis of calibrators from both elisa kits identified several inflammatory markers and albumin but no sirpa was detected.

western blot analysis of calibrators from both kits did not identity sirpa.
