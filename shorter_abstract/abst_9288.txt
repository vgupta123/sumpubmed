although little is known about the interplay between these mortality types, hunting of predators remains a common management strategy aimed at reducing predator-human conflict.
accounting for human density and habitat productivity, human hunting pressure during or before the year of conflict comprised the most important variables.
although only providing correlative evidence, such patterns over large geographic and temporal scales suggest that alternative approaches to conflict mitigation might yield more effective outcomes for humans as well as cougar populations and the individuals within populations.
both were associated with increased male cougar-human conflict.
overexploitation and persecution of large carnivores resulting from conflict with humans comprise major causes of declines worldwide.
