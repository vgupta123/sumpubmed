a total of  <dig> samples, including  <dig> from dead piglets,  <dig> from seriously sick fattening pigs and  <dig> from abortion sows, were collected from different animal hospitals or pig farms from  <dig> different cities in henan .
the results of the present study revealed that t. gondii infection is present in swine in henan and is a potential source of foodborne toxoplasmosis in the investigated areas.
the results show that the toxodb # <dig> genotype may be the dominant t. gondii lineage in mainland china.
of all samples, thirty-four were positive for the t. gondii b <dig> gene  from four cities, including  <dig> from nanyang city, one  from xinyang city, one  from zhengzhou city and one  from zhoukou city.
among livestock, pigs are susceptible to t. gondii infection.
implementation of effective control measures for t. gondii to reduce the chance of zoonotic toxoplasmosis spreading from pig farms may be warranted.
the presence of the t. gondii b <dig> gene was detected using nested polymerase chain reactions .
this is the first large-scale survey molecularly characterizing t. gondii from pigs in henan.
these findings strengthen the limited chinese t. gondii epidemiology database.
therefore, we molecularly characterized dna samples from pigs in henan.
dna was extracted from  <dig> to 5Â g of the most severely affected pig tissue  after postmortem examination.
toxoplasma gondii, a widely prevalent protozoan parasite, causes serious toxoplasmosis infections in humans and other animals.
