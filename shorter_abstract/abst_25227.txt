our target predictions indicated that the  <dig> grain filling-associated mirnas might target a set of wheat genes involved in various biological processes, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, transcription, cellular transport, cell organization and biogenesis, stress responses, signal transduction, and phytohormone signaling.
together, these results demonstrate that the developmental steps by which wheat grains are filled is correlated with mirna-mediated gene regulatory networks.
our dataset provides a useful resource for investigating mirna-mediated regulatory mechanisms in cereal grains, and our results suggest that mirnas contribute to this regulation during a crucial phase in determining grain yield and flour quality.
here, we applied high-throughput srna sequencing and genome-wide mining to identify mirnas potentially involved in the developmental regulation of wheat grains.
we identified  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas from wheat grains.
micrornas  are a class of regulatory small rnas  that down-regulate target genes by mrna degradation or translational repression.
evidence is increasing for their crucial roles during plant development.
however, little is known about mirna-mediated developmental regulation of grain production.
additionally,  <dig> novel mirnas  were identified, with  <dig> of them also potentially related to that maturation process.
