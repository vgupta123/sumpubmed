if the literature provides a reasonable reflection of the incidence of repeated evolution in nature, our findings suggest that natural selection can overcome contingent effects to an extent, but it depends heavily on the aspect of the phenotype targeted by selection.
a key source of evidence that present-day selection can override historically contingent effects comes from the repeated evolution of similar adaptations in different taxa.
whether natural selection can erase the imprint of past evolutionary history from phenotypes has been a topic of much debate.
yet classic examples of repeated evolution are often among closely related taxa, suggesting the likelihood that similar adaptations evolve is contingent on the length of time separating taxa.
