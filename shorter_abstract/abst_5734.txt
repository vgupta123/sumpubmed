totally, we discovered  <dig> integrated cnvrs, with more “loss” events than both “gain” and “both” ones, and clearly clustered them into three cattle groups.
finally, we confirmed  <dig> cnvrs in  <dig> chosen ones by using quantitative pcr, and further demonstrated that cnvr <dig> had significantly negative effects on expression of pla2g2d gene, and both cnvr <dig> and cnvr <dig> were associated with body measurements in chinese cattle, suggesting their key effects on gene expression and cattle traits.
this study provides a highly valuable resource for chinese cattle’s evolution and breeding researches.
we identified  <dig> copy number variable regions , covering  <dig> % of the bovine genome, in  <dig> taurine , together with  <dig> ones in  <dig> yaks  and  <dig> ones in  <dig> buffaloes .
the results advanced our understanding of cnv as an important genomic structural variation in taurine, yak and buffalo.
copy number variations  are a main source of genomic structural variations underlying animal evolution and production traits.
furthermore, we confirmed approximately  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  cnvrs span cattle genes and quantitative trait loci , respectively.
here, with one pure-blooded angus bull as reference, we describe a genome-wide analysis of cnvs based on comparative genomic hybridization arrays in  <dig> chinese domesticated bulls and examined their effects on gene expression and cattle growth traits.
