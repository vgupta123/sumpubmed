the high sequence variation in the corresponding hctb gene enables phylogenetic analysis and provides a suitable target for the genotyping of c. trachomatis.
this study shows that the size variation is due to different numbers of 36-amino acid long repetitive elements built up of five pentamers and one hexamer.
the size variation of hc <dig> has previously been attributed to deletions of pentamers but we show that the structure is more complex with both duplication and deletions of 36-amino acid long elements.
a protein with similar structure has been described in bordetella but was now also found in other genera, including burkholderia, herminiimonas, minibacterium and ralstonia.
deletions and amino acid substitutions result in  <dig> variants of repetitive elements and these elements are combined into  <dig> configurations.
a more complex structure was seen in this study when sequences from  <dig> specimens covering the hctb gene, which encodes hc <dig>  were compared.
sequence determination resulted in  <dig> hctb variants that formed four clades in phylogenetic analysis.
the polymorphisms in hc <dig> need to be further investigated in experimental studies since dna binding is essential for the unique biphasic life cycle of the chlamydiacae.
the histone-like protein hc <dig> binds dna in chlamydia trachomatis and is known to vary in size between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, which is caused by different numbers of lysine-rich pentamers.
strains causing the eye disease trachoma and strains causing invasive lymphogranuloma venereum infections formed separate clades, while strains from urogenital infections were more heterogeneous.
