it allows to conveniently perform network inference from longitudinal high-throughput data using two different sampling based network structure search algorithms.
cancer cell lines can be used as model systems to study the cellular response to drug treatments in a time-resolved way.
network inference from high-throughput data has become an important means of current analysis of biological systems.
we present the r-package 'ddepn' that implements our recent approach on network reconstruction from longitudinal data generated after external perturbation of network components.
we extend our approach by two novel methods: a markov chain monte carlo method for sampling network structures with two edge types  and an extension of a prior model that penalises deviances from a given reference network while incorporating these two types of edges.
