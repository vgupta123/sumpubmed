recently, there are an increasing number of methods being developed with focus on the structural alignments for finding conserved secondary structures as well as common structural motifs in pair-wise or multiple sequences.
many rnas have evolutionarily conserved secondary structures instead of primary sequences.
these results indicate that rscan is a preferable choice for real-life application of searching structural similarities for structured rnas in large databases.
a challenging task is to search similar structures quickly for structured rna sequences in large genomic databases since existing methods are too slow to be used in large databases.
remarkably, rscan can handle large database queries, taking less than  <dig> minutes for searching similar structures for a microrna precursor in human chromosome  <dig>
