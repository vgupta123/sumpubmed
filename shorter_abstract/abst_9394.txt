these genes are thought to evolve in a concerted fashion, with high rates of homogenization of gene copies.
we believe that 5s rdna molecular evolution in fish genomes is driven by a mixed mechanism that integrates birth-and-death and concerted evolution.
clustered multiple copies of 5s rdna variants could have arisen due to unequal crossing over mechanisms.
however, the majority of previous analyses regarding the evolutionary process of rdna repeats were conducted in invertebrates and plants.
the recent identification of divergent 5s rrna gene paralogs in the genomes of elasmobranches and teleost fishes indicate that the eukaryotic 5s rrna gene family has a more complex genomic organization than previously thought.
we identified two variant classes of 5s rdna sequences in the genomes of potamotrygonidae stingrays, similar to the genomes of other vertebrates.
one class of 5s rrna genes was shared only by elasmobranches.
the availability of new sequence data from lower vertebrates such as teleosts and elasmobranches enables an enhanced evolutionary characterization of 5s rdna among vertebrates.
