the r code of the method is available at http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~tyu8/glfd.
here we test the hypothesis that unobserved factors can be mobilized by the living system to coordinate the response to the clinical factors.
we developed a computational method named guided latent factor discovery  to identify hidden factors that act in combination with the observed clinical factors to control gene modules.
using real microarray data, we demonstrate that the method identifies latent factors that are biologically relevant, and extracts more information than analyzing only the first-order response to the clinical outcome.
finding latent factors using glfd brings extra insight into the mechanisms of the disease/drug response.
in the analysis of high-throughput data with a clinical outcome, researchers mostly focus on genes/proteins that show first-order relations with the clinical outcome.
