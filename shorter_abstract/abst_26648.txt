studies concerning transcriptional regulation of mirnas have so far concentrated on those located within the intergenic region of the genome and the search for putative promoters, thus leaving open the question of the existence of possible regulatory elements common to all mirnas including those located in introns of protein coding genes.
in addition, this motif was observed to be most abundant in the upstream sequences of two important mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  this abundance was also conserved in phylogenetically distant species including human and mouse.
this data provides important knowledge for the identification and computational prediction of mirna sequences.
the results show that the motif gannnnga is conserved close to mirna precursor start sites, suggesting that it may be involved in mirna sequence recognition or regulation.
we discovered a previously unknown sequence motif gannnnga that displayed a conserved distribution in the nematode worms caenorhabditis elegans and caenorhabditis briggsae.
in this study, we initially searched for motifs occurring in the area  <dig> bp upstream from all mirnas independent of their genomic location.
