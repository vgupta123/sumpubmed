we observed that swarming was related to both carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as mineral salts base.
large effects of mineral content on swarming were seen with tyrosine and methionine as nitrogen sources.
swarming on other carbon sources was generally only observed using m <dig> salts mineral base.
rapid swarming was observed on malic acid, d-sorbitol, casamino acids, and succinate.
we also demonstrated that the wetting agent reduces the surface tension of the agar.
nitrogen source tests using succinate as carbon source demonstrated two distinct forms of swarming, with very different macroscopic swarm characteristics.
rapid swarming was observed when ammonium ion was provided as nitrogen source, as well as when histidine, tryptophan, or glycine was provided.
the amount of biofilm as measured by crystal violet retention was dependent on carbon source, but not nitrogen source.
surface motility was observed on minimal defined agar plates with  <dig> % agarose, similar in nature to swarming motility identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  we examined this motility under several culture conditions, including inhibition of flagellar motility using congo red.
filamentous growth in the biofilm depends on shear stress, and is enhanced by continuous input of nutrients in chemostat culture.
variovorax paradoxus is an aerobic soil bacterium frequently associated with important biodegradative processes in nature.
our group has cultivated a mucoid strain of variovorax paradoxus for study as a model of bacterial development and response to environmental conditions.
our studies have established that the beta-proteobacterium variovorax paradoxus displays a number of distinct physiologies when grown on surfaces, indicative of a complex response to several growth parameters.
