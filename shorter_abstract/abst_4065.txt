in this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors , chemokine receptors  and death receptor ligands in sars-cov infected dcs.
our results demonstrates that sars-cov did not modulate tlr- <dig> to tlr- <dig> gene expression but significantly induced the expression of ccr- <dig>  ccr- <dig>  and ccr- <dig>  there was also strong induction of tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand , but not fas ligand gene expression in sars-cov infected dcs.
these findings may explain the increased lung infiltrations and lymphoid depletion in sars patients.
the upregulation of chemokines and ccrs may facilitate dc migration from the infection site to the lymph nodes, whereas the increase of trail may induce lymphocyte apoptosis.
the sars outbreak in  <dig> provides a unique opportunity for the study of human responses to a novel virus.
interestingly, the expressions of most genes studied were higher in cb dcs than adult dcs.
we also compared adult and cord blood  dcs to find a possible explanation for the age-dependent severity of sars.
we have previously reported that dendritic cells  might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for sars-cov.
