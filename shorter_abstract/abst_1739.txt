we extracted des from eleven disparate biomedical sources.
our study suggests that the integration of biomedical sources can be achieved automatically with limited precision and largely facilitated by mapping des to terminological resources.
<dig> % of the  <dig> des studied are mapped to entries of a terminological resource and  <dig> % of the whole set can be associated with reference des.
we compared these des to concepts and/or terms in biomedical controlled vocabularies and to reference des.
we also exploited de values to disambiguate underspecified des and to identify additional mappings.
we combine schema- and instance-based approaches to mapping des to terminological resources in order to facilitate data sources integration.
data elements  in particular play an important role in data integration.
data integration is a crucial task in the biomedical domain and integrating data sources is one approach to integrating data.
