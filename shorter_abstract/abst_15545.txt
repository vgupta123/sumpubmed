we analyze all possible pairs of  <dig> vertebrate tfs from the jaspar database.
tissue-specific gene expression is generally regulated by combinatorial interactions among transcription factors  which bind to the dna.
the findings from this study indicate that tissue-specific gene expression is regulated by one or two central regulators and a large number of tfs interacting with these central hubs.
we provide a prediction of interacting tfs in  <dig> human tissues based on their dna-binding affinity in promoter regions.
our candidates are validated by both known protein-protein interactions  and known gene regulation mechanisms in the selected tissue.
our results are in agreement with recent experimental studies.
first, all human promoter regions are scanned for single tf-dna binding affinities with trap and for each tf a ranked list of all promoters ordered by the binding affinity is created.
despite this known fact, previous discoveries of the mechanism that controls gene expression usually consider only a single tf.
