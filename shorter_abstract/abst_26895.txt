behavioral changes and electrophysiological measures suggest striatal dysfunction in ihip14
many palmitoylated proteins and pats have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, including huntington disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimer disease, and x-linked intellectual disability.
hip <dig> hypomorphic mice have behavioral and synaptic deficits.
prior to death the mice exhibit motor deficits, increased escape response during tests of anxiety, anhedonia, a symptom indicative of depressive-like behavior, and striatal synaptic deficits, including reduced probability of transmitter release and increased amplitude but decreased frequency of spontaneous post-synaptic currents.
palmitoylation, the addition of palmitate to proteins by palmitoyl acyltransferases , is an important regulator of synaptic protein localization and function.
however, the phenotype is developmental; thus, a model of post-developmental loss of hip <dig> was generated to examine the role of hip <dig> in synaptic function in the adult.
ten weeks after hip <dig> deletion , mice die suddenly from rapidly progressive paralysis.
the mice also have increased brain weight due to microgliosis and astrogliosis in the cortex.
these data suggest that hip <dig> is essential for maintenance of life and neuronal integrity in the adult mouse.
hip14/dhhc <dig> is the most conserved pat that palmitoylates many synaptic proteins.
Δ/Δ mice, and increased cortical volume due to astrogliosis and microgliosis suggests a novel role for hip <dig> in glia.
