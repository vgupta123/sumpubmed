the canadian council on animal care and american veterinary medical association classify intraperitoneal  pentobarbital as an acceptable euthanasia method in rats.
however, national guidelines do not exist for a recommended dose or volume and ip euthanasia has been described as unreliable, with misinjections leading to variable success in ensuring a timely death.
both dose and volume contribute to speed of death, with a dose of  <dig> mg/kg  being the most effective method.
video recordings of ll and hh groups were analyzed for pain-associated behaviors.
between-group comparisons were performed with 1-way anova and games-howell post hoc tests.
the aims of this study were to assess and improve efficacy and consistency of ip euthanasia.
