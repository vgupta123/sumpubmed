spatial normalization can potentially rescue thousands of snps in a genetic study at the small cost of computational time.
it is likely that such artifacts affect many snp arrays, but the normalization methods used in currently available genotyping algorithms make no attempt at spatial bias correction.
here, we propose an effective single-chip spatial bias removal procedure for affymetrix  <dig>  snp arrays or platforms with similar design features.
microarray measurements are susceptible to a variety of experimental artifacts, some of which give rise to systematic biases that are spatially dependent in a unique way on each chip.
