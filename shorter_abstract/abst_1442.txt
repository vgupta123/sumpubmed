rayts of both studied bacterial groups are monophyletic, and their cognate reps show species-specific characteristics, suggesting shared evolutionary history of reps, rayts and their hosts.
we analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of particular rep classes in genomic sequences of sixty-three bacterial strains belonging to the pseudomonas fluorescens species complex and ten strains of stenotrophomonas sp., in order to assess intraspecific rep diversity and to gain insight into long-term rep evolution.
based on proximity to rayt  genes, twenty-two and thirteen unique rep classes were determined in fluorescent pseudomonads and stenotrophomonads, respectively.
the abundances of rep classes roughly followed host strainsÂ´ phylogeny, differing markedly among individual clades.
high abundances of particular rep classes appeared to depend on the presence of the cognate rayt gene, and deviations from this state could be attributed to recent or ancient mutations of rayt-flanking reps, or rayt loss.
reps of fluorescent pseudomonads were generally more numerous, occurring in hundreds or even over a thousand perfect copies of particular rep class per genome.
the results of our large-scale analysis show that rep elements constitute intriguingly dynamic components of genomes of fluorescent pseudomonads and stenotrophomonads, and indicate that rep diversification and proliferation are ongoing processes.
in stenotrophomonads, rep elements were typically found in tens or a few hundred copies per genome.
rep elements in these bacteria represent a suitable platform to study the interplay between repeated elements, their mobilizers and host bacterial cells.
rep sequences showed highly heterogeneous distribution.
