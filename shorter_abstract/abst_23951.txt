the empirical experiments in real biological data reveal that the recommended seeds show consequently good performance.
in order to accelerate and be efficient the oligonucleotide design process, one of widely used approach is the prescreening unreliable regions using a hashing  algorithm.
because blat seeding algorithm and vector seeding algorithm give poor scores in specificity and efficiency, we conclude that these algorithms are not adequate to design oligos.
we also propose a software package which enables the users to get the adequate seeds under their own experimental conditions.
consequently, we recommend spaced seeds or transition-constrained seeds with 15~ <dig> weight in order to design oligos with the length of  <dig> mer.
as the result, the spaced seed is recorded as the most efficient discriminative seed for oligo design.
our proposed measures are originally designed to be used for oligo design but we expect that our study will be helpful to the other genomic tasks.
oligonucleotide design is known as a time-consuming work in bioinformatics.
since the seeding algorithm is originally proposed to increase sensitivity for local alignment, the specificity should be considered as well as the sensitivity for the oligonucleotide design problem.
to evaluate the proposed measures, we examine five seeding algorithms in oligonucleotide design.
however, a measure of evaluating the seeds regarding how adequate and efficient they are in the oligo design is not yet proposed.
one is that our study can be applied to the oligo design programs in order to improve the performance by suggesting the experiment-specific seeds.
