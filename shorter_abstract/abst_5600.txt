transient knockdown of annexin a <dig> in cardiomyocytes by shrna significantly enhances the contractile functions but does not affect the z-band architecture, as revealed by α-actinin immunostaining in shrna treated cells.
in overall, the present study demonstrated for the first time that annexin a <dig> physically interacts with sarcomeric α-actinin and alters contractility of cardiomyocytes suggesting that it might play important role in excitation and contraction process.
double immunofluorescent staining of cardiomyocytes with anti annexin a <dig> and anti sarcomeric α-actinin antibodies showed perfect co-localization of these two proteins with annexin a <dig> appearing like a component of sarcomere.
annexins are calcium dependent phospholipid binding proteins that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and implicated in various extra- and intracellular processes.
conflicting reports from transgenic mice overexpressing annexin a <dig> or null mice lacking annexin a <dig> showed imbalances in intracellular calcium turnover and disturbed cardiac contractility.
to identify the putative binding partners of annexin a <dig> in the heart, ventricular extracts were subjected to glutathione s-transferase - annexin a <dig> pull down assay and the gst- annexin a <dig> bound proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.
in myocardial tissue, annexins a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are particularly abundant, of which the expression levels of annexin a <dig> has been found to be maximal.
