pyrethroid resistance in southern africa probably has multiple origins under different evolutionary forces, which may necessitate the design of different resistance management strategies.
pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector anopheles funestus is rapidly expanding across southern africa.
genome-wide microarray-based transcriptional profiling and qrt-pcr revealed that the cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp6m <dig> is responsible for extending pyrethroid resistance northwards.
transgenic expression of cyp6m <dig> in drosophila melanogaster coupled with in vitro assays using recombinant enzymes and assessments of kinetic properties demonstrated that cyp6m <dig> is as efficient as cyp6p9a and cyp6p9b in conferring pyrethroid resistance.
funestus population at the northern range of the resistance front.
polymorphism patterns demonstrate that these genes are under contrasting selection forces: the exceptionally diverse cyp6m <dig> likely evolves neutrally, whereas cyp6p9a and cyp6p9b are directionally selected.
here, we established the resistance profile of a zambian an.
similar to other southern african populations, zambian an.
funestus mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids and carbamate, but in contrast to populations in mozambique and malawi, these insects are also ddt resistant.
indeed, cyp6m <dig> is more over-expressed in zambia  than cyp6p9a  and cyp6p9b , whereas cyp6p9a and cyp6p9b are more highly over-expressed in malawi and mozambique.
it remains unknown whether this resistance has a unique origin with the same molecular basis or is multifactorial.
