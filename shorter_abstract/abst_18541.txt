our data suggest conservation of alternative splicing to regulate subcellular distribution of methionine sulfoxide reductases.
the third alternative form lacked the active site and could not be functional.
in the present study, we identified and characterized alternatively spliced forms of mammalian msra.
msra was enzymatically active and was present in cytosol and nucleus in transfected cells, but occurred below detection limits in tested mouse tissues.
in addition to the previously known variant containing an n-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide and distributed between mitochondria and cytosol, a second mouse and human form was detected in silico.
in mammals, a single msra gene is known, however, its product is present in cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria.
there are two enzymes that reduce stereospecifically oxidized methionine residues: msra  and msrb .
methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important protein repair pathway that protects against oxidative stress, controls protein function and has a role in regulation of aging.
