the implications for the emergence of different motif topologies in complex networks are outlined.
our analysis allows to determine unambiguously the relationship between motif topology and the set of potentially implementable functions.
network motifs are recurrent interaction patterns, which are significantly more often encountered in biological interaction graphs than expected from random nets.
