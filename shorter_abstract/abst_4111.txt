seamote is a fast, accurate and flexible algorithm for the identification of sequence patterns involved in protein-dna and protein-rna recognition.
seamote shows an average accuracy of 80% in finding discriminative motifs and outperforms other methods available in literature.
we applied our method to recently published data including  <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation  and  <dig> crosslinking immunoprecipitation  experiments and compared our results with those of other well-established motif discovery tools.
the large amount of data produced by high-throughput sequencing poses new computational challenges.
here, we introduce the seamote  algorithm for discovery of regulatory regions in nucleic acid sequences.
