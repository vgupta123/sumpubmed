given the high heterogeneity of hbv strains and the sensitivity towards sequences changes of sirna, finding a potent sirna inhibitor against the conservative site on the hbv genome is essential to ensure a therapeutic application.
hbv  <dig> -fold genome plasmids carrying various genotypes were co-transfected with shrna plasmids into either huh <dig> cells or mice.
forty short hairpin rna  expression plasmids were constructed to target conserved regions among nine hbv genotypes.
four  were found with the ability to potently inhibit hbv rna, dna, surface antigen , e antigen  and core antigen  expression in hbv genotypes a, b, c, d and i  in huh <dig> cells and in mice.
such sirna suggests an alternate way of inhibiting various hbv genotypes in vitro and in vivo, promising advances in the treatment of hbv.
the levels of various viral markers were examined to assess the anti-hbv efficacy of sirna.
