in the present study, participants viewed simultaneously presented line drawings at peripheral locations, while in the mri scanner.
less is known about the neural representation of distractor stimuli beyond visual areas, and the interactions between stimuli in linguistic processing areas.
neuroimaging studies of attention often focus on interactions between stimulus representations and top-down selection mechanisms in visual cortex.
attention was directed either at the linguistic properties of one of these pictures, or at the fixation point .
this implies that selective attention to a specific location does not completely filter out the representations of distractor stimuli at early perceptual stages.
under some circumstances, the name of ignored distractor pictures is retrieved by linguistic areas.
phonological representations of unattended pictures could be detected in the posterior superior temporal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the insula.
