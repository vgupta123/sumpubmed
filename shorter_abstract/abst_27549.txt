phenotypic analysis of this new germplasm resource revealed considerable variation in flowering time, seed size, and plant architecture.
the inbreeding nature of brachypodium was confirmed by an extremely high level of homozygosity in wild plants and a lack of cross-pollination under laboratory conditions.
to characterize the natural diversity of brachypodium and provide a valuable new tool to the growing list of resources available to brachypodium researchers, we created and characterized a large, diverse collection of inbred lines.
the resources developed in this study are freely available to the research community and will facilitate experimental applications based on natural diversity.
taken together, the inbreeding nature and genotypic diversity observed at individual locations suggest a significant amount of long-distance seed dispersal.
brachypodium distachyon  is rapidly emerging as a powerful model system to facilitate research aimed at improving grass crops for grain, forage and energy production.
an analysis of  <dig> diploid lines from  <dig> locations with  <dig> ssr markers showed considerable genotypic diversity.
there was some correlation between ssr genotypes and broad geographic regions, but there was also a high level of genotypic diversity at individual locations.
