nine unique regions were detected when compared with other published brassica mitochondrial genome sequences.
we analyzed the unique regions of every genome of the brassica family, and found that very few segments were specific for these six mitotypes, especially cam, jun, and ole, which have no specific segments at all.
the introgressed segment orf <dig> from the mitochondrial genome of radish  to its counterpart in rapeseed  demonstrates that this inheritance mode derives from the cytoplasm of both parents.
sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of five species from brassica family allowed the prediction of other extraneous sources of the cybrids from the radish parent, and the determination of their mitochondrial rearrangement.
we obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of ogura-cms-cybrid  rapeseed.
to date, this is the first time that a heterogeneously composed mitochondrial genome was sequenced.
this mitotype noticeably holds two copies of atp <dig> and is devoid of cox2- <dig>  relative to nap mitochondrial genome,  <dig> point mutations were scattered in the  <dig> protein-coding genes.
the mitochondrial genome of oguc is quite divergent from nap and pol, which are more similar with each other.
compared with the chloroplast genome, six identical regions were found in the seven mitochondrial genomes, which show that the brassica family has a stable chloroplast-derived source.
the rearrangement of the  <dig> syntenic regions that comprised  <dig> % of the genome was influenced by short repeats.
unlike maternal inheritance of mitochondria in sexual reproduction, somatic hybrids follow no obvious pattern.
therefore, we conclude that the most specific regions of oguc possibly came from radish.
a pair of large repeats  was responsible for the multipartite structure.
