cilia were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and many proteins involved in cilia function have been conserved through eukaryotic diversification.
we interrogate this genomic dataset to identify proteins with a predicted ancestral ciliary role that have been maintained in non-ciliated land plants.
remarkably, many genes with an ancestral ciliary role are maintained in non-ciliated land plants.
here we identify a core set of proteins with an inferred ciliary function that are conserved in ciliated eukaryotic species.
during these evolutionary losses, proteins with ancestral ciliary functions may be lost or co-opted into different functions.
a large number of proteins possess a phylogenetic ciliary profile indicative of ciliary function.
eukaryotic cilia are complex, highly conserved microtubule-based organelles with a broad phylogenetic distribution.
the phylogenetic distribution of these genes within the land plants indicates evolutionary scenarios of either sub- or neo-functionalisation and expression data analysis shows that these genes are highly expressed in arabidopsis thaliana pollen cells.
however, cilia have also been lost multiple times in different lineages, with at least two losses occurring within the land plants.
