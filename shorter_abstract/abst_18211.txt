it supports the rejection of low quality cdnas and helps in the selection of likely novel splice variants, and/or completely novel transcripts for new experiments.
caftan is built around the mapping of cdnas to the genome assembly, and the subsequent analysis of their genomic context.
to this end we have developed a new high-throughput analysis tool, caftan, which simplifies these efforts and thus fills the gap between large-scale cdna collections and their systematic annotation and application in functional genomics.
we think that it is a very useful program for the annotation and research of unfinished genomes.
it identified as good  <dig>  % of the single exon cdnas and  <dig> % of the multiple exon cdnas.
caftan is a high-throughput sequence analysis tool, which performs a fast and reliable quality prediction of cdnas.
several thousands of cdnas can be analyzed in a short time, giving the curator/scientist a first quick overview about the quality and the already existing annotation of a set of cdnas.
the evaluation of caftan showed that is able to correctly classify more than 85% of  <dig> selected "known protein-coding" vega cdnas as high quality multi- or single-exon.
this provides detailed information about overlapping exons and the structural classification of cdnas with respect to the reference set of splice variants.
all these features are evaluated in individual tests and classify cdnas according to their sequence quality and likelihood to have been generated from fully processed mrnas.
it uses sequence features like the presence and type of polya signals, inner and flanking repeats, the gc-content, splice site types, etc.
the german cdna consortium has been cloning full length cdnas and continued with their exploitation in protein localization experiments and cellular assays.
additionally, caftan compares the coordinates of mapped cdnas with the genomic coordinates of reference sets from public available resources .
