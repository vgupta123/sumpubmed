we establish their roles in carbon metabolism, stress adaptation, cell wall synthesis, transporter efflux, peroxisomal metabolism, phospholipid synthesis, rrna processing, and nuclear/mtdna replication.

therefore, microarray analysis was used to provide this information for each tr mutant.
to identify transcriptional regulators  of goa <dig>  we screened a c. albicans tf knockout library  and identified rbf1p, hfl1p, and dpb4p as positive trs of goa <dig>  the phenotypes of each mutant  are reasonable evidence for their required roles especially in mitochondrial functions.
the trs regulate a number of common genes but each also regulates specific gene transcription.
while the integration of mitochondria with cell metabolic activities is presumed to occur, there is minimal information on this subject at the genome level.
