compared with previous approaches, metaphyler is much more accurate in estimating the phylogenetic composition.
we have introduced a novel taxonomic classification method for analyzing the microbial diversity from whole-metagenome shotgun sequences.
one major limitation of prior computational methods used for this purpose is the use of a universal classification threshold for all genes at all taxonomic levels.
the most popular approach relies on 16s rrna sequencing, however this approach can generate biased estimates due to differences in the copy number of the gene between even closely related organisms, and due to pcr artifacts.
we also present interesting results by analyzing a real metagenomic dataset.
we present a novel taxonomic classifier metaphyler , which uses phylogenetic marker genes as a taxonomic reference.
we propose that better classification results can be obtained by tuning the taxonomic classifier to each matching length, reference gene, and taxonomic level.
results on simulated datasets demonstrate that metaphyler outperforms other tools commonly used in this context .
a major goal of metagenomics is to characterize the microbial composition of an environment.
in addition, we have shown that metaphyler can be used to guide the discovery of novel organisms from metagenomic samples.
