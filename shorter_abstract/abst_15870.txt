genetic analysis of the lac operons in the s. enterica genomes revealed that they all contain intact laci, lacz, and lacy genes.
in the present study, we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> lac + s. enterica isolates and characterized the lac region, comparing it to the lac region in other enteric bacterial species.
our results indicate that the lac region is highly mobile among enterobacteriaceae and demonstrate that the lac + s. enterica subsp.
enterica serovars acquired the lac region through parallel events.
classical bacteriological characteristics of salmonella enterica indicate that the members of this species are unable to utilize lactose as a carbon source.
interestingly, the s. enterica montevideo and s. enterica senftenberg isolates were found to harbor a plasmid with a high degree of sequence similarity to a plasmid from klebsiella pneumoniae strain nk <dig> that also harbors the lac operon.
molecular analyses of the  <dig> isolates revealed that the lac operon resided on a plasmid in some strains and in others was integrated into the bacterial chromosome.
in addition, two s. enterica tennessee isolates carried two copies of the lac operon.
the acquisition of the lac operon by several s. enterica serovars may be indicative of environmental adaptation by these bacteria.
however, laca was truncated in all of the s. enterica subsp.
phylogenetic analysis based on lacizy gene sequences determines distinct clusters, and reveals a greater correlation between lacizy sequence and flanking organization than with either bacterial species or genomic location.
enterica isolates, encoding a  <dig> amino acid peptide rather than the full length  <dig> amino acid laca protein.
