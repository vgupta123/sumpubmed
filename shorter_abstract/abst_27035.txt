in addition, those nutrients had a positive influence on genes affecting longevity and the production of some antimicrobial peptides.
however, varroa parasitism caused the development of viral populations and a decrease in metabolism, specifically by inhibiting protein metabolism essential to bee health.
in honey bees , pollen, which is the main dietary source of proteins, amino acids and lipids, is essential to adult bee physiological development while reducing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen's nutritive impact on honey bee health remained to be determined.
comparing the transcriptome of bees fed with pollen and sugar and bees restricted to a sugar diet, we found that pollen activates nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways.
for that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan.
this harmful effect was not reversed by pollen intake.
the dge-tag profiling methods used in this study proved to be a powerful means for analyzing transcriptome variation related to nutrient intake in honey bees.
the  <dig> experimental groups  were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression  analysis on bee abdomens.
