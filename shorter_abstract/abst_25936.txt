the advanced models include context-specific independence mixtures, mixtures of dependence trees and semi-supervised learning.
mixtures are versatile and powerful statistical models which perform robustly for clustering in the presence of noise and have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications.
due to the general nature of the framework, pymix can be applied to a wide range of applications and data sets.
pymix - the python mixture package implements algorithms and data structures for clustering with basic and advanced mixture models.
cluster analysis is an important technique for the exploratory analysis of biological data.
pymix is a useful tool for cluster analysis of biological data.
