ct images were displayed in both bone and soft tissue windows.
individual anatomic structures were first recognised and labelled on the anatomic images and then matched on radiographs and ct images.
radiographic and ct images of the skull provided good detail of the bony structures in all species.
in ct contrast medium injection enabled good detail of the soft tissues to be obtained in the iguana whereas only the eye was clearly distinguishable from the remaining soft tissues in both the tegu and the bearded dragon.
transversal sections at 5â€‰mm intervals were obtained by means of an electric band-saw.
nevertheless, accurate interpretation of radiographic and ct studies requires a thorough knowledge of the gross and the cross-sectional anatomy.
the results provide an atlas of the normal anatomical and in vivo radiographic and computed tomographic features of the heads of lizards, and this may be useful in interpreting any imaging modality involving these species.
pre- and post- contrast computed tomographic studies of the head were performed on all the live animals.
<dig> adult green iguanas,  <dig> tegus,  <dig> bearded dragons, and, the adult cadavers of :  <dig> green iguana,  <dig> tegu,  <dig> bearded dragon were included in the study.
the aim of this study is to describe the normal cadaveric, radiographic and computed tomographic features of the heads of the green iguana, tegu and bearded dragon.
