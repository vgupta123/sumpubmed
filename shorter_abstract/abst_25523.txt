these tools include in general several image processing steps, the extraction of morphological descriptors, and the grouping of cells into phenotype classes according to their descriptors.
gene perturbation experiments in combination with fluorescence time-lapse cell imaging are a powerful tool in reverse genetics.
the automated detection of abnormal cell morphologies allows us to assign a phenotypic fingerprint to each gene knockdown.
we developed an unsupervised phenotyping approach based on hidden markov models  with multivariate gaussian emissions for the detection of knockdown-specific phenotypes in rnai time-lapse movies.
beyond the identification of genes whose knockdown affects cell morphology, phenotypic fingerprints can be used to find modules of functionally related genes.
by applying our method to the mitocheck database, we show that a phenotypic fingerprint is indicative of a geneâ€™s function.
