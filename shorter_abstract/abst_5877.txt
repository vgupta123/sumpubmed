using this metric, we also invent a node and edge betweenness based fast layout algorithm .
for a graph with n nodes, this approach reduces the expected runtime of the algorithm to o when considering edge crossings, and to o when considering only density and edge lengths.
we achieve a  <dig>  second runtime for a graph with  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges on a standard desktop computer.
furthermore, bfl reduces the runtime by combining a sequential insertion algorim with betweenness.
our bfl algorithm is compared against fast graph layout algorithms and approaches requiring intensive optimizations.
bfl places the high-betweenness nodes to optimal positions and allows the low-betweenness nodes to reach suboptimal positions.
for gene networks, we show that our algorithm is faster than all layout algorithms tested while providing readability on par with intensive optimization algorithms.
however, current graph layout algorithms for biological pathways are insensitive to biologically important information, e.g.
