using six snp-based assays designed to identify substructure within the italian clades, we surveyed a collection of  <dig> isolates and found that one clade predominates throughout endemic districts in the country, while the other two clades are more geographically restricted to portions of southern italy.
in italy, b. abortus has persisted in southern regions in both cattle and water buffalo.
previous attempts at analyzing the phylogenetics of b. abortus in italy have been challenging due to limited genetic variability and unresolved global population genetic structure of this pathogen.
we conducted genome-wide phylogenetic analyses on  <dig> representative strains of b. abortus from italy, and compared these sequences to a worldwide collection of publically available genomes.
italian isolates belong to three clades that are basal to the main and global b. abortus lineage.
although related strains exist worldwide, b. abortus isolates from italy are substantially different than those found in much of the rest of europe and north america, and are more closely related to strains from the middle east and asia.
natural infection in cattle is caused by brucella abortus and transmission typically occurs during abortions, calving, or nursing.
