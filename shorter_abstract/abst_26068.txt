anticancer drugs 5fu, docetaxel, cisplatin, and carboplatin were seen to inhibit growth of the cd44+cd117+ cells by 50% in the 2d culture with ic <dig> concentration, whereas, in the 3d culture, the four drugs inhibited the cell growth by only  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % at 3d one, respectively.
cancer stem cells  are thought to be capable of surviving conventional chemotherapeutic treatments because the cells have more resistant to anticancer drugs than common cancer cells.
in addition, anticancer drugs markedly increased the expression of abcg <dig> and abcb <dig> of cd44+cd117+cells in 3d culture.
the 3d culture provides a realistic model for study of the csc response to anticancer drugs.
the cd44+cd117+cells isolated from human epithelial ovarian cancer skov- <dig> cell line using magnetic-activated cell sorting were found to grow faster than the skov- <dig> cells in the 3d culture and in the nude mice.
effect of paclitaxel on the cd44+cd117+cell viability indicated that fewer cells underwent apoptosis in 3d culture than that in 2d one.
our assay demonstrated that human epithelial ovarian cancer cd44+cd117+cells possessed the properties of cscs that exhibited more chemoresistance in the 3d culture than that of in 2d one.
