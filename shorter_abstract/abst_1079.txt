by utilizing topological information to identify and mask blemishes prior to model based analyses, the method prevents artefacts from confounding the process of background correction, normalization, and summarization.
microarray scans show similar artefacts, which affect the analysis, particularly when one tries to detect subtle changes.
we present a method that harnesses the statistical power provided by having several hdonas available, which are obtained under similar conditions except for the experimental factor.
however, most blemishes are hard to find by the unaided eye, particularly in high-density oligonucleotide arrays .
