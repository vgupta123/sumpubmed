there is a need for software tools to annotate, query and share this data amongst researchers in different physical locations.
we have developed an open source web-based application for remote scoring of tma images, which exploits the value of microsoft silverlight deep zoom to provide a intuitive interface for zooming and panning around digital images.
the use of tissue microarrays  and advances in digital scanning microscopy has enabled the collection of thousands of tissue images.
the system has enabled researchers to simultaneously score large collections of tma and export the standardised data to integrate with pathological and clinical outcome data, thereby facilitating biomarker discovery.
the application has been used for multi-centre scoring of tma slides composed of tissues from several phase iii breast cancer trials and ten different studies participating in the international breast cancer association consortium .
