we have implemented an algorithm based on the schematic method of king and altman  that employs the topological theory of linear graphs for systematic generation of valid reaction patterns in a gui-based stand-alone computer program called kapattern.
the program can automatically generate mathml and matlab output files that users can easily incorporate into simulation programs.
while the theory of enzyme kinetics is fundamental to analyzing and simulating biochemical systems, the derivation of rate equations for complex mechanisms for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is cumbersome and error prone.
a computer program, called kapattern, for generating rate equations for complex enzyme system is a freely available and can be accessed at .
therefore, a number of algorithms and related computer programs have been developed to assist in such derivations.
