the allele types  of significant snps coincided with those previously reported for candidate genes ghd <dig> and pi-ta.
an informative set of  <dig> snps was established by screening  <dig> high-yielding or primary ancestral cultivars for  <dig> validated snps.
our custom snp set is an effective tool for the identification of introgressed genome regions from a particular genetic background.
this study demonstrates that changes in genome structure occurred during artificial selection for high yield, and provides information on several genomic regions associated with yield performance.
introgression breeding is an established strategy for the accumulation of qtls and genes controlling high yield.

a possible relationship between these introgressed regions and six yield traits  was detected in eight genome regions dominated by alleles of one parental origin.
in this study, we used a custom snp set to identify introgressed chromosomal regions in a set of high-yielding japanese rice cultivars, and we performed an association study to identify genome regions associated with yield.
high-yielding cultivars of rice  have been developed in japan from crosses between overseas indica and domestic japonica cultivars.
these snps can be used in genome-wide association studies to detect candidate genome regions associated with economically important traits.
analysis of the population structure of high-yielding cultivars showed three genome types: japonica-type, indica-type and a mixture of the two.
distinct regions skewed for the presence of parental alleles were observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .
