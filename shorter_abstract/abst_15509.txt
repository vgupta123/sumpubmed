dyrk1a is a nuclear protein kinase that has been localized to the splicing factor compartment.
here we describe the identification of dyrk1a as a protein kinase that phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro and in cultivated cells.
the present data show that the splicing factor sf3b <dig> is a substrate of the protein kinase dyrk1a and suggest that dyrk1a may be involved in the regulation of pre mrna-splicing.
downregulation of dyrk1a in hek <dig> cells or in hepg <dig> cells by rna interference reduced the phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b <dig>
by mass spectrometry and mutational analysis of sf3b <dig>  thr <dig> was identified as the major phosphorylation site for dyrk1a.
