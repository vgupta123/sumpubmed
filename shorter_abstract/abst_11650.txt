although both groups had similar intramuscular protein and triglyceride concentrations, the offspring born to hf mothers had a higher proportion of arachidonic acid  and a reduction in Î±-linolenic acid  compared to c group offspring.
in conclusion, a hf gestational diet accelerates the maturation of offspring biceps femoris muscle, reflected in increased glycolytic metabolism and fibre cross sectional area, differences accompanied with a potential resetting of myofibre nutrient uptake.
histological and metabolic features of the biceps femoris muscle obtained from 7-day-old piglets born to sows assigned to either a commercial  or to an isocaloric fat supplementation diet  during pregnancy were assessed.
offspring exposed to a maternal hf diet demonstrated enhanced muscular development, reflected by an increase in fractional growth rate, rise in myofibre cross-sectional area, increased storage of glycogen and reduction in lipid staining of myofibres.
maternal diet during pregnancy can modulate skeletal muscle development of the offspring.
