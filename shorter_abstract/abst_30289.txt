our findings suggest that mrhbdd <dig> may be associated with mammalian spermatogenesis.
stable mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells were sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, ps <dig> and uv irradiation.
gc- <dig>  a spermatogonia cell line, has the capacity to differentiate into spermatids within the seminiferous tubules.
we constructed mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells and evaluated their capacity to differentiate into spermatids in mouse seminiferous tubules.
however, they lost the ability to survive and differentiate in mouse seminiferous tubules.
