amino acids responsible for structure, core function or specificity may be inferred from multiple protein sequence alignments where a limited set of residue types are tolerated.
smerfs performance was improved by use of windows over alignment columns, illustrating the necessity of considering the local environment of positions when assessing their functional significance.
the smerfs algorithm gave similar accuracy to the phylogenetic tree-based miner algorithm but was superior to williamson in prediction of non-catalytic transient complex interfaces.
additional computation employed by miner in calculation of phylogenetic trees did not produce improved results over smerfs.
a new algorithm, smerfs, for predicting protein functional sites from multiple sequences alignments was compared to  <dig> conservation measures and to the miner algorithm.
the difference in performance of smerfs relative to williamson in manually defined complexes was dependent on complex type.
