here, we describe an expression sequence tag  project for bicyclus anynana that has identified the largest available collection to date of expressed genes for any butterfly.
by targeting cdnas from developing wings at the stages when pattern is specified, we biased gene discovery towards genes potentially involved in pattern formation.
these resources will be invaluable for exploring the potential of b. anynana in particular, and butterflies in general, as models in ecological, evolutionary, and developmental genetics.
assembly of  <dig>  ests from a subtracted library allowed us to identify  <dig>  genes of which  <dig>  were annotated based on blast analyses against relevant gene collections.
butterfly wing color patterns are a key model for integrating evolutionary developmental biology and the study of adaptive morphological evolution.
yet, despite the biological, economical and educational value of butterflies they are still relatively under-represented in terms of available genomic resources.
we combined gene and single nucleotide polymorphism  identification by constructing cdna libraries from pools of outbred individuals, and by sequencing clones from the 3' end to maximize alignment depth.
