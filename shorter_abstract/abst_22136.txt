accuracy of differential expression was measured against real-time pcr for  <dig> genes and both platforms correlated well with r values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for codelink and genechip, respectively.
for each microarray platform, five technical replicates, derived from the same total rna samples, were labeled, hybridized, and quantified according to each manufacturers' standard protocols.
despite the widespread use of microarrays, much ambiguity regarding data analysis, interpretation and correlation of the different technologies exists.
the correlation coefficient  of differential expression ratios for the entire set of  <dig>  overlapping genes was  <dig>  between platforms.
there is a considerable amount of interest in correlating results obtained between different microarray platforms.
however, as in this study, a large number of genes may be lost from the correlation due to differing levels of noise between platforms.
to address this issue we conducted a thorough evaluation of two commercial microarray platforms to determine an appropriate methodology for making cross-platform correlations.
in addition to levels of inter-platform correlation, we evaluated precision, statistical-significance profiles, power, and noise levels for each microarray platform.
in all, this study represents the most comprehensive and specifically designed comparison of short-oligonucleotide microarray platforms to date using the largest set of overlapping genes.
