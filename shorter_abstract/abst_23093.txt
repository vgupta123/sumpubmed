the carbapenem subclass of β-lactams is among the most potent antibiotics available today.
the results presented here demonstrate biapenem and tebipenem bind to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  covalently inactivate the enzyme, and subsequently degrade via an s-conjugate elimination mechanism.

despite significant variations in carbapenem sulfur side chains, biapenem and tebipenem ultimately form an identical adduct that docks to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  we propose that this common adduct is an enzyme catalyzed decomposition of the carbapenem adduct by a mechanism similar to s-conjugate elimination by β-lyases.
emerging evidence shows that, unlike other subclasses of β-lactams, carbapenems bind to and inhibit non-classical transpeptidases  that generate  <dig> →  <dig> linkages in bacterial peptidoglycan.
