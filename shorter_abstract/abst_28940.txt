several lines of evidence suggest that theophylline-dependent inhibition of splicing is highly specific, and thermodynamic stability of rna-theophylline complex as well as the location of bps within this complex affects the efficiency of splicing inhibition.
finally, we have constructed an alternative splicing model pre-mrna substrate in which theophylline caused exon skipping both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that a small molecule-rna interaction can modulate alternative splicing.
we constructed a series of pre-mrnas in which the bps was inserted within theophylline aptamer.
the present study was performed to investigate whether a theophylline-dependent "splice switch" that sequesters the branchpoint sequence  within rna-theophylline complex can regulate alternative splicing.
we show that theophylline-induced sequestering of bps inhibits pre-mrna splicing both in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner.
