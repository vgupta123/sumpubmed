through the probabilistic integration of explicit and implicit data sources a functional interaction network can be constructed.
the resulting network is examined in conjunction with expression data to identify groups of genes with significant temporal or tissue specific patterns.
the novel methodology presented here illustrates how the effective integration of pre-existing biological knowledge and high-throughput experimental data drives biological discovery and hypothesis generation.
