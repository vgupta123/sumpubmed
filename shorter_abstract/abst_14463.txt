we propose that different levels of compatibility dependent on genotype by genotype interactions might lead to different amounts of resources available for host and parasite reproduction.
we performed a controlled cross inoculation experiment confronting six lines of the host plant with seven strains of the parasite in order to evaluate genetic variation for phenotypic traits of infection among hosts, parasites, and distinct combinations.
parasite infection intensity and transmission were highly variable among parasite strains and host lines but depended also on the interaction between particular genotypes of the protagonists, and genetic variation for the infection phenotype of parasites from natural populations was found even at a small spatial scale within population.
this variation in compatibility could thus mask the expected negative relationship between host and parasite fitness, as the total resource pool would not be constant.
these results highlight the importance of host variation in the determination of parasite fitness traits.
this kind of interaction may in turn decouple the relationship between parasite transmission and its negative effect on host fitness, altering theoretical predictions of parasite evolution.
furthermore, increased parasite fitness led to a significant decrease in host fitness only on a single host line , although a trade-off between these two traits was expected because host and parasite share the same resource pool for their respective reproduction.
for instance one common definition of parasite virulence is the reduction in host fitness due to infection.
