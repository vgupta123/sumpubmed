we propose a novel measure, called "win percentage", for assessing the suitability of machine classifiers to a particular problem.
in this paper, we seek classifiers that are suitable to a particular problem independent of feature selection.
we define win percentage as the probability a classifier will perform better than its peers on a finite random sample of feature sets, giving each classifier equal opportunity to find suitable features.
after initially using all gaussian gene-pairs, we show that precise estimates of win percentage  can be achieved using a smaller random sample of all feature pairs.
fundamentally, we illustrate that the selection of the most suitable classifier  not only depends on the dataset and application but also on the thoroughness of feature selection.
in particular, win percentage provides a single measurement that could assist users in eliminating or selecting classifiers for their particular application.
