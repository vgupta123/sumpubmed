this study is significant in that it reveals the existence of a novel group of organisms that play a role in the reduction of perchlorate under saline conditions.
a metagenomic characterization was performed using illumina dna sequencing technology, and the 16s rdna of several pure strains isolated from the mixed cultures were sequenced.
the structure of the two microbial ecosystems of interest has been established and some representative strains obtained in pure culture.
the results illustrate that under favorable conditions a group of organisms can readily dominate an ecosystem and yet be effectively eliminated when their advantage is lost.
these rhodobacteraceae especially, as well as other organisms present in these communities may be a promising source of unique salt-tolerant enzymes for perchlorate reduction.
biological treatment can subsequently remove the perchlorate from the brine.
when nitrate is present, it will also be concentrated in the brine and must also be removed by biological treatment.
in the absence of nitrate, members of the rhodobacteraceae constituted the prevailing taxonomic group.
the primary objective was to obtain an in-depth characterization of the microbial populations of two salt-tolerant cultures each of which is capable of metabolizing perchlorate.
