migration is an important aspect of cellular behaviour and is therefore widely studied in cell biology.
we here present the cell_motility software, an open source java application under the gnu-gpl license that provides a clear and concise analysis workbench for large amounts of cell motion data.
apart from performing the necessary calculations, the software also visualizes the original motion paths as well as the results of the calculations to help the user interpret the data.
the application features an intuitive graphical user interface as well as full user and developer documentation and both source and binary files can be freely downloaded from the project website at  .
one of the typical approaches to study motion paths of individual cells relies on fitting mean square displacements to a persistent random walk function.
in providing a free, open source software solution for the automated processing of cell motion data, we aim to achieve two important goals: labs can greatly simplify their data analysis pipeline as switching between different computational software packages becomes obsolete  and secondly, to provide scientists in the field with a freely available common platform to perform their analyses, enabling more efficient data quality control through peer reviewing.
