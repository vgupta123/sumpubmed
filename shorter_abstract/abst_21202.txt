here, we show that active transcription continues after transient tf-target interactions by tracking de novo synthesis of rnas made in response to tf nuclear import.
thus, the functional read-out of de novo transcripts produced by transient tf-target interactions allowed us to capture new models for genome-wide transcriptional control.
recently, we described a dynamic mode of tf regulation named “hit-and-run”.
thus, the analysis of de novo transcripomics demonstrates that bzip <dig> may act as a catalyst tf to initiate a transcriptional complex , after which active transcription by rna polymerase continues without the tf being bound to the gene promoter .
this model proposes that master tf can interact transiently with a set of targets, but the transcription of these transient targets continues after the tf dissociation from the target promoter.
our proof-of-principle example is the master tf basic leucine zipper  <dig> , a central integrator of metabolic signaling in plants.
thus, we extended the target system  to include 4tu-labeling and named this new technology target-tu.
this dynamic regulatory model allows a master tf to catalytically propagate rapid and broad transcriptional responses to changes in environment.
however, experimental evidence validating active transcription of the transient tf-targets is still lacking.
our findings provide experimental proof for active transcription of transient tf-targets supporting a “hit-and-run” mode of action.
to do this, we introduced an affinity-labeled 4-thiouracil  nucleobase to specifically isolate newly synthesized transcripts following conditional tf nuclear import.
using target-tu, we captured newly synthesized mrnas made in response to bzip <dig> nuclear import at a time when bzip <dig> is no longer detectably bound to its target.
