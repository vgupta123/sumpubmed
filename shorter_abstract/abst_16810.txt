furthermore,  <dig> week of continuous gh-treatment in male rats reduced the levels of mir- <dig> and mir-29b, whereas mild starvation  raised the levels of mir- <dig>  mir-122a and mir-29b in both sexes.
we conclude that hepatic mirna levels depend on the hormonal and nutritional status of the animal and show that mir-29b is a female-predominant and gh-regulated mirna in rat liver.
we have previously shown that hepatic transcript profiles are different between males and females; that some of these differences are under the regulation of growth hormone ; and that mild starvation diminishes some of the differences.
among the eight putative sex-different mirnas, only one female-predominant mirna  was confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr.
in this study, we tested if hepatic mirnas are regulated in a similar manner.
using microarrays, mirna screening was performed to identify sex-dependent mirnas in rat liver.
micrornas  are short non-coding rnas playing an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.
out of  <dig> unique probes on the array,  <dig> were expressed in the liver and eight  of those were found to be different between the sexes.
