we find that a constrained regression approach shows consistently good performance.
methods that can automatically assess the quality of computationally predicted protein structures are important, as they enable the selection of the most accurate structure from an ensemble of predictions.
we examined techniques to estimate the quality of a predicted protein structure based on prediction consensus.
assessment methods that determine the quality of a predicted structure by comparing it against the various structures predicted by different servers have been shown to outperform approaches that rely on the intrinsic characteristics of the structure itself.
lga is used to align the structure in question to the structures for the same protein predicted by different servers.
the work presented here provides the basis for the construction of a regression model trained on data from existing structure prediction servers.
