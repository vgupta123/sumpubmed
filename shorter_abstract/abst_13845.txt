we propose that ecological and more geographic data should be collected to confirm these results.
here, we characterize the diversity of the dwarf lemurs  and assess the status of the seven described species, based on phylogenetic and population genetic analysis of mtdna  and three nuclear markers .
cheirogaleus sibreei falls into the c. medius mtdna clade, but in morphological analyses the membership is not clearly resolved.
the molecular and morphometric data indicate that c. adipicaudatus and c. ravus are synonymous with c. medius and c. major, respectively.
we do not have sufficient data to assess the status of c. minusculus.
based on the general metapopulation lineage concept and multiple concordant data sets, we identify three exclusive groups of dwarf lemur populations that correspond to three of the seven named species: c. major, c. medius and c. crossleyi.
this study identified three distinct evolutionary lineages within the genus cheirogaleus.
species are viewed as the fundamental unit in most subdisciplines of biology.
these three species were found to be genealogically exclusive in both mtdna and ndna loci and are morphologically distinguishable.
