we describe a conceptual framework for mapping quantitative trait loci  that control complex traits by treating trait formation as a dynamic system.
this framework, called systems mapping, incorporates a system of differential equations that quantifies how alterations of different components lead to the global change of trait development and function through genes, and provides a quantitative and testable platform for assessing the interplay between gene action and development.
every phenotypic trait can be viewed as a "system" in which a group of interconnected components function synergistically to yield a unified whole.
we show that systems mapping implemented by design principles of biological systems is quite versatile for deciphering the genetic machineries for size-shape, structural-functional, sink-source and pleiotropic relationships underlying plant physiology and development.
systems mapping should enable geneticists to shed light on the genetic complexity of any biological system in plants and other organisms and predict its physiological and pathological states.
