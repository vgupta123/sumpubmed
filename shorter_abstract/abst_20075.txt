this suggests that more potential novel snps may be discovered using both approaches than with just the conventional approach.
to bring down the per-sample cost, one approach is to pool barcoded ngs libraries before sample enrichment.
we successfully enriched barcoded ngs libraries instead of genomic dna, achieving reproducible coverage profiles  across multiplexed samples, with <10% strand bias.
our study has also shown the benefit of computing inter-sample snp-concordances and inspecting read alignments in order to attain more confident results.
therefore, we evaluated the impact of different software tools and analytical approaches on the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in multiplexed tngs data.
our pipeline saved  <dig> hours of run time per hiseq <dig> exome sample and detected ~5% more snps than the conventional whole genome approach.
to generate our own test model, we combined a sequence capture method with ngs in three experimental stages of increasing complexity .
still, we lack a complete understanding of how this multiplexed tngs approach and the varying performance of the ever-evolving analytical tools can affect the quality of variant discovery.
