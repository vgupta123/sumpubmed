developing flowers of homozygous npr <dig> mutants are dramatically more resistant to infection by the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae, suggesting a role of npr <dig> as a repressor of npr1-mediated defense response with a novel role in flower development.
we conclude that tcnpr <dig> functions similar to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene in the regulation of the cacao defense response.
to test tcnpr <dig> function directly in cacao tissues, a synthetic microrna targeting tcnpr <dig> mrna was transiently expressed in cacao leaves using an agrobacterium-infiltration method.
like in arabidopsis, tcnpr <dig> was constitutively expressed across a wide range of tissue types and developmental stages but with some differences in relative levels compared to arabidopsis.
arabidopsis thaliana  non-expressor of pr <dig>  is a transcription coactivator that plays a central role in regulating the transcriptional response to plant pathogens.
tcnpr <dig> knock down leaf tissues were dramatically more resistance to infection with phytophthora capsici in a leaf bioassay, showing smaller lesion sizes and reduced pathogen replication.
