specifically, for slightly or moderately duplicated genes with gene families containing  <dig> -  <dig> paralogs, genes were more likely to evolve alternative splicing and had on average a greater number of alternative splicing isoforms after long-term evolution compared to singleton genes.
on the other hand, those large gene families  had a lower proportion of alternative splicing, and fewer alternative splicing isoforms on average even when ancient duplicated genes were taken into consideration.
duplication and alternative splicing are thought to work together to provide the diverse functions or expression patterns for eukaryotes.
we also found these duplicated genes having alternative splicing were under tighter evolutionary constraints compared to those having no alternative splicing, and had an enrichment of genes that participate in molecular transducer activities.
our results implicate that there are key differences in functions and evolutionary constraints among singleton genes or duplicated genes with or without alternative splicing incidences.
gene duplication provides resources for developing novel genes and new functions while retaining the original functions.
we studied the association between occurrences of alternative splicing and gene duplication.
it implies that the gene duplication and alternative splicing may have different functional significance in the evolution of speciation diversity.
we look into the relationship between occurrence of alternative splicing and duplication at different time after duplication events.
