many simulation models, inspired by the social behavior of natural organisms, are presented to provide new approaches for solving realistic optimization problems.
by using quorum sensing mechanisms, artificial bacteria working together can find the nutrient concentration  quickly in the artificial environment.
biomimicry of quorum sensing mechanisms using the lifecycle model allows the artificial bacteria endowed with the communication abilities, which are essential to obtain more valuable information to guide their search cooperatively towards the preferred nutrient concentrations.
lcm-qs model can be classified into three main sub-models: chemotaxis with qs sub-model, reproduction and elimination sub-model and migration sub-model.
in this paper, we present a computational model termed lcm-qs, which simulates the bacterial quorum-sensing  mechanism using an individual-based modelling approach under the framework of agent-environment-rule  scheme, i.e.
