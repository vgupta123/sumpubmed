our results clearly demonstrated a beneficial effect of the serratia spp.
several studies report a potential contribution of the bacteria for the pwd development, either as a helper to enhance the pathogenicity of the nematode or as a pathogenic agent expressing interesting traits related to lifestyle host-adaptation.
pine wilt disease  caused by the pinewood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus is one of the most serious forest diseases in the world.
we report, for the first time, that b. xylophilus associated bacteria may assist the nematode opportunistically in the disease, and that a virulent b. xylophilus isolate displayed a higher tolerance towards the os conditions than an avirulent isolate.
the bacterial effect was transverse for both b. xylophilus isolates.
the role of b. xylophilus-associated bacteria in pwd and their interaction with the nematode, have recently been under substantial investigation.
to b. xylophilus under the os condition.
was found to be extremely os-resistant, and promote survival of b. xylophilus and down-regulate two b. xylophilus catalase genes .
in addition, we show that the virulent isolate  of b. xylophilus survives better than the avirulent  isolate under the os condition.
we could not observe a strong and specific adhesion of these bacteria on the b. xylophilus cuticle surface.
