the present study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with waterlogging tolerance  in barley and compare the qtls identified across two seasons and in two different populations using a composite map constructed with ssrs, rflp and diversity array technology  markers.
there may be some degree of homoeologous relationship between qtls controlling barley waterlogging tolerance and that in other crops as discussed in this study.
qtls identified in this study have made it possible to use marker assisted selection  in combination with traditional field selection to significantly enhance barley breeding for waterlogging tolerance.
improving waterlogging tolerance in barley is still at an early stage compared with other traits.
some of these qtls affected multiple waterlogging tolerance related traits, for example, qtl qwt4- <dig> contributed not only to reducing barley leaf chlorosis, but also increasing plant biomass under waterlogging stress, whereas other qtls controlled both leaf chlorosis and plant survival.
