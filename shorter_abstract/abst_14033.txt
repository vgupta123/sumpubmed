when results from molecular typing of tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and 23s rdna were analyzed in samples taken from the same patient, no discrepancies in the identified genotypes were found; however, there were discrepancies in  <dig> of  <dig> patients  samples relative to the arp and tpr loci.
the repetition number for the arp gene was lower in whole blood  samples compared to swab samples.

differences in the cdc subtypes identified in parallel samples indicated genetic instability of the arp and tpr loci and suggested limited applicability of the cdc typing system in epidemiological studies.
in addition to the above described typing,  <dig> pcr-positive swabs and whole blood samples were tested for individual genotype frequencies.
differences in treponemal genotypes detected in whole blood and swab samples suggested important differences between both compartments and/or differences in adherence of treponeme variants to human cells.
similarly, the most common tpr rflp type “d” was found to have lower occurrence rates in wb samples while type “e” had an increased occurrence in these samples.
samples taken from  <dig> of  <dig> patients were completely typed for tp <dig>  tp <dig>  23s rdna, arp, and tpr loci.
we tested whether identified molecular subtypes were identical in pcr-positive parallel samples taken from the same patient at a same time.
eighteen syphilis positive patients , with two pcr-typeable parallel samples taken at the same time, were tested with both cdc  and sequence-based typing.
