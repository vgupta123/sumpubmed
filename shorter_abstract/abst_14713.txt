gh <dig> gene number in fungal genomes ranged from 0â€“ <dig>  ancestral state reconstruction of gh <dig> gene abundance showed a strong correlation with nutritional mode, and gene family expansion was observed in several clades of pathogenic filamentous ascomycota species.
reliance on plant gh <dig> enzyme activity for c acquisition in these symbionts supports earlier predictions of possible plant control over c allocation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis.
these data suggest that plant biotrophic fungi exhibit a wide range of ability to access plant-synthesized sucrose.
a number of plant pathogenic fungi also use gh <dig> enzymes to access plant-derived sucrose, but less is known about the sucrose utilization ability of mutualistic and commensal plant biotrophic fungi, such as mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi.
the aim of this study was to explore the distribution and abundance of gh <dig> genes in fungi to understand how sucrose utilization is structured within and among major ecological guilds and evolutionary lineages.
using bioinformatic and pcr-based analyses, we tested for gh <dig> gene presence in all available fungal genomes and an additional  <dig> species representing a broad phylogenetic and ecological range of biotrophic fungi.
gh <dig> gene number was negatively correlated with animal pathogenicity and positively correlated with plant biotrophy, with the notable exception of mycorrhizal taxa.
we found a strong signature of both ecological strategy and phylogeny on gh <dig> gene number in fungi.
few mycorrhizal species were found to have gh <dig> genes as compared to other guilds of plant-associated fungi, such as pathogens, endophytes and lichen-forming fungi.
photosynthate within plants is transported from source to sink tissues as sucrose, which is hydrolyzed by plant glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> enzymes  into its constituent monosaccharides to meet plant cellular demands.
endophytic fungi are more similar to plant pathogens in their possession of gh <dig> genes, whereas most genomes of mycorrhizal taxa lack gh <dig> genes.
