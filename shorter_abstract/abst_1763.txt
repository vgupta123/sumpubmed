in this paper, we propose the two-pass random walks with restart on a heterogenous network, tp-nrwrh for short, to predict new indications for approved drugs.
rather than random walk on bipartite network, we integrated the drug-drug similarity network, disease-disease similarity network and known drug-disease association network into one heterogenous network, on which the two-pass random walks with restart is implemented.
we proposed a two-pass random walk with restart on the drug-disease heterogeneous network, referred to as tp-nrwrh, to predict new indications for approved drugs.

we have conducted performance evaluation on two datasets of drug-disease associations, and the results show that our method has higher performance than six existing methods.
the experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting new indications for approved drugs.

with the explosive growth of large-scale biochemical and phenotypic data, drug repositioning holds great potential for precision medicine in the post-genomic era.
it is urgent to develop rational and systematic approaches to predict new indications for approved drugs on a large scale.
since traditional drug research and development is often time-consuming and high-risk, there is an increasing interest in establishing new medical indications for approved drugs, referred to as drug repositioning, which provides a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach for drug discovery.
performance evaluation on two independent datasets showed that tp-nrwrh achieved higher performance than six existing methods on 10-fold cross validations.
