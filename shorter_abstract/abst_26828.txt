the output can be generated as graphs, excel-files, images with projections of the final analysis and exported as variables.
enhanced cellclassifier starts from images analyzed by cellprofiler, and allows multi-class classification using a support vector machine algorithm.
classification results can be integrated with other object measurements including inter-object relationships.
training of objects can be done by clicking directly "on the microscopy image" in several intuitive training modes.
this makes a detailed interpretation of the image possible, allowing the differentiation of many complex phenotypes.
here we describe enhanced cellclassifier which allows multiple class classification, elucidating complex phenotypes.
even though revolutionizing image analysis in current biology, some routine and many advanced tasks are either not supported or require programming skills of the researcher.
currently, among open source software, cellprofiler and its extension analyst are widely used in automated image processing.
