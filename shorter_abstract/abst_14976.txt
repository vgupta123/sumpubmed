the method was applied to deletion of  <dig> p. aeruginosa genes encoding transcriptional regulators of the gntr family.
we describe a method for rapid generation of unmarked p. aeruginosa deletion mutants.
with appropriate modifications, the method should be applicable to other bacteria.
while maintaining the key features of traditional gene replacement procedures, for example, suicide delivery vectors, antibiotic resistance selection and sucrose counterselection, the method described here is considerably faster due to streamlining of some of the key steps involved in the process, especially plasmid-borne mutant allele construction and its transfer into the target host.
unmarked deletion mutants are finally obtained by flp-mediated excision of the antibiotic resistance marker.
the plasmid-borne deletions are next transferred to the p. aeruginosa chromosome by homologous recombination.
