the kernel approach presented here shows increased prediction accuracy with a significantly higher number of true positives and negatives on multiple mhc class ii alleles, when testing data sets from mhcpep  <cit> , mchbn  <cit> , and mhcbench  <cit> .
similarity scores, in contrast to a fixed-length, pocket-specific representation of amino acids, provide a flexible and powerful way of modelling mhc binding, and can easily be applied to other dynamic sequence problems.
this paper introduces a kernel method that can handle variable length peptides effectively by quantifying similarities between peptide sequences and integrating these into the kernel.
evaluation by cross validation, when segregating binders and non-binders, produced an average of  <dig>  aroc for the mhcbench data sets , and an average of  <dig>  aroc for multiple alleles of the mhcpep database.
the method improves performance over existing state-of-the-art methods of mhc class ii peptide binding predictions by using a custom, knowledge-based representation of peptides.
