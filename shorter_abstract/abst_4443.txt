other genes play a role in flavonoid biosynthesis and hormonal metabolism.
a genome-wide transcriptional analysis, performed with a chip that allows to monitor the expression of more than  <dig>  tomato transcripts, identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts by comparing roots of fe-deficient and fe-sufficient tomato plants.
these transcripts are related to the physiological responses of tomato roots to the nutrient stress resulting in an improved iron uptake, including regulatory aspects, translocation, root morphological modification and adaptation in primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and tca cycle.
however, no detailed transcriptome analysis has been described so far.
plants react to iron deficiency stress adopting different kind of adaptive responses.
large-scale transcriptional analyses of roots under iron deficiency are only available for a very limited number of plant species with particular emphasis for arabidopsis thaliana.
