haploid sequence from a fosmid library prepared from lymphocytes of an eaz cow was used for comparison.
almost all genome sequencing projects neglect the fact that diploid organisms contain two genome copies and consequently what is published is a composite of the two.
samples were: 1) lymphocytes from a single angus steer; 2) sperm cells from an angus bull; 3) lymphocytes from east african zebu  cattle collected and processed in a field laboratory in eastern kenya.
the diploid sequences of three groups of cattle samples were obtained using a simple sample preparation procedure requiring only a microscope and a haemocytometer.
we have developed a set of laboratory protocols and software tools that will enable any laboratory to obtain haplotype sequences at only modestly greater cost than traditional mixed diploid sequences.
contigs were obtained by mapping to the bovine umd <dig>  reference genome assembly and scaffolds were assembled by joining adjacent contigs that were within a threshold distance of each other.
we have developed a simplified method of directly obtaining the haploid sequences of each genome copy from an individual organism.
snp haplotypes were assembled with the single individual haplotyper program to generate an n <dig> size of 97–201 kb but only ~27–68 % genome coverage.
this means that the relationship between alternate alleles at two or more linked loci is lost.
