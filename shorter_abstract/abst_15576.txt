candidate gene approaches were undertaken to annotate insecticide resistance, sex-determining, chemoreceptors, and antimicrobial peptides.
blow flies  are important medical, veterinary and forensic insects encompassing 8 % of the species diversity observed in the calyptrate insects.
the p. regina genomes appear to contain few mobile genetic elements, an almost complete absence of sines, and most of the repetitive landscape consists of simple repetitive sequences.
we present the hybrid  draft assemblies of the male and female genomes of the common north american blow fly, phormia regina .
the  <dig> and 534 mb draft assemblies contained  <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes in the female and male genomes, respectively; including > 93 % conserved eukaryotic genes.

this resource will provide a strong foundation for future studies into the evolution, population structure, behavior, and physiology of all blow flies.
putative x and y chromosomes  were assembled and annotated.
