the hybridized dna fragments were recovered by the hsa method and cloned into pmd18-t vector.
in this research we developed a method to rapidly isolate ests from chromosome 1r of rye by combining the techniques of chromosome microdissection with hybrid specific amplification .
construction of single-chromosome est library could be an efficient strategy to isolate important ests located on specific chromosomes.
we developed a new method to rapidly clone chromosome-specific ests from chromosome 1r of rye.
isolated in this research were  <dig> ests with unknown functions, probably representing some new genes on rye chromosome 1r.
the information reported here should be useful for cloning and investigating the new genes found on chromosome 1r.
chromosome 1r was isolated by a glass needle and digested with proteinase k .
the dna of chromosome 1r was amplified by two rounds of pcr using a degenerated oligonucleotide 6-mw sequence with a sau3ai digestion site as the primer.
of the  <dig> ests obtained and analyzed,  <dig> were known sequences located on rye chromosome 1r or on homologous group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat; all of them were highly homologous with ests of wheat, barley and/or other plants in gramineae, some of which were induced by abiotic or biotic stresses.
to obtain important expressed sequence tags  located on specific chromosomes is currently difficult.
the pcr product was digested with sau3ai and linked with adaptor hsa <dig>  then hybridized with the sau3ai digested cdna with adaptor hsa <dig> of rye leaves with and without salicylic acid  treatment, respectively.
