although the area is thought to have experienced periods of relative continuity during pleistocene glacial periods, small-scale studies suggest deep lineage divergence across low-elevation gaps.
consistent patterns of strong lineage divergence among different molecular datasets indicate genetic breaks between populations inhabiting geographically distinct mountain regions.
despite the small area of australia’s alpine and sub-alpine habitats, their low topographic relief and lack of extensive glaciation, divergence among populations was on the same scale as that detected in much more extensive northern hemisphere mountain systems.
changing climatic conditions drive their expansion and contraction, leaving signatures on the genetic structure of their flora and fauna.
we found broadly congruent patterns of regional structure between the dna sequence and microsatellite datasets, corresponding to strong divergence among isolated mountain regions.
interestingly, within areas of largely contiguous alpine and sub-alpine habitat around mt kosciuszko, microsatellite data suggested significant population structure, accompanied by a strong signature of isolation-by-distance.
mountain landscapes are topographically complex, creating discontinuous ‘islands’ of alpine and sub-alpine habitat with a dynamic history.
three primary phylogeographic groups were evident in the highly fragmented victorian high country, while within-region structure detected with microsatellites may reflect more recent population isolation.
we found mixed support, however, for divergence among other mountain regions.
