in this study, we establish links between blochmannia, growth of starting new colonies and the host immune response.
the immune response of ants from control and treated colonies was estimated by inserting nylon filaments in the gaster and removing it after  <dig> h. in the control colonies, the encapsulation response was positively correlated to the bacterial amount, while no correlation was observed in treated colonies.
indeed, antibiotic treatment increased the encapsulation response of the workers, probably due to stress conditions.
furthermore, the bacteria improve the workers encapsulation response.
the increased growth rate observed in non-treated colonies confirms the importance of blochmannia in this phase of colony development.
this would provide an important selective advantage during colony founding, where the colonies are faced with severe inter and intraspecific competition.
incipient rifampin treated colonies had significantly lower numbers of brood and adult workers than control colonies.
thus, these ants are likely to be less susceptible to various pathogen attacks, such as the phoridae fly parasitoids, normally found in the vicinity of camponotus nests.
all carpenter ants  studied hitherto harbour primary endosymbiotic bacteria of the blochmannia genus.
efficiency of the treatment was estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization , using blochmannia specific primers  and two fluorescent probes .
