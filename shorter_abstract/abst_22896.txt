the invasion in hep- <dig> cells of four clinical isolates and two reference strains of their ureaplasma was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy and gentamicin invasion assay.
the gentamicin invasion assay detected that 1% of the atcc strains were inside the infected hep- <dig> cells in contrast to 10% to the clinical isolates.
the results presented herein will help better understand u. diversum infections, aswell as cellular attachment and virulence.
understanding mollicutes is challenging due to their variety and relationship with host cells.
a high level of phospholipase c activity was also detected in all studied ureaplasma.
