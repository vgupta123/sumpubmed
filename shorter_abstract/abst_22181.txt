this microarray was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed when bean leaf extracts, pod extracts or apoplastic fluid were added to the growth medium.
in this work, a genomic library of p. syringae pv.
this study furthers the understanding of the mechanisms involved, responses and the metabolic adaptation that occurs during the interaction of p. syringae pv.
transcription profiles show that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, the majority under the effect of bean leaf extract and apoplastic fluid.
these include genes encoding type iii secretion system proteins and genes involved in cell-wall degradation, phaseolotoxin synthesis and aerobic metabolism.
although several bacterial genes have been determined as participants in pathogenesis, the overall process still remains poorly understood, mainly because the identity and function of many of the genes are largely unknown.
