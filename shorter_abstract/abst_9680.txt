pharmacological and genetic manipulation of glycine receptors shows that they are implicated in the control of these locomotory movements.
morphological molecular techniques and heterologous expression experiments revealed that glycine receptors are inhibitory and are present on both motoneurones and locomotory muscle while putative glycinergic interneurons were identified in the nerve cord by labeling with an anti-glycine antibody.
in ciona intestinalis, glycine receptors, glycinergic transmission and putative glycinergic interneurons, have a key role in coordinating swimming movements through a simple cpg that is present in the motor ganglion and nerve cord.
thus, the strong association between glycine receptors and vertebrate locomotory networks may now be extended to include the phylum chordata.
the results suggest that the basic network for 'spinal-like' locomotion is likely to have existed in the common ancestor of extant chordates some  <dig> m years ago.
a key element in pattern generation is the role of glycinergic synaptic transmission by interneurons that cross the cord midline and inhibit contralaterally-located excitatory neurons.
a reduced preparation of the larva consisting of nerve cord and motor ganglion generates alternating swimming movements.
