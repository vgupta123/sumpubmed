there are now several ways to generate fluorescent fusion proteins by randomly inserting dna encoding the green fluorescent protein  into another protein's coding sequence.
while remarkably useful, the current insertional strategies have two major limitations:  they only produce one kind, or color, of fluorescent fusion protein and  one half of all gfp insertions within the target coding sequence are in the wrong orientation.
our initial tests targeted two mammalian integral membrane proteins: the voltage sensitive motor, prestin, and an er ligand gated ca2+ channel .
these new designs increase the efficiency of random fusion protein generation in one of two ways:  by creating two different fusion proteins from each insertion or  by being independent of orientation.
