according to sam,  <dig> genes were identified as common to all the microarray platforms and therefore a common radiosensitivity signature.
using the radiation-related signaling pathway and identified genes, a genetic network was generated.
significant genes including actn <dig>  ccnd <dig>  hcls <dig>  itgb <dig>  pfn <dig>  ptprc, rab <dig>  and was, which are adhesion-related molecules that were identified by both sam and gene set analysis, and showed interaction in the genetic network with the integrin signaling pathway.
the survival fraction at 2â€‰gy  was calculated as a measure of radiosensitivity and a linear regression model was applied to identify genes or a gene set with a correlation between expression and radiosensitivity .
our results suggested that the identified genes are candidates for radiosensitivity biomarkers and that integrin signaling via adhesion molecules could be a target for radiosensitization.
radiosensitivity profiling data using clonogenic assay and gene expression profiling data from four published microarray platforms applied to nci- <dig> cancer cell panel were used.
in gene set analysis, functions in the cell cycle, dna replication, and cell junction, including adherence and gap junctions were related to radiosensitivity.
radiosensitivity signature genes were identified using significant analysis of microarrays  and gene set analysis was performed using a global test using linear regression model.
integration of four different microarray experiments and gene selection using gene set analysis discovered possible target genes and pathways relevant to radiosensitivity.
