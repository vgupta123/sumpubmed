in the present study, we report an in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay , developed by using ethanol extract of mycobacterium bovis .
to detect species specific molecules, components in the ethanol extract were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and western blotting.
the assay, named , was evaluated for detection of anti- m. bovis antibodies in the sera of cattle and white-tailed deer.
the use of serological assays for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis  has been intensively studied and use of specific antigens have aided in improving the diagnostic accuracy of the assays.
the results warrant further evaluation and validation of evelisa for bovine tb diagnosis of traditional and alternative livestock as well as for free-ranging animal species.
m. bovis -specific lipids and protein  in the ethanol extract were detected by thin layer chromatography and western blotting, respectively.
