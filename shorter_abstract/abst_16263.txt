protein-dna interactions play a crucial role in the life of biological organisms in controlling transcription, regulation, as well as dna recombination and repair.
in this study, using a method combining sequence homology, structural analogy modeling and biochemical data, we first build the 3d structure of the complex between the poorly-characterized perr-like regulator slr <dig> and its target dna, which controls the defences against metal and oxidative stresses in synechocystis.
then, based on published observations, we propose more elaborated multimeric models that may be biologically important to understand molecular mechanisms.
the deep understanding of these processes, which requires the atomic description of the interactions occurring between the proteins and their dna partners is often limited by the absence of a 3d structure of such complexes.
using a combination of different types of data, we build and validate a relevant model of the tridimensional structure of a biologically important protein-dna complex.
finally, in agreement with experimental data we present a 3d-structure of the slr1738-dna complex resulting from the binding of multimers of the fur-like regulator onto its target dna that possesses internal repeats.
