phylogenetic analysis based on the combined pif- <dig> and lef- <dig> sequences places clbinpv in the group ii alphabaculoviruses.
this result is consistent with the absence of gp <dig> from the clbinpv genome and the presence instead of a fusion protein gene, characteristic of group ii.
clbinpv belongs to the group ii alphabaculoviruses and is most closely related to orlenpv, ldmnpv, tnsnpv, ecobnpv and chchnpv.
in this study, the complete genome of clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand this virus better.
blast searches revealed that clbinpv encodes a photolyase-like gene sequence, which has a 1-bp deletion when compared with photolyases of other baculoviruses.
this deletion disrupts the sequence into two small photolyase orfs, designated clbiphr- <dig> and clbiphr- <dig>  which correspond to the cpd-dna photolyase and fad-binding domains of photolyases, respectively.
the genome of clbinpv contains  <dig>  base pairs  with a g+c content of 37%, and  <dig> putative open reading frames  of at least  <dig> nucleotides.
one hundred and twenty-six of these orfs have homologues with other baculovirus genes while the other  <dig> are unique to clbinpv.
