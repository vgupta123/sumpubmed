through sirna-mediated knockdowns, we identify an important role for spectrin and the associated proteins adducin and p <dig>  during s. flexneri invasion.
the spectrin cytoskeleton is emerging as an important host cell target of enteric bacterial pathogens.
here we investigate the involvement of spectrin cytoskeletal components during the pathogenesis of the invasive pathogen shigella flexneri.
these findings highlight the importance of the spectrin cytoskeletal network during s. flexneri pathogenesis and further demonstrate that pathogenic events that were once thought to exclusively recruit the actin cytoskeletal system require additional cytoskeletal networks.
following internalization, all three proteins are recruited to the internalized bacteria, however upon generation of actin-rich comet tails, we observed spectrin recruitment to those structures in the absence of adducin or p <dig> .
