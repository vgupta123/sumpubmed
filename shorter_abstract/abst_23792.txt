although candida species are commensal microorganisms, they can cause many invasive fungal infections.
taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of 24-smt may be a novel approach to control candida spp.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of inhibitors of Δ24-sterol methyltransferase , 20-piperidin-2-yl-5α-pregnan-3β-20-diol , and  <dig> -epiminolanosterol , against clinical isolates of candida spp., analysing the ultrastructural changes.
all strains used in this study were susceptible to amphotericin b; however, some isolates were fluconazole- and itraconazole-resistant.
treatment with sub-inhibitory concentrations of aza and eil induced several ultrastructural alterations, including changes in the cell-wall shape and thickness, a pronounced disconnection between the cell wall and cytoplasm with an electron-lucent zone between them, mitochondrial swelling, and the presence of electron-dense vacuoles.
most of the azole-resistant isolates were candida non-albicans  species, but several of them, such as c. guilliermondii, c. zeylanoides, and c. lipolytica, were susceptible to 24-smti, indicating a lack of cross-resistance.
the fungicidal activity of 24-smti was particularly high against cna isolates.
the selectivity of 24-smti for fungal cells versus mammalian cells was assessed by the sulforhodamine b viability assay.
aza and eil were found to be potent growth inhibitors of candida spp.
fluorescence microscopy analyses indicated an accumulation of lipid bodies and alterations in the cell cycle of the yeasts.
