in this study, immunomagnetic cell sorting protocols to purify cd34+, cd133+ and lin- cells from fresh and cryopreserved cord blood were optimized.
there is a growing interest in cord blood as a source of primitive stem cells with the capacity for multilineage differentiation.
protocols developed for the enrichment of peripheral blood-derived stem cells have been found to be suboptimal for cord blood.
the optimized protocols enable rapid enrichment of highly pure hematopoietic stem cells from both fresh and cryopreserved cord blood.
