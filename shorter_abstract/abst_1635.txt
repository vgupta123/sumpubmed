opioids are a mainstay for the treatment of chronic pain.
morphine did not alter mpdz expression levels.
these studies used a well-established model of ascending morphine administration to induce tolerance, oih and other opioid maladaptations in  <dig> strains of inbred mice.
genome-wide computational genetic mapping was then applied to the data in combination with a false discovery rate filter.
the behavioral data processed using computational genetic mapping and false discovery rate filtering provided several strongly linked biologically plausible gene associations.
the objective of this study was to identify genes responsible for opioid tolerance and oih.
the strongest of these was the highly polymorphic mpdz gene coding for the post-synaptic scaffolding protein mpdz/mupp <dig>  heterozygous mpdz +/âˆ’ mice displayed reduced opioid tolerance and oih.
mpdz gene expression and mpdz/mupp <dig> protein levels were lower in the spinal cords of low-adapting 129s1/svlm mice than in high-adapting c57bl/ <dig> mice.
unfortunately, therapy-limiting maladaptations such as loss of treatment effect , and paradoxical opioid-induced hyperalgesia  can occur.
