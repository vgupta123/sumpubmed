it is a mountain specialist, restricted to areas above 2400â€‰m of the high atlas mountains of morocco with apparently no connection between the different populations.
in order to investigate its phylogeography,  <dig> specimens of a. andreanskyi were analyzed from eight different populations across the distribution range of the species for up to  <dig> base pairs of mitochondrial dna  and  <dig> base pairs of nuclear dna including five loci .
the results obtained with both concatenated and coalescent approaches and clustering methods, clearly show that all the populations analyzed present a very high level of genetic differentiation for the mitochondrial markers used and are also generally differentiated at the nuclear level.
atlantolacerta andreanskyi is an enigmatic lacertid lizard that, according to the most recent molecular analyses, belongs to the tribe eremiadini, family lacertidae.
these results indicate that a. andreanskyi is an additional example of a montane species complex.
