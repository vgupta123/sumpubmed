since it has been shown that wc <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of γδ t cell responses in cattle, which, like chickens, have a high percentage of γδ t cells in their peripheral blood, cd163c-α may play a similar role, especially in species lacking wc <dig> genes.
we annotated the bovine genome and identified genes coding for bovine cd163a and cd163c-α but found no evidence for cd163b.
bovine cd163a is widely expressed in immune cells, whereas cd163c-α transcripts are enriched in the wc1+ γδ t cell population.
our results suggest that gene duplications resulted in the expansion of cd163c-α-like and wc1-like molecules.
this expanded repertoire was retained by species known as "γδ t cell high", but homologous srcr molecules were maintained by all mammals.
