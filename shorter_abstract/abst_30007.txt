enrichment of the dimer fraction could only be achieved by stabilization with a crosslinker reagent.
our results provide new experimental evidence that may contribute to revise and expand the existing models that were proposed to explain the roles of this poorly understood regulatory protein.
in this work, clpt <dig> was obtained in a recombinant form and purified.
the arabidopsis clp consists of two heptameric rings  assembled from nine distinct subunits.
so, oligomerization status of clpt <dig> seems to control the assembly of the clp protease.
hsp <dig> chaperones  are believed to dock to the axial pores of clp and then transfer unfolded polypeptides destined to degradation.
in addition, clpt <dig> stimulates the atpase activity of clpd by more than 50% when both are present in a 1: <dig> molar ratio.
outside this optimal proportion, the stimulatory effect of clpt <dig> on the atpase activity of clpd declines.
it interacts with the chloroplastic hsp <dig> chaperones clpc <dig> and clpd and tightly modulates the atpase activity of the latter.
