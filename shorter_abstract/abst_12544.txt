in each stage, the cellular core of the notochord was cut into three pieces along the longitudinal axis .
in order to identify possible gradients leading to segmentation of the notochord, all  <dig> notochord-expressed hox genes were investigated, most of them displaying a typical anterior-posterior expression pattern along the notochord axis.
the clustering of hox genes revealed a pattern that could be related to notochord segmentation.
notochord samples were collected from unsegmented, pre-segmented and segmented developmental stages.
we further investigated how mineralisation is initiated in the notochord, and several factors related to chondrogenic lineage were identified , suggesting a cartilage-like character of the notochord.
the aim of this study was to identify genes/pathways acting in gradients over time and along the anterior-posterior axis during notochord segmentation and immediately prior to mineralisation of the vertebral bodies in atlantic salmon.
kegg analysis of differentially expressed genes between stages revealed down-regulation of pathways associated with ecm, cell division, metabolism and development at onset of notochord segmentation.
an incomplete salmon genome was successfully used to analyse rna-seq data from the cellular core of the atlantic salmon notochord.
in teleosts such as atlantic salmon , segmentation and subsequent mineralisation of the notochord during embryonic stages are essential for normal vertebrae formation.
this implies that inhibitory signals produce segmentation of the notochord.
