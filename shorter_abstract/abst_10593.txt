echovirus  <dig>  causes various clinical recognized syndromes, mostly with gastrointestinal syndrome and paralysis.
the current study summarized the shandong e- <dig> strains isolated from a 26-year acute flaccid paralysis  surveillance, and elucidated the characterization of phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships of e- <dig> worldwide.
phylogeographic analysis suggested that two regional transmissions of e- <dig> were mainly detected, with one located between europe and africa countries and the other was in the asia-pacific region.
as a predominant serotype circulating in afp surveillance, phylogenetic analysis showed that e- <dig> exhibited both time and geographic subdivision worldwide.
the time of the most recent common ancestor of e- <dig> was estimated around  <dig> years and evolved with  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions/site/year.
regional transmission was mainly detected and australia may be responsible for the spread of e- <dig> in recent years.
