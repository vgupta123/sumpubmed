ck- <dig>  ck- <dig>  epcam and cd- <dig> positive cell were also positive for serpinb <dig>  in the animal model, time course analysis in liver specimens revealed a progressive increase of serpinb <dig> and a parallel decrease of activated caspase  <dig>  which was barely detectable at 20Â hours.
transcription analysis confirmed the presence of serpinb3-homologous only in the liver of injured mice and sequence analysis proved its belonging to mouse serpinb3b.
to induce experimental activation of the liver stem/progenitor compartment, c57bl/6j mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide plus d-galactosamine and were sacrificed at different time points.
in the setting of liver injury hepatic progenitor cells are activated, counterbalancing the inhibited regenerative capacity of mature hepatocytes.
aim of the present study was to explore the presence of serpinb <dig> in hepatic progenitor cells in human livers and in a mouse model of liver stem/progenitor cell activation.
hepatic progenitor cells were analysed in foetal and adult livers at protein and transcriptional levels.
serpinb <dig>  a serpin over-expressed in injured liver and in primary liver cancer, has been shown to induce apoptosis resistance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and to increase tgf-beta and myc expression.
the presence of serpinb <dig> in the progenitor cell compartment was detected in sorted human foetal and adult epithelial cell adhesion molecule  positive liver cells.
serpinb <dig> is highly expressed in hepatic stem/progenitor cell compartment of both foetal and adult livers.
