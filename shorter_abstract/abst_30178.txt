this poses fundamental hurdles when genetic diversity is investigated.
we developed shorah, a computational method for quantifying genetic diversity in a mixed sample and for identifying the individual clones in the population, while accounting for sequencing errors.
the software was run on simulated data and on real data obtained in wet lab experiments to assess its reliability.
