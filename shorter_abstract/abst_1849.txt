overall, this paper contributes to the novel identification of  <dig> new transcripts, or near 3% of the Æ. ægypti proteome assuming a  <dig> -protein set, and to the best-described sialome of any blood-feeding insect.
most of the  <dig> proteins coded by these sg transcripts have no known function and represent high-priority candidates for expression and functional analysis as antihemostatic or antimicrobial agents.
to expand our knowledge on the salivary cocktail of Ædes ægypti, a vector of dengue and yellow fevers, we analyzed a set of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags from cdna libraries of adult female mosquitoes.
a nonredundant catalogue of  <dig> transcripts  is described, including  <dig> coding for proteins of a putative secretory nature.
additionally, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of salivary gland  homogenates followed by tryptic digestion of selected protein bands and ms/ms analysis revealed the expression of  <dig> proteins.
an unexpected finding is the occurrence of four protein families specific to sg that were probably a product of horizontal transfer from prokaryotic organisms to mosquitoes.
analysis of tissue-specific transcription of a subset of these genes revealed at least  <dig> genes whose expression is specific or enriched in female sg, whereas  <dig> additional genes were expressed in female sg and in males but not in other female tissues.
