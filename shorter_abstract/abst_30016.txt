we have developed three methods to predict whether an rna can interact with a particular rna-binding protein using support vector machines and different features based on the sequence , the motif score  and the secondary structure .
therefore, computational methods that capture the protein-dependent nature of such binding interactions could help to predict potential binding partners in silico.
sequence motifs and secondary structure information were not necessary to improve these predictions.
oli outperformed olimoss and rpiseq, confirming our protein-specific predictions and suggesting that tetranucleotide frequencies are appropriate discriminative features.
a precision-recall curve analysis achieved higher precision values for oli.
it is therefore necessary to identify the rna interaction partners in order to understand the precise functions of such proteins.
on a second experimental dataset including real negative binding information, oli outperformed rnacontext with a precision of  <dig>  vs.  <dig> .
finally we confirmed that protein-specific experimental data concerning rna-protein interactions are valuable sources of information that can be used for the efficient training of models for in silico predictions.
our experiments showed that features based on primary sequence information are sufficiently discriminating to predict specific rna-protein interactions.
