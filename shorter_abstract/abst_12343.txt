the phenotype of the c. glutamicum ipsa deletion mutant was complemented to different extend by homologs from corynebacterium diphtheriae  and mycobacterium tuberculosis , indicating the conserved function of ipsa in the pathogenic species.
further studies revealed the absence of inositol-derived lipids in the cell wall and a complete loss of mycothiol biosynthesis.

the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis of the cell wall by these pathogens are well understood, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown.
the development of new drugs against tuberculosis and diphtheria is focused on disrupting the biogenesis of the cell wall, the unique architecture of which confers resistance against current therapies.
here, we characterize ipsa, a laci-type transcriptional regulator conserved among mycobacteria and corynebacteria that plays a role in the regulation of cell wall biogenesis.
additional targets of ipsa with putative functions in cell wall biogenesis were identified and ipsa was shown to bind to a conserved palindromic motif within the corresponding promoter regions.
this characterization of ipsa function and of its regulon sheds light on the complex transcriptional control of cell wall biogenesis in the mycolata taxon and generates novel targets for drug development.
an ipsa deletion mutant of corynebacterium glutamicum cultured on glucose displayed significantly impaired growth and presented an elongated cell morphology.
