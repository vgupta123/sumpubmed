based on this model, we develop an optimization method that identifies reactions for flux capacity modifications to predict outcomes with high statistical likelihood.
we compare three optimization methods that select an intervention set comprising up- or down-regulation of reaction flux capacity: ccopt , detopt , and mcopt .
over the last several years, a number of computational methods have been described for identifying combinations of reaction modifications.
mceval shows that the optimal flux predicted based on the ccopt intervention set is more likely to be obtained, in a probabilistic sense, than the flux predicted by detopt.
the flux capacity distributions required for our methods were estimated from maximal reaction velocities or elementary mode analysis.
the intervention sets identified by ccopt and mcopt were similar; however, the exhaustive sampling required by mcopt incurred significantly greater computational cost.
in this work, we model the uncertainties as probability distributions in the flux carrying capacities of reactions.
an important step in strain optimization is to identify reactions whose activities should be modified to achieve the desired cellular objective.
maximizing tolerance to variable engineering outcomes  can identify intervention sets that statistically improve the desired cellular objective.
we present two case studies analyzing a cho cell and an adipocyte model.
we evaluate the methods using a monte carlo simulation-based method, mceval .
