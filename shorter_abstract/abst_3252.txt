the largest group of proteins comprised those involved in metabolism , followed by protein modification/turnover , redox regulation , cell structural components , stress and defence response  with fewer in other groups.
analysis of a cdna library constructed from exudate identified  <dig> unique transcripts.
proteomic analysis tentatively identified  <dig> proteins from  <dig> spots collected from 2d gels analysed by partial amino acid sequence determination using ms/ms.
this feature was exploited to document macromolecules present in exudate of white lupin , in particular to identify proteins and rna molecules, including microrna .
more prominent proteins were cyclophilin, ubiquitin, a glycine-rich rna-binding protein, a group of proteins that comprise a glutathione/ascorbate-based mechanism to scavenge oxygen radicals, enzymes of glycolysis and other metabolism including methionine and ethylene synthesis.
this is the first inventory of macromolecule composition of phloem exudate from a species in the fabaceae, providing a basis to identify systemic signalling macromolecules with potential roles in regulating development, growth and stress response of legumes.
mirna composition of exudate varied with site of collection  and nutrition .
