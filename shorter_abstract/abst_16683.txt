multi-agent systems  have been proposed as good candidates to achieve this goal.
we observed that multi-protein structures emerge and that the system behavior is very robust, in terms of the number and size of the structures generated.
there is an increasing need for computer-generated models that can be used for explaining the emergence and predicting the behavior of multi-protein dynamic structures in cells.
we have created 3dspi, a multi-agent based software that we used to explore the generation of multi-protein dynamic structures.
being based on a very restricted set of parameters, it is perfectly suited for exploring the minimal set of rules needed to generate large multi-protein structures.
furthermore, the generated structures very closely mimic spatial organization of real life multi-protein structures.
it demonstrates that robust multi-protein structures can emerge using a restricted set of parameters and allows the exploration of the dynamics of such structures.
