longum bbmn <dig> isolated from centenarianâ€™s faeces was used as a model strain to further investigate the carbohydrate utilization.
in bifidobacterial genomes, only 15% of ghs contained signal peptides, suggesting their weakness in utilization of complex carbohydrate, such as plant cell wall polysaccharides.
however, compared with other intestinal bacteria, bifidobacteiral genomes encoded more gh genes for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates, indicating that they have genetic advantages in utilizing these substrates.
it is noteworthy that all of the gh genes for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates in the bbmn <dig> genome were conserved in all studied bifidobacterial strains.
our results demonstrated that starch and starch hydrolysates were the most universal and favorable carbon sources for bifidobacteria.
in order to determine the potential substrate preference of bifidobacteria, we compared the glycoside hydrolase  profiles of a pooled-bifidobacterial genome  with a representative microbiome  of the human gut.
the low amount of these carbon sources in adult intestine was speculated to contribute to the low relative abundance of bifidobacteria.
bifidobacteria are key commensals in human gut, and their abundance is associated with the health of their hosts.
among the nutrients in human gut, starch is a highly fermentable substrate and can exert beneficial effects by increasing bifidobacteria and/or being fermented to short chain fatty acids.
the pathway for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates was the only complete pathway for complex carbohydrates in human gut.
although they are dominant in infant gut, their number becomes lower in adult gut.
the changes of the diet are considered to be main reason for this difference.
large amounts of whole-genomic sequence data of bifidobacteria make it possible to elucidate the genetic interpretation of their adaptation to the nutrient environment.
