a complete analysis of available crystal structures has been made alongside with molecular dynamics simulations of model peptides to explore a possible structural role for c <dig> .
the present study is aimed to fill up this lack of knowledge by characterizing the role of c <dig>  of the cwxp motif.
the cwxp motif of transmembrane helix  <dig>  is highly conserved in class a gpcrs.
