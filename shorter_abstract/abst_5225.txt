specifically, we investigated the size of the area that enhances responses, i.e., the grating summation field, the size of the inhibitory surround, and the distance dependence of signal coupling, i.e., the linking field.
we found that the sizes of both grating summation field and inhibitory surround increase with preferred spatial wavelength.
however, not all properties of receptive fields in v <dig> scale with preferred spatial wavelength.
size- or scale-independent representation of visual objects might be supported by processing in primary visual cortex .
spatial-wavelength independence of the linking field implies a constant spatial range of signal coupling between neurons with different preferred spatial wavelengths.
we tested whether different receptive field properties of neurons in v <dig> scale with preferred spatial wavelength.
no evidence was found that size of the linking field depends on preferred spatial wavelength.
our data show that some receptive field properties are related to preferred spatial wavelength.
our visual system enables us to recognize visual objects across a wide range of spatial scales.
neurons in v <dig> are selective for spatial frequency and thus represent visual information in specific spatial wavebands.
for the summation field this increase, however, is not strictly linear.
