these results highlight the flexibility of fungal cells in maintaining cell wall integrity and contribute to assessments of glucan remodeling as a target for therapy.
a transient up-regulation of dna replication genes associated with entry into s-phase occurred whereas cell-cycle regulating genes  were persistently up-regulated.
the transcriptional profiles revealed an increase of transcript levels for genes involved in cell wall formation , protein n-glycosylation and sorting in the er , signaling , ion transport , stress response and metabolism and a reduced expression of adhesins.
the cell wall is essential for the yeast to hypha  transition that enables candida albicans to invade human tissues and evade the immune system.
the absence of phr1p triggers an adaptive response aimed to reinforce the hyphal cell wall and restore homeostasis.

we exploited the ph-conditional nature of a phr <dig> null mutant to analyze the impact of glucan remodeling on the hyphal transcriptional program and the role of chitin synthases in the hyphal wall stress  response.
phr <dig> deletion was synthetic lethal with chs <dig> loss on solid m <dig> medium-ph  <dig>  and with chs <dig> deletion on solid m199-ph  <dig>  on spider medium, phr <dig> was synthetic lethal with chs <dig> or chs <dig> at ph  <dig>
in hyphal growth inducing conditions, phr1Δ germ tubes are defective in elongation, accumulate chitin, and constitutively activate the signaling pathways mediated by the map kinases mkc1p, cek1p and hog1p.
to test the physiological relevance of altered chs gene expression, phr1Δ chsxΔ  mutant phenotypes were analyzed during the y-h transition.
chs3p is essential in preserving phr1Δ cell integrity during the y-h transition.
our findings also unveiled an unanticipated essential role of chs8p during filamentation on solid media.
phr1p is responsible of glucan remodeling at neutral-alkaline ph and is essential for morphogenesis and virulence.
