a simple classification rule with few genes and parameters is desirable when applying a classification rule to new data.
one popular simple classification rule, diagonal discriminant analysis, yields linear or curved classification boundaries, called ripples, that are optimal when gene expression levels are normally distributed with the appropriate variance, but may yield poor classification in other situations.
the proposed classification rule for two classes selects either swirls or ripples after parsimoniously selecting the number of genes and distance measures.
the parsimonious selection of classifiers coupled with the selection of either swirls or ripples provides a good basis for formulating a simple, yet flexible, classification rule.
a simple modification of diagonal discriminant analysis yields smooth highly nonlinear classification boundaries, called swirls, that sometimes outperforms ripples.
applications to five cancer microarray data sets identified predictive genes related to the tissue organization theory of carcinogenesis.
