three different block definitions  were exploited to create simulations for block identification with Î¸ value from real genotyping data.
one region of  <dig> kb exhibiting a single strong ld value  was selected for the analysis of sample size effect on haplotype structure.
attainment of a reliable haplotype structure with  <dig> samples was not possible, although the simulation was repeated  <dig>  times.
we emphasize the importance of applying careful confidence measures when using the estimated haplotype structure in biomedical research.
the mechanisms that shape haplotypes have not been fully explored, although the effect of sample size has been implicated.
we present a close examination of the effect of sample size on haplotype blocks using an original computational simulation.
to acquire a reliable result, it would be necessary to increase sample size more than  <dig> and to repeat the simulation  <dig>  times.
a region spanning  <dig>  mb on chromosome 20q was genotyped for  <dig>  snps in  <dig> japanese subjects.
even in one genomic region showing a high ld value, the haplotype block might be fragile.
genome-wide maps of linkage disequilibrium  and haplotypes have been created for different populations.
these analyses underscored the difficulties of estimating haplotype blocks.
as a result, it was quite difficult to estimate a haplotype block for data with less than  <dig> samples.
