for assessing the performance, we used real biological samples, bacillus subtilis strains  <dig> and mgb <dig>  in the positive mode by lc-orbitrap.
our method can detect m/z values of biological samples much more accurately than other lc-ms analysis tools.
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  utilizing the high-resolution power of an orbitrap is an important analytical technique for both metabolomics and proteomics.
in the present study, we developed a novel, easy-to-use and straightforward m/z detection method, amdorap.
obtaining the accurate m/z values from raw data should be indispensable as a starting point for comparative lc-orbitrap analysis.
thus, it is necessary to convert raw data to accurate and reliable m/z values for metabolic fingerprinting by high-resolution lc-ms.
for  <dig> identified compounds by measuring the authentic compounds, we compared obtained m/z values with other lc-ms processing tools.
amdorap allows us to address the relationships between biological effects and cellular metabolites based on accurate m/z values.
most important feature of the orbitrap is excellent mass accuracy.
