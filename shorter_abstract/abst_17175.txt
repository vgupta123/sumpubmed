based on these results, testing of the oncolytic potential of attenuated semliki forest virus in canine cancer patients appears feasible.
furthermore we performed a 3-week safety study in two adult beagles which received a single intravenous injection of ~ <dig> ×  <dig> plaque forming units of parental a <dig> strain.
no adverse events were observed in either of the two virus-injected adult beagles and no infective virus could be recovered from any of the biological samples collected over the course of the study.
a non-pathogenic semliki forest virus vector va7-egfp previously showed promise in targeting human tumor xenografts in mice, but the oncolytic capacity of the virus in canine cancer cells and the safety of the virus in higher mammals such as dogs, are not known.
neutralizing antibodies to semliki forest virus became detectable in the dogs at 5 days post infection and remained elevated until study termination.

we therefore assessed the oncolytic potency of va7-egfp against canine cancer cells by infectivity and viability assays in two dog solid tumor cell lines.
