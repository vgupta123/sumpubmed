after global forebrain ischemia  with  <dig> h reperfusion , we found important neuronal lesion in the rat hippocampal ca <dig> region, which was reduced by a preceding 3-min preconditioning ischemia , whereas the preconditioning stimulus alone  had no effect.
one element believed to contribute to reduce ros production is the uncoupling protein ucp <dig> .
our first goal was to determine in rat hippocampus whether ucp <dig> protein upregulation was associated with ipc-induced protection and increased ros production.
in ghrelin experiments, the i/r+ghrelin group  showed considerable protection of ca <dig> neurons versus i/r animals, and increased hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna .
the two dissimilar protective strategies, ipc and ghrelin administration, were both associated with upregulated ucp <dig>  suggesting that ucp <dig> may often represent a final common pathway in protection from i/r.
the second goal was to determine whether the peptide ghrelin, which possesses anti-oxidant and protective properties, alters ucp <dig> mrna levels in the same way as ipc during protection.
compared to control, ucp <dig> protein labelling increased moderately in the i/r  and ipc+i/r  groups, and substantially in the ipc group .
hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna showed a moderate increase in i/r  and ipc+i/r  groups versus control, and a large increase in the ipc group .
