while several informal species groups are morphologically well defined, a lack of reliable characters for species identification considerably hampers their study.
a coalescent-based species tree and a reconstruction based on a supermatrix approach supported five of the species groups as monophyletic.
ancestral state reconstructions provided evidence for downstream diversification in at least two species groups.
our species-level analyses of five gene regions provide clearer definitions of species groups within european rhithrogena.
a downstream diversification trend in the hybrida and alpestris species groups supports a previously proposed headwater origin hypothesis for aquatic insects.
a constant speciation rate over time suggests that the paleoclimatic fluctuations, including the pleistocene glaciations, did not significantly influence the tempo of diversification of alpine species.

here we present a species-level phylogeny of rhithrogena in europe using two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene regions.
rhithrogena is well diversified in the european alps, with a number of locally endemic species, and several cryptic species have been recently detected.
to improve sampling in a genus with many cryptic species, individuals were selected for analysis according to a recent dna-based taxonomy rather than traditional nomenclature.
a molecular clock, mapped on the most resolved phylogeny and calibrated using published mitochondrial evolution rates for insects, suggested an origin of alpine rhithrogena in the oligocene/miocene boundary.
