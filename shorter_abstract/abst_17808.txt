typhoid and paratyphoid fever are endemic in china.
sixty-seven isolates of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella  showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin .
twenty-five s. typhi and  <dig> s. paratyphi were isolated from  <dig> bacteriemic patients between  <dig> and  <dig> at a hospital in shenzhen, southern china.
fifty-two percent  of s. typhi and  <dig> %  of s. paratyphi a were resistant to nalidixic acid.
sixty-four isolates of s. paratyphi a belonged to one clone.
six patients infected by s. paratyphi a had a travel history before infection.
nalidixic acid-resistant s. typhi and s. paratyphi a blood isolates were highly prevalent in shenzhen, china.
pfge showed the variable genetic diversity of nalidixic acid-resistant s. typhi and limited genetic diversity of nalidixic acid -resistant s. paratyphi a.
the objective of this investigation was to determine the molecular features of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella enteric serovar typhi  and paratyphi  from blood isolates in shenzhen, china.
twenty-two distinct pulsed field gel electrophoresis  patterns were observed among s. typhi.
all  <dig> nars isolates had a single substitution in the quinolone resistance-determining region  of gyra , and  <dig> % of these isolates carried the substitution ser83phe in gyra.
plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes including qnr and aac-ib-cr were not detected in any isolate.
