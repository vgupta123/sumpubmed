the genetic analyses revealed three ancient lineages in the north, south and centre of the species’ current range.
estimates of gene flow suggest low dispersal rates, constrained by the availability of contiguous rocky habitat.
velvet geckos  are a primary prey for the endangered broad-headed snake , which is restricted to sandstone habitats in southeastern australia.
we sequenced the nd <dig> gene from  <dig> velvet geckos, to clarify the lizards’ phylogeographic history and landscape genetics.
we also analysed  <dig> records from a longterm  capture-mark-recapture program at three sites, to evaluate dispersal rates of geckos as a function of locality, sex and body size.
