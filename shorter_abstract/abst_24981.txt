we show that the promoter region of the chicken adenosine receptor 2b gene , a known myb-target gene, acts as a dna replication origin.
the retroviral oncogene v-myb encodes a transcription factor  which is responsible for the transformation of myelomonocytic cells by avian myeloblastosis virus .
our data show that this region also acts as an origin of replication in chicken cells.
because of this finding we have asked whether other myb-regulated genes are also associated with dna replication origins.
our work raises the possibility that a fraction of myb target gene promoters is associated with dna replication origins.
furthermore, we have examined known replication origins for the presence of myb binding sites.
we found that the intergenic region between the genes for the minichromosome maintenance  <dig> protein  and the catalytic subunit of dna-dependent protein kinase , whose human counterpart has been identified as a replication origin, contains a number of myb binding sites.
we have recently demonstrated that the chicken gas <dig> gene, whose promoter co-localizes with an origin of dna replication, is a bona fide myb target gene.
our work identifies the chicken mcm <dig> gene as a novel myb target gene and presents evidence for the co-localization of two novel origins of dna replication with myb-regulated genes.
