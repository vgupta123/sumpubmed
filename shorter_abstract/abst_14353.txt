however, increased redundancy comes with minor costs in terms of increases in material allocation or decreases in conductance.
recent theoretical and empirical work has identified redundancy as one of the benefits of the reticulate form in the evolution of leaf vein networks.
here, we examined both costs and benefits to redundancy in  <dig> individual reticulate leaf networks comprising over  <dig>  million vein segments.
these results suggest the evolutionary transition to the reticulate type of networks found in modern angiosperm flora involved a relatively minor increase in material and conductance costs with significant benefits in terms of network redundancy.
we compared levels of costs and benefits within reticulate networks to those within analogous networks without loops known as maximum spanning trees .
we also show that full networks do not markedly decrease the distance to non-vein tissue in comparison to msts.
