we estimate that the selection coefficient for blindness would need to be at least  <dig>   for blindness to evolve in the model cave-organism, astyanax mexicanus.
our results indicate that strong selection is required for the evolution of blindness in cave-dwelling organisms, which is consistent with recent work suggesting a high metabolic cost of eye development.
this model captures the interaction of three forces:  selection favoring alleles causing blindness,  immigration of sightedness alleles from a surface population, and  mutations creating blindness alleles.
we investigated the dynamics of this model and determined selection-strength thresholds that result in blindness evolving in caves despite immigration of sightedness alleles from the surface.
