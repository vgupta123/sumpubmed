currently, with large amount of spectra sequenced everyday, spectra libraries containing tens of thousands of annotated experimental ms/ms spectra become available.
it uses spectra libraries as training datasets and introduces significant scores of the features used in our previous de novo sequencing method for hcd and etd spectra pairs.
this paper proposed an advanced de novo sequencing method for hcd and etd spectra pair and used information from spectra libraries and significant improved previous similar methods.

de novo peptide sequencing via tandem mass spectrometry  has been developed rapidly in recent years.
the results show that this proposed method achieves better sequencing accuracy with higher ranked correct sequences and less computational time.
in this study, an improved de novo sequencing method assisted with spectra library is proposed.
two pairs of hcd and etd spectral datasets were used to test the performance of the proposed method and our previous method.
