these expression profiles indicate a paracrine role for the two hormones.
in addition, the vasotocin gene is expressed in the kidney, rectal gland and intestine.
the vasopressin- and oxytocin-family of neurohypophysial hormones evolved in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates through tandem duplication of the ancestral vasotocin gene.
jawed vertebrates contain at least one homolog each of vasopressin and oxytocin, whereas only a vasopressin-family hormone, vasotocin, has been identified in jawless vertebrates.
the synteny of genes in the lamprey locus is conserved in elephant shark, coelacanth and tetrapods but disrupted in teleost fishes.
to trace the origin of these genes, we have sequenced bac clones from the neurohypophysial gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark , and in a jawless vertebrate, the japanese lamprey .
we have also analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in an invertebrate chordate, the amphioxus .
in contrast to the conserved linkage of the neurohypophysial genes in these vertebrates, the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has experienced extensive rearrangements in the teleost lineage.
the elephant shark neurohypophysial hormone genes encode vasotocin and oxytocin, and are linked tail-to-head like their homologs in coelacanth and non-eutherian tetrapods.
the duplicated genes were linked tail-to-head like their homologs in elephant shark, coelacanth and non-eutherian tetrapods.
vasopressin and oxytocin are mammalian neurohypophysial hormones with distinct functions.
the lamprey locus contains a single neurohypophysial hormone gene, the vasotocin.
the amphioxus locus encodes a single neurohypophysial hormone, designated as vasotocin.
these differences in the arrangement of the two genes in different bony vertebrate lineages raise questions about their origin and ancestral arrangement.
