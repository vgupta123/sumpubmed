multiple genome comparison further indicates that different groups of correlated pairs have different evolutionary courses:  the vast majority of positively-correlated pairs are old,  most of the weakly-correlated pairs are relatively young, and  negatively-correlated pairs are a mixture of old and young events.
previous studies focus on the regulation of a single cassette exon, but recent experiments indicate that multiple cassette exons within a gene may interact with each other.
however, the extent to which the cassette exons coordinate with each other remains unknown.
based on est data, we employed a metric of correlation coefficients to describe the interaction between two adjacent cassette exons and then categorized these exon pairs into three different groups by their interaction  patterns.
we performed a large-scale analysis of interactions between adjacent cassette exons.
sequence analysis demonstrates that strongly-correlated groups are more conserved and contain a higher proportion of pairs with reading frame preservation in a combinatorial manner.
additionally, the positively-correlated pairs bear strong resemblance to constitutive exons, which suggests that they may evolve from ancient constitutive exons, while negatively and weakly correlated pairs are more likely to contain newly emerging exons.
several cases of exon interaction have been discovered.
this interaction can increase the potential to generate various transcripts and adds an extra layer of complexity to gene regulation.
