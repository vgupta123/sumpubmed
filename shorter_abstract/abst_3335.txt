plant disease resistance was activated by a single streptomycete strain only.
the growth of the mycorrhiza-forming fungus laccaria bicolor was stimulated by some of the streptomycetes, and piloderma croceum was only moderately affected.
the determined patterns of streptomyces-microbe interactions were associated with distinct patterns of secondary metabolite production.
additionally, our study indicates that the streptomyces strains, which are not general antagonists of fungi, may produce still un-described metabolites.
fifteen streptomyces isolates exhibited substantial variation in inhibition of tested mycorrhizal and plant pathogenic fungi .
studies on mycorrhiza associated bacteria suggest that bacterial-fungal interactions play important roles during mycorrhiza formation and affect plant health.
