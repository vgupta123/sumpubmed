but for some other samples like transcriptomic samples, majority of the observed duplicates might be natural duplicates.
artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads may lead to incorrect interpretation of the abundance of species and genes in metagenomic studies.
we implemented a method for identification of exact and nearly identical duplicates from pyrosequencing reads.
for high-complexity metagenomic samples lacking dominant species, natural duplicates only make up <1% of all duplicates.
we compared the occurrences of the duplicates identified by our method and the natural duplicates made by independent simulations.
however, since the duplicated reads observed in a pyrosequencing run also include natural  duplicates, simply removing all duplicates may also cause underestimation of abundance associated with natural duplicates.
we observed that the duplicates, including both artificial and natural duplicates, make up 4-44% of reads.
the number of natural duplicates highly correlates with the samples' read density .
it is important not only to identify the duplicates from metagenomic datasets but also to distinguish whether they are artificial or natural duplicates.
we provide a tool to estimate the number of natural duplicates according to user-defined sample types, so users can decide whether to retain or remove duplicates in their projects.
this method can process a typical dataset in ~ <dig> minutes; it also provides a consensus sequence for each group of duplicates.
our method is available from http://cd-hit.org as a downloadable program and a web server.
