glucagon-like peptide  <dig> , peptide yy  and neuromedin u  were expressed and purified from stable cho lines; since the α-amide group is essential for full biological potency of many peptides, fc-fusion peptides were expressed in cho lines stably expressing the α-amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase .

both problems are potentially solved by producing peptides as fusions with the fc region of human immunoglobulin.
purified fusion proteins were analyzed intact and after hrv3c rhinovirus protease cleavage, at a site in the linker separating the fc region from the peptide, by mass spectrometry and amide-specific immunoassays.
cho cells express measurable endogenous pam activity, amidating 25 % of fc-pyy and almost 90 % of fc-glp <dig>  expression of exogenous pam increased the level of peptide amidation to 50 % of fc-pyy and 95 % of fc-nmu.
the fc fusions were expressed at 1– <dig>  μg/mg cell protein and secreted at 5-20 % of cell content per hour, in a peptide-specific manner.
