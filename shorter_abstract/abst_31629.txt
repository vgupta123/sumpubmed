gene family comparisons with five other eudicot species revealed  <dig>  clusters containing macadamia genes and  <dig> macadamia-specific clusters, and provides evidence for linage-specific expansion of gene families involved in pathogen recognition, plant defense and monoterpene synthesis.
the large gondwanan plant family proteaceae is an early-diverging eudicot lineage renowned for its morphological, taxonomic and ecological diversity.
this study presents the first available genomic resources for the large basal eudicot family proteaceae, access to most macadamia genes and opportunities to uncover the genetic basis of traits of importance for adaptation and crop improvement.
the gene space of macadamia provides a foundation for comparative genomics, gene discovery and the acceleration of molecular-assisted breeding.

the draft assembly has a total length of 518 mb and spans approximately 79% of the estimated genome size.
the family is a focus for studies of adaptive radiation due to remarkable species diversification in mediterranean-climate biodiversity hotspots, and numerous evolutionary transitions between biomes.
cyanogenesis is an important defense strategy in the proteaceae, and a detailed analysis of macadamia gene homologues potentially involved in cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis revealed several highly expressed candidate genes.
macadamia is the most economically important proteaceae crop and represents an ancient rainforest-restricted lineage.
