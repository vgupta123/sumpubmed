transcription factor binding site enrichment was also noted.
we have demonstrated that this chicken gene co-expression network is a useful tool in gene function prediction and the identification of putative novel transcription factors and binding sites.
this data was generated from a diverse range of experiments, including different tissues and experimental conditions.
