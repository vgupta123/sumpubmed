three live case studies in the field of plant biology are presented related to arabidopsis thaliana.
the three case studies demonstrate end user satisfaction with the system.
ferret is designed to assist bio scientists at different stages of research from early idea exploration to advanced analysis of results from bench experiments.
we present ferret, a prototype retrieval system, designed to retrieve and rank sentences  conveying gene-centric relationships of interest to a scientist.

in the first case the bzip family of genes was identified.
for example, it is designed to handle gene name ambiguity and perform query expansion.
inputs can be a list of genes with an optional list of keywords.
results are presented in the form of a heat map and sentences corresponding to specific cells of the heat map may be selected for display.
the first is to discover genes that may relate to the phenotype of open immature flower in arabidopsis.
the third case is on searching for potential gene targets of an arabidopsis transcription factor hypothesized to be involved in plant stress responses.
