frequently, a large number of models need to be compared with the target native structure.
clusco is fast and easy-to-use software for high-throughput comparison of protein models with different similarity measures  and clustering of the comparison results with standard methods: k-means clustering or hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
the main reason for the development of clusco software was to create a high-throughput tool for all-versus-all comparison, because calculating similarity matrix is the one of the bottlenecks in the protein modeling pipeline.
the development, optimization and validation of protein modeling methods require efficient tools for structural comparison.
the application was highly optimized and written in c/c++, including the code for parallel execution on cpu and gpu, which resulted in a significant speedup over similar clustering and scoring computation programs.
