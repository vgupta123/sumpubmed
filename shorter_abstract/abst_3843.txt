this information was then used to fine-map qtl identified in a cross between lh and ln rats in order to identify candidate genes causing the phenotypes.
using the sequence of the three strains, we applied an approach that harnesses the distribution of observed strain differences , or nucleotide diversity, to distinguish genomic regions of identity-by-descent  from those with divergent ancestry between the three strains.
by intersecting the identified haplotype blocks with quantitative trait loci  previously identified in a cross between lh and ln strains, the candidate qtl regions have been narrowed by 78%.
the lyon hypertensive , lyon normotensive  and lyon low-pressure  rats are inbred strains simultaneously derived from a common outbred sprague dawley colony by selection for high, normal, and low blood pressure, respectively.
we identified haplotypes that, in total, contain at least 95% of the identifiable polymorphisms between the lyon strains that are likely of differing ancestral origin.
this approach, merged with additional integrative genetics approaches, will likely lead to novel mechanisms underlying complex disease and provide new drug targets and therapies.
whole genome sequence analysis between the lh, ln, and ll strains identified the haplotype structure of these three strains and identified candidate genes with sequence variants predicted to affect gene function.
because the genome sequence has been determined, we were further able to identify putative functional variants in genes that are candidates for causing the qtl.
