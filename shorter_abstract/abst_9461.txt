ptcs were preferentially located in the terminal parts of the transcript, which generally have a lower frequency of functional domains, indicating that selection was operating against ptcs at sites central to protein function.
premature termination codons  cause mrna degradation or a truncated protein and thereby contribute to the transcriptome and proteome divergence between species.
furthermore, the density of ptc genes varied on a megabasepair scale within chromosomes and we found the density to be correlated both with indel divergence and proximity to the telomere.
the distribution of ptc genes varied between chromosomes, with y having the highest proportion.
gene ontology classification revealed that olfactory receptor genes were over represented among the ptc genes.
our results showed that the density of ptc genes fluctuated across the genome depending on the local genomic context.
in summary, 8% of the chimpanzee genes were affected by ptcs and this type of variation is likely to have an important effect on the transcript and proteomic divergence between humans and chimpanzees.
