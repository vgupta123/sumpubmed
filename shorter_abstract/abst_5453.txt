in conclusion, this paper emphasises the high variability occurring in clinicopathological variables between new-born and 30-day-old pigs, and between piglets and adult pigs.
therefore, adult laboratory reference intervals cannot be applied to piglets.
the aim of this study was to compare haematological and chemical variables in piglets of two ages and determinate age-related reference intervals for commercial hybrid young pigs.
samples were analysed using automated haematology  and chemistry analysers, and age-related reference intervals were calculated.
the tsat and tibc were significantly higher in p <dig> compared to p5; however, piglets remained iron deficient compared to adult reference intervals reported previously.

new-born piglets can represent a model for congenital and genetic diseases in new-born children.
blood samples were collected under general anaesthesia from  <dig> animals divided into five-  and 30-  day-old piglets.
it is known that piglets may have significant differences in clinicopathological results compared to adult pigs.
these results were associated with a reduction of the rbc regeneration process and the thrombopoietic response.
this study provides valuable reference data for piglets at precise ages and could be used in the future as historical control improving the reduction in animal experiments, as suggested by the 3rs principle.
