the fragmentation spectra of peptides thus identified were searched with mascot against the swiss-prot database, and the y-ion and b-ion fragmentation series subsequently analyzed for mass shifts compatible with acetylated lysine residues.
we were therefore interested in establishing the acetylation state of histone h <dig> and h <dig> in stationary and in exponential phase, since the regulation of this modification could contribute to transcriptional shut-down and chromatin compaction during semi-quiescence.
we made use of nano-spray tandem mass spectrometry to perform a precursor ion scan to detect an m/z  <dig> immonium ion, diagnostic of an nÎµ-acetylated lysine residue that allowed unambiguous identification of acetylated as opposed to tri-methylated lysine.
we found that k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> were acetylated in exponential phase , but could not detect these modifications in histones isolated from stationary phase cells at the sensitivity level of the mass spectrometer.
the involvement of histone acetylation in facilitating gene expression is well-established, particularly in the case of histones h <dig> and h <dig>  it was previously shown in saccharomyces cerevisiae that gene expression was significantly down-regulated and chromatin more condensed in stationary phase compared to exponential phase.
a significantly higher level of acetylation of these residues in exponential phase was confirmed by immuno-blotting.
we propose that de-acetylation of h4k <dig> allowed formation of condensed chromatin in stationary phase, and that acetylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> reflected the active transcriptional state of the yeast genome in exponential phase.
