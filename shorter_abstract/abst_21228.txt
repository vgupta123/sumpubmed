air laid pressed paper products that are typically used in wet wipes must be bound together so they can resist mechanical tearing during storage and use.
in this project, carbohydrates, proteins and phenolic compounds were applied to air laid, pressed paper products in order to identify potential renewable green binders that are as strong as the current commercial binders, while being organic and renewable.
these organic and renewable binders can be purchased in large quantities at low cost, require minimal reaction time and do not form viscous solutions that would clog sprayers, characteristics that make them attractive to the non-woven paper industry.
out of the twenty binders surveyed, soy protein, gelatin, zein protein, pectin and salix lignin provided comparable strength results to a currently employed chemical binder.
each potential green binder was applied to several filter paper strips and tested for strength in the direction perpendicular to the cellulose fibril orientation.
renewable resources derived from plant components could be an excellent substitute for the chemicals that are currently used as paper binders.
although chemical binders are approved by the environmental protection agency, the public is demanding products with lower carbon footprints and that are derived from renewable sources.
the paper industry is no exception.
