disruption of genes encoding a putative alcaligin biosynthesis protein  and a gene previously implicated in protein degradation  led to severe growth deficiency under iron depletion conditions.
modules of iron acquisition systems, anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation were the most noteworthy in the gene network.
genetic studies not only demonstrated the importance of iron acquisition and protein degradation for iron depletion, but also characterized a novel transcriptional factor  with a role in anaerobic energy metabolism.
we show that the iron response in s. oneidensis is a rapid process.
selected genes in the network were analyzed by genetic studies.
in this work, we integrate physiological, transcriptomics and genetic approaches to delineate the iron response of s. oneidensis.
temporal gene expression profiles were examined for iron depletion and repletion, and a gene co-expression network was reconstructed.
closer inspection of these modules revealed a transcriptional regulator  involved in iron acquisition and ten transcriptional factors involved in anaerobic energy metabolism.
disruption of a novel transcriptional factor  caused deficiency in both anaerobic iron reduction and growth with thiosulfate or tmao as an electronic acceptor, suggesting that so <dig> is required for specific branches of anaerobic energy metabolism pathways.
however, knowledge is incomplete about other biological pathways that respond to changes in iron concentration, as well as details of the responses.
using a reconstructed gene network, we identified major biological pathways that were differentially expressed during iron depletion and repletion.
bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes in each of the modules might be regulated by dna-binding proteins fur, crp and rpoh, respectively.
