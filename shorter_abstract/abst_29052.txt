oxidant-induced damage to atp production and cell membrane integrity of the microbes were quantitatively assessed.
moreover, both oxidants affected atp production and membrane integrity of the cells.
even though oxidants are able to disrupt atp production and cell membrane integrity, the degrees of damage vary among the organisms and correlate differentially with their viability.
polymorphonuclear neutrophils are a major component of the host defense against bacterial infection.
to determine to what degrees various cf pathogens resist the oxidants relative to non-cf pathogens, we compared the susceptibility of psa, sa, burkholderia cepacia , klebsiella pneumoniae , and escherichia coli  to various concentrations of h2o <dig> or hocl, in vitro.
cystic fibrosis  lung disease has a unique profile of pathogens predominated by pseudomonas aeruginosa  and staphylococcus aureus .
correlation of membrane permeability and atp levels with bacterial viability was statistically evaluated.
these microorganisms must overcome host immune defense to colonize the cf lungs.
however, the effects varied among the tested organisms and, the oxidant-mediated damage correlated differentially with the bacterial viability.
a crucial microbicidal mechanism is the production of oxidants including hydrogen peroxide  and hypochlorous acid  by neutrophils to achieve efficient bacterial killing.
the identified profile of h2o2-resistance was kp > psa > bc > ec > sa and the profile of hocl-resistance psa > sa > bc > ec > kp.
