in heterogeneous environments, sex-biased dispersal could lead to environmental adaptive parental effects, with offspring selected to perform in the same way as the parent dispersing least, because this parent is more likely to be locally adapted.
we find that the advantage of the uniparental strategy over the biparental strategy is maximal when dispersal is more strongly sex-biased and when dispersal distances of the least mobile sex are much lower than the size of the environmental patches.
moreover, the conditions for environmental adaptive maternal effects to be selected for are more easily fulfilled in plants than in animals.
the study suggests that sex-biased dispersal can help predict the direction and magnitude of environmental adaptive parental effects.
