both apec and upec isolates were used as tester and driver strains in  <dig> different sshs in order to obtain apec- and upec-specific subtraction fragments .
however, further studies on the genes that encode putative or hypothetical proteins might offer important insight into the pathogenesis of disease, as caused by these two expec.
we further determined the distribution of these tester-derived sequences in a collection of upec and apec isolates using polymerase chain reaction techniques.
suppression subtractive hybridization  strategy was used with extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  that cause avian colibacillosis  and human urinary tract infections  to determine if they possessed genes that were host and/or niche specific.
