however, paclitaxel exposure reduced the endocytic capacity of dc but reduced the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and tnfÎ±.
paclitaxel exposure led to a dose dependent increase in hla class ii expression equivalent to exposure to lipopolysaccharide , and a corresponding increase in proliferation of allogeneic t cells at the clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel.
the potential utility of dendritic cells  as cancer vaccines has been established in early trials in human cancers.
the concomitant administration of cytotoxic agents and dc vaccines has been previously avoided due to potential immune suppression by chemotherapeutics.
