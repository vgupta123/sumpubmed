over 80% coverage was obtained from distant species, including ginkgo, loblolly pine and equisetum.
herein we present a universal high-throughput, rapid pcr-based technique to amplify, sequence and assemble plastid genome sequence from diverse species in a short time and at reasonable cost from total plant dna, using the large inverted repeat region from strawberry and peach as proof of concept.
cognate primer pairs were then designed to generate ~ <dig> â€“  <dig>  kb overlapping amplicons from the inverted repeat region in  <dig> diverse genera.
100% coverage of the inverted repeat region was obtained from arabidopsis, tobacco, orange, strawberry, peach, lettuce, tomato and amaranthus.
sequence from the inverted repeat region of strawberry and peach plastome was obtained, annotated and analyzed.
the method exploits the highly conserved coding regions or intergenic regions of plastid genes.
these activities involve complicated preparatory procedures like chloroplast dna isolation or identification of the appropriate bac clones to be sequenced.
rolling circle amplification  is being used currently to amplify the chloroplast genome from purified chloroplast dna and the resulting products are sheared and cloned prior to sequencing.
using an informatics approach, chloroplast dna sequence information from  <dig> available eudicot plastomes was aligned to identify the most conserved regions.
additionally, a polymorphic region identified from gel electrophoresis was sequenced from tomato and amaranthus.
traditionally, the first step in mining the valuable information within a chloroplast genome requires sequencing a chloroplast plasmid library or bac clones.
availability of dna sequence information is vital for pursuing structural, functional and comparative genomics studies in plastids.
sequence analysis revealed large deletions in these species relative to tobacco plastome thus exhibiting the utility of this method for structural and comparative genomics studies.
