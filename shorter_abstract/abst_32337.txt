we established a multiplex approach validated and valuable for cost savings, and with the concurrent detection of  <dig> pathogens of public health concern.
leptospirosis is caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the leptospira genus and is an endemic and recurrent seasonal disease of great concern in reunion island.
in reunion island, the magnitude of chikungunya infection related symptoms was high and with over 38% of serological prevalence in the population.
this epidemics illustrated the potential threat of emerging arboviral diseases for inhabitants of reunion island and elsewhere since vectors are worldwide distributed.
simplex protocols already published were used with key modifications to implement a triplex assay which was set-up with a small reaction volume to improve cost efficiency.
