bovine sold <dig> is expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells  and is localized in the cotyledonary mesenchyme.
expressing cells and protein localization of sold <dig> coincided among the three ruminants.
both sold <dig> mrnas were also expressed in tmcs of cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes.
sold <dig> is produced specifically in the cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes in ruminants and appears to be involved in the construction of the ruminant placenta.
we examined mrna expression by chorionic fibroblasts as a measure of one of the sold <dig> functions.
sold <dig> participated in regulating nucleoredoxin and bcl2-like  <dig> expression in chorionic fibroblasts.
the mature sold <dig> proteins were localized in the mesenchymal villi of cotyledons after secretion.
bovine, ovine and caprine sold <dig> affected gene expression in mesenchymal fibroblasts in vitro; nucleoredoxin expression was upregulated and bcl2-like  <dig> was downregulated.
