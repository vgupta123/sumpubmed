a data set of  <dig> hsv- <dig> capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the proposed method.
this paper proposes a new method, based on weighted-projection matching in wavelet space for virus orientation determination.
this paper introduces a new method for orientation determination of low contrast images and highly noisy virus particles.
results show that a significant improvement, in terms of accuracy and speed, is obtained for the initial orientation estimates of noisy herpes virus images.
the results show that the proposed method reduces the amount of data needed in a reconstruction by at least  <dig> %.
an initial model of about  <dig> Å resolutions was used to generate projections of an hsv- <dig> capsid.
for a  <dig> Å resolution reconstruction of the hsv virus,  <dig>  particles are necessary.
this method is based on weighted projection matching in wavelet space, which increases the accuracy of the orientations.
a hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination.
in order to perform a 3d reconstruction of electron microscopic images of viruses, it is necessary to determine the orientation  of the 2d projections of the virus.
this may result in savings  <dig> to  <dig> man-years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing.
recently a low ph sindbis capsid was determined with the proposed method, where other methods based on the common line fail.
the projections containing high resolution information are usually very noisy.
