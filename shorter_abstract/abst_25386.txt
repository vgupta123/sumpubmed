we report the subcellular localization of the atrop <dig> protein at the plasma membrane in tobacco epidermal cells using gfp fusions.
the lox gene was induced dramatically whereas expression of npr <dig>  a gene up-regulated by sa, decreased slightly in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic plants after infection with p. infestans.
expression of this gene was maintained in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic plants after infection with p. infestans.
in conclusion, our results indicate that dn-atrop <dig> affects potato resistance to p. infestans.
small gtpases are monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.
additionally, transient and stable expression of a dominant negative form  of the arabidopsis atrop <dig> in potato led to h2o <dig> accumulation associated with the reduced development of phytophthora infestans montagne de bary and smaller lesions on infected potato leaves.
in transgenic potato lines, the transcript levels of salicylic acid  and jasmonic acid  marker genes  were analyzed.
the expression of the strboh-d gene, a nadph oxidase homologue in potato, was analyzed by rt-pcr.
