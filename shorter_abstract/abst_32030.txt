further genomic comparisons of pseudomonas-specific phages showed that these viruses could be classified according to conserved segments that appear be free from genome rearrangements, called locally collinear blocks .
based on structural genomic comparison and phylogenetic clustering, we suggest the classification of ufv-p <dig> in the luz24likevirus genus, and present a set of shared locally collinear blocks as the genomic signature for this genus.
we have presented the functional annotation of ufv-p <dig>  a new pseudomonas fluorescens phage.
the genome of the phage ufv-p <dig> is composed of bidirectional modules and presented  <dig> functionally predict orfs, forming clusters of early and late transcription.
in addition, the genome organization of the phage ufv-p <dig> was shown to be similar to that of phages pap <dig> and luz <dig> which have recently been classified as a luz24likevirus.
