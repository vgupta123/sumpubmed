however, the endogenous  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanases are heat inactivated, and the remaining high molecular weight β-glucans may cause severe problems such as increased brewer mash viscosity and turbidity.
in the barley malting process, partial hydrolysis of β-glucans begins with seed germination.
an active protein was isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies of the β-glucanase activity-containing culture supernatant.
the purified protein had a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, as determined by mass spectrometry.
this isolated protein hydrolyzed  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucan , but showed only residual activity against  <dig> -β-glucan , or no activity at all against  <dig> -β-glucan , indicating that the r. microsporus var.
the purified enzyme was highly sensitive to cu+ <dig>  but showed less or no sensitivity to other divalent ions, and was able to reduce both the viscosity and the filtration time of a sample of brewer mash.
the enzyme was able to reduce both the viscosity of the brewer mash and the filtration time, indicating its potential value for the brewing industry.
increased viscosity impairs pumping and filtration, resulting in lower efficiency, reduced yields of extracts, and lower filtration rates, as well as the appearance of gelatinous precipitates in the finished beer.
in comparison to the values determined for the mash treated with two commercial glucanases, the relative viscosity value for the mash treated with the  <dig> - <dig> -β-glucanase produced by r. microsporus var.
the zygomycete microfungus r. microsporus var.
microsporus secreted substantial amounts of β-glucanase in liquid culture medium containing  <dig> % chitin.
its molecular mass was  <dig>  kda.
