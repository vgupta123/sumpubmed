w3-18- <dig>  and shewanella denitrificans os <dig> which span the genus based on the number of genes lost in comparison to mr- <dig>  we also constructed a shewanella core model that contains the genes shared by all  <dig> sequenced strains and a few non-conserved genes associated with essential reactions.
cluster analysis of these results revealed that the mr- <dig> model is most similar to the w3-18- <dig> model, followed by the mr- <dig> and os <dig> models when considering predicted growth phenotypes.
in the first level, growth/no-growth phenotypes were predicted by the models on various carbon sources and electron acceptors.
shewanella is a genus of facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria that have highly adaptable metabolism which allows them to thrive in diverse environments.
in this work, we updated the model for shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> and constructed metabolic models for three other strains, namely shewanella sp.
constraint-based modeling is a useful tool for helping researchers gain insights into the metabolic capabilities of these bacteria.
however, a cluster analysis done based on metabolic gene content revealed that the mr- <dig> and w3-18- <dig> models are the most similar, with the mr- <dig> and os <dig> models being more distinct from these latter two strains.
however, shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> is the only strain with a genome-scale metabolic model constructed out of  <dig> sequenced shewanella strains.
model comparisons between the five constructed models were done at two levels â€“ for wildtype strains under different growth conditions and for knockout mutants under the same growth condition.
here, we showed how conga can be used to find biomass, metabolic, and genetic differences between models.
