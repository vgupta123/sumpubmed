the pipeline incorporates a network analysis of the protein-protein interactome, a flux balance analysis of the reactome, experimentally derived phenotype essentiality data, sequence analyses and a structural assessment of targetability, using novel algorithms recently developed by us.
the pipeline developed provides rational schema for drug target identification that are likely to have high rates of success, which is expected to save enormous amounts of money, resources and time in the drug discovery process.
using flux balance analysis and network analysis, proteins critical for survival of m. tuberculosis are first identified, followed by comparative genomics with the host, finally incorporating a novel structural analysis of the binding sites to assess the feasibility of a protein as a target.
we report a comprehensive in silico target identification pipeline, targettb, for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
the method has the potential to be used as a general strategy for target identification and validation and hence significantly impact most drug discovery programmes.
identification and validation of appropriate targets for designing drugs are critical steps in drug discovery, which are at present major bottle-necks.
further analyses include correlation with expression data and non-similarity to gut flora proteins as well as 'anti-targets' in the host, leading to the identification of  <dig> high-confidence targets.
a majority of drugs in current clinical use for many diseases have been designed without the knowledge of the targets, perhaps because standard methodologies to identify such targets in a high-throughput fashion do not really exist.
a thorough comparison with previously suggested targets in the literature demonstrates the usefulness of the integrated approach used in our study, highlighting the importance of systems-level analyses in particular.
