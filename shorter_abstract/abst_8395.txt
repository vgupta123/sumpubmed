in this project, we used a comparative approach to investigate the importance of tlr-related genes in comparison with other immunologically relevant genes for resistance traits in five species by associating their genomic location with previously published immune-related qtl regions.
four tlr-related genes  appear to be the most likely candidate genes underlying qtl regions which control the resistance to the same or similar pathogens in several species.
we also report medium-density rh maps for porcine chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  a comparative analysis of the positions of previously published relevant qtls allowed the identification of homologous regions that are associated with similar health traits in several species and which contain tlr related and other immunologically relevant genes.
this comparative genomic approach identified eight genes as potentially causative genes for variations of health related traits.
