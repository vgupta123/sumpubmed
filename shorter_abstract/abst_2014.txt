we analyse the genetic structure and diversity of feral cats from six locations on mainland australia, seven australian islands and samples from southeast asia and europe using microsatellite and mitochondrial dna data.
the results of the study provide an important timeframe for the impact of feral cats on native species in australia.
the islands surrounding australia may represent founding populations and are of particular interest.
a mainly european origin of feral cats in australia, with possible secondary introductions from asia following the initial establishment of cats in australia is reasonable.
we find genetic distinctiveness of australian mainland samples compared with dirk hartog island, flinders island, tasman island and cocos  island samples, and genetic similarities between some of the island populations.
on-going influx of domestic cats into the feral cat population is apparently causing the australian mainland populations to be genetically differentiated from those island populations, which likely are remnants of the historically introduced cat genotypes.
our results based on phylogeographic model selection are consistent with a european origin of cats in australia.
in australia, feral cats have caused decline and extinction of native mammals, but their time of introduction and origin is unclear.
