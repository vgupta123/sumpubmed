northern dandelion populations also showed reduced infestation by a specialized seed-eating weevil.
in addition we used four southern and four northern populations in a 8x <dig> cross-inoculation greenhouse experiment in which plants were exposed experimentally to each otherâ€™s natural field soil microbial communities.
a similar trend of reduced rust fungus infection in northern populations was observed but this trend was not statistically significant.
we tested this hypothesis in the common dandelion , a species with well-established geographic parthenogenesis, by screening prevalence and effects of several specialized pests and pathogens in natural dandelion populations.
because sexual reproduction is often considered a costly evolutionary strategy that is advantageous in the face of selection by coevolving pests and pathogens, one possible explanation for geographic parthenogenesis is that populations at higher latitudes are exposed to fewer pests and pathogens.
many species with sexual and asexual variants show a pattern of geographic parthenogenesis where asexuals have broader and higher-latitude distribution than sexuals.
the prevalence of pests and pathogens decreased along the south-to-north axis of geographic parthenogenesis.
this highlights the potential of biotic interactions in shaping patterns of geographic parthenogenesis.
