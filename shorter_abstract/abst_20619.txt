however, the molecular events triggered by twist <dig> to motivate dissemination of cancer cells are largely unknown.
here we show that twist <dig> induces the production of interleukin  <dig> , which activates matrix metalloproteinases and promotes invasion of breast epithelial and cancer cells.
blockage of il <dig> signaling by il <dig> neutralizing antibodies or receptor inhibition reduced the invasiveness of both breast epithelial and cancer cells, indicating that twist <dig> induces autonomous cell invasion by establishing an il <dig> antocrine loop.
co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the wr domain mediates the formation of a protein complex comprised of twist <dig> and the nuclear factor-kappab  subunit rela , which synergistically activates the transcriptional activity of nf-Îºb.
in this novel mechanism, twist1-mediated il <dig> transcription is induced through the twist <dig> carboxy-terminal wr  domain instead of the classic dna binding bhlh domain.
the produced il <dig> signals through an autocrine loop and promotes extracellular matrix degradation to enable cell invasion across the basement membrane.
