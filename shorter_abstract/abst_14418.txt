we aimed to resolve this by conducting a detailed analysis of the effects of damage to each brain region in the same sustained attention task used in our previous work.
in addition to operant data, video data of rats' performance during the task were also analysed.
detailed analysis revealed that the increase in omissions in pptg rats was not a consequence of motor impairment.
both lesion groups omitted trials relative to controls but the effect was milder and transient in nbm rats.
in contrast nbm rats showed evidence of inadequate lever pressing.
however, we conclude that the most parsimonious explanation for the deficit observed in pptg rats is inadequate response organization, rather than impairment in sustained attention.
however, the results of the pptg study were open to alternative interpretation.
the video data  showed reduced lever orientation in pptg lesioned rats, coupled with an increase in unconditioned behaviours such as rearing and sniffing.
previous work from this laboratory has also demonstrated that pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus  lesioned rats make more omissions on a test of sustained attention, suggesting that it might also play a role in mediating this function.
