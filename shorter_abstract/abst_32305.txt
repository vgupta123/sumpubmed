whether and how k deficient plants also alter their secondary metabolism for nutrient management and defense is not known.
up-regulation of the 13-lox pathway in response to low k was evident in increased transcript levels of several biosynthetic enzymes.
based on our results we propose that under k-deficiency plants produce oxylipins and glucosinolates to enhance their defense potential against herbivorous insects and create reversible storage for excess s and n.
here we show that k-deficient plants contain higher levels of the phytohormone jasmonic acid , hydroxy-12-oxo-octadecadienoic acids  and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  than k-sufficient plants.
k-deficient plants illustrate these strategies by inducing high-affinity k-uptake and adjusting primary metabolism.
transcript and glucosinolate profiles of k-deficient plants resembled those of herbivore attacked plants.
