within these regions, b.napus orthologs for a number of candidate adaptation genes were detected, including central circadian clock components like circadian clock- associated  <dig>  and the important flowering-time regulators flowering locus t  and fruitful .
flowering time, plant height and seed yield are strongly influenced by climatic and day-length adaptation in crop plants.
phenotypic associations were calculated in the panel over the years 2010â€“ <dig> for flowering time, plant height and seed yield in  <dig> highly diverse locations in germany, china and chile, adding up to  <dig> diverse environments in total.
we identified  <dig> genome regions associating with the onset of flowering,  <dig> with plant height,  <dig> with seed yield and  <dig> cross-trait regions with potential adaptive value.
allelic effects were additive for plant height and yield, but not for flowering time.
the results suggest that flowering time regulation within an adapted b. napus breeding pool is driven by a high number of small modulating processes rather than major transcription factors like bna.co.
gene ontology  enrichment analysis of candidate regions suggested that selection of genes involved in post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of flowering time may play a potential role in adaptation of b. napus to highly divergent environments.
the classical flowering time regulators bna.flc and bna.co were not found among the candidate regions, although both show functional variation.
