the method is simple and fast, taking only a few milliseconds to run, and works by clustering either vectors representing secondary structure elements, or buried alpha-carbon positions, using average-linkage clustering.
this study presents a novel clustering-based approach to domain identification, which works equally well on individual chains or entire complexes.
numerous computational methods exist for doing so, but most operate only on a single protein chain and many are limited to making a series of cuts to the sequence, while domains can and do span multiple chains.
the method is competitive with others, achieving 70% agreement with scop on a large non-redundant data set, and 80% on a set more heavily weighted in multi-domain proteins on which both scop and cath agree.
protein structures are comprised of modular elements known as domains.
by representing the structure as a set of points or vectors in space, it allows us to break free of any artificial limitations that other approaches may depend upon.
