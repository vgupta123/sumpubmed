in wild-type saccharomyces cerevisiae, calorie restriction accomplished by glucose limitation extends replicative lifespan in a manner that depends on sir <dig> and the nad+ salvage enzymes, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase and nicotinamidase.
the results constrain the possible mechanisms by which calorie restriction may regulate sir <dig> and suggest that provision of vitamins and calorie restriction extend lifespan by different mechanisms.
hydrophilic interaction chromatography followed by tandem electrospray mass spectrometry were used to identify the  <dig> compounds that constitute the core nad+ metabolome and  <dig> related nucleosides and nucleotides.
though alterations in the nad+ to nicotinamide ratio and the nad+ to nadh ratio are anticipated by models to account for the effects of calorie restriction, the nature of a putative change in nad+ metabolism requires analytical definition and quantification of the key metabolites.
