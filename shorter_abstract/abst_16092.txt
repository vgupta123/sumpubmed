functional groups contained in this de gene list include metabolic proteins , mitochondrial proteins , oxidative status  and cholesterol homeostasis .
this analysis clearly points to alterations in progesterone signalling  as the major driver.
application of a virtual muscle model to gene expression data pointed to a coordinated reduction in slow twitch muscle isoforms of the contractile apparatus , consistent with diminishment in associated slow machinery  in the high fe animals.
we contrast the pectoralis muscle transcriptomes of broilers selected from within a single genetic line expressing divergent feed efficiency  in an effort to improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of fe.
surprisingly, we found that the expression of  <dig> genes encoding the broiler mitoproteome is modestly–but significantly–biased towards the high fe group, suggesting a slightly elevated mitochondrial content.
we applied a differential network method  whose aim is to use patterns of differential co-expression to detect regulatory molecules transcriptionally rewired between the groups.
we show the progesterone receptor localises to the mitochondria in a quail muscle cell line.
because the progesterone receptor can localise to avian mitochondria, our data continue to point to muscle mitochondrial metabolism as an important component of the phenotypic expression of variation in broiler fe.
