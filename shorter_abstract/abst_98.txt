cloning of the tet gene mediated resistance to second generation tetracyclines in c. glutamicum, indicating that it might be responsible for the failure of minocycline therapies in patients with c. resistens bacteremia.
the complete genome sequence of c. resistens dsm  <dig> was determined by pyrosequencing to identify genes contributing to multi-drug resistance, virulence, and the lipophilic lifestyle of this newly described human pathogen.
corynebacterium resistens was initially recovered from human infections and recognized as a new coryneform species that is highly resistant to antimicrobial agents.
the genome encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes ensuring the availability of exogenous fatty acids for growth, including predicted virulence factors that probably contribute to fatty acid metabolism by damaging host tissue.
plasmid pja <dig> revealed a modular architecture of gene regions that contribute to the multi-drug resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  the tet gene encoding a ribosomal protection protein is reported here for the first time in corynebacteria.
the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> consists of a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp in size and the  <dig> -bp plasmid pja <dig>  metabolic analysis showed that the genome of c. resistens dsm  <dig> lacks genes for typical sugar uptake systems, anaplerotic functions, and a fatty acid synthase, explaining the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species.
the detected gene repertoire of c. resistens dsm  <dig> provides insights into the lipophilic lifestyle and virulence functions of this newly recognized pathogen.
plasmid pja <dig> harbors several genes contributing to antibiotic resistance of c. resistens dsm  <dig>  including a tetracycline resistance region of the tet w type known from lactobacillus reuteri and streptococcus suis.
the tet gene of pja <dig> was cloned in corynebacterium glutamicum and was shown to confer high levels of resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline in vitro.
bacteremia associated with this organism in immunocompromised patients was rapidly fatal as standard minocycline therapies failed.
