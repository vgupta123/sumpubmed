these results indicate that egfp expression is controlled by the penk <dig> promoter, which contains cyclic amp-responsive elements.
to develop a new tool for the identification of in vitro enkephalinergic neurons and to analyze enkephalin promoter activity, we generated transgenic mice for a bacterial artificial chromosome .
enkephalinergic neurons from these mice expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of the preproenkephalin  gene  promoter.
the penk1-egfp bac transgenic mouse contributes to the further characterization of enkephalinergic neurons in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information.
enkephalins are endogenous opiates that are assumed to modulate nociceptive information by mediating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, including the spinal dorsal horn.
these results suggest that egfp-positive neurons in laminae i-ii coexpress enkephalin and Î³-aminobutyric acid , and are activated by forskolin and in conditions of nerve injury.
these data indicate that ppe expression is affected by peripheral nerve injury.
egfp-positive neurons were distributed throughout the gray matter of the spinal cord, and were primarily observed in laminae i-ii and v-vii, in a pattern similar to the distribution pattern of enkephalin-containing neurons.
incubation in the presence of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, increased the number of egfp-positive neurons.
sections obtained from sciatic nerve-ligated mice exhibited increased egfp-positive neurons on the ipsilateral  compared with the contralateral .
