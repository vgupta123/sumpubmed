in order to identify individual genes or networks that may be myostatin targets, we looked for genes that were differentially expressed between dm and normal  animals  in the semitendinosus muscle  at  <dig> days of fetal development .
these data highlight features indicating that dm muscle is shifted towards a more glycolytic metabolism, and has an altered extracellular matrix composition  and decreased adipocyte differentiation .
the genes down-regulated in dm fetuses were mainly those encoding extracellular matrix proteins, slow contractile proteins and ribosomal proteins.
the altered gene expression in the three major muscle compartments  is consistent with the well-known characteristics of dm cattle.
the genes up-regulated in dm fetuses were mainly involved in the regulation of transcription, cell cycle/apoptosis, translation or dna metabolism.
double-muscled  cattle have a loss-of-function mutation in their myostatin gene responsible for the hypermuscular phenotype.
thus, the myostatin loss-of-function mutation affected several physiological processes involved in the development and determination of the functional characteristics of muscle tissue.
many genes were found to be differentially expressed according to genetic type , and according to the presence of one or two functional myostatin allele.
