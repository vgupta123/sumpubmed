analysis of  <dig> m. hominis isolates revealed that the vaa upstream region was conserved whereas the downstream region was highly variable.
mapping of vaa on existing physical maps of five m. hominis isolates by pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that vaa is located in a genomic region containing the majority of other characterized membrane protein genes of m. hominis.
sequencing of an  <dig> kb region containing the vaa locus of m. hominis isolate  <dig> showed the presence of conserved housekeeping genes at the borders of the region, uvra upstream and the hitabl operon downstream to vaa.
the high variability level of the locus indicate that it is a chromosomal 'hot spot', presumably important for sustaining diversity and a high adaptation potential of m. hominis.
compellingly, the conserved upstream region and variable downstream region of vaa correlates with the genetic structure of vaa itself which consists of a conserved 5' end and a variable 3' end containing a variable number of exchangeable sequence cassettes.
our data demonstrate that the vaa locus contains a divergent genetic islet, and indicate pronounced intraspecies recombination.
we have analysed the structure of the vaa locus to elucidate the genetic basis for variation of vaa.
