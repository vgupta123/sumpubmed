in this study we undertook to address both of these matters using the zero-magnesium sle model in neocortical slices.
sle amplitude was the single most important variable correlating with slice viability, with a value less than 50 μv indicative of tissue unlikely to be able to sustain population activity for more than 30–60 minutes.
in conclusion, the findings confirm that the amplitude of population activity is a suitable field potential parameter for judging brain slice viability — and can be applied independent of the mechanism of tissue activation.
using zero-magnesium sle activity as the output parameter, we investigated: 1) changes in the pattern  of sle activity as slice health either deteriorated; or was compromised by altering the preparation methodology and; 2) in quiescent tissue, whether the triggering of high frequency field activity following electrode insertion predicted subsequent development of sle activity — and hence slice viability.
furthermore, a method for gauging the viability of quiescent tissue, in which sle activity is intentionally suppressed, has not been documented.
in quiescent slices, an increase in high frequency field activity immediately after electrode insertion predicted the development of sle activity in 100% of cases.
furthermore, the magnitude of the increase in spectral power correlated with the amplitude of succeeding sle activity .
