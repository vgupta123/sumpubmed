u•g mismatches occur spontaneously throughout the genome, where they are repaired by factors associated with the base excision repair pathway.
these results show that faithful repair of u•g can be carried out by either the mismatch repair or base excision repair pathways.
u•g mismatches are also the initiating lesion in immunoglobulin gene diversification, where they undergo mutagenic processing by redundant pathways, one dependent upon uracil excision and the other upon mismatch recognition by mutsα.
this contrasts with ung, which readily excises u opposite either a or g. repair of u•g by mutsα depends upon dna polymerase δ , atp, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen , all properties of canonical mismatch repair.
faithful repair by either pathway is comparably efficient, suggesting that mismatch repair and base excision repair share the task of faithful repair of genomic uracil.
thus, the redundant functions of these pathways in immunoglobulin gene diversification reflect their redundant functions in faithful repair.
using a biochemical assay for mismatch repair, we show that mutsα can promote efficient and faithful repair of u•g mismatches, but does not repair u•a pairs in dna.
