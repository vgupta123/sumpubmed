the increased floral longevity and high pollination efficiency operated as compensatory mechanisms to counteract low pollinator visitation frequency.
plants may adapt to alpine habitats by specialization in the reproductive strategy and functional aspects of their flowers and pollination systems.
alpine habitats reduce the opportunities for cross-pollination in a relatively high proportion of alpine plant species, and self-pollination may be favored in these adverse conditions.
the species is fully self-compatible but employs a predominantly outcrossing mating system according to parentage analysis .
analyses of floral morphology, observation of plant-pollinator interactions, and hand pollination experiments were conducted in three natural populations.
here, we investigated the mating system and pollination of incarvillea mairei, a perennial himalayan herb typically found at altitudes between  <dig> and 4500Â m.
incarvillea mairei displayed a set of apparently specialized floral traits, the stigma is sensitive to touch and close immediately and its reopening allows a second opportunity for the receipt of pollen.

outcrossing rates and effective numbers of pollen donors were assessed in  <dig> open-pollinated families by using progeny analysis based on seven microsatellite markers.
floral features such as having a sensitive stigma and anther-prongs, in conjunction with pollinator behavior, function together contributing to a set of unique reproductive adaptations that enhance outcrossing success.
