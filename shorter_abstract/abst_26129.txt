we have performed a sequence survey project resulting in  <dig> expressed sequence tags  corresponding to  <dig> unique clones,  <dig> genome survey sequences , and eleven finished contigs from the diplomonad fish parasite spironucleus salmonicida .
rigorous phylogenomic analyses identified  <dig> genes – mostly encoding metabolic proteins – that have been acquired by diplomonads or their relatively close ancestors via lateral gene transfer .
although most acquisitions were from prokaryotes, more than a dozen represent likely transfers of genes between eukaryotic lineages.
our results highlight the power of comparative genomic studies to yield insights into the biology of parasitic protists and the evolution of their genomes, and suggest that genetic exchange between distantly-related protist lineages may be occurring at an appreciable rate in eukaryote genome evolution.
strikingly different patterns of codon usage were observed in genes corresponding to frequently sampled ests versus genes poorly sampled, indicating that translational selection is influencing the codon usage of highly expressed genes.
a number of genomic properties that distinguish s. salmonicida from its human parasitic relative g. lamblia were identified such as nineteen putative lineage-specific gene acquisitions, distinct mutational biases and codon usage and distinct polyadenylation signals.
comparative genomic studies of the mitochondrion-lacking protist group diplomonadida  has been lacking, although giardia lamblia has been intensively studied.
