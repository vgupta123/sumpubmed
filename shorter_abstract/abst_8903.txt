however, no comprehensive analysis of the tcp family in watermelon  has been undertaken previously.
furthermore, phylogenetic and structural analyses distinguished two homology classes within the cltcp family, designated class i and class ii.
the plant-specific tcp transcription factor family, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, performs diverse functions in multiple aspects of plant growth and development.
the functions of two cltcp genes, cltcp14a and cltcp <dig>  in regulating plant height were confirmed by ectopic expression in arabidopsis wild-type and ortholog mutants.
the class ii genes were differentiated into two subclasses, the cin subclass and the cyc/tb <dig> subclass.
this study represents the first genome-wide analysis of the watermelon tcp gene family, which provides valuable information for understanding the classification and functions of the tcp genes in watermelon.
