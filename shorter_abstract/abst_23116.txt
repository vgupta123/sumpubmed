the intensive microbial community presents in these systems can be used as a pond water quality treatment system, and the microbial protein can serve as a feed additive.
biofloc technology , a rearing method with little or no water exchange, is gaining popularity in aquaculture.
the main objective of the present study was to investigate microbial diversity of samples obtained from different culture environments  as well as from the intestines of shrimp reared in both environments through high-throughput sequencing technology.
analyses of the bacterial community identified in water from bft and “clear seawater”  systems  containing the shrimp litopenaeus stylirostris revealed large differences in the frequency distribution of operational taxonomic units .
the current problem with bft is the difficulty of controlling its bacterial community composition for both optimal water quality and optimal shrimp health.
four out of the five most dominant bacterial communities were different in both culture methods.
a correlation was found between bacteria groups and physicochemical and biological parameters measured in rearing tanks.
indeed, the biofloc environment modified the shrimp intestine microbiota, as the low level  of similarity between intestinal bacterial communities from the two treatments.
in the water column, such systems develop conglomerates of microbes, algae and protozoa, together with detritus and dead organic particles.
