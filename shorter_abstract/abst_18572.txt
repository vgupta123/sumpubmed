vertebrate genomes contain numerous duplicate genes, many of which are organised into paralagous regions indicating duplication of linked groups of genes.
we demonstrate two further paralogous regions in the human genome, and identify orthologous regions in mammalian, chicken, frog and teleost genomes, timing the duplications to before the separation of the actinopterygian and sarcopterygian lineages.
comparison of genomic organisation in different lineages can often allow the evolutionary history of such regions to be traced.
however in contrast to the hox genes, only two clusters of paralogous fox genes have so far been identified in the human genome and the organisation in other vertebrates is unknown.
to uncover the evolutionary history of the fox clusters, we report on the comparative genomics of these loci.
comparison of loci identifies the pattern of gene duplication, loss and cluster break up through multiple lineages, and suggests foxs <dig> is a likely remnant of fox cluster duplication.
an additional fox class, foxs, was also found to reside in this duplicated genomic region.
