the genomes of b. longum strains that were capable of utilizing l-fucose harboured two gene regions that encoded enzymes predicted to metabolize l-fucose to l-lactaldehyde, the precursor of  <dig> -pd, via non-phosphorylated intermediates.
suis bsm11- <dig> and b. kashiwanohense strains grew in the presence of 2′-fl and 3′- fl.
the two species that predominate the infant bifidobacteria community, bifidobacterium longum subsp.
all b. longum isolates utilized the l-fucose moiety, while b. kashiwanohense accumulated l-fucose in the supernatant.
we further investigated metabolites formed during l-fucose and fucosyllactose utilization, and aimed to identify genes and pathways involved through genome comparison.
human milk oligosaccharides  are one of the major glycan source of the infant gut microbiota.
infantis and were highly similar to b. kashiwanohense α-fucosidases .
<dig> -propanediol  was the major metabolite from l-fucose fermentation, and was formed in equimolar amounts by b. longum isolates.
the two α-fucosidases of b. longum subsp.
suis were 78–80 % similar to b. longum subsp.
for the first time, strains of b. longum subsp.
infantis and an isolate of b. longum subsp.
infantis tpy11- <dig> harboured four α-fucosidases with 95–99 % similarity to the type strain.
b. kashiwanohense dsm  <dig> and pv20- <dig> possessed three and one α-fucosidase, respectively.
recently bifidobacteria were obtained from the stool of six month old kenyan infants including species such as bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, and bifidobacterium pseudolongum that are not frequently isolated from infant stool.
here we observed that the ability to utilize fucosyllactose is a trait of various bifidobacteria species.
infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum, possess an arsenal of enzymes including α-fucosidases, sialidases, and β-galactosidases to metabolise hmos.
