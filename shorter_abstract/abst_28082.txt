we show that les phages are capable of horizontal gene transfer by infecting p. aeruginosa strains from different sources and that type iv pili are required for infection by all three phages.
the liverpool epidemic strain  is transmissible, capable of superseding other p. aeruginosa populations and is associated with increased morbidity.
les phages confer a competitive advantage in a rat model of chronic lung infection and may, therefore underpin les prevalence.

in the pao <dig> host background, the lesφ <dig> prophage conferred immunity against lesφ <dig> infection and reduced susceptibility to lesφ <dig> infection.
each prophage was less stable in the pao <dig> chromosome with substantially higher rates of spontaneous phage production than when residing in the native lesb <dig> host.
here the infective properties of three les phages were characterised.
our data suggest that lesφ <dig> is more sensitive to induction into the lytic cycle or has a more efficient replicative cycle than the other les phages.
lytic production of lesφ <dig> was considerably higher than that of lesφ <dig> and lesφ <dig>  each phage was capable of both lytic and lysogenic infection of the susceptible p. aeruginosa host, pao <dig>  producing phage-specific plaque morphologies.
