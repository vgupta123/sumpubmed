taken together, our findings indicate that even common and apparently ecologically well-studied species may consist of reproductively isolated units, with distinct evolutionary histories and likely different ecology and evolutionary potential.
we tested for cryptic genetic variation within the broadly distributed alpine mayfly baetis alpinus across several major european drainages in the central alps.
furthermore, the two lineages differed in relative abundance, overall levels of genetic diversity as well as patterns of population structure: lineage a was abundant, widely distributed and had a higher level of genetic variation, whereas lineage b was less abundant, more prevalent in spring-fed tributaries than glacier-fed streams and restricted to high elevations.
these findings emphasize the need to investigate hidden diversity even in well-known species to allow for appropriate assessment of biological diversity and conservation measures.
subsequent morphological analyses revealed that traits previously acknowledged as intraspecific variation of b. alpinus in fact segregated these two lineages.
many species contain evolutionarily distinct groups that are genetically highly differentiated but morphologically difficult to distinguish .
