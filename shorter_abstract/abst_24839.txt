in contrast, we view evolution to dengue haemorrhagic fever as the behaviour of a complex dynamic system.
we therefore, analyse the combined effect of multiple cytokines that interact dynamically with each other in order to generate a mathematical model to predict occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever.
trapezoidal membership functions are developed for each of the cytokine parameters and the degree of unfavourability to attain dengue haemorrhagic fever is measured.
sensitivity analysis indicates that this is a robust mathematical model.
the results show a robust mathematical model that explains the evolution from dengue to its serious forms in individual patients with high accuracy.
the majority of previous studies have analysed the association of individual cytokines with clinical disease severity.
the accuracy of this model in predicting severity level of dengue is  <dig> % at 96 h from the onset of illness,  <dig> % at 108 h and  <dig> % at 120 h. a region of ambiguity is detected in the model for the value range  <dig>  to  <dig> .
inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, contribute to its evolution from an asymptotic infection to severe forms of dengue.
dengue causes considerable morbidity and mortality in sri lanka.
their interactions are mapped using fuzzy logic mechanisms with the combination of modified hamacher and owa operators.
