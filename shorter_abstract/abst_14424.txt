automatic and reference-free particle picking is an important first step in a visual proteomics analysis of cell tomograms.
cryo-electron tomography is an important tool to study structures of macromolecular complexes in close to native states.
a whole cell cryo electron tomogram contains structural information of all its macromolecular complexes.
we present a framework to generate crowded mixtures of macromolecular complexes for realistically simulating cryo electron tomograms including noise and image distortions due to the missing-wedge effects.
to develop these methods it is crucial to realistically simulate tomograms of crowded cellular environments, which can then serve as ground truth models for assessing and optimizing methods for detection of complexes in cell tomograms.
however, cell cytoplasm is highly crowded, which makes particle detection challenging.
over a wide range of increasing noise levels, the dog particle picking performance remained stable, but dramatically reduced beyond a specific noise threshold.
here, we present a framework for simulating tomograms of cellular environments at high crowding levels and assess the dog particle picking method.
we determined optimal parameter settings to maximize the performance of the dog particle-picking method.
to further improve performance, we propose a combination strategy for integrating results from multiple parameter settings.
simulated tomograms are then used for assessing the template-free difference-of-gaussian  particle-picking method to detect complexes of different shapes and sizes under various crowding and noise levels.
