the present study investigated estrogen-mediated modulation of two voltage-gated potassium channel  subunits, kv <dig>  and kv <dig> , that are expressed predominantly in pvn neurons and the functional current of kv <dig>  and kv <dig> , the transient outward potassium current .
specifically, pvn neurons projecting to the rostral ventrolateral medulla  play a regulatory role in the determination of the sympathetic outflow in the cardiovascular system.
these findings demonstrate that e <dig> exerts an inhibitory effect on the functions of ia, potentially by selectively down-regulating kv <dig>  but not kv <dig>  in pvn-rvlm neurons distributed in a specific parvocellular subdivision.
in the pvn-rvlm neurons, the estrogen receptor β is expressed.
however, to date, the effects of estrogen on pvn-rvlm neurons have not been reported.
single-cell real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that 17β-estradiol  replacement  selectively down-regulated kv <dig>  mrna levels in the pvn-rvlm neurons of ovariectomized female rats.
e <dig> also shortened a delay in the excitation of the pvn-rvlm neurons.
