as such, weeds offer a case study to ask how specialization relates to abundance and distribution of species in relation to the varying disturbance regimes occurring in arable crops.
it is also sensitive to disturbance regime and we show here that recent changes in agricultural practices, i.e.
this study shows that the concept of generalist/specialist species is particularly relevant to understand the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the evolution of plant community composition and that ecological theories developed in stable environments are valid in highly disturbed environments such as agro-ecosystems.
we used data derived from an extensive national monitoring network of approximately  <dig> arable fields scattered across france to quantify the degree of specialisation of  <dig> weed species using six different ecological methods.
we then explored the impact of the level of disturbance occurring in arable fields by comparing the degree of specialisation of weed communities in contrasting field situations.
the approach developed here to classify arable weeds according to the breadth of their ecological niche is robust and applicable to a wide range of organisms.
when applied on a large-scale data set across france, this classification highlighted that monoculture harbour significantly more specialists than crop rotations, suggesting that crop rotation increases abundance of generalist species rather than sets of species that are each specialised to the individual crop types grown in the rotation.
increased levels of disturbance have favoured the most generalist species, hence leading to biotic homogenisation in arable landscapes.
