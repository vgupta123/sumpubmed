the data show that pigs may provide a new animal model for detailed analysis of the developmental functions of the psens.
here we describe the sequencing, chromosomal mapping, and polymorphism analysis of psen <dig> and psen <dig> in the domestic pig .
the porcine presenilin proteins showed a high degree of homology over their entire sequences to the psens from mouse, bovine, and human.
psen <dig> and psen <dig> transcription was examined during prenatal development of the brain stem, hippocampus, cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum at embryonic days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which revealed distinct temporal- and tissue-specific expression profiles.
furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of psen <dig> and psen <dig> showed similar localization of the proteins predominantly in neuronal cells in all examined brain areas.
