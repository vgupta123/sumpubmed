the majority of larvae injected with tc007490/d2r dsrna died during larval stage prior to entering pupal stage, suggesting that this gpcr is essential for larval growth and development.
in this study, we employed functional genomics methods and used the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, as a model system to study the physiological roles of gpcrs during the larval growth, molting and metamorphosis.
a total of  <dig> non-sensory gpcrs were identified in the t. castaneum genome.
the results from our study revealed the physiological roles of some gpcrs in t. castaneum.
however, there is no commercial pesticide targeting insect gpcrs.
these findings could help in development of novel pesticides targeting these gpcrs.
