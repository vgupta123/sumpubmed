the mitotic exit network  is a group of proteins that form a signaling cascade that is essential for cells to exit mitosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
we have determined by peptide library selection and phosphosite array screening that the protein kinase dbf2-mob <dig> preferentially phosphorylated substrates that contain an rxxs motif.
these proteins are enriched for rxxs motifs, and may include substrates that mediate the function of dbf2-mob <dig> in mitotic exit and cytokinesis.
the relatively low degree of sequence restriction at the site of phosphorylation suggests that dbf <dig> achieves specificity by docking its substrates at a site that is distinct from the phosphorylation site
this specificity determined for peptide substrates was also evident in many of the proteins phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> in a proteome chip analysis.
using a combination of peptide library selection, phosphorylation of opitmal peptide variants, and screening of a phosphosite array, we found that dbf2-mob <dig> preferentially phosphorylated serine over threonine and required an arginine three residues upstream of the phosphorylated serine in its substrate.
