six loci, encoding c4h, 4cl <dig>  4cl <dig>  c3h, f5h, and cad, displayed different levels of nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium  possibly reflecting different levels of selection.
while the number of lines included in this study limit the power of the association analysis, our results imply that genetic variation for forage quality traits can be mined in phenylpropanoid pathway genes of elite breeding lines of maize.
associations with forage quality traits were identified for several individual polymorphisms within the 4cl <dig>  c3h, and f5h genomic fragments when controlling for both overall population structure and relative kinship.
forage quality of maize is influenced by both the content and structure of lignins in the cell wall.
in the present study we have amplified partial genomic fragments of six putative phenylpropanoid pathway genes in a panel of elite european inbred lines of maize  contrasting in forage quality traits.
a 1-bp indel in 4cl <dig> was associated with in vitro digestibility of organic matter , a non-synonymous snp in c3h was associated with ivdom, and an intron snp in f5h was associated with neutral detergent fiber.
biosynthesis of monolignols, constituting the complex structure of lignins, is catalyzed by enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway.
