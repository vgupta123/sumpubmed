sam domains share a common fold and mediate protein-protein interactions in a wide variety of proteins.
when expressed in mammalian cells, nkd localized to the plasma membrane, while kd showed a more diffuse cytosolic localization.
increasing the local concentration of purified ack <dig> kinase domain at the surface of lipid vesicles stimulated autophosphorylation and catalytic activity, consistent with a requirement for dimerization and trans-phosphorylation for activity.
a minimal construct comprising the n-terminus and kinase domain  was autophosphorylated, while the kinase domain alone  was not.
here, we addressed the importance of the ack <dig> sam domain in kinase activity.
