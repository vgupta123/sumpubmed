however, ncr expression is not associated with nodule senescence.
the ncr genes are activated in successive waves during nodule organogenesis, correlated with bacterial infection of the nodule cells and with a specific spatial localization of their transcripts from the apical to the proximal nodule zones.
together, these data show that the ncr gene expression is subject to an extreme tight regulation and is only activated during nodule organogenesis in the polyploid symbiotic cells.
according to their shannon entropy, a measure expressing tissue specificity of gene expression, the ncr genes are among the most specifically expressed genes in m. truncatula.
we find that all but five of these genes are expressed in nodules but in no other plant organ or in response to any other biotic interaction or abiotic stress tested.
the ncr gene family is extremely large in medicago with about  <dig> genes.
here we used the medicago truncatula gene expression atlas  and other published microarray data to analyze the expression of  <dig> ncr genes in  <dig> different experimental conditions.

the rhizobia are located intracellularly in the symbiotic nodule cells.
during symbiosis, none of the genes are induced by nod factors.
moreover, when activated in nodules, their expression level is among the highest of all genes.
