results of the present study suggest that the word-related n <dig> can still be modulated in adulthood as a result of the improvements in literacy skills.
for untrained functional illiterates and regular readers no changes in literacy skills or n <dig> amplitude were observed.
event-related brain potentials were recorded from  <dig> functional illiterates receiving intensive literacy training for adults,  <dig> functional illiterates not participating in the training and  <dig> regular readers while they read words, pseudowords or viewed symbol strings.
event-related brain potentials  were used to investigate training-related changes in fast visual word recognition of functionally illiterate adults.
attending intensive literacy training was associated with improvements in reading and writing skills and with an increase of the word-related n <dig> amplitude.
