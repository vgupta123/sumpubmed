discons is an openly accessible sequence analysis tool that identifies and highlights structurally disordered segments of proteins where the conformational flexibility is conserved across homologs, and therefore potentially functional.
however, in the case of many idps, the lack of evolutionary conservation of the primary sequence can hamper the study of functionality, because the conservation of their disorder profile and ensuing function may not appear in a traditional analysis of the evolutionary history of the protein.
discons therefore helps with elucidating the function arising from the disordered state by analyzing individual proteins as well as large-scale proteomics datasets.
here we present discons , a novel pipelined tool that combines the quantification of sequence- and disorder conservation to classify disordered residue positions.
the tool is freely available both as a web application and as stand-alone source code hosted at http://pedb.vib.be/discons.
analyzing the amino acid sequence of an intrinsically disordered protein  in an evolutionary context can yield novel insights on the functional role of disordered regions and sequence element.
