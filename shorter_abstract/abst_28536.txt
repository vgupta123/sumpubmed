we propose that the iranian plateau is home to two more taxonomic units displaying complex primary and secondary relationships with their long recognized neighbours.
based on correspondence analysis, distance and allele-sharing trees, we find a good coherence between geographical origin and genetic make-up of the populations.
in addition to samples with clear affiliation to m. m. musculus and m. m. domesticus, we find two genetic groups in central and south east iran, which are as distinct from each other as they are from the south-east asian m. m. castaneus.
we thus confirm the clear distinction of the three best described peripheral subspecies, m. m. musculus, m. m. domesticus and m. m. castaneus.
the phylogeography of the house mouse , an emblematic species for genetic and biomedical studies, is only partly understood, essentially because of a sampling bias towards its most peripheral populations in europe, asia and the americas.

a large diversity was found in the iranian populations, which have had an unclear taxonomic status to date.
