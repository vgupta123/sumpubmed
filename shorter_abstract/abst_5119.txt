phenotypic analysis of the xcm <dig> mutant reveals concomitant premature termination of floral shoots with frequent bifurcation of the shoot apices, stems, and flowers.
we propose that the ccs52a <dig> gene is a mediator that functions together with meristematic genes to regulate meristem organization, and cross-functions with chromatin regulators in cell cycle progression during shoot apical meristem development.
genetic studies indicated that the ccs52a <dig> gene functions together with wuschel  and clavata <dig>  in regulating the development of the shoot meristem, and also contributes to this regulation together with the chromatin remodeling pathway.
cell division and cell fate decisions regulate organ formation and function in plant growth and development.
in this study, we address these questions by analysis of a shoot apex defective mutant, namely xcm <dig>
it is still unclear how specific meristematic regulatory networks operate with the cell cycle machinery to translate stem cell identity and maintenance into cellular behavior.
microscopic observations show irregular cell organization in shoot apical meristems of xcm <dig>  positional cloning revealed that xcm <dig> is a loss of function allele of the ccs52a2/fzr <dig> gene, which has previously been implicated in root development.
in addition, fewer xcm <dig> cells express cyclin b1: <dig>  showing that cell cycle progression is disrupted in the mutant.
