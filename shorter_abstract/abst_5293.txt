in plants, 14-3- <dig> proteins have major roles as regulators of nitrogen and carbon metabolism, conclusions based on the studies of a few specific 14-3- <dig> targets.
in addition, we demonstrated that 14-3- <dig> proteins interacted with one isocitrate dehydrogenase and two malate dehydrogenases.
taken together, our findings indicate that 14-3- <dig> proteins play roles as crucial tuners of multiple primary metabolic processes including tca cycle and the shikimate pathway.
there were also changes in the levels of aromatic compounds and the activities of shikimate dehydrogenase, which participates in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds.
these modifications were related to the reduced activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, which are key enzymes of tca cycle.
in this study, extensive novel roles of 14-3- <dig> proteins in plant metabolism were determined through combining the parallel analyses of metabolites and enzyme activities in 14-3- <dig> overexpression and knockout plants with studies of protein-protein interactions.
