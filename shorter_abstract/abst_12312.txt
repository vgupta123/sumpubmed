besides these strong overall similarities, wild boar and domestic pig lfa- <dig> differ by  <dig>  and  <dig> or  <dig>  substitutions, of which one is located in the crucial i-domain .
as most wild boars are seropositive to the rtx toxin-producing bacterium actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and because they have sustained continuous natural selection, future studies addressing the functional impact of these polymorphisms could bring interesting new information on the physiopathology of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae-associated pneumonia in domestic pigs.
predicted cd11a and cd <dig> subunits share all the main structural characteristics of their mammalian homologues, with a larger interspecies conservation for the cd <dig> than the cd11a.
this study reports the sequencing of the wild boar beta2-integrin cd11a and cd <dig> cdnas.
