using gold standard sets of protein complexes and protein function and localization annotations, we show our algorithm achieved an overall improvement over previous algorithms in terms of precision, recall, and biological relevance of the predicted complexes.
the algorithm uses a novel graph theoretic measure, parametric local modularity, to identify highly connected sub-networks as candidate protein complexes.
we present an algorithm, mipalm , to infer protein complexes in a protein-protein interaction network.
we applied our algorithm to predict and characterize a set of  <dig> novel protein complexes in s. cerevisiae.
mipalm is a novel algorithm for detecting protein complexes from large protein-protein interaction networks with improved accuracy than previous methods.
recent advances in proteomic technologies have enabled us to create detailed protein-protein interaction maps in multiple species and in both normal and diseased cells.
