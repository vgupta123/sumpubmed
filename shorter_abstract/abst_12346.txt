we also confirmed that during the evolution to digenetic life style in leishmania, the parasite acquired capabilities to evade drug action and maintain parasite virulence in the host with the incorporation of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily in rab genes.
therefore the Î²-subunit emerges as an excellent target for compounds inhibiting parasite activity in clinical cases of co-infections.
in order to adapt and survive within two hosts, leishmania species must have acquired virulence factors in addition to mechanisms that mediate susceptibility/resistance to infection in the pathology associated with disease.
geranylgeranyl transferase-i  was absent in both leishmania and its sister leptomonas.
our study based on whole genome sequences is the first to build comparative evolutionary analysis and identification of prenylation proteins in leishmania and its sister leptomonas.
farnesyltransferase  and geranylgeranyl transferase-ii  were identified for protein prenylation.
the information presented in our present work has importance for drug design targeted to kill l. donovani in humans but not affect the human form of the prenylation enzymes.
rab proteins are key mediators of vesicle transport and contribute greatly to the evolution of complexity of membrane transport system.
in this study we used our whole genome sequence data of these two divergent kinetoplastids to analyze the orthologues/paralogues of rab proteins.
leptomonas is monogenetic kinetoplastid parasite of insects and is primitive in comparison to leishmania.
