similarity searches using defined protein secretion systems from other gram-negative bacteria as query sequences revealed that r. l. bv.
viciae  <dig> has ten putative protein secretion systems.
viciae  <dig> protein secretion systems putatively involved in the secretion of proteins to the extracellular space  is required for establishing the symbiosis with legumes.
bioinformatic analysis and mass fingerprinting of tryptic fragments of culture supernatant proteins identified  <dig> putative type i substrates,  <dig> of which are secreted via the prsde, secretion system.
the prsde  system was shown to be the major route of protein secretion in non-symbiotic cells and to secrete proteins of widely varied size and predicted function.
these are the general export pathway , a twin-arginine translocase  secretion system, four separate type i systems, one putative type iv system and three type v autotransporters.
this is in contrast to many type i systems from other bacteria, which typically secrete specific substrates encoded by genes often localised in close proximity to the genes encoding the secretion system itself.
mutations in genes encoding each of these  were generated, but only mutations affecting the prsde  and tat systems were observed to affect the growth phenotype and the profile of proteins in the culture supernatant.
the aim of this study was to systematically analyse protein secretion in the recently sequenced strain rhizobium leguminosarum bv.
none of the r. l. bv.
proteins secreted during the infection process by some rhizobial strains can influence infection and modify the plant defence signalling pathways.
