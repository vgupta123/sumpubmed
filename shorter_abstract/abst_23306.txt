this work was focused on developing a quantitative model of infection and oedema in mouse pinna.
our results showed that s. pyogenes can infect the mouse pinna and that it can be recovered at least for up to  <dig> days from the infected site; we also found that s. pyogenes can induce a bigger oedema than the pbs-treated control for at least 7 days; our results were validated with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory formulation made with ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone.
preclinical assays are the first tests performed to evaluate new therapeutic molecules using animal models.
we consider that the model could be useful for assessment of new anti-inflammatory or antibacterial therapies for dermal infections.
the infection was achieved with a strain of streptococcus pyogenes that was inoculated in an injury induced at the auricle of balb/c mice, the induced oedema was recorded by measuring the ear thickness with a digital micrometer and histopathological analysis was performed to verify the damage.

currently, there are several models for evaluation of treatments, for dermal oedema or infection.
the model we developed led us to emulate a dermal infection and allowed us to objectively evaluate the increase or decrease of the oedema by measuring the thickness of the ear pinna, and to determine the presence of the pathogen in the infection site.
however, the most common or usual way is to induce the inflammation with chemical substances instead of infectious agents.
the presence of s. pyogenes at the infection site was determined every day by culture.
