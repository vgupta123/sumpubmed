this study has revealed that chalcone1--3-m-tolyl-propenone can serve as a safe and effective antiulcer agent as it has been proved to increase ph and gastric wall mucus, increase gpx, sod, pge <dig>  and decrease mda level, ultimately, it has also contributes towards the over-expression of hsp protein andtgf-β, and down-expression of bax protein.
pas staining showed intense uptake of magenta color of gastric wall mucus in rats fed with hptp, and immunohistochemical staining of gastric mucosa revealed over-expression of hsp <dig> protein, down-expression of bax protein and over expression of tgf-β in rats administered with hptp.
administration of hptp had decreased the acidity, increased gastric wall mucus and flattening of gastric mucosa and reducing erosive gastric damage area.
h & e stain showed decreased infiltration of leucocytes with edema of submucosal layer.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  can result in peptic ulcer disease  which is a common condition worldwide.
