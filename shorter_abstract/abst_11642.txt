animals were placed in three different housing conditions: one group was transferred to an ee, a second group received daily rt, whereas a third group remained in the standard cage.
enriched environment and daily reaching training of the dominant forelimb significantly increased the number of newly differentiated gstπ+ oligodendrocytes at day  <dig> and newly differentiated cnpase+ oligodendrocytes in the sensorimotor cortex at day  <dig>  the myelin level as measured by cnpase expression was increased in the frontal cortex at day  <dig>  distribution of newly differentiated ng2+ subpopulations changed between  <dig> and 42 days with an increase of gstπ+ subtypes and a decrease of ng2+ cells in the sensorimotor cortex and corpus callosum.
analysis of neuronal marker doublecortin  showed that more than half of ng2+ cells express dcx in the cortex.
the number of new dcx+ng2+ cells was reduced by ee at day  <dig>
in the present study we evaluated whether specific reaching training of the dominant forelimb  and stimulation of unspecific motor activity through enriched environment  influence the generation of distinct oligodendrocyte subpopulations in the sensorimotor cortex and corpus callosum of the adult rat brain.
our results indicate for the first time that specific and unspecific motor training conditions differentially alter the process of differentiation from oligodendrocyte subpopulations, in particular ng2+dcx+ cells, in the sensorimotor cortex and corpus callosum.
increased motor activity or social interactions through enriched environment are strong stimulators of grey and white matter plasticity in the adult rodent brain.
