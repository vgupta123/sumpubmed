the new packing scheme increases changes in non-polar burial for mutants compared to wild-type proteins, but does not substantially improve agreement between Δg and ΔΔg binding models.
this provides solvent accessible areas for proteins that are much closer to those of experimental structures than the more extended sidechain regime.
in a dataset curated for the absence of mainchain rearrangement upon binding, non-polar area burial is a major determinant of Δg models.
burial of non-polar area is weighted down in fitting of ΔΔg models.
