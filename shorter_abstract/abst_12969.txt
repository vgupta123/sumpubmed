neddylation is shown to facilitate e <dig> complex assembly; while un-neddylated cullins are bound by cand <dig> that prevents recruitment of the substrates.
it forms tertiary complexes with fully assembled crl e <dig> complexes such as scfskp <dig>  elongin b/c -cul2- vhl and cul4-ddb complex by binding to both n-terminal and c-terminal domain of cullins.
cullin-ring ubiquitin e <dig> ligases  are regulated by modification of an ubiquitin-like protein, nedd <dig>  on the cullin subunit.
