while it is always possible that the entire or gene lineage was lost at some point in the history of daphnia pulex, we think it more likely that the insect or lineage is indeed a relatively recently expanded gene lineage concomitant with the evolution of terrestriality in the insects or their hexapod ancestors.
in addition, grs55â€“ <dig> share distinctive amino acid motifs and cluster with the sugar receptors of insects, and may illuminate the origin of this distinctive subfamily.
ests, tiling array, and pcr amplification results support  <dig> predicted gene models, and preliminary expression data comparing the sexes indicates potential female-biased expression for some genes.
the keystone species daphnia pulex, a well known crustacean, is the first aquatic invertebrate to have its genome sequenced.
we describe  <dig> grs , belonging to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, which were identified bioinformatically in the draft genome of the crustacean waterflea daphnia pulex.
