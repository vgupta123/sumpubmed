since many benefits of microbes are highly strain-specific and their mechanistic details remain largely elusive, further identification of new probiotic bacteria with immunoregulatory potentials is of great interest.
that is, males treated with anti-inflammatory bm <dig> experienced less weight gain and higher testosterone level; females treated with bm <dig> maintained lower serum tnf-α as well as healthy skin with active folliculogenesis and hair growth.

interestingly, these l. reuteri strains evoked different consequences depending on the gender of the mice.
the gut microbiota is playing more important roles in host immune regulation than was initially expected.
we supplied c57bl/ <dig> mice with these bacteria in drinking water while feeding them a standard diet for 20 weeks.
we have screened our collection of probiotic lactic acid bacteria  for their efficacy in modulating host immune response.
