we studied oocytes in mouse fetal and neonatal ovaries,  <dig> â€“ <dig> days post coitum, to examine the relationship between oocyte development and programmed cell death during meiotic prophase i.
cor- <dig>  highlighted axial elements of the synaptonemal complex and allowed definitive identification of the stages of meiotic prophase i. labelling for cleaved poly- polymerase , an inactivated dna repair protein, indicated apoptosis.
oocytes at all stages of meiotic prophase i stained for cleaved parp- <dig> and/or tunel, or neither.
our data indicate that apoptosis can occur throughout meiotic prophase i in mouse fetal and early postnatal oocytes, with greatest incidence at the diplotene stage.
the vast majority of oocytes formed in the fetal ovary do not survive beyond birth.
possible reasons for their loss include the elimination of non-viable genetic constitutions arising through meiosis, however, the precise relationship between meiotic stages and prenatal apoptosis of oocytes remains elusive.
oocytes with fragmented  or compressed  axial elements showed slight but significant differences in staining for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel to those with intact elements.
however, fragmentation of axial elements alone was not a good indicator of cell demise.
careful selection of appropriate markers for oocyte apoptosis is essential.
