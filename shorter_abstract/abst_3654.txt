identification of individual components in complex mixtures is an important and sometimes daunting task in several research areas like metabolomics and natural product studies.
the identities of these metabolites were confirmed by comparing the correlation plots with reported nmr data, mostly from the human metabolome database.
nmr spectroscopy is an excellent technique for analysis of mixtures of organic compounds and gives a detailed chemical fingerprint of most individual components above the detection limit.
for the identification of individual metabolites in metabolomics, correlation or covariance between peaks in 1h nmr spectra has previously been successfully employed.
in this paper, we demonstrate how a similar approach can be used to identify metabolites in human biofluids .
correlation plots prepared by statistically correlating 1h-13c heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra from human biofluids provide unambiguous identification of metabolites.
from  <dig> 1h-13c heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra,  <dig> correlation plots resembling pure metabolites were constructed.
the correlation plots highlight cross-peaks belonging to each individual compound, not limited by long-range magnetization transfer as conventional nmr experiments.
