ssh results were further characterized by dot blot, northern blot, and rt-pcr.
larval molting and metamorphosis are important physiological processes in the life cycle of the holometabolous insect.
we used suppression subtractive hybridization  to identify genes differentially expressed during larval molting and metamorphosis.
the expression levels of eleven genes were found to change during larval molting or metamorphosis, suggesting a functional role during these processes.
these results provide a new set of genes expressed specifically during larval molt or metamorphosis that are candidates for further studies into the regulatory mechanisms of those stage-specific genes during larval molt and metamorphosis
one hundred expressed sequence tags  were identified and included  <dig> putative genes with similarity to known genes, and  <dig> unknown ests.
we performed ssh between tissues from a variety of developmental stages, including molting 5th and feeding 6th instar larvae, metamorphically committed and feeding 5th instar larvae, and feeding 5th instar and metamorphically committed larvae.
