yet patterns of standing genetic variation within cnidarian species, a major determinant of adaptive potential, are virtually unknown at genome-scale resolution.
analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites suggested that highly heterozygous regions are evolving under relaxed purifying selection compared to the rest of the aiptasia genome.
low coverage genome sequencing revealed large genetic distances among globally widespread lineages, novel candidate targets of selection, and considerably higher heterozygosity than previously reported for aiptasia.
candidate targets of selection, including lectins and genes involved in rho gtpase signalling, were identified based on unusual signatures of nucleotide diversity, tajima’s d, and heterozygosity compared to genome-wide averages.
we explore patterns of genome-wide polymorphism and identify candidate loci under selection in the sea anemone aiptasia, an important laboratory model system for studying the symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellate algae of the genus symbiodinium.
our results shed light on patterns of intraspecific genome-wide polymorphism in a model for studies of coral-algae symbiosis and present genetic targets for future research on evolutionary and cellular processes in early-diverging metazoans.
evolutionary relationships based on genome-wide polymorphism supported the current paradigm of a genetically distinct population from the us south atlantic that harbors diverse symbiodinium clades.
heterozygosity was an important feature shaping nucleotide diversity patterns: at any given snp site, more than a third of individuals genotyped were heterozygotes, and heterozygosity within individual genomes ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %.
