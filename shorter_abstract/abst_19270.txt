the ability to regulate transgene expression has many applications, mostly concerning the analysis of gene function.
site-specific recombination  is then be used repeatedly to insert any new transgene at the reporter transgene locus of such clones so that optimal induction characteristics are conferred upon it.
in clone rht14- <dig>  increases in expression from essentially background levels  to more than 104-fold above background  were reproducibly detected after cre-mediated insertion of either the luciferase or the i-scei transgenes.
transgenes encoding luciferase, i-scei endonuclease or rad <dig> were then inserted by ssr at a loxp site adjacent to the gfp gene resulting stringent tet-regulated transgene expression.
desirable induction characteristics, such as low un-induced expression, high induced expression and limited cellular heterogeneity, can be seriously impaired by chromosomal position effects at the site of transgene integration.
rht14- <dig> and similar ht1080-derived clones can now be used in conjunction with a convenient delivery vector , in a simple 3-step protocol leading to stringent and reproducible transgene regulation.
