antibiotics sensitivity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , pcr for carbapenemase and efflux pump genes were performed for all carbapenems-resistant isolates.
outer-membrane protein  was evaluated based on pfge profile.
a total of  <dig> isolates of enterobacter spp were analyzed, 44/ <dig>  e. aerogenes and 8/ <dig>  e. cloacae were resistant to carbapenems.
kpc was present in  <dig> % of e. aerogenes and in all e. cloacae resistant to carbapenems.
the efflux pump acrab-tolc gene was only identified in carbapenems-resistant e. cloacae.
there is a predominant clone in hospital b and hospital c as well.
this study evaluated clonality and mechanisms of carbapenems resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacter spp.
the isolates presented multiple mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems including omp alteration.
there was a predominant clone in each hospital suggesting that cross-transmission of carbapenems-resistant enterobacter spp.
the carbapenems-resistant e. aerogenes identified in hospital a belonged to six clones, however, a predominant clone was identified in this hospital over the study period.
all isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin, polymyxin b and tigecycline.
