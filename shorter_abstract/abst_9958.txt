we compared assemblies obtained using sanger data with those from different inputs from new sequencing technologies.
high quality drafts can be produced for small genomes without any sanger data input.
so, an appropriate mix of technologies may help resolve most difficulties, and eventually provide assemblies of high quality without requiring any sanger-based input.
