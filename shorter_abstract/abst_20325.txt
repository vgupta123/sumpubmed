the decrease in cellular o2-, which was accompanied by a brief accumulation of h2o <dig> and downregulation of phosphorylated akt  and cellular flice-inhibitory protein, sensitized k <dig> leukemia cells and human promyelocytic leukemia  cells to trail-induced apoptosis.
many cancer cells develop resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand -induced apoptosis, necessitating combination with chemotherapy, and normal cells manifest side effects due to the combined treatment regimen of trail and chemotherapeutic drugs.
the fesod component was rapidly introduced into the cell by strail and intracellular superoxide radical , which have been implicated as potential modulators of apoptosis in cancer cells, was eliminated, resulting in a highly reduced cellular environment.
in this study, we exploited trail receptor-mediated endocytosis for the first time to produce a cell-permeable molecule, soluble forms of recombinant trail:iron superoxide dismutase , which possesses strail-induced apoptotic ability and fesod antioxidant activity.
we also obtained evidence that the lack of response to strail:fesod in normal t cells occurred because strail:fesod shows much stronger shifts of redox state in erythroleukemia  and hl- <dig> cells compared to that in normal t cells.
the fusion protein overcomes the inability of fesod to permeate the cell membrane, exhibits synergistic apoptotic effects on k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells and demonstrates minimal toxicity to normal t cells and the normal liver cell line lo <dig>  indicating its potential value for the treatment of leukemia.
