the framework was used to model the effect of selenium supplementation for prostate cancer prevention and parallels the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial that showed no efficacy despite suggestive data from secondary endpoints in the nutritional prevention of cancer trial and found increased incidence of high-grade prostate cancer in certain subgroups.
using machine learning methods, we identified the parameters of the model that are most predictive of trial outcome and found that the top four are directly related to the rates of reactions producing methylselenol and transporting extracellular selenium into the cell as selenide.
clinical trials are the main method for evaluating safety and efficacy of medical interventions and have produced many advances in improving human health.

key features include the ability to propagate uncertainty in biological mechanism to uncertainty in trial outcome and mechanisms for identifying knowledge gaps most responsible for unexpected outcomes.
here we demonstrate a modeling framework for linking knowledge of underlying biological mechanism to evaluate the expectation of trial outcomes.
this modeling process demonstrates how the approach can be used in advance of a large clinical trial to identify the best targets for conducting further research to reduce the uncertainty in the trial outcome.
