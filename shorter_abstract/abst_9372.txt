our evaluation shows that seqping was able to generate better gene predictions compared to three hmm-based programs  using their respective available hmms.
we conclude that the seqping pipeline predictions are more accurate than gene predictions using the other three approaches with the default or available hmms.
we present an automated gene prediction pipeline, seqping that uses self-training hmm models and transcriptomic data.
the pipeline was evaluated using the oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana genomes.
the pipeline processes the genome and transcriptome sequences of the target species using glimmerhmm, snap, and augustus pipelines, followed by maker <dig> program to combine predictions from the three tools in association with the transcriptomic evidence.
a large number of software tools and pipelines developed by various computing techniques are available for gene prediction.
seqping generates species-specific hmms that are able to offer unbiased gene predictions.
gene prediction is one of the most important steps in the genome annotation process.
furthermore, none of the currently available gene-finders has a universal hidden markov model  that can perform gene prediction for all organisms equally well in an automatic fashion.
