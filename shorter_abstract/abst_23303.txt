among the proteins identified were two γca homologs, acca <dig> and acca <dig>  demonstrating that γca proteins are not specific to plants/green algae.
the detection of γcas in ci of acanthamoeba, considered to be a closer relative of animals and fungi than plants, suggests that γca proteins may have been an ancestral feature of mitochondrial ci, rather than a novel, plant-specific addition.
in plants and green algae, several purportedly plant-specific proteins homologous to γ-type carbonic anhydrases  have been identified as components of ci.
however, relatively little is known about ci composition in the unicellular protists, the characterizations of which are essential to our understanding of ci evolution.
this assertion is supported by the presence of genes encoding γcas in the nuclear genomes of a wide variety of eukaryotes.
the complexity of mitochondrial complex i  has increased considerably relative to the homologous complex in bacteria.
comparative analyses of ci composition in animals, fungi and land plants/green algae suggest that novel components of mitochondrial ci include a set of  <dig> proteins common to all eukaryotes and a variable number of lineage-specific subunits.
in fact, through bioinformatics searches we detected γca homologs in diverse protist lineages, and several of these homologs are predicted to possess n-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides.
