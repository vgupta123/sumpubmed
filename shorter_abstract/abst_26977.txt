we sequenced ~ <dig> small rnas from soybean roots inoculated with b. japonicum and identified conserved mirnas based on similarity to mirnas known in other plant species and new mirnas based on potential hairpin-forming precursors within soybean est and shotgun genomic sequences.
a subset of these mirnas were validated by northern analysis and mirnas differentially responding to b. japonicum inoculation were identified.
the conserved mirna loci and novel mirnas identified in this study enable investigation of the role of mirnas in rhizobial symbiosis.
symbiosis between legumes  and rhizobia bacteria  results in root nodules where the majority of biological nitrogen fixation occurs.
using conserved mirnas as internal control, we estimated that our analysis identified ~50% of mirnas in soybean roots.
however, the role of small rnas in legume-rhizobial symbiosis is largely unexplored.
small rnas regulate a number of developmental processes in plants and animals.
we also identified putative target genes of the identified mirnas and verified in vivo cleavage of a subset of these targets by 5'-race analysis.
the availability of complete and assembled genome sequence information will enable identification of many other mirnas.
construction and analysis of a small rna library led to the identification of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirna families in soybean.
these bioinformatics analyses identified  <dig> families of mirnas of which  <dig> were novel.
