coprocultures were performed at the same dates to collect l <dig> for dna extraction from pooled larvae and to determine the resistant allele frequencies by pyrosequencing analysis.
in the present study we compared the levels of resistance in teladorsagia circumcincta and trichostrongylus colubriformis by means of the faecal egg reduction test  and the percentage of resistant alleles obtained after pyrosequencing.
benzimidazole  resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism  at codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the isotype  <dig> of beta-tubulin gene although in some species these snps have also been associated with resistance to macrocyclic lactones.

in t. circumcincta, snps were not found at any of the three codons before treatment; after the administration of abz, snps were present only in two different flocks, one of them with a frequency of  <dig> % at snp  <dig>  and the other  <dig> % % at snp  <dig>  in relation to t. colubriformis, we found the snp <dig> before treatment in  <dig> %  of the flocks with values between  <dig>  and  <dig> %.
the frequencies observed for snp <dig> in t. colubriformis indicate that the presence of resistance is more common than revealed by the fecrt.
the study was conducted in  <dig> naturally infected sheep flocks.
