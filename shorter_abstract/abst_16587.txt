molecular surfaces are simple representations of molecular structure that are easily constructed from various forms of molecular data such as 3d atomic coordinates  and electron microscopy  data.
we present a multi-scale morse-smale molecular-surface alignment tool, ms3align, which aligns molecular surfaces based on significant protrusions on the molecular surface.
the input is a pair of molecular surfaces represented as triangle meshes.
we have presented an algorithm that aligns molecular surfaces based on the topology of surface curvature.

aligning similar molecular structures is an important step in the process of bio-molecular structure and function analysis.
fourth, we demonstrate the ability of ms3align to align iso-surfaces derived from cryo-electron microscopy scans.
a key advantage of ms3align is computational efficiency that is achieved because it processes only a few carefully chosen protrusions on the molecular surface.
