the optimal reference state was selected and the cutoff effect on the distance-dependent potentials investigated.
to capture the long-range and the multi-body interactions, residues in different secondary structure elements at protein-protein interfaces were considered as different residue types.
training sets of protein-protein matches were generated based on bound and unbound forms of proteins taken from the dockground resource.
the results show that the scoring function deck can successfully identify near-native protein-protein matches and thus is useful in protein docking.
the potentials were validated on the docking decoys sets, showing better performance than the existing potentials used in scoring of protein-protein docking results.
the study presents a new distance- and environment-dependent, coarse-grained, knowledge-based  potential for scoring of protein-protein docking predictions.
in addition to the practical application of the potentials, the study provides insights into the relative utility of the reference states, the scope of the distance dependence, and the coarse-graining of the potentials.
each residue was represented by a pseudo-atom in the geometric center of the side chain.
knowledge-based potentials improve modeling of protein complexes by taking advantage of the rapidly increasing amount of experimentally derived information on protein-protein association.
computational approaches to protein-protein docking typically include scoring aimed at improving the rank of the near-native structure relative to the false-positive matches.
an essential element of knowledge-based potentials is defining the reference state for an optimal description of the residue-residue  pairs in the non-interaction state.
five reference states for the potentials were defined and tested.
