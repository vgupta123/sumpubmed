clostridium botulinum strains can be divided into four physiological groups that are sufficiently diverged to be considered as separate species.
the largest difference between c. botulinum group iii isolates occurred within their surprisingly large plasmidomes and in the pattern of mobile elements insertions.
the completion of the genome of c. botulinum group iii has revealed it to be a genome with dual identity.
here we present the first complete genome of a c. botulinum strain from physiological group iii, causing animal botulism.
the genotypic species share a conserved chromosomal core that can be transformed into various pathogenic variants by modulation of the highly plastic plasmidome.
it belongs to the pathogenic species c. botulinum, but as a genotypic species it should also include c. novyi and c. haemolyticum.
these plasmids also contained more mobile elements than other replicons.
the  <dig>  mb chromosome was highly conserved between the isolates and also closely related to that of c. novyi.
