we also divided pseudogenes into relative-time groups: ancestral pseudogenes inherited from a common ancestor, pseudogenes recombined between serovars which likely arose between initial divergence and later recombination, serovar-specific pseudogenes arising after recombination but prior to the last evolutionary bottlenecks in each population, and more recent strain-specific pseudogenes.
recombination and pseudogene-formation have been important mechanisms of genetic convergence between paratyphi a and typhi, with most pseudogenes arising independently after extensive recombination between the serovars.
genome sequence similarity between paratyphi a and typhi has been attributed to convergent evolution via relatively recent recombination of a quarter of their genomes.
the accumulation of pseudogenes is a key feature of these and other host-adapted pathogens, and overlapping pseudogene complements are evident in paratyphi a and typhi.
a comparative analysis of pseudogene complements of these and two finished typhi genomes  identified several pseudogenes that had been overlooked in prior genome annotations of one or both serovars, and identified  <dig> pseudogenes shared between serovars.
the recombination events, along with divergence of and within each serovar, provide a relative time scale for pseudogene-forming mutations, affording rare insights into the progression of functional gene loss associated with host adaptation in salmonella.
of the >  <dig> serovars of salmonella enterica subspecies i, most cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease in a wide range of mammalian hosts.
however, s. enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi a are restricted to the human host and cause the similar systemic diseases typhoid and paratyphoid fever.
