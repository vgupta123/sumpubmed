ifn, and in particular, ifn-α, has been used clinically as an effective therapeutic agent for viral infections.
in contrast to human and canine ifn-α subtypes, most mink ifn-α subtypes contained two n-glycosylation sites.
as a key link between innate and adaptive immune responses, the interferon  system is the first line of defense against viral infection.
furthermore, recombinant mink ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig> significantly suppressed the propagation of canine distemper virus in vero cells, with ifn-α <dig> demonstrating the highest activity.
we identified the mink ifn-α <dig> subtype as a promising candidate for the development of effective antiviral drugs.
the homologies of the  <dig> mink ifn-α genes were  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively.
therefore, it is important to identify ifn-α subtypes with high antiviral activity for the development of genetically engineered antiviral drugs.
however, different subtypes of ifn-α demonstrate distinct antiviral activity.
