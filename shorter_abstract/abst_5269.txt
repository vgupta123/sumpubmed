dna sequencing is rapidly expanding in the life sciences.
they sequenced microbes, metagenomes, and a marine mammal, the californian sea lion, zalophus californianus.
here we present a cross-disciplinary course that provides undergraduate students with practical experience in running a next generation sequencing instrument through to the analysis and annotation of the generated dna sequences.
the students met sequencing quality controls, had no detectable contamination in the targeted dna sequences, provided publication quality data, and became part of an international collaboration to investigate carcinomas in carnivores.
many labs across world are installing next generation sequencing technology and we show that the undergraduate students produce quality sequence data and were excited to participate in cutting edge research.
teaching undergraduates to use the latest technology to sequence genomic dna ensures they are ready to meet the challenges of the genomic era and allows them to participate in annotating the tree of life.
students learned important skills for their future education and career opportunities, and a perceived increase in studentsâ€™ ability to conduct independent scientific research was measured.
