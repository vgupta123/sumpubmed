first we have developed a support vector machine  based model using primary sequence of proteins and obtained maximum mcc  <dig>  with accuracy of  <dig> %.
we have compared the amino acid composition of atp interacting and non-interacting regions of proteins and observed that certain residues are preferred for interaction with atp.
based on this study, a web server has been developed for predicting 'atp interacting residues' in a protein http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/atpint/.
the performance of this model was improved significantly  from the previous one, where only the primary sequence of the proteins were used.
the evolutionary information is important for the identification of 'atp interacting residues', as it provides more information compared to the primary sequence.
one of the major challenges in post-genomic era is to provide functional annotations for large number of proteins arising from genome sequencing projects.
