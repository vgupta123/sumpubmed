this study uses streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> as a model system to determine the genome-wide transcriptional response following exposure to three antibiotics  that target distinct stages of cell wall biosynthesis.
regulatory networks known to govern responses to environmental and nutritional stresses are also at the core of the common antibiotic response, and likely help cells survive until any specific resistance mechanisms are fully functional.
a generalised response to all three antibiotics was identified which involves activation of transcription of the cell envelope stress sigma factor Ïƒe, together with elements of the stringent response, and of the heat, osmotic and oxidative stress regulons.
many antibiotic-specific transcriptional changes were identified, representing cellular processes potentially important for tolerance to each antibiotic.
the future development of new drugs with novel antibacterial activities requires a detailed understanding of adaptive responses to existing compounds.
sensitivity studies using mutants constructed on the basis of the transcriptome profiling confirmed a role for several such genes in antibiotic resistance, validating the usefulness of the approach.
both can be exploited to increase antibiotic susceptibility.
antibiotic inhibition of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis induces both common and compound-specific transcriptional responses.
