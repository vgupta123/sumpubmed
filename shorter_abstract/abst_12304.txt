in one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis.
since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on adg, future research on nnpds probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.
nnpds is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli , clostridium perfringens  type a/c, clostridium difficile , rotavirus a, coronavirus, cystoisospora suis, strongyloides ransomi, giardia spp or cryptosporidium spp.
these findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea.
