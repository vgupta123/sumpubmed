we force these cases into tentative cell track bifurcations, which define natural semi-local neighborhoods that permit bayesian judgment about the underlying cell behavior.
the high accuracy achieved by our method suggests that a bifurcation-based semi-local neighborhood provides sufficient information to recognize dependencies between nearby tracking choices, and to interpret difficult tracking cases without reverting to global optimization.
difficult cases originate from detection errors and relatively rare large motions.
the bifurcation judgment process not only correctly tracks through cell divisions and large movements, but also offers corrections to detection errors.
we demonstrate that this method enables large scale analysis of caenorhabditis elegans development, an ideal validation platform because of an invariant cell lineage.
therefore, our method focuses computational effort on difficult cases identified by local increases in cell number.
advances in fluorescence labeling and imaging have made it possible to acquire in vivo records of complex biological processes.
in vivo analysis requires, at minimum, tracking hundreds of cells over hundreds of time points in complex three dimensional environments.
