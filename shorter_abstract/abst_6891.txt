over expression of hc-pro rss induced clear phenotypic changes both in growth rate and in leaf and flower morphology of the tobacco plants.
expression of the hc-pro rss mimics transcriptional changes previously shown to occur in plants infected with intact viruses .
the results indicate that the hc-pro rss contributes a significant part of virus-plant interactions by changing the levels of multiple cellular rnas and proteins.
the transcript levels of leaves and flowers of these plants were analysed using microarray techniques .
transcript levels of s-adenosyl-l-methionine  were also decreased in these plants, apparently leading to decreased transmethylation capacity.
the proteome analysis using 2d-page indicated significantly altered proteome profile, which may have been both due to altered transcript levels, decreased translation, and increased proteosomal/protease activity.
the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes was significantly changed in the leaves and flowers, respectively, in the hc-pro expressing transgenic plants.
the results also suggest that photosynthetic oxygen evolution, sugar metabolism and energy levels were significantly changed in these transgenic plants.
in this study we have explored these effects using previously characterized transgenic tobacco plants which constitutively express  the helper component-proteinase  derived from a potyviral genome.
interestingly, these transcriptome alterations in the hc-pro expressing tobacco plants were similar as those previously detected in plants infected with ssrna-viruses.
