analysis of the jmjd <dig> neighbouring gene 1110005a03rik revealed an incident deletion of this gene in two out of three earlier reported jmjd <dig> knockout mice, which might affect previously described conflicting phenotypes.
moreover, our systematic annotation in nine species identified  <dig> dsbh fold-containing proteins that split into  <dig> highly conserved subgroups.
the jumonji c  domain containing gene  <dig>  has misleadingly been annotated to encode a transmembrane receptor for the engulfment of apoptotic cells.
we describe here a semiautomated computational pipeline to identify and annotate jmjc domain containing proteins.
given the importance of jmjc domain containing proteins in controlling a wide range of diverse biological functions, we undertook a comparative genomic analysis to gain further insights in jmjd <dig> gene organisation, evolution, and protein function.
this analysis let to the identification and characterisation of a bi-directional transcriptional unit compromising the jmjd <dig> and 1110005a03rik genes and to the recognition of a new, before overseen jmjd <dig> exon in mammals.
to determine potentially important residues for jmjd <dig> function a structural model of the jmjd <dig> protein was calculated based on sequence conservation.
retrieved jmjd <dig> sequences were used to phylogenetically analyse corresponding loci and their genomic neighbourhood.
using a sequence segment n-terminal of the jmjd <dig> jmjc domain as query for a reciprocal blast search, we identified homologous sequences in  <dig> species across all major phyla.
further, we provide novel insights into the evolution of jmjd <dig> and other related members of the superfamily of jmjc domain containing proteins.
