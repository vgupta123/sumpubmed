as a step in assessing the utility of this approach, we derived primary embryonic fibroblast populations and embryonic stem cell lines from mice that carried two different fluorescent protein genes as alleles at the chromosome  <dig> locus, rosa <dig>  fluorescence activated cell sorting  showed that the vast majority of cells in each line expressed the two marker proteins at similar levels, and that populations exhibited expression noise similar to that seen in bacteria and yeast.
mice that carry two different fluorescent protein genes as alleles of a locus would seem to be a useful tool for addressing this issue because loh would change a cell's phenotype from dichromatic to monochromatic.
in addition, loh caused by mitotic crossing over might be discernable in tissues because this event produces a pair of neighboring monochromatic cells that are different colors.
similar approaches will allow these phenomena to be studied in tissues.
<dig> of  <dig> stably monochromatic es cell clones exhibited loss of the expected allele at the rosa <dig> locus.
loh would be detectable in diverse cell types in the body if this event were to confer an obvious cellular phenotype.
cells with a monochromatic phenotype were present at frequencies on the order of 10- <dig> and appeared to be produced at a rate of approximately 10- <dig> variant cells per mitosis.
dichromatic mouse embryonic cells provide a novel system for studying genetic/karyotypic stability and factors influencing expression from allelic genes.
loh at this locus was usually not accompanied by loh near the centromere, suggesting that mitotic recombination was the major cause of rosa <dig> loh.
