ion mobility-mass spectrometry , an analytical technique which combines the features of ion mobility spectrometry  and mass spectrometry , can rapidly separates ions on a millisecond time-scale.
in this paper, a model is presented based on least square support vectors regression  method to predict peptide ion drift time in imms from the sequence-based features of peptide.
as an important parameter, peptide drift time can be used for enhancing downstream data analysis in imms-based proteomics.
our proposed ls-svr model can predict peptide drift time from sequence information in relative high prediction accuracy by a test on a dataset of  <dig> peptides.
our proposed method was tested on three datasets with different charge states.
four descriptors were extracted from peptide sequence to represent peptide ions by a 34-component vector.
the parameters of ls-svr were selected by a grid searching strategy, and a 10-fold cross-validation approach was employed for the model training and testing.
