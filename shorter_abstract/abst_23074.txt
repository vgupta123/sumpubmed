endothelial function as well as vascular structure in the hindquarter vascular bed was estimated using an in vivo constant-flow preparation.
two weeks of gh treatment did not normalise the bp, vascular structure and the endothelial function in the resistance vessels.
endothelial dysfunction and reduced vasculature mass in the hindquarter vascular bed was found in hx rats.
furthermore, basal plasma and urine nitrate levels and aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase  expression were analysed.
hypophysectomy was associated with decreased map  and heart rate  .
baroreceptor activity and the influences of no on bp control were assessed during telemetric measurement.
in un-supplemented and gh supplemented hypophysectomized  male rats as well as intact rats, continuous resting mean arterial blood pressure  was measured using telemetry.
the aim of the study was to evaluate the acute and continuous  effect of growth hormone  on blood pressure  regulation and to investigate the interplay between gh, nitric oxide  and bp.
an interaction between gh, no-system and bp regulation can be demonstrated.
gh substitution caused a further transient decrease in map and a transient increase in hr .
gh substitution seems to have a short lasting effect on lowering blood pressure via activation of the no-system.
gh substitution resulted in an impaired baroreceptor function.
