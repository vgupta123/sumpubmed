we call this version as the motif stems search  problem.
a motif stem is an l-mer with some wildcard characters and hence corresponds to a set of l-mers , some of which are -motifs.
kuksa and pavlovic have presented an efficient algorithm to find motif stems for inputs from large alphabets.
recently a new version of the motif search problem has been introduced by kuksa and pavlovic.
several versions of the motif search problem have been studied in the literature.
in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for mss and evaluate it on both synthetic and real data.
motifs are significant patterns in dna, rna, and protein sequences, which play an important role in biological processes and functions, like identification of open reading frames, rna transcription, protein binding, etc.
one such version is called the planted motif search or -motif search.
the time complexities of most of the planted motif search algorithms depend exponentially on the alphabet size.
