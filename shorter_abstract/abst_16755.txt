the presence of simultaneous infections by different salmonella strains in the same animal has never been reported and could have important epidemiological implications.
this may have implications in the interpretation of results from baseline studies, and also help to better understand human salmonellosis outbreaks and the horizontal transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes.
baseline studies on salmonellosis prevalence in fattening pigs in europe are based on direct pathogen isolation from mesenteric lymph nodes .
fourteen finishing pigs belonging to  <dig> farms that showed high salmonellosis prevalence and a variety of circulating salmonella strains, were found infected by salmonella spp, and  <dig> of them were simultaneously infected with strains of  <dig> or  <dig> different serotypes.
this is the first report clearly demonstrating that pigs naturally infected by salmonella may harbour different salmonella strains simultaneously.
four animals were found infected by salmonella spp.
