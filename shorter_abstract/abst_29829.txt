dna fragments obtained during amplification are mixed and ligated.
suppression pcr limits amplification to dna molecules representing full length target dna, while amplification of other types of molecules formed during ligation is suppressed.
in this study we developed a quick and efficient strategy for introduction of multiple complex mutations in a target dna without intermediate subcloning by using a combination of connecting sdm and suppression pcr.
the procedure consists of sequential rounds, with each individual round including pcr amplification of target dna with two non-overlapping pairs of oligonucleotides.
a wide variety of complex multiple mutations can be generated in a short period of time.
to create additional mutations, an aliquot of the ligation mixture is then used directly for the next round of mutagenesis employing internal oligonucleotides specific for another region of target dna.
the desired mutation is incorporated at the 5' end of one or both internal oligonucleotides.
in addition, many of the existing multiple sdm methods have technical limitations associated with type and number of mutations that can be introduced, or are technically demanding and require special chemical reagents.
thus, mals represents a powerful alternative to the existing methods for multiple sdm.
the resulting dna mixture is amplified with external oligonucleotides that act as suppression adapters.
