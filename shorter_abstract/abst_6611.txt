we previously solved the crystal structures of the c-terminal globular domains of two paralogs, aglb-short  <dig> and aglb-short  <dig>
we determined the crystal structure of the c-terminal globular domain of the third aglb paralog, aglb-long, at  <dig>  Å resolutions.
the present structure revealed that a. fulgidus aglb-l contained a variant type of the dk motif with a short insertion, and confirmed that the second signature residue, lys, of the dk motif participates in the formation of a pocket that binds to the serine and threonine residues at the + <dig> position of the n-glycosylation sequon.
all three aglbs contain a variant type of the dk motif.
the genome of a hyperthermophilic archaeon, archaeoglobus fulgidus, encodes three paralogous aglb proteins.
the c-terminal domain of a. fulgidus aglb-l includes a structural unit common to aglb-s <dig> and aglb-s <dig>  this structural unit contains the evolutionally conserved wwdyg and dk motifs.
the present structure will be useful as a search model for molecular replacement in the structural determination of the full-length a. fulgidus aglb-l.
the structure of a. fulgidus aglb-l, together with the two previously solved structures of aglb-s <dig> and aglb-s <dig>  provides a complete overview of the three aglb paralogs encoded in the a. fulgidus genome.
the catalytic subunits of the ost enzyme are stt <dig> in eukaryotes, aglb in archaea and pglb in eubacteria.
oligosaccharyltransferase  transfers an oligosaccharide chain to the asparagine residue in the n-glycosylation sequons.
the crystallization of the fusion protein with maltose binding protein  afforded high quality protein crystals.
since the fusion protein behaved as a monomer upon gel filtration, we reconstituted the monomer structure from the swapped dimer by exchanging the swapped segments.
