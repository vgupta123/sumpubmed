the irefindex consolidates protein interaction data from ten databases in a rigorous manner using sequence-based hash keys.
working with consolidated interaction data comes with distinct challenges: data are redundant, overlapping, highly interconnected and may be collected and represented using different curation practices.
the irefscape plug-in will be of interest to advanced users of interaction data.
overlapping evidence is presented using a multi-graph and a bi-partite representation is used to distinguish binary and n-ary source data.
tools are provided to facilitate a range of tasks from a simple search to knowledge discovery.
the plug-in provides access to a consolidated data set in a uniform accession space while remaining faithful to the underlying source data.
the irefscape plug-in for the cytoscape graphical viewer addresses these challenges.
a uniform accession space is used to limit redundancy and support search expansion and searching on multiple accession types.
