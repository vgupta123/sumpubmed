comparison with the publicly available protein database indicates that a total of  <dig>   unigenes exhibit similarity  to known proteins.
the functional annotation and classification including gene ontology , clusters of orthologous group  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis revealed that the main activated genes in radish taproots are predominately involved in basic physiological and metabolic processes, biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathways, signal transduction mechanisms and other cellular components and molecular function related terms.
in this study, a high-throughput, large-scale rna sequencing technology was employed to characterize the de novo transcriptome of radish roots at different stages of development.
however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying glucosinolate metabolism in radish taproots.
a number of candidate radish genes in the glucosinolate metabolism related pathways were also discovered, from which, eight genes were validated by t-a cloning and sequencing while four were validated by quantitative rt-pcr expression profiling.
it will serve as an important public information platform to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of the related nutritional and flavor components during taproot formation in radish.
the ensuing transcriptome dataset provides a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular genetics research in radish.
approximately  <dig>  million paired-end reads representing  <dig>  unigenes with a n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp, and a total length of  <dig>  mb were obtained.
glucosinolates in the fleshy taproot significantly affect the flavor and nutritional quality of radish.
radish , is an important root vegetable crop worldwide.
