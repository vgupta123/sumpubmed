in order to establish a plant cell death classification system, future research should combine morphological data with biochemical and molecular data.
the search for an all-encompassing classification system based on plant cell death morphology continues.
the results indicated that within a single system, various types and intensities of stress will influence cell death morphology.
the lace plant is a model system for studying pcd as leaf perforations form predictably via this process during development.
morphological similarities between developmental and induced pcd included: disappearance of anthocyanin from the vacuole, increase in vesicle formation, nuclear condensation, and fusing of vesicles containing organelles to the vacuole prior to tonoplast collapse.
this study induced death in cells that do not undergo developmental pcd using various degrees and types of stress .
cell death was observed via live cell imaging and compared to the developmental pcd pathway.
plasma membrane retraction was a key feature of developmental pcd but did not occur in all induced modes of cell death.

programmed cell death  is an important process for the development and maintenance of multicellular eukaryotes.
in animals, there are three morphologically distinct cell death types: apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and necrosis.
regardless of the causal agent in cell death, the vacuole appeared to play a central role in dying cells.
