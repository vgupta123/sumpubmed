for the subset of samples that carry pstol <dig>  haplotype sequences suggest long-term selective maintenance of functional alleles, but with repeated evolution of loss-of-function alleles through premature stops and frameshift mutations.
the loss-of-function alleles have evolved convergently in multiple rice species and cultivated rice varieties.
we find that the presence/absence polymorphism spans cultivated, weedy and wild asian rice groups.
greenhouse assessments of plant growth under low- and high-phosphorus conditions did not reveal significant associations with pstol <dig> genotype variation; however, the striking signature of balancing selection at this locus suggests that further phenotypic characterizations of pstol <dig> allelic variants is warranted and may be useful for crop improvement.
the ability to grow in phosphorus-depleted soils is an important trait for rice cultivation in many world regions, especially in the tropics.
these findings suggest balancing selection for both functional and non-functional pstol <dig> alleles that predates and transcends asian rice domestication, a pattern that may reflect fitness tradeoffs associated with geographical variation in soil phosphorus content.
we assessed pstol <dig> presence/absence in a geographically diverse sample of wild, domesticated and weedy rice and sequenced the gene in samples where it is present.
