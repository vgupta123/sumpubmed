bioinformatic searches of the genomes of p. infestans, p. ramorum, and p. sojae reveal they have similar kinomes, which for p. infestans contains  <dig> eukaryotic protein kinases  and  <dig> atypical kinases , equaling 2% of total genes.
protein phosphorylation likely plays crucial roles in these stages, and to help understand this we present here a genome-wide analysis of the protein kinases of p. infestans and several relatives.
also identified were two tyrosine kinases, which are rare in non-metazoans.
the life cycle of p. infestans involves hyphae which differentiate into spores used for dispersal and host infection.
the kinome of hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, an oomycete with a simpler life cycle than p. infestans, was found to be one-third smaller.
after refining gene models, most were classifiable into families seen in other eukaryotes.
little experimentation to date has addressed the biological functions of oomycete kinases, but this should be stimulated by the structural, evolutionary, and expression data presented here.
the study also provides new insight into kinase evolution since oomycetes are taxonomically distant from organisms with well-characterized kinomes.
the large sizes of the phytophthora kinomes imply that phosphorylation plays major roles in their life cycles.
several epks bear accessory domains not identified previously on kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases with integral cyclin domains.
most epks lack accessory domains, implying that many are regulated transcriptionally.
some epk families are nevertheless unusual, especially the tyrosine kinase-like  group which includes large oomycete-specific subfamilies.
