these results suggest that  <dig> .
defining specific interactions between host cells and viral proteins is essential in understanding how viruses exploit cellular functions and the innate strategies underlying cellular control of hiv replication.
<dig> with rev in human cells was shown in a mammalian two-hybrid assay and by colocalization of rev and  <dig> .
<dig> expression influences the transactivation function of rev.
identification of rev-modulating cellular factors may eventually contribute to the design of novel antiviral therapies.
the experimental strategies outlined in this study are applicable to the identification and biological characterization of further novel rev-interacting cellular factors.
the hiv rev protein is a post-transcriptional inducer of hiv gene expression and an important target for interaction with cellular proteins.
<dig> may act as a modulator of rev activity.
<dig> .1-containing fusion proteins showed predominant cytoplasmic localization, which was dependent on crm1-mediated export from the nucleus.
