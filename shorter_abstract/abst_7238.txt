piglets with m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi failed to show vaccine-induced ami responses; there was no rise in m. hyopneumoniae antibody levels following vaccination of piglets in the presence of m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi.
however, piglets with m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi had primary  and secondary  m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses following vaccination.
in this study neonatal m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi was not subject to passive interference by mdi.

the effect of antigen-specific mdi on vaccine-induced ami and cmi responses to mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  was assessed in neonatal piglets.
to determine whether cmi and ami responses could be induced in piglets with mdi, piglets with high and low levels of maternal m. hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against m. hyopneumoniae at  <dig> d of age.
piglet m. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody, lymphoproliferation, and delayed type hypersensitivity  responses were measured  <dig> d and  <dig> d post vaccination.
further, it appears that both maternal derived and endogenous cmi contribute to m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses in piglets vaccinated in the face of mdi.
