the results from the presented experiments demonstrated that selective gene knock-down in subsets of brain cells is achievable.
polymerase ii-based viral expression systems can be used to cell-specifically express constructs incorporating flanking and loop sequences from endogenous microrna , which directs the designed hairpins into the endogenous gene silencing machinery.
while many studies have documented non-cell-selective gene knock-down in the brain, it has not been tested whether different cell types or different areas of the central nervous system  are equally amenable to this approach.
this was not due to regional differences in the expression of the the key enzymes involved in mirna processing.
however, there are some presently unknown regional factors which affect either the processing of mirna-based cassettes or their potency for gene silencing.
