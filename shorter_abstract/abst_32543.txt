exogenous manipulations, such as rnai, are certainly feasible and possibly required to increase the successful application of gene repair in some primary or progenitor muscle cells.
using primary myoblasts from mdx5cv mice, single-stranded dna oligonucleotides were designed to correct this dna mutation.
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in the production of a dysfunctional form of the protein, dystrophin.
single-stranded dna oligonucleotides that were designed to repair this splice site mutation corrected the mutation in the gene and restored expression of wild-type dystrophin.
the mdx5cv mouse is a model of dmd in which a point mutation in exon  <dig> of the dystrophin gene creates an artificial splice site.
