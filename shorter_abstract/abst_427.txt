this makes annotation systems hard to reproduce, inflexible to modification over time, difficult to assess, difficult to partition across multiple geographic sites, and difficult to understand for those who are not domain experts.
typical annotation pipelines utilize traditional database technologies, clustered computing resources, perl, c, and unix file systems to process raw sequence data, identify genes, and predict and categorize gene function.
traditional genome annotation systems were developed in a very different computing era, one where the world wide web was just emerging.
here, we develop a framework for linking traditional data to owl-based ontologies in genome annotation.
in this way, all researchers, experimental and computational, will more easily understand the informatics processes constructing genome annotation and ultimately be able to help improve the systems that produce them.
