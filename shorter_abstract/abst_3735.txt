to examine the mutational landscapes of tumour genomes we have developed a novel method to identify mutational hotspots in tumour genomes using both mutational data and information on evolutionary conservation.
the continuing fall in genome sequencing costs has resulted in a concomitant increase in the number of cancer whole genome sequences being produced, facilitating systematic interrogation of both the coding and non-coding regions of cancer genomes.
we have applied our methodology to over  <dig> whole cancer genomes and show that it identifies prominent coding and non-coding regions that are known or highly suspected to play a role in cancer.
we have developed a framework to identify mutational hotspots in cancer genomes, which is applicable to the entire genome.
the identification of mutations that play a causal role in tumour development, so called “driver” mutations, is of critical importance for understanding how cancers form and how they might be treated.
importantly, we applied our method to the entire genome, rather than relying on predefined annotations  and we highlight recurrently mutated regions that may have resulted from increased exposure to mutational processes rather than selection, some of which have been identified previously as targets of selection.
while the landscape of coding drivers has been extensively studied and many of the most prominent driver genes are well characterised, comparatively less is known about the role of mutations in the non-coding regions of the genome in cancer development.
