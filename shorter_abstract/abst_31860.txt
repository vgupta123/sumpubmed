the mamx protein plays an important role in controlling magnetosome size, maturation, and crystal form.
quantitative real-time rt-pcr  results indicated that the deletion of mamx had differential effects on the transcription levels of the other three genes in the operon.
the mamx gene, located in the mamxy operon, is highly conserved in the mai of all magnetospirillum strains studied to date.
there were no striking differences in cell growth among ∆mamx, cmamx, and wild-type strain .
the four mamxy proteins appear to have redundant functions involved in magnetosome formation.
a mamx deletion mutant  and its complemented strain  by conjugation in m. gryphiswaldense strain msr- <dig> were constructed.
the phenotype of ∆mamx was similar to that of an ftsz-like deleted mutant and mamxy operon deleted mutant reported previously.
magnetotactic bacteria produce membrane-enveloped magnetite crystals  whose formation is controlled primarily by a gene island termed the magnetosome island .
characterization of single gene and operon function in mai has elucidated in part the genetic basis of magnetosome formation.
our findings provide new insights into the coordinated function of mai genes and operons in magnetosome formation.
