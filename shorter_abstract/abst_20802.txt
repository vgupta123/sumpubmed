somatic mammalian cells can be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells by ectopic expression of pluripotency-inducing factors such as oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  c-myc and in some cases nanog and lin- <dig>  however, there is limited information concerning the expression of these factors during natural regenerative processes.
we have identified lin- <dig> as a downstream target of fgf <dig> during the process of retina regeneration.
we present evidence that upon injury, the quiescent  rpe cells transiently dedifferentiate and express sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> along with eye field transcriptional factors and display a differential up-regulation of alternative splice variants of pax <dig>  however, this transient process of dedifferentiation is not sustained unless fgf <dig> is present.
these two ways of regeneration occur concomitantly when an external source of fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  is present after injury .
the embryonic chick can regenerate its retina by transdifferentiation of the retinal pigmented epithelium  and by activation of stem/progenitor cells present in the ciliary margin.
we propose a novel model in which injury signals initiate rpe dedifferentiation, while fgf <dig> up-regulates lin- <dig>  allowing for rpe transdifferentiation to proceed.
