in turn, this behavior creates broader ‘thermodynamically ultra-fastened’  regions characterized by incomplete denaturation of the two dna strands, so reducing amplification efficiency throughout these domains.
this model provides a mechanistic explanation for why some genome regions are particularly difficult to amplify and assay in many procedures, and importantly it also explains inter-sample variability of this behavior.
a major practical consequence of this is that inter-region and inter-sample variability can be largely overcome by employing routine fragmentation methods  prior to sample amplification.
the most affected genome regions tend to correlate with high c + g content, however this relationship is complex and does not explain why the direction and magnitude of effects varies considerably between samples.
