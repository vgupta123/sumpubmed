in contrast, further north in central chile, the correspondence of genetic disjunctions in d. antarctica with long beaches indicates that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation among established kelp populations.
genetic disjunctions in this region appear to correspond to the presence of long beaches.
in contrast, we hypothesised that further south - throughout the region affected by the patagonian ice sheet at the last glacial maximum  - d. antarctica would show relatively little genetic structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.
mitochondrial  and chloroplast  dna analyses of d. antarctica from  <dig> chilean localities  revealed two deeply divergent  clades from the centre and south of the country, with contrasting levels and patterns of genetic structure.
in contrast to the genetic structure found among central chilean populations, samples from the southern chilean patagonian region  were genetically homogeneous and identical to a haplotype recently found throughout the subantarctic region.
we expected that, along the central chilean coast, d. antarctica would show considerable phylogeographic structure as a consequence of the isolating effects of distance and habitat discontinuities.
broadly, this study demonstrates that some taxa may be considered to have either high or low dispersal potential across different temporal and geographic scales.
among populations from central chile , substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales, and a significant isolation-by-distance effect was observed.
southern bull-kelp  has a broad distribution along much of the chilean coast.
the inferred trans-oceanic ancestry of these patagonian populations supports the notion that d. antarctica is capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting.
southern  chile has been recolonised by d. antarctica relatively recently, probably since the lgm.
