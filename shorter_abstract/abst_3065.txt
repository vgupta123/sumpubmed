an amperometric biosensor based on the mutated form of aox from the strain ca <dig> was constructed and revealed an extended linear response to the target analytes, ethanol and formaldehyde, as compared to the sensor based on the native aox.
several point mutations in the aox gene, mostly different between the two mutant alleles, have been identified.
hansenula polymorpha  mutant strains resistant to allyl alcohol in methanol medium were selected.
it can help in creation of improved ethanol biosensors with a prolonged linear response towards ethanol in real samples of wines, beers or fermentation liquids.
the described selection methodology opens up the possibility of isolating modified forms of aox with further decreased affinity toward substrates without reduction of the maximal velocity of reaction.
such strains possessed decreased affinity of alcohol oxidase  towards methanol: the km values for aox of wild type and mutant strains ca <dig> and ca <dig> are shown to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively, whereas vmax values are increased or remain unaffected.
