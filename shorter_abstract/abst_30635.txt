the new approach use patterns of haplotype diversity in the genome: locally in the genome, the number of observed haplotypes is much smaller than the total number of possible haplotypes.
identifying the genetic components of common diseases has long been an important area of research.
we show that the new approach speeds up the hpm method with a factor of  <dig> on a genome-wide dataset with  <dig> individuals typed in  <dig> markers using default parameters and more if the pattern length is increased.
the statistical power to detect association, however, is limited when markers are analysed one at a time.
this can be alleviated by considering multiple markers simultaneously.
recently, genotyping technology has reached the level where it is cost effective to genotype single nucleotide polymorphism  markers covering the entire genome, in thousands of individuals, and analyse such data for markers associated with a diseases.
the haplotype pattern mining  method is a machine learning approach to do exactly this.
