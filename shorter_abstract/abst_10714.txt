wet-lab scientists of the centre for genomic science and database experts from the politecnico of milan in the context of a genomic data model project developed smith.
in order to manage the flow of sequencing data produced at the genomic unit of the italian institute of technology , we developed smith .
this method permits the creation of metadata that can be used to search the database for specific files as well as for statistical analyses.
smith runs automatically and limits direct human interaction mainly to administrative tasks.
sequencing is generally performed by specialized facilities that have to keep track of sequencing requests, trace samples, ensure quality and make data available according to predefined privileges.
the parameters and input data are passed to the workflow engine that performs de-multiplexing, quality control, alignments, etc.
smith is a web application with a mysql server at the backend.
