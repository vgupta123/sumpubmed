we conducted a study to explore the role of opn and thp in canine renal oxalosis.
the other four dogs were assigned to a control group and were injected intravenously with  <dig> % nacl three times a day  for  <dig> consecutive days.
although these two proteins were discovered a long time ago, their role in setting kidney stone formation has not yet been fully investigated.
urinary macromolecules contribute to promoting or inhibiting crystal retention in renal tissue and stone formation.
six dogs were assigned to the treatment group and were injected intravenously with  <dig> Â m potassium oxalate .
together, these results suggest that thp and opn are both involved in the pathogenesis and response to oxalate exposure.
osteopontin  and tamm-horsfall protein  are the most important proteins involved in this process.
immunohistochemistry examination revealed increased tissue expression of opn in the renal tissue while thp was significantly decreased.
