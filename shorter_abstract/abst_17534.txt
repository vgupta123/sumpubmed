we employed bisulfite next generation sequencing to examine the methylation status of the lin <dig> gene and four processed pseudogenes derived from lin <dig>  the objective was to determine whether lin <dig> pseudogenes maintain the same pattern of methylation as the parental gene or acquire a methylation pattern independent of the gene of origin.
in this study, we determined that the methylation status of lin <dig> pseudogenes does not resemble the pattern evident for the lin <dig> gene, but rather these pseudogenes appear to acquire methylation patterns independent of the parental gene.
furthermore, we observed that methylation levels of the examined pseudogenes correlate to the location of insertion within the genome.
lin <dig> pseudogenes inserted into gene bodies were highly methylated in all tissues examined.
in contrast, pseudogenes inserted into genomic regions that are not proximal to genes were differentially methylated in various tissue types.
pseudogenes are transcriptionally silenced by dna methylation, but little is known about how pseudogenes are targeted for methylation or how methylation levels are maintained in different tissues.
our analysis suggests that lin <dig> pseudogenes do not aquire patterns of tissue-specific methylation as for the parental gene, but rather are methylated in patterns specific to the local genomic environment into which they were inserted.
dna methylation directs the epigenetic silencing of selected regions of dna, including the regulation of pseudogenes, and is widespread throughout the genome.
