although we previously showed the potential usefulness of helix polysynaptic circuits, a full characterization of synaptic connectivity and its dynamics during network development has not been performed.
in this paper, we systematically investigated the in vitro formation of polysynaptic circuits, among helix b <dig> and the serotonergic c <dig> neurons, from a morphological and functional point of view.
estimation of the functional connections by means of cross-correlation analysis revealed that networks under elevated kcl concentrations exhibited strongly correlated signals with short latencies , typical of electrically coupled cells.
on the other hand, we found prolonged firing activity, selectively maintained following the first serotonin application.
helix neurons can be individually identified and isolated in cell culture, showing well-conserved size, position, biophysical properties, synaptic connections, and physiological functions.
a large number of invertebrate models, including the snail helix, emerged as particularly suitable tools for investigating the formation of synapses and the specificity of neuronal connectivity.
finally, we clearly demonstrated that these two types of correlations  were effectively related to the presence of electrical or chemical connections, by comparing micro-electrode array  signal traces with intracellularly recorded cell pairs.
networks treated with either potassium or serotonin were predominantly interconnected through electrical or chemical connections, respectively.
furthermore, b <dig> response and short-term increase in c <dig> excitability induced by serotonin is sufficient to trigger spontaneous activity with chemical connections, an important requisite for long-term maintenance of firing activity.
statistical analysis revealed no significant changes in neuronal dynamics during network development.
potassium induced a transient depolarization of all neurons.
