our study systematically analyzes the effects of mouse contamination in the sequencing data of human-in-mouse xenografts.
we conducted comprehensive simulations to compare three alignment strategies at different mutation rates, read lengths, sequencing error rates, human-mouse mixing ratios and sequenced regions.
when these xenografts are subject to dna sequencing, the samples could contain various amounts of mouse dna.
in some scenarios the performance gain of these two special handling strategies was too small for special handling to be cost-effective, but it was found crucial when false non-synonymous snvs should be minimized, especially in exome sequencing.
patient-derived tumor xenografts in mice are widely used in cancer research and have become important in developing personalized therapies.
the combined reference strategy was particularly good at reducing false negative variants calls without significantly increasing the false positive rate.
we also sequenced a nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenograft and a cell line to test how the strategies work on real data.
we found the "filtering" and "combined reference" strategies performed better than aligning reads directly to human reference in terms of alignment and variant calling accuracies.
