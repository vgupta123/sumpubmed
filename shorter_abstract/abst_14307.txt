to test if casein induces a slower rate of gastric emptying in cats than whey protein, l-phenylalanine  was dosed orally into  <dig> adult cats to estimate gastric emptying and whole-body phe flux.
decreasing the rate of protein emptying from the stomach may improve efficiency of utilization of dietary amino acids for protein deposition.
concentrations of indispensable amino acids in plasma were not significantly affected by dietary protein source.
in adult cats fed frequent small meals, the replacement of casein with whey protein in the diet does not affect supply or utilization of amino acids.
first-pass splanchnic extraction of phe was not different between diets and averaged 50% .
phenylalanine fluxes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol/ for casein- and whey-based diets, respectively ).
some studies in rats and humans have shown casein to be more slowly released from the stomach than whey protein.
the half-time for gastric emptying averaged  <dig>  min with casein and  <dig>  min with whey protein, and was not significantly different between diets .
these two milk proteins appear to be equally capable of meeting the dietary amino acid needs of cats.
