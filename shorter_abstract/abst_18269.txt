our analyses further support a close relationship between notonectoidea and pleoidea within nepomorpha, and the superfamilies nepoidea, ochteroidea, naucoroidea, and pleoidea are resolved as monophyletic in all trees with strong support.
we also performed likelihood-ratio tests to examine the support for monophyly of nepomorpha with different combinations of taxa included in the analysis.
most previous studies of morphological and molecular data have consistently supported the monophyly of the true water bugs .
in particular, long-branch attraction  between the distant outgroup taxa and pleoidea, as well as lba among taxa in the ingroup, made nepomorpha appear to be polyphyletic.
based on these results, hua et al.
our results also confirmed that monophyly of nepomorpha clearly is not refuted by the mitochondrial genome data.
, the water bugs in the group pleoidea formed the sister group to a clade that consisted of nepomorpha  + leptopodomorpha  + cimicomorpha  + pentatomomorpha , thereby suggesting that fully aquatic hemipterans evolved independently at least twice.
furthermore, we found that specimens of helotrephes sp.
our reanalysis suggests that the lack of support for the monophyly of the true water bugs  by hua et al.
based on nine nepomorphan mitochondrial genomes.
likely resulted from inadequate taxon sampling.
were misidentified as paraplea frontalis  by hua et al.
