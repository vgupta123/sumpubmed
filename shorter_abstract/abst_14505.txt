we had previously developed a similarity score between sequences, called a local alignment kernel, that exhibits good performance for this task in combination with a support vector machine.
the best performance for homology detection is obtained by the local alignment kernel.
the local alignment kernel depends on an amino acid substitution matrix.
we optimized the substitution matrix by classical gradient descent by setting an objective function that measures how well the local alignment kernel discriminates homologs from non-homologs in the cog database.
this optimization procedure leads to useful substitution matrices, both for the local alignment kernel and the smith-waterman algorithm.
detecting remote homologies by direct comparison of protein sequences remains a challenging task.
the local alignment kernel exhibits better performance when it uses the matrices and gap parameters optimized by this procedure than when it uses the matrices optimized for the smith-waterman algorithm.
furthermore, the matrices and gap parameters optimized for the local alignment kernel can also be used successfully by the smith-waterman algorithm.
