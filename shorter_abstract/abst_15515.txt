when rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner during mouse retinal development, p <dig> is upregulated in a compensatory manner.
in contrast to the developing mouse retina, when rb <dig> was acutely inactivated in the developing human fetal retina, p <dig> was not upregulated in a compensatory manner.
the primary rb family member expressed in proliferating embryonic retinal progenitor cells in mice is p <dig>  which is required for appropriate cell cycle exit during retinogenesis.
we found that the rb family of proteins  are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development.
in the human retina, rb <dig> was the primary family member expressed throughout development.
in this manuscript, we explore the different roles of the rb family in human and mouse retinal development in order to better understand the species-specific difference in retinoblastoma susceptibility.
p <dig> protein is expressed redundantly with rb in postmitotic cells of the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina.
we propose that intrinsic genetic compensation between rb and p <dig> prevents retinoblastoma in rb- or p107-deficient mice, but this compensation does not occur in humans.
the primary rb family member expressed in proliferating postnatal retinal progenitor cells is rb.
there was very little if any p <dig> expressed in the developing human retina.
similarly, when p <dig> is inactivated in the mouse retina, rb is upregulated.
no changes in p <dig> expression were seen when p <dig>  rb or both were inactivated in the developing mouse retina.
