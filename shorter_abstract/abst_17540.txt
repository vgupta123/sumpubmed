th <dig> and pro-inflammatory responses were higher than th <dig> and anti-inflammatory responses, respectively, and ifn-γ:il- <dig> ratios were higher for placebo than for sp recipients.
we evaluated whether intermittent preventive treatment in infants with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine  had an effect on the acquisition of these cellular immune responses in mozambican children.
higher frequencies of ifn-γ and il- <dig> producing cd3+ cells and elevated il- <dig>  ifn-γ, mcp- <dig> and il- <dig> in plasma were individually associated with increased malaria incidence, at different time points.
multiple cytokines and chemokines were quantified in plasma by luminex, and antigen-specific cytokine production in whole blood was determined by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry, at ages  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> months.
ipti-sp did not significantly affect the proportion of cd3+ cells producing ifn-γ, il- <dig> or il- <dig>  overall, plasma cytokine or chemokine concentrations did not differ between treatment groups.
plasma concentrations of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were associated with current infection or prior malaria episodes.
this study has also provided new insights as to how these cytokine responses are acquired upon age and exposure to p. falciparum, as well as their associations with malaria susceptibility.
cytokines and chemokines are key mediators of anti-malarial immunity.
