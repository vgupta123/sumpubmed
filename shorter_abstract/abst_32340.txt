here, we have characterized the secretion of gaussia luciferase in more detail.
we describe three basic mechanisms by which gluc can be released from cells: first, classical secretion by virtue of the n-terminal signal peptide; second, internal signal peptide-mediated secretion and third, non-conventional secretion in the absence of an n-terminal signal peptide.
due to its secretion via multiple secretion pathways gluc can find multiple applications as a research tool to study classical and non-conventional secretion.
non-conventional release of dngluc is not stress-induced, does not require autophagy and can be enhanced by growth factor stimulation.
a variety of secreted luciferases from marine organisms have been described that harbor an n-terminal signal peptide for release along the classical secretory pathway.
