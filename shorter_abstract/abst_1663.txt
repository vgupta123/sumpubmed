prolactin is also found in multiple fluids throughout the body, including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid .
in this study, we measured prolactin levels in both plasma and csf, and performed a genome-wide association study.
we identified  <dig> snps associated with increased prolactin levels in both biological fluids.
prolactin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that plays an essential role in lactation, tissue growth, and suppressing apoptosis to increase cell survival.
