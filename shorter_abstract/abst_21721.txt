these data suggest that jhd2-mediated alleviation of excessive csm1/lrs <dig> or condensin at the nts <dig> region of rdna is required for the integrity of rdna repeats and proper rdna silencing during mitosis.
our results show that yeast jhd <dig>  which demethylates histone h <dig> lys <dig> near the rdna locus, regulates rdna repeat stability and rdna silencing in a sir2-independent manner by maintaining csm1/lrs <dig> and condensin association with rdna regions during mitosis.
our fish analyses further demonstrate that the demethylase activity of jhd <dig> regulates mitotic rdna condensation and that jhd2-deficient cells contain the mostly hypercondensed rdna mislocalized away from the nuclear periphery.
we found that lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig> methylation within histone h <dig> acts as a bivalent marker for the regulation of rdna recombination and rent complex-mediated rdna silencing, both of which are sir2-dependent pathways.
in this context, jhd <dig> regulates rdna recombination through the tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> pathway and prevents excessive recruitment of tof <dig>  csm1/lrs <dig> and condensin subunits to the replication fork barrier site within the nts <dig> region.
nucleolar ribosomal dna is tightly associated with silent heterochromatin, which is important for rdna stability, nucleolar integration and cellular senescence.
by contrast, we found that jhd <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved jarid <dig> family h <dig> lys <dig> demethylase, affects all states of methylated h3k <dig> within the nontranscribed spacer  regions of rdna and that its activity is required for the regulation of rdna silencing in a sir2-independent manner.
