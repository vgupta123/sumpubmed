we show how the loop fragments cover practically all ultrahigh resolution crystallographic protein structures in protein data bank , with a  <dig>  Ångström root-mean-square  precision.
these fragments are all different parameterisations of a unique kink solution to a generalised discrete nonlinear schrödinger  equation.
protein loops are built in a modular fashion.
we introduce the concepts of protein loop clustering and percolation, to develop a quantitative approach to systematically classify the modular building blocks of loops in crystallographic folded proteins.
there are many examples of loop fragments with an identical amino acid sequence, but with a very different structure.
furthermore, we have found that the amino acid sequence does not determine the structure in a unique fashion.
we find that no more than  <dig> different loop fragments are needed, to describe around  <dig> % of ultrahigh resolution loops in pdb.
accordingly, the fragments are also local energy minima of the ensuing energy function.
but there is also a large number of loop fragments that are either unique, or very rare, and examples of unique fragments are found even in the structure of a myoglobin.
the majority of loop fragments are also common, which are shared by many proteins.
the loops are composed of fragments that can be modelled by the kink of the dnls equation.
