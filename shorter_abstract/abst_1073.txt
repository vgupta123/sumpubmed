tspgwi also possesses an n-terminal pd-xk nuclease domain related to the corresponding domains in hsdr subunits, but lacks the atp-dependent translocase module of the hsdr subunit and the additional domains that are involved in subunit-subunit interactions in type i systems.
tspgwi is a bifunctional protein comprising a tandem arrangement of type i-like domains; particularly noticeable is the central hsdm-like module comprising a helical domain and a highly conserved s-adenosylmethionine-binding/catalytic mtase domain, containing dpavgtg and nppy motifs.
the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme shares significant sequence similarity with another representative of the thermus sp.
restriction-modification systems are a diverse class of enzymes.
we have previously proposed the existence of a thermus sp.
the mtase and rease activities of tspgwi are autonomous and can be uncoupled.
enzyme family, which belongs to type ii restriction endonucleases , however, it features also some characteristics of types i and iii.
both the restriction endonuclease  and methyltransferase  activities of wild type  tspgwi  are dependent on the presence of divalent cations.
we cloned, expressed, and mutagenised the tspgwi gene and investigated the properties of its product, the bifunctional tspgwi restriction/modification enzyme.
they are classified into four major types: i, ii, iii and iv.
