these cells are particularly suited for studies into autocrine and paracrine regulation of various aspects of trophoblast function.
expression of trophoblast markers , invasion abilities and transcriptome of ach-3p closely resembled primary trophoblasts.
hla-g positive ach-3p display pseudopodia and a stronger expression of extravillous trophoblast markers.
as an example a novel effect of tnf-Î± on matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> in hla-g positive ach-3p and explants was found.
the different subpopulations of trophoblasts e.g., villous and extravillous trophoblasts also exist in ach-3p cells and can be immuno-separated by hla-g surface expression.
higher expression of insulin-like growth factor ii receptor and human chorionic gonadotropin represents the basis for the known autocrine stimulation of extravillous trophoblasts.
we established a first trimester trophoblast cell line  by fusion of primary human first trimester trophoblasts  with a human choriocarcinoma cell line .
