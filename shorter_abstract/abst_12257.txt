our results demonstrated that heterologous expression of banana mapip1; <dig> in arabidopsis confers salt and drought stress tolerances by reducing membrane injury, improving ion distribution and maintaining osmotic balance.
overexpression of mapip1; <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in an increased primary root elongation, root hair numbers and survival rates compared to wt under salt or drought conditions.
transient expression of mapip1;1-gfp fusion protein indicated its localization at plasma membrane.
physiological indices demonstrated that the increased salt tolerance conferred by mapip1; <dig> is related to reduced membrane injury and high cytosolic k+/na+ ratio.
aquaporin  proteins function in transporting water and other small molecules through the biological membranes, which is crucial for plants to survive in drought or salt stress conditions.
finally, reduced expression of aba-responsive genes in mapip1;1-overexpressing plants reflects their improved physiological status.
additionally, the improved drought tolerance conferred by mapip1; <dig> is associated with decreased membrane injury and improved osmotic adjustment.
however, the precise role of aqps in drought and salt stresses is not completely understood in plants.
