the inhibitory activity of the test strain is due to the synthesis of an antimicrobial protein.
it was completely inactivated by treatment with proteinase k and partially by pronase e.
the peptide showed very low haemagglutination and haemolytic activities against human red blood cells.
the acp retained biological stability after heat-treatment at 90°c for  <dig> min, maintained activity over a ph range 6– <dig>  and remained active after treatment with α-amylase, lipase, organic solvents, and detergents.
the  <dig> amino acid n terminal sequence was obtained by edman degradation.
an attempt has been made to purify and characterise an anti-candida compound produced by enterococcus faecalis.
an anti-candida protein  produced by e. faecalis active against 8 c. albicans strains was characterised and partially purified.
the antimicrobial activity of the e. faecalis strain was found exclusively in the extracellular filtrate produced in the late logarithmic growth phase.
to our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a promising non-haemolytic anti-candida protein from e. faecalis that might be used to treat candidiasis especially in immunocompromised patients.
