asynapsis of these arms and the persistent dsbs then trigger transcriptional silencing through meiotic sex chromosome inactivation , resulting in formation of the xy body.

to gain more insight into the regulation and significance of msci and pscr among different eutherian species, we have performed a global analysis of xy pairing dynamics, dsb repair, msci and pscr in the domestic dog , for which the complete genome sequence has recently become available, allowing a thorough comparative analyses.
in addition to par synapsis between x and y, we observed extensive self-synapsis of part of the dog x chromosome, and rapid loss of known markers of dsb repair from that part of the x. sequencing of rna from purified spermatocytes and spermatids revealed establishment of msci.
this may be partially explained by extensive, but transient, self-synapsis of the x chromosome, in association with rapid completion of meiotic dsb repair.
in male mouse meiosis, the largely heterologous x and y chromosomes synapse only in their short pseudoautosomal regions , and dsbs persist along the unsynapsed non-homologous arms of these sex chromosomes.
our comparative analysis was then used to identify two x-linked genes that may escape msci in spermatocytes, and  <dig> that are specifically re-activated in spermatids of human, mouse and dog.
in addition, our comparative analysis identifies novel candidate male fertility genes.
however, the self-synapsing region of the x displayed higher x-linked gene expression compared to the unsynapsed area in spermatocytes, and was post-meiotically reactivated in spermatids.
