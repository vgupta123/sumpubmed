it causes stress and defence reactions for instance via induction of the jasmonate and ethylene biosynthesis, and by consequent gene expression alteration regulated by these hormones.
comparison of these results to a previous transcriptional profiling of hc-pro rss-expressing plants revealed that some of same genes were induced by both rsss, but their expression levels were typically higher in ac <dig> than in hc-pro rss expressing plants.
the three most up-regulated transcript groups were related to stress, cell wall modifications and signalling, whereas the three most down-regulated groups were related to translation, photosynthesis and transcription.
all in all, a large number of transcript alterations were found to be specific to each of the rss expressing transgenic plants.
expression of ac <dig> rss in transgenic tobacco plants induced clear phenotypic changes both in leaves and in flowers.
ac <dig> rss in transgenic tobacco plants interferes with the silencing machinery.
it appears that many of the gene expression alterations appeared to be related to enhanced biosynthesis of jasmonate and ethylene, and consequent enhancement of the genes and pathways that are regulated by these hormones, or to the retrograde signalling caused by the reduced photosynthetic activity and sugar metabolism.
the changed sugar metabolism may cause significant down-regulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, thus reducing the general translation level.
rna-silencing is a conserved gene regulation and surveillance machinery, which in plants, is also used as major defence mechanism against viruses.
various virus-specific dsrna structures are recognized by the silencing machinery leading to degradation of the viral rnas or, as in case of begomoviruses, to methylation of their dna genomes.
