the findings suggest strong influence of genetic factors across vertebrate genomes.
snpks consists of two major steps: to obtain an initial effective size by the kolmogorov-smirnov test  and to find an intermediate effective size by interval evaluation.
the effective snp size was estimated to be  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the human, chimpanzee, dog, and mouse genomes, respectively, and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in human intergenic, genic, intronic, and cpg island regions, respectively.
the application of snpks to the real snp data revealed the similar small effective snp size  in the human, chimpanzee, dog, and mouse genomes as well as in human genomic regions.
the snpks algorithm was implemented in computer programs and applied to the real snp data.
the local environment of single nucleotide polymorphisms  contains abundant genetic information for the study of mechanisms of mutation, genome evolution, and causes of diseases.
it remains unsolved for the estimation of the effective snp size, the number of snps that are sufficient to represent the bias patterns observed from the whole snp data.
recent studies revealed that neighboring-nucleotide biases on snps were strong and the genome-wide bias patterns could be represented by a small subset of the total snps.
to estimate the effective snp size, we developed a novel statistical method, snpks, which considers both the statistical and biological significances.
snpks is the first statistical method to estimate the effective snp size.
