the early events underlying alzheimer's disease  remain uncertain, although environmental factors may be involved.
we have found that acute hsv <dig>  infection rapidly reduces full length app levels – as might be expected – yet surprisingly markedly increases levels of a novel c-terminal fragment of app of about  <dig> kda.
herpes virus infection leads to rapid loss of full length app from cells, yet also causes increased levels of a novel  <dig> kda c-terminal app fragment.
this band was not increased in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
however to date the effects of acute herpesvirus infection on metabolism of app in human neuronal-type cells have not been investigated.
