calcium  has recently been shown to selectively increase the activity of monoamine oxidase-a , a mitochondria-bound enzyme that generates peroxyradicals as a natural by-product of the deamination of neurotransmitters such as serotonin.
the effects of a <dig> and cb-28k are both independent of any change in mao-a protein or gene expression.
it has also been suggested that increased intracellular free ca2+ levels as well as mao-a may be contributing to the oxidative stress associated with alzheimer disease .
the toxicity  associated with either a <dig> or the ad-related Î²-amyloid peptide, which also increases free intracellular ca2+, is attenuated by mao-a inhibition in ht- <dig> cells as well as in primary hippocampal cultures.
treatment of ht- <dig> cultures with the ca2+ ionophore a <dig> also increases mao-a activity, whereas overexpression of calbindin-d28k , a ca2+-binding protein in brain that is greatly reduced in ad, decreases mao-a activity.
these data suggest that increases in intracellular ca2+ availability could contribute to a mao-a-mediated mechanism with a role in ad-related oxidative stress.
