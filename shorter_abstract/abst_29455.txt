caspases are a family of cysteinyl proteases that regulate apoptosis and other biological processes.
the majority of these proteins are involved in signal transduction, regulation of cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, integrity of the nucleus, and development of nerve cells.
identification of caspase- <dig> cellular targets is crucial to gain further insights into the cellular mechanisms that have been implicated in various diseases including: cancer, neurodegenerative, and immunodeficiency diseases.
human proteome screening, using cat <dig>  indicate the presence of a large number of possible caspase- <dig> substrates that exceed the anticipated figure.

in contrast to other tools which were trained on cleavage sites of various caspases as well as other similar proteases, cat <dig> showed a significant decrease in the false positive rate.
caspase- <dig> is considered the central executioner member of this family with a wide range of substrates.
assessing prediction accuracy using  <dig> fold cross validation, our method shows auc  of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> %, and specificity of  <dig> %.
cat <dig> is a powerful tool that is a clear improvement over existing similar tools, especially in reducing the false positive rate.
the ability of cat <dig> in predicting the precise cleavage site was demonstrated in comparison to existing state-of-the-art tools.
here, we describe a powerful bioinformatics tool that can predict the presence of caspase- <dig> cleavage sites in a given protein sequence using a position-specific scoring matrix  approach.
the developed tool, cat <dig>  was used to screen  <dig>  human proteins with assigned gene ontology terms.
in addition to their involvement in various expected functions such as cytoskeleton organization, nuclear integrity and adhesion, a large number of the predicted substrates are remarkably associated with the development of nerve tissues.
