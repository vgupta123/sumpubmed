mldl has been shown to exhibit isopeptidase, muramidase and antibacterial activity.
we determined that mldl-ds <dig>   <dig>   <dig> possessed non-enzymatic antibacterial activity independent of their muramidase activity.
the enzymatic properties of pure mldl isoforms have not yet been described because only destabilase complexes containing other proteins could be isolated from the salivary gland secretion and because low product yield from the generation of recombinant proteins has made comprehensive testing difficult.
the data obtained in our study led to the suggestion that the recombinant mldl isoforms isolated from inclusion bodies form stable oligomeric complexes.
for the first time, we demonstrated the fibrinolytic activity of the recombinant mldl and showed that only intact proteins possessed this activity, suggesting their enzymatic nature.
destabilase-lysozyme  is a multifunctional i-type enzyme that has been found in the secretions from the salivary glands of medicinal leeches.
in the present study, we optimised the procedures related to the expression, isolation and purification of active mldl isoforms  using an escherichia coli expression system, and we detected and compared their muramidase, lytic, isopeptidase and antimicrobial activities.
analyses of the tested activities revealed that all isoforms exhibited almost identical patterns of ph and ionic strength effects on the activities.
