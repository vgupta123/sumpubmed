in order to investigate the diversity and specificity among hydrogeanse specific proteases we constructed a phylogenetic tree which revealed several subgroups that showed a striking resemblance to the subgroups previously described for -hydrogenases.
the last step in the maturation process of the large subunit of -hydrogenases is a proteolytic cleavage of the c-terminal by a hydrogenase specific protease.
additionally the proteases specificity was also addressed by amino acid sequence analysis and protein-protein docking experiments with 3d-models derived from bioinformatic studies.
our findings suggest that the hydrogenase specific proteases are under similar regulatory control as the hydrogenases they cleave.
finally we present data that may explain the specificity seen among hydrogenase specific proteases, the so called "hoxbox"; an amino acid sequence specific for proteases of hox-type.
this opens the door for more detailed studies of the specificity found among hydrogenase specific proteases and the structural properties behind it.
the filamentous cyanobacteria nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> and nostoc sp strain pcc  <dig> may contain a single uptake hydrogenase or both an uptake and a bidirectional hydrogenase respectively.
contrary to other accessory proteins these hydrogenase proteases are believed to be specific whereby one type of hydrogenases specific protease only cleaves one type of hydrogenase.
these studies revealed a so called "hoxbox"; an amino acid sequence specific for protease of hox-type which might be involved in docking with the large subunit of the hydrogenase.
this co-evolution could be the result of a close interaction between the protease and the large subunit of the -hydrogenases, a theory supported by protein-protein docking experiments performed with 3d-models.
in order to examine these proteases in cyanobacteria, transcriptional analyses were performed of hupw in nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> and hupw and hoxw in nostoc sp.
