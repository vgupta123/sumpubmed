organizing the i. ricinus single kunitz-domain peptides based on their cysteine motif allowed us to specify a putative target and to relate this target specificity to illumina transcript reads during tick feeding.
the overall interpretation of our analyses discloses a rapidly emerging kunitz group with a distinct disulfide bond pattern from the i. ricinus salivary gland transcriptome.
the red queen hypothesis offers a fruitful theoretical framework to give a dynamic explanation for host-parasite interactions.

we observe that several of these kunitz peptide groups vary in their translated amino acid sequence, secondary structure, antigenicity, and intrinsic disorder, and that the majority of these groups are subject to a purifying  selection.
we propose a model to explain the structural and functional evolution of tick salivary kunitz peptides that we call target-oriented evolution.
the two main mechanisms advocated to explain the functional heterogeneity of tick salivary kunitz-domain proteins are gene sharing and gene duplication.
tick salivary kunitz-domain proteins perform multiple functions within the feeding lesion and have been classified as venoms; thereby, constituting them as one of the important elements in the arms race with the host.
using the recent salivary gland ixodes ricinus transcriptome we analyze, for the first time, single kunitz-domain encoding transcripts by means of computational, structural bioinformatics and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the structural evolution of this important multigenic protein family.
both do not, however, elucidate the evolution of the kunitz family in ticks from a structural dynamic point of view.
we finalize by describing the evolution and emergence of these kunitz peptides.
