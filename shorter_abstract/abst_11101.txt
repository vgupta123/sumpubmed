the question of how genomic processes, such as gene duplication, give rise to co-ordinated organismal properties, such as emergence of new body plans, organs and lifestyles, is of importance in developmental and evolutionary biology.
we conclude that the diversification of the tgf-β pathway can be parsimoniously explained according to the 2r model, with additional rounds of duplications in teleost fishes.
after an investigation of  <dig> genomes, we show that the emergence of the tgf-β pathway coincided with appearance of the first known animal species.
we subsequently retrace duplications in ancestral genomes on the lineage leading to humans, as well as lineage-specific duplications, such as those which gave rise to novel smads and receptors in teleost fishes.
our results challenge the view of well-conserved developmental pathways.
herein, we focus on the diversification of the transforming growth factor-β  pathway – one of the fundamental and versatile metazoan signal transduction engines.
finally, we investigate duplications followed by accelerated evolution which gave rise to an atypical tgf-β pathway in free-living bacterial feeding nematodes of the genus rhabditis.
the tgf-β signal transduction engine has expanded through gene duplication, continually adopting new functions, as animals grew in anatomical complexity, colonized new environments, and developed an active immune system.
