treatment for 90 min resulted in the identification of  <dig> up-regulated expressed sequences tags  and  <dig> down-regulated ests.
some of the changes may represent specific adaptive responses to this compound in this important pathogenic fungus.
in this work we examined the gene expression changes in paracoccidioides yeast cells following oenb treatment in order to investigate the adaptive cellular responses to drug stress.
we constructed differential gene expression libraries using representational difference analysis  of paracoccidioides yeast cells treated with oenb for  <dig> and 180 min.
infection experiments in macrophages corroborated the in vitro results.
the carbohydrate polymer content of the cell wall of the fungus was also evaluated, and the results corroborated with the transcriptional data.
several other genes, such as those involved in a variety of important cellular processes  were found to be up-regulated in response to oenb treatment.
fluorescence microscopy showed increased levels of chitin in cells treated with oenb.
the compound oenothein b , which is isolated from the leaves of eugenia uniflora, a brazilian cerrado plant, interferes with paracoccidioides yeast cell morphology and inhibits  <dig> -β-d-glucan synthase  transcript accumulation, which is involved in cell wall synthesis.
genes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis, such as gln <dig>  kre <dig> and fks <dig>  were found to be regulated by oenb.
the exposure of paracoccidioides to oenb resulted in a complex altered gene expression profile.
