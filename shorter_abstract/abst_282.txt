the total protein and rmp <dig> yield was  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l, which was accomplished via the use of medium number  <dig>  the peptone and yeast extract from hongrun baoshun  more effectively improved the total protein and the yield of rmp <dig> to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l compared to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l that resulted from oxoid .
furthermore, we observed that the total protein, antimicrobial activity and rmp <dig> yield from the fermentation supernatant increased from  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  au/ml, and  <dig>  mg/l, respectively, in ph <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  au/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively in ph  <dig>  in a 5-l fermenter.
these results provide an economical method for the high-level production of rmp <dig> under the control of the gap promoter.
the novel plectasin-derived antimicrobial peptide-mp <dig> gene was constitutively expressed under the control of the gap promoter.
it’s the highest level of antimicrobial peptides expressed in pichia pastoris using gap promoter so far.

antimicrobial peptides are ideal therapy candidates for antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
however, due to high production costs, novel methods of large-scale production are urgently needed.
finally, the recombinant mp <dig> was purified with a cation-exchange column with a yield of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig> % purity, and a molecular weight of  <dig>  da, which was consistent with its theoretical value of 4383 da.
the optimum carbon source and concentration were determined, and 4% glucose  was initially selected as the best carbon source.
