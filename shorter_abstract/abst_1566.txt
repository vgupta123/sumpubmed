progress in the life sciences cannot be made without integrating biomedical knowledge on numerous genes in order to help formulate hypotheses on the genetic mechanisms behind various biological phenomena, including diseases.
here we address the extraction of related genes by searching for densely-connected subgraphs, which are modeled as cliques, in a biomedical relational graph.
we constructed a graph whose nodes were gene or disease pages, and edges were the hyperlink connections between those pages in the online mendelian inheritance in man  database.
the results of experiments using 'metabolic syndrome'-related gene modules show that the gene modules can be used to get a coherent holistic picture helpful for interpreting relations among genes.
the extracted gene sets provide a holistic picture useful for comprehending complex disease mechanisms.
