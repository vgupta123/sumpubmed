we summarize the results with a simple, three-panel diagnostic visualization featuring a scatterplot of the standard data with logistic standard curve and 95% confidence intervals, an annotated histogram of sample measurements, and a plot of the 95% concentration coefficient of variation, or relative error, as a function of concentration.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  is a standard immunoassay to estimate a protein's concentration in a sample.
in our illustration, we fit a standard curve to the screened and normalized data, review the modeling diagnostics, and apply propagation of error.
displaying the results in the three-panel layout succinctly summarizes both the standard and sample data while providing an informative critique of applicability of the fitted model, the uncertainty in concentration estimates, and the quality of both the experiment and the elisa microarray process.
we use an elisa microarray investigation of breast cancer biomarkers to illustrate the evaluation of concentration estimation errors.
in this paper, we present a statistical method based on propagation of error to evaluate concentration estimation errors in the elisa microarray process.
therefore, we briefly discuss the roles of experimental design, data screening, normalization, and statistical diagnostics when evaluating elisa microarray concentration estimation errors.
evaluating estimation error is critical to interpreting biological significance and improving the elisa microarray process.
