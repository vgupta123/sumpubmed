population expansion events were inferred for populations of clade c, north china plain region, clade b and yungui plateau region at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> Â years bp, respectively.
conflicting results were obtained from mtdna and microsatellite analyses; strong population genetic structure was obtained from mtdna data but not microsatellite data.
the microsatellite data indicated that genetic subdivision fits an isolation-by-distance  model, but the mtdna data failed to support this model.
this study also provides insights on the necessity of conservation of m. pilosus populations to conserve this genetic biodiversity, especially in the areas of ytp, scb and nsc regions.
apparently contradictory genetic structure patterns of mtdna and microsatellite could be explained by male-mediated gene flow among populations.
our results suggested that pleistocene climatic oscillations might have had a profound influence on the demographic history of m. pilosus.
phylogenetic analyses showed that m. pilosus comprised three main lineages: a, b and c, which corresponded to distinct geographic populations of the yangtze plain , sichuan basin  and north and south of china , respectively.
the most recent common ancestor of m. pilosus was dated as  <dig>  million years before present .
there are at least three possible refugia for m. pilosus during glacial episodes.
in the present study, we used a combination of microsatellites and mitochondrial dna  to investigate the phylogeography of the east asian fish-eating bat .
