it has been shown that blip tyr <dig> is a specificity determinant in that substitutions at this position result in large differential changes in the relative affinity of blip for class a β-lactamases.
these findings cannot be easily rationalized based on the β-lactamase residues in direct contact with blip tyr <dig> since they are identical for bla <dig> and kpc- <dig> suggesting that differences in the blip-β-lactamase interface outside the local environment of tyr <dig> influence the effect of substitutions.
results from this study and previous studies suggest that substitutions at blip tyr <dig> may induce changes at the interface outside its local environment and point to the complexity of predicting the impact of substitutions at a protein-protein interaction interface.
β-lactamase inhibitory protein  competitively inhibits class a β-lactamases via two binding loops that occlude the active site.
the results indicate the sequence requirements at position  <dig> are widely different depending on the target β-lactamase.
the production of β-lactamases by bacteria is the most common mechanism of resistance to the widely prescribed β-lactam antibiotics.
in this study, the effect of systematic substitutions at blip position  <dig> on binding to class a β-lactamases was examined to further explore the role of blip tyr <dig> in modulating specificity.

stringent sequence requirements were observed at tyr <dig> for binding bacillus anthracis bla <dig> while moderate requirements for binding tem- <dig> and relaxed requirements for binding kpc- <dig> β-lactamase were seen.
