finally, a relevant fraction of m1a lineages present today in the european continent and nearby islands possibly had a jewish instead of the commonly proposed arab/berber maternal ascendance.
the striking parallelism between subclade ages and geographic distribution of m <dig> and its north african u <dig> counterpart strongly reinforces this scenario.
the earliest m <dig> expansion into africa occurred in northwestern instead of eastern areas; this early spread reached the iberian peninsula even affecting the basques.
the majority of the m1a lineages found outside and inside africa had a more recent eastern africa origin.
the coalescence age of the african haplogroup m <dig> is younger than those for other m asiatic clades.
both western and eastern m <dig> lineages participated in the neolithic colonization of the sahara.
this study provides evidence that m <dig>  or its ancestor, had an asiatic origin.
it has been proposed that the east african clade m <dig> supports a single origin of haplogroup m in africa.
to test the validity of that hypothesis, the phylogeographic analysis of  <dig> complete mitochondrial dna  sequences and  <dig> partial sequences belonging to haplogroup m <dig> was carried out.
the m <dig> geographic distribution and the relative ages of its different subclades clearly correlate with those of haplogroup u <dig>  for which an eurasian ancestor has been demonstrated.
