the clusterization and the ranking of kegg pathways based on their efficiency were performed.
"amino acid metabolism" and "genetic information processing" revealed the highest efficiencies among other functional classes of kegg pathways.
23- <dig> june  <dig> ix international conference on the bioinformatics of genome regulation and structure\systems biology  novosibirsk, russia
an approach for estimating pathway efficiency using the matrix of intra/inter-compartmental ppi frequency, based on analysis of reactions efficiencies distribution was suggested.
biological processes are usually distributed over various intracellular compartments.
"nervous system" and "signaling molecules interaction" contained the most inefficient pathways.
however, the proposed method does not require such data and can be used for preliminary analysis of different protein networks.
however, the difference in the reaction rates between similar proteins among different compartments is usually quite high.
using data from the databases string, andsystem, intact and uniprot, a ppi frequency matrix of intra/inter-compartmental interactions efficiencies was constructed.
