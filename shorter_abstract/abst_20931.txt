conceptually, our findings unravel the complexity of gene regulation, as regards key genes involved in the heterocellular cell adhesion between developing thymocytes and the major component of the thymic microenvironment, an interaction that is a mandatory event for proper intrathymic t cell differentiation.
developing thymocytes interact with thymic microenvironment in a defined spatial order.
there is evidence that extracellular matrix molecules play a fundamental role in guiding differentiating thymocytes in both cortical and medullary regions of the thymic lobules.
a component of thymic microenvironment, the thymic epithelial cells, is crucial for the maturation of t-lymphocytes through cell-cell contact, cell matrix interactions and secretory of cytokines/chemokines.
such a decrease comprised all cd4/cd8-defined thymocyte subsets.
functionally, we demonstrated that disruption of vla- <dig> in human tec by cd49e-sirna-induced gene knockdown decreased the ability of tec to promote thymocyte adhesion.
the thymus is a central lymphoid organ, in which bone marrow-derived t cell precursors undergo a complex process of maturation.
our previous results have shown that adhesion of thymocytes to cultured tec line is enhanced in the presence of fibronectin, and can be blocked with anti-vla- <dig> antibody.
for this purpose we knocked down the cd49e by means of rna interference.
the interaction between the integrin α5β <dig>  and fibronectin is relevant for thymocyte adhesion and migration within the thymic tissue.
