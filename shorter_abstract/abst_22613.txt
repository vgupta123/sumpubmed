proteomic analysis showed 1- <dig> genes, mainly i-type, expressed in individual accessions.
three i-type genes, each containing more than six allelic variants, were tightly linked because of their co-segregation in every accession.
only 2- <dig> allelic variants were detected for each m- and s-type gene.
the m-type gene, tua3- <dig>  for which homologs were previously characterized only at glu-d <dig> locus in common wheat and aegilops tauschii, was detected at glu-a <dig> locus in t. urartu.
about 62% accessions had three active i-type genes, rather than one or two in common wheat.
phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated that the characterized t. urartu might be the direct donor of the glu-a <dig> locus in common wheat varieties.
compared with the glu-a <dig> locus in common wheat, a large number of highly diverse lmw-gs genes and active genes were characterized in t. urartu, demonstrating that this progenitor might provide valuable genetic resources for lmw-gs genes to improve the quality of common wheat.
in the present study, we exploited the high-throughput molecular marker system, gene cloning, proteomic methods and molecular evolutionary genetic analysis to reveal the composition, variation, expression and evolution of lmw-gs genes in a t. urartu population from the fertile crescent region.
eight lmw-gs genes, including four m-type, one s-type and three i-type, were characterized in the t. urartu population.
southeastern turkey might be the center of origin and diversity for t. urartu due to its abundance of lmw-gs genes/genotypes.
the phylogenetic analysis provided molecular evidence and confirmed that t. urartu was the a-genome donor of hexaploid wheat.
this problem, however, can be greatly simplified by characterizing the lmw-gs genes in triticum urartu, the a-genome donor of hexaploid wheat.
tua3- <dig> was the first s-type gene identified at glu-a <dig> locus.
