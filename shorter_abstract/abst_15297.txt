a computational analysis of zebrafish trfs shows that they are conserved among vertebrates and mining of publicly available datasets reveals that some 5′trfs are differentially expressed in disease conditions, namely during infection and colorectal cancer.
the trfs identified are 18– <dig> nt long, are derived from specific 5′ and 3′ processing of mature trnas and are differentially expressed during development and in differentiated tissues, suggesting that they are likely produced by specific processing rather than random degradation of trnas.
we further show that a highly expressed trf  is cleaved in vitro by dicer and has silencing ability, indicating that it can enter the rnai pathway.
trfs constitute a class of conserved regulatory rnas in vertebrates and may be involved in mechanisms of genome regulation and in some diseases.
