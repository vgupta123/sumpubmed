this work identified  <dig> nets that are predicted to have important functions in muscle development and/or maintenance from their expression patterns during myoblast differentiation and in mouse tissues.
using transcriptional microarray analysis, we found that expression of  <dig> of the nets significantly increases during myoblast differentiation.
the lamina is involved in nuclear structure, gene expression, and association of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton with the nucleus.
the nuclear lamina is a protein meshwork lining the inner nuclear membrane, which contains a polymer of nuclear lamins associated with transmembrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane.
we previously identified a group of  <dig> novel putative nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins  in a large-scale proteomics analysis.
four members of this group have potential signaling functions at the ne, based on their sequence homologies.
we confirmed these results using quantitative rt-pcr, and furthermore, found that all  <dig> nets are expressed at high levels in adult mouse skeletal muscle relative to  <dig> other tissues examined.
our goal was to identify new nuclear envelope and lamina components whose expression is coordinated with muscle differentiation.
furthermore, the  <dig> nets that we could analyze by immunoblotting were highly enriched in nuclear envelopes relative to microsomal membranes purified from mouse liver.
because mutations in lamina proteins have been linked to several human diseases affecting skeletal muscle, we examined net expression during differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts.
using epitope-tagged cdnas, we determined that the  <dig> nets we could analyze  all target to the nuclear envelope in c2c <dig> cells.
we confirmed that  <dig> of these nets are authentic nuclear envelope proteins.
