together with ever improving rnai lab techniques, these design rule sets are expected to make sirnas a more useful tool for molecular genetics, functional genomics, and drug discovery studies.
a comparison with  <dig> online sirna design tools indicated that some of the rule sets we developed surpassed all of these design tools commonly used in sirna design practice in positive predictive values .
using a distinctly large set of sirna efficacy data assembled from a vast diversity of origins , we conducted extensive analyses of all known features that have been implicated in increasing rnai effectiveness.
by performing quantitative analyses on cooperative effects among these features, then applying a disjunctive rule merging  algorithm, we developed a bundle of sirna design rule sets with the false positive problem well curbed.
however, while these methods continue to grow in popularity, designing effective sirna experiments can be challenging.
a number of features having positive impacts on sirna efficacy were identified.
