generation of large mate-pair libraries is necessary for de novo genome assembly but the procedure is complex and time-consuming.
furthermore, in some complex genomes, it is hard to increase the n <dig> length even with large mate-pair libraries, which leads to low transcript coverage.
in these two examples, the transcript coverage was almost complete, especially for long transcripts.
with expanded human transcriptome data, the n <dig> of human genome was doubled and l_rna_scaffolder out-performed most scaffolding results by existing scaffolders which employ mate-pair libraries.
to demonstrate the accuracy of the method, the zebrafish genome was scaffolded.
we applied l_rna_scaffolder to the highly polymorphic pearl oyster draft genome and the gene model length significantly increased.
we describe l_rna_scaffolder, a novel genome scaffolding method that uses long transcriptome reads to order, orient and combine genomic fragments into larger sequences.
