further, a reported increase in serum testosterone after long-term  castration constituted a basis for testing the hypothesis that a spontaneous increase in serum testosterone or androstenedione in this model causes a commensurate increase in baroreflex-mediated bradycardia.
a spontaneous recovery of baroreflex-mediated bradycardia occurred following long-term castration, although circulating testosterone and androstenedione remained suppressed.
2) the long-term modulation of baroreflex-mediated bradycardia occurs independent of androgens, or the baroreflex mechanism may become adapted to low levels of circulating androgens.
the data suggest: 1) 17Î²-estradiol does not contribute to testosterone restoration of the baroreflex-mediated bradycardia in short-term castrated rats.
