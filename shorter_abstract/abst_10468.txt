also imc is completely passive, so after evaluation, ampoule contents  can be analyzed by any other method desired.
however, imc provided new additional data – a continuous record of heat-producing bacterial activity  in calorimetry ampoules at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations.
here we present the data for the  <dig> antibiotics and two representative microorganisms e. coli  and s. aureus .
it easily provides accurate mics – plus a potential means for analyzing and comparing the modes of action of antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations.
imc can be a powerful tool for determining the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms in vitro.
antibiotics with similar modes of action proved to have similar effects on tdelay and/or Δq/Δt.
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms is performed by either disc diffusion or broth dilution tests.
