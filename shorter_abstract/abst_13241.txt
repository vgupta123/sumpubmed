sequence motifs representing transcription factor binding sites  are commonly encoded as position frequency matrices  or degenerate consensus sequences .
these formats are used to represent the characterised tfbs profiles stored in transcription factor databases, as well as to represent the potential motifs predicted using computational methods.
the method selects the best non-redundant motif set, with repetitive motifs merged together, by cutting the hierarchical tree using silhouette values.
matlign is a user-friendly tool for post-processing large collections of dna sequence motifs.
to fill the gap between the known and predicted motifs, methods are needed for the post-processing of prediction results, i.e.
the tool aligns and evaluates the similarity of motifs using a combination of scoring functions, and visualises the results using hierarchical clustering.
our analyses show that matlign can reliably discover the most similar analogue from a collection of characterised regulatory elements such that the method is also useful for the annotation of motif predictions by pfm library searches.
starting from a large number of potential regulatory motifs, matlign provides a researcher with a non-redundant set of motifs, which can then be further associated to known regulatory elements.
