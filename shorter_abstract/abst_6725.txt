the snp-phage package is being made available open source at .
results have to be stored in a relational database to facilitate interrogation through queries or to generate data for further analyses such as determination of linkage disequilibrium and identification of common haplotypes.
for snp discovery from chromatogram data, several bioinformatics programs have to be combined to generate an analysis pipeline.
although these tasks are routinely performed by several groups, an integrated open source snp discovery pipeline that can be easily adapted by new groups interested in snp marker development is currently unavailable.
a machine learning tool developed by this group for increasing the efficiency of snp discovery is integrated as a part of this package as an optional feature.
snp-phage provides a bioinformatics solution for high throughput snp discovery, identification of common haplotypes within an amplicon, and genbank  submissions.
scripts to generate a user-friendly web interface are also provided with common queries for preliminary data analysis.
snp selection and visualization are aided through a user-friendly web interface.
