cog analysis divided the identified mrnas and proteins into  <dig> and  <dig> categories, respectively,  <dig> mrnas and  <dig> proteins appeared to be involved in cell cycle control, cell division and chromosome partitioning.
until now, there is no such research relevant to exosomal mrnas and proteins in porcine milk, therefore, we have attempted to investigate porcine milk exosomal mrnas and proteins using rna-sequencing and proteomic analysis.

these results provide the first insight into porcine milk exosomal mrna and proteins, and will facilitate further research into the physiological significance of milk exosomes for infants.
additionally,  <dig> selected mrnas were identified by qpcr, meanwhile,  <dig> proteins related to immunity and cell proliferation were detected by western blot.
recent reports demonstrated that milk is enriched in maternal-derived exosomes that are involved in fetal physiological and pathological conditions by transmission of exosomal mrnas, mirnas and proteins.
