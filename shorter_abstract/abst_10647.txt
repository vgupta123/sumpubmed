in this paper we focus on the problems of deciding consistency with a species tree  of a partial set of orthology/paralogy relationships c on a collection of n genes.
orthologs inference is the starting point of most comparative genomics studies, and a plethora of methods have been designed in the last decade to address this challenging task.
we also investigate a biologically meaningful optimization version of these problems, in which we wish to minimize the number of duplication events; unfortunately, we show that all these optimization problems are np-hard and are unlikely to have good polynomial time approximation algorithms.
we give the first polynomial algorithm – more precisely a o time algorithm – to decide whether c is consistent, even when the species tree is unknown.
