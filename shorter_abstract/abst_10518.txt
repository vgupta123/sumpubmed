estimating the interactome size is important for evaluating the completeness of current datasets, in order to measure the remaining efforts that are required.
our method leads to higher and more accurate estimates of the interactome size, as it accounts for interactions that are genuine yet difficult to detect with commonly-used experimental assays.
in particular, these interactions are less often supported by yeast two-hybrid, and more often by more complex experiments such as biochemical activity assays.
consequently, several large-scale interactome mapping projects have been undertaken, and protein-protein interactions are being distilled into databases through literature curation; yet protein-protein interaction data are still far from comprehensive, even in the model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae.
we discovered that the set of literature-curated protein-protein interactions is qualitatively different when restricted to proteins that have received extensive attention from the scientific community.
it yields an estimate of at least  <dig>   <dig> direct physical protein-protein interactions in s. cerevisiae.
our analysis showed that high-throughput and literature-curated interactome datasets are more correlated than commonly assumed, but that this bias can be corrected for by focusing on well-studied proteins.
