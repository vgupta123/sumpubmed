such networks can be used to visualize folding pathways in terms of the experimentally observed intermediates.
in this representation, the shuffling transitions are within the planes, and the redox edges connect adjacent planes.
the oxidative folding space can be represented as a network of dis states interconnected by disulfide interchange reactions that can either create/abolish or rearrange disulfide bridges.
we propose a simple 3d representation wherein the states having the same number of disulfide bridges are placed on separate planes.
