no differences in innervation densities were found across the sole of the foot using the two staining techniques: nav <dig>  immunochemistry ) and the sihler’s method ).
the computer simulation of the effects of skin thicknesses and innervation densities on thresholds of modeled aδ and aβ fibers did not reveal differences in pain and perception thresholds across the foot sole as have been observed experimentally.
human nociceptive withdrawal reflexes  can be evoked by electrical stimulation applied to the sole of the foot.
however, the results indicate that there are no nociceptive intraepidermal nerve fibers  innervating the heel.
the nerve staining and modeling results do not explain differences in nwr thresholds across the sole of the foot which may suggest that central mechanisms contribute to variation in nwr excitability across the sole of the foot.
secondly, mathematical modeling was used to investigate to what degree differences in skin thicknesses affect the activation thresholds of aδ and aβ fibers in the sole of the foot.
the first part of the study investigated the neural innervation in different sites of the sole of the foot using two different staining techniques.
the model included three different sites in the sole of the foot  and three different electrode sizes .
instead a lack of ienfs at the heel decreased the electrical activation thresholds compared to models including ienfs.
for each of the  <dig> combinations of site and electrode size, a total of  <dig> aβ fibers and  <dig> aδ fibers was modeled.
the aim of the present study was to investigate potential peripheral mechanisms for any site dependent differences in reflex thresholds.
