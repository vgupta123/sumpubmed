in order to identify the factors involved in intra-mammary infection  and diffusion in dairy cows, we investigated the molecular characteristics of two groups of staph.
the two groups of strains, one originated from high imi prevalence herds and the other from low imi prevalence herds, present a peculiar set of genes and polymorphisms related to phenotypic features, such as bacterial invasion of mammary epithelial cells and host adaptation.
staphylococcus aureus  is one of the major pathogens causing mastitis in dairy ruminants worldwide.
