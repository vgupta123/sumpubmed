fs-indels either modify the complete c-terminal region of the protein or result in premature termination of translation.
in order to study the relationships between nfs-indels and mendelian diseases, we characterized nfs-indels according to numerous structural, functional and evolutionary parameters.
nfs-indels insert/delete multiples of three nucleotides leading to the insertion/deletion of one or more amino acids.
the rules are interpretable by non-expert humans and they thus represent new knowledge about the relationships between the genotype and phenotypes of nfs-indels and the causative molecular perturbations that result in the disease.
when an indel occurs within a coding region, it can be either frameshifting  or non-frameshifting .
however, a major advantage of our approach is that we also provide the reasons for the predictions, in the form of a set of rules.
a major challenge is to predict the effects of these indels and to distinguish between deleterious and neutral variants.
we then used these parameters to identify specific characteristics of disease-causing and neutral nfs-indels.
small insertion and deletion polymorphisms  are the second most common mutations in the human genome, after single nucleotide polymorphisms .
