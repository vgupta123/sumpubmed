nafld is associated with significant shifts in the methylation of key genes responsible for ba and dm that are associated with transcriptional modulations.
in a targeted analysis we specifically investigate to what extent nafld is associated with methylation and transcriptional changes in gene networks responsible for drug metabolism  and bile acid  homeostasis, which may trigger liver and system toxic events.
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  is associated with a high risk for liver cirrhosis and cancer.
using multiple linear regression models, we detected methylation differences in proximity to the transcriptional start site of these genes in two nafld cohorts and correlated the methylation of significantly changed cpg sites to transcriptional expression in a third cohort using robust multiple linear regression approaches.
these findings have implications for ba composition, ba regulated metabolic pathways and for drug safety and efficacy.
we performed a systematic analysis of  <dig> genes responsible for ba homeostasis and dm based on liver derived methylation and expression data from three cohort studies including  <dig> nafld and  <dig> non-nafld patients.
we detected  <dig> genes involved in ba homeostasis and dm to be significantly differentially methylated.
