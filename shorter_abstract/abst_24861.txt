information content of a partition increases when clusters do not intersect and decreases if they are not clearly separated.
a partition with the highest total information content  is selected as the optimal one.
partition quality is measured based on a new index called net information transfer index  that measures the information change when an additional cluster is introduced.
clustering techniques are routinely used in gene expression data analysis to organize the massive data.
we have developed a novel method to find the number of clusters in gene expression data.
we illustrate our method using four publicly available microarray datasets.
in contrast to the existing methods that evaluate the partitions independently, our procedure considers the dynamic rearrangement of cluster members when a new cluster is added.
in all four case studies, the proposed method correctly identified the number of clusters and performs better than other well known methods.
clustering techniques arrange a large number of genes or assays into a few clusters while maximizing the intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster separation.
