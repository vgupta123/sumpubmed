introduced a method called networkreducer, which reduces large metabolic networks to smaller subnetworks, while preserving a set of biological requirements that can be specified by the user.
does not allow specifying the different biological requirements.
here we present an milp approach for computing minimum subnetworks with the given properties.
our procedure is about 5- <dig> times faster than networkreducer and can enumerate all minimum subnetworks in case there exist several ones.
compared to previous work, our approach is more efficient and allows computing not only one, but even all minimum subnetworks satisfying the required properties.
applying complex analysis methods to genome-scale metabolic networks is often not possible in practice.
while some of the associated algorithms can be applied to genome-scale network reconstructions with several thousands of reactions, others are limited to small or medium-sized models.
