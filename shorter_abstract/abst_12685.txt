the homology between contig sequences generated in each pooled library and mapped est sequences was studied.
among the fast sequencing systems,  <dig> liquid phase pyrosequencing provides the longest reads and is the most promising method for bac clones.
the dna samples of  <dig> or  <dig> bac clones were pooled and used for shotgun library development.
we demonstrate the efficiency of sequencing gene rich regions from barley chromosome 3h, with special reference to syntenic relationships with rice chromosome  <dig>
homology analysis of these contigs with rice genes indicated that  <dig>  rice genes can be assigned to barley contigs by the simple comparison of sequence lengths in both species.
here we report the results of pooled sequencing of bac clones selected with ests genetically mapped to chromosome 3h.
the identified contigs can be annotated with barley cdnas and reference sequences on the browser.
a pcr screening system based on primer sets derived from genetically mapped ests on chromosome 3h was used for clone selection in a bac library developed from cultivar "haruna nijo".
the number of contigs assigned on chromosome 3h was  <dig>  their lengths ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp with an average  <dig>  bp.
we sequenced pooled barley bac clones using a  <dig> parallel genome sequencer.
