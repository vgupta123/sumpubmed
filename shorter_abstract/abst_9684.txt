the introduced tools depict mutually compensative effects between parameters to provide insight regarding role of individual parameters, identifiability and experimental design.
analysis of nf- κb and mapk pathway models shows that highly compensative parameters constitute clusters consistent with the network topology.
the method applied to examine an exceptionally rich set of published experiments on the nf- κb dynamics reveals that the experiments jointly ensure identifiability of only  <dig> % of model parameters.
as a results, a relevant insight into identifiability analysis and experimental planning can be obtained.
progress in developing mathematics to manipulate such multi-parameter models and so enable their efficient interplay with experiments has been slow.
in order to simplify analysis of multi-parameter models a method for clustering of model parameters is proposed.
we currently lack methods that simplify broadly understood analysis of multi-parameter models.
compared to engineering or physics problems, dynamical models in quantitative biology typically depend on a relatively large number of parameters.
the method indicates which further experiments should be performed in order to increase the number of identifiable parameters.
