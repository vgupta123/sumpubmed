however, ranbpm protein containing highly conserved spry, lish, ctlh and cra domains is currently considered as a scaffolding protein with multiple cellular functions.
atranbpm protein has highly conserved spry, lish, ctlh and cra domains.
immunopurification of atranbpm followed by mass spectrometric analysis identified proteins containing lish and cra domains; lish, cra, ring-u-box domains and a transducin/wd <dig> repeats in a complex with atranbpm.
microscopic analysis of gfp-atranbpm in vivo and immunofluorescence localization of endogenous atranbpm protein in cultured cells and seedlings of arabidopsis showed mainly cytoplasmic and nuclear localization.
absence of colocalization with Î³-tubulin was consistent with the biochemical data and suggests another than a centrosomal role of the atranbpm protein.
we showed that as yet uncharacterized arabidopsis ranbpm protein physically interacts with lish-ctlh domain-containing proteins.
although the exact functions of the ctlh complexes in scaffolding of protein degradation, in protein interactions and in signalling from the periphery to the cell centre are not yet fully understood, structural conservation of the complexes across eukaryotes suggests their important biological role.
ranbpm  was originally reported as a centrosome-associated protein in human cells.
based on sequence similarity, we identified a homologue of the human ranbpm in arabidopsis thaliana.
