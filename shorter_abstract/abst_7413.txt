epifluorescence microscopy is a common method used to enumerate virus-like particles  from environmental samples and relies on the use of filter membranes with pore sizes <  <dig>  μm; the most commonly used protocols employ  <dig> mm anodisc™ membranes with a built-in support ring.
both nuclepore membranes typically gave an order of magnitude lower vlp abundance values for environmental samples.
this method increases the options of reliable approaches available for quantifying vlp from environmental samples.
other filters with small pore sizes exist, including the  <dig> mm anodisc™ membranes without a support ring.
we compared vlp concentrations obtained from phage lysates and seawater samples using both anodisc membranes, as well as nuclepore™ small pore-size membranes .
here we describe a modified protocol for  <dig> mm anodisc membranes that uses a custom filter holder that can be readily constructed in individual investigators' laboratories from commercially available swinnex® filter holders.
the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes gave comparable estimates of vlp abundance to those obtained with the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes when similar staining methods were employed.
the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes are less costly and require smaller sample volumes than their  <dig> mm counterpart making them ideal for large-scale studies and sample replication.
