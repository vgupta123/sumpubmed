genomics research was fueled initially by government and nonprofit funding sources, later augmented by private research and development  funding.
this study focuses on public funding of genomics research, identifying and collecting data from major government and nonprofit organizations around the world, and updating previous estimates of world genomics research funding, including information about geographical origins.
we initially identified  <dig> publicly funded organizations; we requested information about each organization's funding of genomics research.
of these organizations,  <dig> responded and  <dig> reported genomics research expenditures .
the figures reported here include all the largest funders and we estimate that we have accounted for most of the genomics research funding from government and nonprofit sources.
aggregate spending on genomics research from  <dig> funding sources averaged around $ <dig>  billion in  <dig> â€“  <dig>  the united states spent more than any other country on genomics research, corresponding to 35% of the overall worldwide public funding .
when adjusted to genomics funding intensity, however, the united states dropped below ireland, the united kingdom, and canada, as measured both by genomics research expenditure per capita and per gross domestic product.
