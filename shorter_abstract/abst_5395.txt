species tree estimation is challenged by gene tree heterogeneity resulting from biological processes such as duplication and loss, hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting , and horizontal gene transfer .
mathematical theory about reconstructing species trees in the presence of hgt alone or ils alone suggests that quartet-based species tree methods  might be effective techniques for estimating species trees when both hgt and ils are present.
our study shows that two quartet-based species tree estimation methods  are both highly accurate, even on datasets with high rates of hgt.
the study suggests the possibility that some quartet-based methods might be statistically consistent under phylogenomic models of gene tree heterogeneity with both hgt and ils.
our study shows that quartet-based species-tree estimation methods can be highly accurate under the presence of both hgt and ils.
we evaluated several publicly available coalescent-based methods and concatenation under maximum likelihood on simulated datasets with moderate ils and varying levels of hgt.
in contrast, although njst and concatenation using maximum likelihood are highly accurate under low hgt, they are less robust to high hgt rates.
