we present rnaseg, an algorithm for the prediction of transcriptional units based on drna-seq data.
we show the performance of our method based on a well-studied drna-seq data set for helicobacter pylori.
while expression profiling and transcriptional start site prediction are standard tasks today, the problem of identifying transcriptional units in a genome-wide fashion is still not solved for prokaryotic systems.
furthermore, the program provides many different predictions in a single run, which can be used to infer the significance of transcriptional units in a consensus procedure.
