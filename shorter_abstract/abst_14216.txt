the structural maintenance of chromosome proteins smc <dig> and smc <dig> play an important role in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity by preventing the premature separation of the sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase.
hinderin is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues.
this has lead to the identification of hinderin, a novel five domains protein including two coiled-coil motifs and sharing a strikingly structural similarity to the smc family of proteins.
in order to identify proteins that by binding to smc <dig> may interfere with the protein dimerization process, a human cdna library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid system by using the hinge region of smc <dig> as bait.
orthologue forms of the protein are present in other vertebrates but not in lower organisms.
a mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the n- and c-terminal globular domains mediate the binding of hinderin to smc <dig>  hinderin/smc <dig> complexes could be recovered by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates using an anti-smc <dig> antibody, thus demonstrating that the two proteins interact in vivo.
on the contrary, hinderin did not interact with smc <dig>  in vivo the rate of smc1/smc <dig> interaction was decreased by the ectopic expression of hinderin.
