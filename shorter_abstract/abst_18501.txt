we hope that our analysis will help guide biomedical scientists in selecting the most appropriate database for their needs especially in light of the dramatic differences in their content.
we analyzed the major publicly available primary databases that contain literature curated ppi information for human proteins.
the number of literature citations for the ppis included in the databases was  <dig>  in hprd,  <dig>  in mint,  <dig>  in intact,  <dig>  in bind and < <dig>  in the remaining databases.
a number of publicly available repositories for human ppis are currently available.
the number of binary non-redundant human ppis ranged from  <dig> in pdzbase and  <dig> in mips to  <dig>  in mint and  <dig>  in hprd.
given the importance of ppis, we suggest that submission of ppis to repositories be made mandatory by scientific journals at the time of manuscript submission as this will minimize annotation errors, promote standardization and help keep the information up to date.
each of these databases has their own unique features with a large variation in the type and depth of their annotations.
