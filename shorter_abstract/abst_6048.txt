the smoothed solution that is free of parametric bias permits differentiation, which is crucial for the numerical decoupling of systems of differential equations.
structure identification of dynamic models for complex biological systems is the cornerstone of their reverse engineering.
in this report we propose a robust, fully automated solution for signal extraction from time series, which is the prerequisite for the efficient reverse engineering of biological systems models.
the method is applicable in signal extraction from time series with nonstationary noise structure and can be applied in the numerical decoupling of system of differential equations into algebraic equations, and thus constitutes a rather general tool for the reverse engineering of mechanistic model descriptions from multivariate experimental time series.
the resulting procedure can be used on arbitrary time series with a nonstationary noise process; it is illustrated here with metabolic profiles obtained from in-vivo nmr experiments.
our original implementation relied on artificial neural networks , which caused slight, undesirable bias during the smoothing of the time courses.
while described here within the context of bst, this procedure has a general applicability to signal extraction.
