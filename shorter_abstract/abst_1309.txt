the statistical methods described in the paper are available as an r package, metaarray  <dig> .
with the explosion in data generated using microarray technology by different investigators working on similar experiments, it is of interest to combine results across multiple studies.
the methods are illustrated with application to a meta-analysis of datasets for metastatic cancer.
a key feature of the model is the use of latent variables that represent quantities that can be combined across diverse platforms.
