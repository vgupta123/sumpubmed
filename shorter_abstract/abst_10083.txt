these results offer an explanation for the wild-type binding of the dcc along the drosophila x chromosome, contribute to delineate the forces leading to the establishment of dosage compensation and suggest new experimental approaches to understand the precise biochemical features of the dosage compensation system.
comparative data indicate that the same sequences may be involved in dosage compensation in other drosophila species.
in this study, we compare the known binding sites of the dcc with oligonucleotide profiles that measure the specificity of the sequences of the d. melanogaster x chromosome.
their distribution suggests that these sequences contribute to chromosome recognition, the generation of dcc binding sites and/or the local spreading of the complex.
in drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation is mediated by the action of the dosage compensation complex .
