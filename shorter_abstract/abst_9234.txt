published molecular phylogenies are usually based on data whose quality has not been explored prior to tree inference.
using data from published molecular analyses on the phylogeny of crustaceans it is shown that tree topologies and popular support values do not show existing differences in data quality.
to increase confidence in molecular phylogenies an exploratory analysis of the signal to noise ratio can be conducted with split decomposition methods.
this leads to errors because trees obtained with conventional methods suppress conflicting evidence, and because support values may be high even if there is no distinct phylogenetic signal.
class i effects consist of attraction of terminal taxa caused by symplesiomorphies, which results in a false monophyly of paraphyletic groups.
to visualize variations in signal distinctness, we use network analyses based on split decomposition and split support spectra.
class iii effects consist of attraction due to accumulated chance similarities or convergent character states.
tools that allow an a priori examination of data quality are rarely applied.
both methods show the same differences in data quality and the same clade-supporting patterns.
class ii effects are caused by drastic signal erosion.
long branches affected by this phenomenon usually slip down the tree to form false clades that in reality are polyphyletic.
if long-branch effects are detected, it is necessary to discern between three classes of effects to find the best approach for an improvement of the raw data.
to recover the correct phylogeny, more conservative genes must be used.
