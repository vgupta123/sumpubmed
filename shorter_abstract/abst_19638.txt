therefore it is not expected that there is a simple explanation with an obvious candidate gene but it is more likely a network of genes and intragenic variants that explain the variation of these traits.
refined qtl regions were imputed to the full sequence data.
by analyzing imputed sequence data the qtl position on bta <dig> was narrowed down to two regions in the nh.
bta <dig> was analyzed using sequence data for the nh breed.
screening bta <dig> and bta <dig> for female fertility traits in nh, nr and dj suggested that the qtl for female fertility were specific for nh.
fertility traits are complex traits as many different biological and physiological factors determine whether a cow is fertile.
the genes in the regions were then studied to ascertain their possible effect on fertility traits.
a missense mutation in cd <dig> showed the strongest association with fertility traits on bta <dig>  the annotated snps on bta <dig> were all intergenic variants.
two qtl regions on bta <dig> and on bta <dig> previously detected in nordic holstein  and validated in the danish jersey  and nordic red  were investigated further in the present study to further refine the qtl locations.
no markers in the dj and nr breeds reached significance.
bta <dig> was screened for number of inseminations , 56-day non-return rate , days from first to last insemination , and the interval from calving to first insemination  in the range of  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> bp, whereas bta <dig> was screened for icf only in the range from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> with the hd bovine snp array for nh, dj and nr.
female fertility is important for the maintenance of the production in a dairy cattle herd.
