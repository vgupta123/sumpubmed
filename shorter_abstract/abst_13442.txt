three genomic regions were found to exhibit a significant association at a stringent threshold  and all of the most highly resistant pis shared the same alleles at these three qtls.
a total of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were obtained and used to perform an association analysis for ssr by using a mixed linear model as implemented in the tassel software.
with this end in view, we assessed resistance using a highly reproducible artificial inoculation method on a diverse collection of  <dig> soybean lines, mostly composed of plant introductions  and some of which had previously been reported to be resistant to sclerotinia stem rot.
overall, 50% of the lines exhibited a level of resistance equal to or better than the resistant checks among elite material.
sclerotinia stem rot  is the most important soybean disease in eastern canada.
this work will facilitate breeding efforts for increased resistance to sclerotinia stem rot through the use of these pis.
