the method comprises the induction of changes in methylation/demethylation of the endogenous gene by the plant’s treatment with short oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to the coding region.
nowadays, the challenge for biotechnology is to develop tools for agriculture and industry to provide plants characterized by productivity and quality that will satisfy the growing demand for different kinds of natural products.
in addition, emo-βglu flax obtained by this technology showed similar features as those obtained by genetic engineering.
in vitro cultured plants and f <dig> generation flax plants overproducing the β- <dig> -glucanase gene  were characterized by up-regulation of β-glucanase and chitinase genes, decreases in the methylation of ccgg sequences in the β-glucanase gene and in total dna methylation and, more importantly, reasonable resistance against fusarium infection.

however, the strong social resistance to genetically modified organisms and restrictive regulations in european union countries necessitated the development of a new technology for new plant types generation which uses the knowledge resulting from analysis of genetically modified plants to generate favourably altered plants while omitting the introduction of heterologous genes to their genome.
