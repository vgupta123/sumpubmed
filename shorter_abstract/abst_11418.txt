negative energy balance , an altered metabolic state, occurs in early postpartum dairy cattle when energy demands to support lactation exceed energy intake.
a total of  <dig> down-regulated putative target genes were also identified among  <dig> differentially expressed hepatic genes previously reported for the same animal model.
furthermore, hnf3-gamma , a hepatic transcription factor  that is involved in igf- <dig> expression regulation and maintenance of glucose homeostasis is a putative target of mir- <dig>
this study shows that sneb affects liver mirna expression and these mirnas have putative targets in hepatic genes down-regulated under this condition.
mirna expression was profiled in the liver of moderate yielding dairy cattle under severe neb  and mild neb  using the affymetrix gene chip mirna_ <dig>  array with  <dig> probe sets for bos-taurus mirnas.
during neb the liver undergoes oxidative stress and increased breakdown of fatty acids accompanied by changes in gene expression.
it is now known that micro rnas  can have a role in mediating such alterations in gene expression through repression or degradation of target mrnas.
this study highlights the potential role of mirnas in transcription regulation of hepatic gene expression during sneb in dairy cattle.
mirna expression is known to be altered by metabolism and environmental factors and mirnas are implicated in expression modulation of metabolism related genes.
among these, gpr <dig> , heyl , dnja <dig>  cd <dig>  and gns -6-sulfatase) are known to be associated with hepatic metabolic disorders.
mir- <dig> and mir-17-5p are known to show differential expression under oxidative stress.
