however, this requires the identification and use of stable resistance genes that are effective across different environments.
pyramiding these genes in the same background is likely to result in stable resistance to nclb.
genome-wide association study reveals that nclb resistance is a complex trait which is under the control of many minor genes with relatively low effects.
northern corn leaf blight  caused by exserohilum turcicum is a destructive disease in maize.
an association panel including  <dig> diverse lines was evaluated for resistance to nclb in multiple environments, and a large number of resistant lines were identified and can be used as reliable resistance resource in maize breeding program.
to identify genomic regions associated with nclb resistance in maize, a genome-wide association analysis was conducted using  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphism markers.
single-marker and haplotype-based associations, as well as anderson-darling tests, identified alleles significantly associated with nclb resistance.
