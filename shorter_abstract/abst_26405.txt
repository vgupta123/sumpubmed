the whole-genome qtl meta-analysis reduced by six-fold late blight resistance qtls , by ca.
to get insight into the genomic organization of late blight resistance loci as compared to maturity qtls, a qtl meta-analysis was performed for both traits.
meta-analysis helped to refine the genomic regions of interest frequently described, and provided the closest flanking markers.
integrating qtl results from independent experiments performed on related species helps to survey the genetic diversity of loci/alleles underlying complex traits, and to highlight potential targets for breeding or qtl cloning.
the anchorage of meta-qtls to the potato genome sequence, recently publicly released, will especially improve the candidate gene selection to determine the genes underlying meta-qtls.
meta-qtls of late blight resistance and maturity juxtaposed along chromosomes iv, v and viii, and overlapped on chromosomes vi and xi.
potato  late blight resistance has been thoroughly studied, generating mapping data for many rpi-genes  and qtls .
moreover, late blight resistance was often associated with plant maturity.
nineteen qtl publications for late blight resistance were considered, seven of them reported maturity qtls.
late blight resistance meta-qtls were observed on every chromosome and maturity meta-qtls on only six chromosomes.
the distribution of late blight resistance meta-qtls is significantly independent from those of rpi-genes, resistance gene analogs and defence-related loci.
twenty-one qtl maps and eight reference maps were compiled to construct a  <dig> -marker consensus map on which qtls were projected and clustered into meta-qtls.
five-fold maturity qtls , and by ca.
