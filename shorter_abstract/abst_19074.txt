our results provided new insights into the transcriptional organization and gene structure of fd.
in this work, rna-seq technology followed by three de novo assembly strategies was used to provide the first comprehensive transcriptomics landscape of flavescence dorée phytoplasma  infecting field-grown vitis vinifera leaves.
the rna-seq technology was successfully applied for the first time to analyse the fd global transcriptome profile during grapevine infection.
interestingly, qrt-pcr validation of the rna-seq expression values confirmed that a group ii intron represented the fd genomic region with the highest expression during grapevine infection.

functional classification revealed that the most expressed genes were either related to translation and protein biosynthesis or hypothetical proteins with unknown function.
some of these hypothetical proteins were predicted to be secreted, so they could be bacterial effectors with a potential role in modulating the interaction with the host plant.
this mobile element may contribute to the genomic plasticity that is necessary for the phytoplasma to increase its fitness and endorse host-adaptive strategies.
this may represent the starting point for the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to study differential expression in fd and in other phytoplasmas with an unprecedented resolution.
