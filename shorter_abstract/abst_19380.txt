since the microarray design was based on a platform that permits flexible in situ oligonucleotide synthesis, a set of optimally performing probes could be defined by a selection approach that combined computational and experimental aspects.
the performance of the optimized microarray was demonstrated in a pilot study.
the genotypes of  <dig> hay-fever patients  with high ige levels against inhalant antigens were compared to the results obtained with  <dig> age- and sex-matched controls.
while the in silico process eliminated 9% of the initial probe set, which had been picked purely on the basis of potential association with disease, the subsequent experimental validation excluded more than twice as many.
genetic variants in immune regulator genes have been associated with numerous diseases, including allergies and cancer.
for the genotyping of immune regulator genes, such as cytokines, chemokines and transcription factors, an oligonucleotide microarray for the analysis of  <dig> relevant snps was established.
for several variants, allele-frequency differences of more than 10% were identified.
