addition of  <dig> nm pab <dig> or pab <dig> to rat drg cultures resulted in the  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold enhancement of myelination respectively while addition of mmp- <dig> to drg co-cultures resulted in enhanced mapk, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> phosphorylation.
these results suggest inhibition of mmp- <dig> may be beneficial under conditions of dysmyelination.
mmp- <dig> protein expression was increased within demyelinated lesions of mouse experimental autoimmune encephalitis  and human multiple sclerosis lesions compared to surrounding normal tissue.
metalloproteinases are important mediators in the development of the nervous system and can contribute to the maturation of the neural micro-environment.
