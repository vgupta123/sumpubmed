here we show that sr-a deficient mice and wild type mice are equally susceptible to malaria infection both during liver and blood stages.
our results do not reveal a function of sr-a i and ii receptors in the plasmodium berghei anka infection, both in the development of cm and parasitemia control.
moreover, like wild type mice, sr-a deficient mice are able to mount a protective immune response against radiation attenuated sporozoites.
mice deficient for both sr-ai and ii are more susceptible to infections by a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens.
moreover, these receptors appear not to be required for the establishment of a protective immune response against the malaria liver stages.
