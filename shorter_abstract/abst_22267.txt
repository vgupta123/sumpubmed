our results demonstrate that the north american wheat breeding lines have several resistance loci that provide apr and seedling resistance to highly virulent pgt races.
the lines included in this study were grouped into two major clusters, based on the results of principal component analysis using  <dig>  snp markers.
using the resistant lines and the snp markers identified in this study, marker-assisted resistance breeding can assist in development of varieties with elevated levels of resistance to virulent stem rust races including ttksk.
we also identified putatively novel sr resistance genes on chromosomes 3b, 4d, 5a, 5b, 6a, 7a, and 7b.
using a mixed linear model,  <dig> snp markers associated with apr against ug <dig> were detected, including markers linked with the known apr gene sr <dig>  using the same model,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snp markers associated with seedling resistance against races ttksk, trttf, and tkttf were identified, respectively.
upon screening for adult plant resistance  to ug <dig> during  <dig> and  <dig> in artificial stem rust screening nurseries at njoro, kenya and at debre zeit, ethiopia, several wheat lines were found to exhibit apr.

in an effort to identify loci conferring resistance to these races, a genome-wide association study was carried out on a panel of  <dig> spring wheat breeding lines from the international maize and wheat improvement center , six wheat breeding programs in the united states and three wheat breeding programs in canada.
tritici  race ttksk  poses a severe threat to global wheat production because of its broad virulence on several widely deployed resistance genes.
