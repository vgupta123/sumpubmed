the endochitinase component of the dimer changed post trichoderma inoculation.
we examined the differential expression of the entire suite of chitinolytic enzymes in maize plants in the presence and absence of t. harzianum.
it was found to be a heretofore undiscovered heterodimer between an exo- and an endo-enzyme, and the endo portion differed between plants colonized with t. harzianum and those grown in its absence and between shoots and roots.
the heterodimeric enzymes from shoots in the presence and absence of t. harzianum were purified and characterized.
in a previous study, we identified the numerous chitinolytic enzyme families and individual enzymes in maize which are implicated in plant disease resistance and other plant responses.
the interaction of plants with endophytic symbiotic fungi in the genus trichoderma alters the plant proteome and transcriptome and results in enhanced plant growth and resistance to diseases.
the dimer originating from trichoderma inoculated plants had a higher antifungal activity than the comparable enzyme from control plants.
the dimeric enzyme from trichoderma-inoculated plants had higher specific activity and greater ability to inhibit fungal growth than those from control plants.
the activity of specific chitinolytic enzymes was higher in plants grown from trichoderma treated seeds than in control plants.
