a systematic random sampling technique was used to collect  <dig> blood samples from pigs in central ethiopia.
a questionnaire survey was made to assess potential risk factors and knowledge of farm attendants about toxoplasmosis.
pigs supplied with feed containing animal byproducts had nearly four times  higher risk of acquiring t. gondii infection.
t. gondii infections in pigs are wide spread.
the high seroprevalence suggests that pigs might serve as an important source of t. gondii infection for people.
this is the first report of seroepidemiology of t. gondii infection in pigs in ethiopia.
multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that extensively managed pigs  are nearly twice  at higher risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis than intensively managed pigs .
absence of rodent control, high neonatal mortality and history of abortion were found among herds of the studied pig farms.
most of the farm attendants had little knowledge of health risks due to cats, neither to human nor to animals.
extensive management systems and pig feed types containing animal byproducts are independent predictors of t. gondii seropositivity.
toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widely prevalent cyst forming apicomplexan parasites with significant impact on animal production particularly in sheep, goats and pigs.

the objectives of this cross-sectional study were to estimate the seroprevalence and to assess risk factors of toxoplasma gondii infection in pigs.
direct agglutination test  was used to test sera.
