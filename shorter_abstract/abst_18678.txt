to identify genes that are potentially regulated by nkx <dig>  during the major wave of endocrine and exocrine cell differentiation, we assessed gene expression changes that occur in the absence of nkx <dig>  at the onset of the secondary transition in the developing pancreas.
we also identified signaling factors and transmembrane proteins that function downstream of nkx <dig> , including several that have not previously been described in the pancreas.
several of the newly identified signaling factors and transmembrane proteins may function to influence islet cell fate decisions.
microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in e <dig>  and/or e <dig>  nkx <dig> -/- embryos.
deletion of nkx <dig>  in mice leads to misspecification of islet cell types; insulin-expressing β cells and glucagon-expressing α cells are replaced by ghrelin-expressing cells.
additional studies have suggested that nkx <dig>  functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator to regulate islet cell formation and function.
interestingly, a number of known exocrine genes are also misexpressed in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas.
expression profiling of nkx <dig> -/- mice during embryogenesis has allowed us to identify known and novel pancreatic genes that function downstream of nkx <dig>  to regulate pancreas development.
