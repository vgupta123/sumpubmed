low-complexity regions  in proteins are tracts that are highly enriched in one or a few amino acids.
lcrs enriched in positively charged amino acids show the contrary pattern, indicating an important effect of purifying selection in their maintenance.
we have detected a significant increase in the rate of accumulation of novel lcrs in the ancestral amniota and mammalian branches, and a reduction in the chicken branch.
we have traced back the evolutionary history of  <dig>  lcrs from a large set of homologous protein families from h.sapiens, m.musculus, g.gallus, d.rerio and c.intestinalis.
this dichotomy results in net protein sequence gain over time.
we have found that the gain of novel lcrs is frequently associated with repeat expansion whereas the loss of lcrs is more often due to accumulation of amino acid substitutions as opposed to deletions.
we have performed the first large-scale study on the evolutionary dynamics of lcrs in protein families.
given their high abundance, and their capacity to expand in relatively short periods of time through replication slippage, they can greatly contribute to increase protein sequence space and generate novel protein functions.
however, little is known about the global impact of lcrs on protein evolution.
