in this study we analyzed the vast dataset of human allelic variants  of the most polymorphic mhc class ii locus, hla-drb <dig>  and identified many previously unknown sequence features possibly contributing to the recombination.
we also identified more complex, highly conserved sequence motifs in exon  <dig>  some of these can be identified as putative recombination motifs previously found in other genes, but most are previously unidentified.
furthermore, the cpg pattern was highly conserved.
a large number of mhc class ii allele sequences is publicly available and could be used to analyze the sequence features behind the recombination, revealing possible basis for such recombination processes both in hla class ii genes and other genes, which recombination acts upon.
hla/mhc class ii molecules show high degree of polymorphism in the human population.
