<dig> hours of hypoxia reduced embryonic viability by 49% in embryos exposed from e <dig> - <dig>  but no effect on viability was observed in younger embryos exposed to hypoxia from e <dig> - <dig> .
after  <dig> hours of hypoxia,  <dig> % of the cardiac-a1ar deleted embryos were either dead or re-absorbed compared to  <dig> % of control littermates and after  <dig> hours  <dig> % of cardiac-a1ar deleted embryos were dead or re-absorbed.
to determine if the heart is a key site of adenosine-mediated embryo protection, a1ars were selectively deleted in the embryonic heart using a cre-loxp system in which the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter drives cre-recombinase expression and excision of the a1ar gene from cardiomyocytes.
these data identify the embryonic heart as the critical site where adenosine acts to protect the embryo against hypoxia.
however, the sites of a1ar action that mediate embryo protection are not known.
with increasing exposure of maternal hypoxia  from 48- <dig> hours beginning at embryonic day   <dig> , embryo viability decreased in the cardiac-a1ar deleted embryos.
gene expression analysis revealed clusters of genes that are regulated by both hypoxia and a1ar expression.
as such these studies identify a previously unrecognized mechanism of embryo protection.
