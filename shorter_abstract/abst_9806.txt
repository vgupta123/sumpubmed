the purpose of the project was to study the ability of recombinant vaccinia virus  and bacterial plasmid, both carrying the ns <dig> gene from tick-borne encephalitis  virus under the control of different promoters, to protect mice against lethal challenge using a heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocol.
the heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocol, using a vv recombinant and bacterial plasmid, both containing the ns <dig> tbe virus protein gene under the control of different promoters, achieved a high level of protection in mice against lethal challenge with a highly pathogenic tbe virus strain.
heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocols using recombinant vv and bacterial plasmids could be used for the development of flavivirus vaccines.
heterologous prime-boost immunization protocols using different gene expression systems have proven to be successful tools in protecting against various diseases in experimental animal models.
