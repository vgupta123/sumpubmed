the characterization of the abo blood group status is vital for blood transfusion and solid organ transplantation.
the described workflow delivers high resolution abo genotyping at low cost enabling population-scale molecular abo characterization.
sample specific barcodes and sequencing adaptors are introduced during pcr, rendering the products suitable for direct sequencing on illumina miseq or hiseq instruments.
several methods for the molecular characterization of the abo gene, which encodes the alleles that give rise to the different abo blood groups, have been described.
