we analyzed dna sequences of mt genome trs  in the ridged-eye flounder , and characterized dna sequences of mttrs from other vertebrates using the data available in genbank.
tandem repeats are concentrated in the control regions; however, we found approximately  <dig> % of the trs elsewhere in the mt genome.
this model can explain the characteristics of trs in available vertebrate mt genomes.
based on our analysis of this larger dataset of mttr sequences, we propose a novel model of pause melting misalignment  to describe the birth and motif indel of tandem repeats.
tandem repeats  in the mitochondrial  genome control region have been documented in a wide variety of vertebrate species.
the flounder mttrs possess three motif types with hypervariable characteristics at the 3â€² end of the control region .
pmm is activated during a pause event in mitochondrial replication in which a dynamic competition between the nascent  heavy strand and the displaced  heavy strand may lead to the melting of the n-strand from the template  light strand.
