the kp1_p <dig> gene was more prevalent in pla strains and capsular type k1/k <dig> strains, but disruption of this gene in ntuh-k <dig> strain did not decrease virulence in mice.
the kp1_p <dig> protein could be used as an antigen for early serodiagnosis of k. pneumoniae pla, particularly in k1/k <dig> pla strains.
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  revealed an open reading frame  located on the pk <dig> plasmid and bioinformatic analysis identified this protein as a signal peptide of unknown function.
the secreted proteins of the ntuh-k <dig> strain were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and then immunoblotted using convalescent sera from patients with k. pneumoniae pla.
klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged worldwide as a cause of pyogenic liver abscess  often complicated by meningitis and endophthalmitis.

therefore, we tried to isolate immunodominant proteins secreted by k. pneumoniae strains causing pla.
ten of fourteen  sera from patients with k. pneumoniae pla were immunoreactive with the recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein.
