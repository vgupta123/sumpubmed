herein, we present gaap, a genome assembly pipeline for scaffolding based on core-gene-defined genome organizational framework  described in our previous study.

in our performance tests using both empirical and simulated data of  <dig> genomes in six species with diverse genome size, complexity, and all three categories of cgofs, gaap outcompetes or achieves comparable results when compared to three other reference-assisted programs, aligngraph, ragout and medusa.
gaap uses both cgof and pair-end reads to create assemblies in genomic scale, and performs better than the currently available reference-assisted assembly tools as it recovers more assemblies and makes fewer false locations, especially for species with extensive rearranged genomes.
