quantitative analysis, performed in 19/ <dig> pulmonary lesions, showed a statistically significant difference  between the arrival time of the malignant  and benign  pulmonary lesions.
based on our preliminary results, the use of ultrasonographic contrast medium can be recommended for improving the diagnostic usefulness of cytology and biopsy sampling, because ceus may help to define necrotic areas from viable tissue.
the majority of neoplastic pulmonary lesions showed an inhomogeneous distribution of contrast medium, whereas inflammatory lesions had a homogenous distribution with typical pulmonary vessels ramification.
the contrast medium allows for the precise definition of lesion edges, the presence of necrotic areas, and the distribution of pulmonary vessels.

this study describes the feasibility of contrast enhanced ultrasonography  in the diagnostic work-up of non-cardiac thoracic disorders of small animals.
the lung and mediastinal abscesses had peripheral enhancement of the wall with an avascular center.
all cytological and biopsy samples obtained after ceus were diagnostic.
forty animals,  <dig> dogs and  <dig> cats, were included in the study.
the majority of mediastinal malignant lesions showed an inhomogeneous distribution pattern.
