this avoids both the exclusive dependence on the robust expression of individual, highly cell type-specific marker genes and the bias towards an equal distribution upon inclusion of all genes for computation.
the expression profiles of the whole tissues were compared to computationally reconstituted expression profiles that combine the expression profiles of the isolated cell fractions  according to their relative mrna proportions in the tissue.
the mrna proportions were determined by trimmed robust regression using only the most robustly-expressed genes , i.e.
the relative mrna proportions were determined using several different chip evaluation methods, among which the mas  <dig>  signal algorithm appeared to be most robust.
the computed mrna proportions agreed well with the cell proportions determined by immunohistochemistry except for a minor number of outliers.
robust computational reconstitution uses an intermediate number of robustly-expressed genes to estimate the relative mrna proportions.
determining and analyzing cell type-specific gene expression under diverse conditions is therefore a central aim of biomedical research.
genes that were either regulated  or robustly-expressed in all patients were identified using different test statistics.
the present study compares gene expression profiles in whole tissues and isolated cell fractions purified from these tissues in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
those showing the most similar expression in tissue and isolated cell fractions.
