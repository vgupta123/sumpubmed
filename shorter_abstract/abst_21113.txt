the classifier also performed well, achieving greater than 80% sensitivity for many cancer types on independent validation datasets.
then, using mirna, clinical and treatment data and encoding it in a machine-learning readable format, we built a prognosis predictor model to predict the outcome of treatment with 85% accuracy.
our research is a step towards the final goal of diagnosing cancer and predicting treatment recommendations using non-invasive blood tests.
here we go a step further, using tissue mirna and clinical data across  <dig> cancers from the ‘the cancer genome atlas’  database.
there have been many studies showing the effectiveness of mirna data in diagnosing specific cancer types, but few studies explore the role of mirna in predicting treatment outcome.
we used this model to create a tool that recommends personalized treatment regimens.
the accuracies improved to  <dig> –100% when climbing up the embryonic tree and classifying cancers at different stages.
the current state-of-the-art in cancer diagnosis and treatment is not ideal; diagnostic tests are accurate but invasive, and treatments are “one-size fits-all” instead of being personalized.
we use machine learning techniques to create an accurate pan-cancer diagnosis system, and a prediction model for treatment outcomes.

we define the accuracy as the ratio of the total number of instances correctly classified to the total instances.
we achieved  <dig> % accuracy for classification using a support vector machine classifier with radial basis.
many mirnas selected by our feature selection algorithm had strong previous associations to various cancers and tumor progression.
