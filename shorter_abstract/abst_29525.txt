in addition, we provide sequence comparisons for nlrp1a and report on previously unrecognized splice variants of nlrp1b.
however, little is known about their expression profile and sequence in different mouse strains.
our results show that macrophages from some inbred mouse strains simultaneously express different splice variants of nlrp1b.
in contrast to the highly polymorphic nlrp1b splice variants, sequencing of expressed nlrp1a showed the protein to be highly conserved across all mouse strains.
furthermore, simultaneous expression of these paralogs may lead to competitional binding of nlrp1b interaction partners needed for inflammasome activation, thus influencing macrophages susceptibility to lt. to more completely understand the role of nlrp <dig> paralogs in mice, we surveyed for their expression in a large set of lt-resistant and sensitive mouse macrophages.
although susceptibility of mouse macrophages to lt has been genetically linked to nlrp1b, mice harbor two additional nlrp <dig> paralogs in their genomes .
we found that nlrp1a was expressed only in toxin-resistant macrophages, with the sole exception of expression in lt-sensitive cast/eij macrophages.
to date, the only known activator of rodent nlrp <dig> is anthrax lethal toxin , a protease secreted by the bacterial pathogen bacillus anthracis.
