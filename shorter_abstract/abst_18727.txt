with the exception of tins, the sequences of unspliced est clusters evolve significantly slower than genomic background.
direct evidence for the independent transcription of many pins and tins is obtained from cage tag and chromatin data.
we systematically study the evidence on unspliced transcripts available in est annotation tracks for human and mouse, comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  unspliced est clusters, respectively.
the frequently postulated connection between lack of splicing and nuclear retention and the surprising overlap of chromatin-associated transcripts suggests that this class of transcripts might be involved in chromatin organization and possibly other mechanisms of epigenetic control.
despite their abundance, unspliced est data have received little attention as a source of information on non-coding rnas.
unspliced est data, although typically disregarded in transcriptome analysis, can be used to gain insights into this rarely investigated transcriptome component.
fifteen to twenty percent of the unspliced est cluster are conserved between human and mouse.
