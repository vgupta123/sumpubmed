the immunological importance of cd1d is underscored by its influences on the performances of natural killer t-cells and thereby mediates the innate and adaptive immune systems.
using diffraction-based dotreadyâ„¢ immunoassays, the present study showed that seb directly and specifically conjugated to cd1d.
we found that seb induced the expression of cd1d on the cell surface prompting a rapid conjugation between them.
we demonstrated the role of cd1d in the late stage of pathogen recognition and cleansing, and thereby underscored its clinical potential in treating bioweaponizable antigens, such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b .
this is a noted deviation from the typical antigen recognition process that recruits the major histocompatibility complex class ii  molecules.
given circumstances mandate a paradigm shift from the conventional therapeutic strategy that counts on targeting the host markers responding to the early assault of pathogens.
