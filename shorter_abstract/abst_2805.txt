one of the major problems concerning dengue transmission is that embryos of its main vector, the mosquito aedes aegypti, resist desiccation, surviving several months under dry conditions.
aachs1a expression would be responsible for sc chitin synthesis.
the serosal cuticle  contributes to mosquito egg desiccation resistance, but the kinetics of sc secretion during embryogenesis is unknown.
we observed an abrupt acquisition of desiccation resistance during ae.
they also point to the role of the chitinized sc in the desiccation resistance of ae.
it was verified that at the moment of serosal cuticle formation, aachs1a is the sole variant specifically expressed.
in addition to the peritrophic matrix and exoskeleton, these findings confirm chitin is also present in the mosquito serosal cuticle.
aegypti embryogenesis associated with serosal cuticle secretion, occurring at complete germ band extension, between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after egglaying.
it has been argued that mosquito sc contains chitin as one of its components, however conclusive evidence is still missing.
