the course of hev-infection for contact-infected pigs was characterized by: faecal hev rna excretion that started at day  <dig>  postexposure and lasted  <dig>  days; viremia that started after  <dig>  days of faecal hev rna excretion and lasted  <dig>  days; antibody development that was detected after  <dig>  days of faecal hev rna excretion.
the time until onset of faecal hev rna excretion and onset of viremia was significantly shorter for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs, whereas the duration of faecal hev rna excretion was significantly longer.
the course of infection differed between infection routes, suggesting that contact-infection could be a better model for natural transmission than iv inoculation.
to resemble natural transmission,  <dig> hev-susceptible pigs were infected either by one-to-one exposure to intravenously inoculated pigs , by one-to-one exposure to contact-infected pigs  or due to an unknown non-intravenous infection route .
contact with pigs or consumption of pork products, the transmission routes and dynamics of infection should be identified.
at  <dig> days postinfection hev rna was detected less frequently in organs of contact-infected pigs compared to iv-pigs.
for contact-infected pigs, hev rna was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> muscle samples that were proxies for pork at retail and in  <dig> of  <dig> urine samples.
