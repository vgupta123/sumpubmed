this sequence was identified in qki mrna targets including the mrnas for myelin basic proteins.
the identification of a bipartite mrna binding site for qki and now slm- <dig> prompted us to determine whether sam <dig> and gld- <dig> also bind bipartite direct repeats.
these data demonstrate that the star proteins qki, gld- <dig>  sam <dig> and slm- <dig> recognize rna with direct repeats as bipartite motifs.
the bipartite nature of the consensus sequence was essential for slm- <dig> high affinity rna binding.
previously by using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment , we defined the quaking binding site as a hexanucleotide sequence with an additional half-site .
the function of these rna binding proteins has been difficult to elucidate mainly because of lack of genetic data providing insights about their physiological rna targets.
this information should help identify binding sites within physiological rna targets.
indeed sam <dig> bound the slm- <dig> consensus and required both uaa motifs.
herein we report using selex the identification of the slm- <dig> rna binding site as direct uaa repeats.
the gld- <dig> binding site is defined as a hexanucleotide sequence  that is found in many, but not all, physiological gld- <dig> mrna targets.
sam <dig>  sam68-like mammalian protein  <dig>  and  <dig>  are members of the k homology  and star  protein family.
