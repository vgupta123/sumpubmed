pre-clinical models that effectively recapitulate human disease are critical for expanding our knowledge of cancer biology and drug resistance mechanisms.
using the human affymetrix whole transcript platform we analysed transcriptional profiles from engrafted tissues without prior cell separation of mouse cells and found it to return highly reproducible profiles in xenografts from individual mice.
importantly, this masking approach can be applied and adapted to other xenograft models where human tissue infiltration is lower.
the model was further tested with experimental mixtures of human and mouse cells, demonstrating that the presence of mouse cells does not significantly skew expression profiles when xenografts contain 90% or more human cells.
we demonstrate species-specific transcriptional profiles can be obtained from xenografts when high levels of engraftment are achieved or with the application of transcript cluster masks.
for haematological malignancies, the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient  mouse is one of the most successful models to study paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia .
in addition, we present a novel in silico and experimental masking approach to identify probes and transcript clusters susceptible to cross-species hybridisation.
this model provides a powerful platform for identifying genes and pathways associated with all disease progression and response to therapy in vivo.
