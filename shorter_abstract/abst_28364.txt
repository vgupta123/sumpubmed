we exploit these clusters for predicting gene function by carrying over annotations from well-annotated genes to other, less-characterized genes in the same cluster.
the intrinsic nature of phenotypes to visibly reflect genetic activity underlines their usefulness in inferring new gene functions.
however, there have been relatively few efforts to make use of phenotype data beyond the single genotype-phenotype relationships.
we present results on a study where we use a large set of phenotype data – in textual form – to predict gene annotation.
we show that these clusters correlate well with several indicators for biological coherence in gene groups, such as functional annotations from the gene ontology  and protein-protein interactions.
often, a genetic component to a disease is discovered only after clearly defining its phenotype.
thus, systematically analyzing these data on a large scale offers many possibilities for inferring functional annotation of genes.
to this end, we use text clustering to group genes based on their phenotype descriptions.
in the past years, many technologies to systematically generate phenotypes in a high-throughput manner, such as rna interference or gene knock-out, have been developed and used to decipher functions for genes.
