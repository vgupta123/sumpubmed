the ∆6-desaturase gene, encoding a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids, has potential in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.
the ∆6-desaturase gene has been isolated from a selected strain of oomycetes, pythium sp.
the codon-optimized ∆6-desaturase gene generated in this study is a promising tool for further reconstitution of the fatty acid profile, in a host system of choice, for the production of economically important fatty acids, particularly the n- <dig> and n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids.
heterologous expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that monoene, diene and triene fatty acids having ∆9-double bond were substrates for pydes <dig>  no distinct preference between the n- <dig> and n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acyl substrates was found.
the ∆6-desaturated products were markedly increased by codon optimization of pydes <dig>
the deduced amino acid sequence shared a high similarity to those of other ∆6-desaturases that contained the signature features of a membrane-bound ∆6-desaturase, including a cytochrome b <dig> and three histidine-rich motifs and membrane-spanning regions.
