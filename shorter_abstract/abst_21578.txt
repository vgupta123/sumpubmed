the analyses were conducted successively on the whole panel and on its indica  and japonica  subcomponents.
despite recent sequencing efforts, local genetic resources remain underexploited, even though they carry alleles that can bring agronomic benefits.
the panel of  <dig> rice varieties was phenotyped under greenhouse conditions for several root traits in an experimental design with  <dig> replicates.
root length, root mass in different layers, root thickness, and the number of crown roots, as well as several derived root parameters and shoot traits, were recorded.
the two associations with the highest significance were for root thickness on chromosome  <dig> and for crown root number on chromosome  <dig>  no common associations were detected between the indica and japonica subpanels, probably because of the polymorphism repartition between the subspecies.
the results were submitted to association mapping using a mixed model involving structure and kinship to enable the identification of significant associations.
taking advantage of the recent genotyping with  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphism markers of a core collection of  <dig> vietnamese rice varieties originating from provinces from north to south vietnam and from different agrosystems characterized by contrasted water regimes, we have performed a genome-wide association study for different root parameters.
