however, most experiments have been conducted in established cell lines subjected to specific p53-inducing stimuli, both factors potentially biasing the results.
using encode data, we also mapped p <dig> res in about  <dig>  distant enhancers and identified a 16-fold enrichment for high activity res within those sites in the comparison with genomic regions near transcriptional start sites .
besides canonical, full site res, we developed specific pattern searches for non-canonical half sites and 3/ <dig> sites and show that they can mediate p53-dependent responsiveness of associated coding sequences.
we developed p53retriever, a pattern search algorithm that maps p <dig> response elements  and ranks them according to predicted transactivation potentials in five classes.
the entire list of identified and functionally classified p <dig> res near all ucsc-annotated genes and within encode mapped enhancer elements is provided.
we provide a comprehensive annotation of canonical and non-canonical p <dig> res in the human genome, ranked on predicted transactivation potential.
predictions from our pattern search were cross-referenced to chip-seq, chip-exo, expression, and various literature data sources.

based on the mapping of predicted functional res near tss, we examined expression changes of thirteen genes as a function of different p53-inducing conditions, providing further evidence for pde2a, gas <dig>  e2f <dig>  apobec3h, kctd <dig>  trim <dig>  dicer, hras, kitlg and tgfa p53-dependent regulation, while map2k <dig>  dnaja <dig> and potentially yap <dig> were identified as new direct p <dig> target genes.
p53retriever is available as an r package at: http://tomateba.github.io/p53retriever.
