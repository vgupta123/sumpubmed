after paracetamol coadministration with low sunitinib doses , alt and ast concentrations ranged  <dig> - <dig>  u/l and  <dig> - <dig>  u/l respectively, lower than group-b.
bun levels were higher  for group-b  and group-d  compared to group-a  and group-c .
this study evaluates the effects of sunitinib-paracetamol coadministration on liver and renal function biomarkers and liver, kidney, brain, heart and spleen histopathology.
liver and renal function monitoring is recommended.
in group-d, at low doses of sunitinib, lesser damage than in group-b occurred but larger changes including congestion were observed at high sunitinib doses.
hepatic histopathology showed vascular congestion in group-b; mild congestion in group-c .
mild cardiotoxicity occurred in groups b, c and d. brain vascular congestion occurred at high doses of sunitinib administered alone or with paracetamol.
sunitinib at high doses show renal, cardiac and brain toxicity.
sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat gist and mrcc may interact with paracetamol as both undergo p <dig> mediated biotransformation and p-glycoprotein transport.
hepatic and renal biomarkers correlated with histopathology signs.
paracetamol coadministration with high sunitinib doses showed higher alt and ast values , p <  <dig> .
