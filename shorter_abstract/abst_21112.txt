the type and amount of cytokine secretion depends on the type of co-cultivated oligosaccharide.
substrate engineering of these glycosyltransferases generally acting on sucrose leads to the controlled formation of novel tailored di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides.
a differential secretion of cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> was observed upon oligosaccharide co-cultivation with colorectal epithelial caco- <dig> cells.
