importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the dek oncogene also induces a t cell response.
the identification of dek as a tumor-associated antigen capable of eliciting a t cell response validates our experimental approach and argues for the antigens we have identified here to be evaluated as targets of effector immunity and as vaccine candidates.
the most commonly identified tumor-associated antigen, using serum from immunized and treg-depleted mice, was the dek oncogene.
altered expression of the dek oncogene has been implicated in a number of human cancers.
serum from mice vaccinated in the context of treg blockade identified a number of potentially oncogenic transcripts that may serve as important immune targets in a tumor-derived cdna library screen.
serum from mice immunized with our cell-based vaccine in the context of treg blockade was used to screen a cdna expression library constructed from the parental neuroblastoma tumor cell line, agn2a.
the use of post-vaccine immune serum in this report differs from previous approaches where serum collected at the time of cancer onset or diagnosis and was used for tumor antigen identification.
