we present a cost-effective method for identifying medium-sized deletions in genomic regions with low genomic coverage.
sanger sequencing results confirmed an overall detection accuracy of 95%.
two mate-paired libraries were separately constructed from human cancerous tissue to generate paired short reads  from restriction fragments digested with a 4-base restriction enzyme.
