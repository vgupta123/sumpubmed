the current ab initio approaches, however, have selectivity issues, i.e., a high number of false positives is reported, which can lead to laborious and costly attempts to provide biological validation.
as a consequence, in silico methods have been developed to predict mirna loci.
therefore, mirnas are involved in several biological processes, making the study of these molecules one of the most relevant topics of molecular biology nowadays.
for the three datasets used in our experiments, our method achieved at least 97% of sensitivity and could deliver a two-fold, 20-fold, and 6-fold increase in selectivity, respectively, compared with the best results of current computational tools.
hopefully, new research, such as studies of severe diseases caused by mirna malfunction, will benefit from the proposed computational tool.
this study presents an extension of the ab initio method mirnafold, with the aim of improving selectivity through machine learning techniques, namely, random forest combined with the smote procedure that copes with imbalance datasets.
the extension of mirnafold by the introduction of machine learning techniques, significantly increases selectivity in pre-mirna ab initio prediction, which optimally contributes to advanced studies on mirnas, as the need of biological validations is diminished.

however, characterizing mirnas in vivo is still a complex task.
by comparing our method, termed mirnacle, with other important approaches in the literature, we demonstrate that mirnacle substantially improves selectivity without compromising sensitivity.
