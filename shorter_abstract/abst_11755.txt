we describe here a combined analysis of both types of nucleic acids from the same sample material.
cdna is prepared by the application of oligo-dt coupled magnetic beads for mrna capture, first strand synthesis and 3â€™-tailing followed by pcr.
the results we present demonstrate that a combined analysis of genomic dna and messenger rna from ultra-low input samples is feasible and can readily be applied to other cellular systems with limited material available.
the method described enables the combined preparation of amplified cdna as well as amplified whole-genome dna from an ultra-low input sample material derived from a sub-colony of in-vitro cultivated human embryonic stem cells.
the protocol was evaluated by sequencing sub-colony structures from human embryonic stem cells containing  <dig> to  <dig> cells.
to our knowledge, this is the first report where sub-colonies of human embryonic stem cells have been analyzed both at the genomic as well as transcriptome level.
with recent development it is nowadays possible to analyze ultra-low input sample material down to single cells.
nevertheless, investigating such sample material often limits the analysis to either the genome or transcriptome.
