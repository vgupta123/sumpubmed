neuroimaging and neuropsychological literature show functional dissociations in brain activity during processing of stimuli belonging to different semantic categories , but little information is available about the time course of object perceptual categorization.
the aim of the study was to provide information about the timing of processing stimuli from different semantic domains, without using verbal or naming paradigms, in order to observe the emergence of non-linguistic conceptual knowledge in the ventral stream visual pathway.
the larger frontal/central n <dig> and the subsequent temporal activation for inanimate objects might reflect the prevalence of a functional rather than perceptual representation of manipulable tools compared to animals.
at early processing stages  the right occipital-temporal cortex was more activated in response to animals than to artifacts as indexed by posterior n <dig> response, while frontal/central n <dig>  showed the opposite pattern.
behavioral responses to animal stimuli were ~ <dig> ms faster and more accurate than those to artifacts.
overall, the data are compatible with a modality-specific semantic memory account, in which sensory and action-related semantic features are represented in modality-specific brain areas.
event related potentials  were recorded in  <dig> healthy right-handed individuals as they performed a perceptual categorization task on  <dig> pairs of images of animals and man-made objects .
