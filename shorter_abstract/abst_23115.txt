moreover, no significant correlation was found between these two features.
this was achieved using seven molecular markers, reliable records on  <dig> host species and a proxy of the ovipositor length.
great variations of both the ovipositor length and the host range  were observed at this scale, with these two features being not significantly constrained by the phylogeny.
ovipositor length was not shown as a significant predictor of the parasitoid host range.
alternative drivers of the ecological differentiation such as interspecific interactions are proposed and the consequences on the recruitment of these parasitoids on native and exotic pests are discussed.
the ecological differentiation of insects with parasitic life-style is a complex process that may involve phylogenetic constraints as well as morphological and/or behavioural adaptations.
in both cases, strong contrasts were observed between sister species.
this study provides firstly the first evidence for the strong lability of both the ovipositor’s length and the realised host range in a set of phylogenetically related and sympatric species.
