overall, our results reveal that more recent selection increased autozygosity across the entire genome, but some specific regions increased more than others.
as a result, allele frequencies are shifted for many contemporary animals, and in numerous cases to a homozygous state for specific genomic regions.
genome signatures of artificial selection in u.s. jersey cattle were identified by examining changes in haplotype homozygosity for a resource population of animals born between  <dig> and  <dig>  genetic merit of this population changed dramatically during this period for a number of traits, especially milk yield.
haplotypes found to be associated with increased milk, fat and protein yield in u.s. jersey cattle also consistently increased in frequency.
when combined with animal birth year information, signatures of selection associated with economically important traits were identified and compared to results from an extended haplotype homozygosity analysis.
the analyses used in this study was able to detect directional selection over the last few decades when individual production records for jersey animals were available.
the intense selection underlying these changes was achieved through extensive use of artificial insemination , which also increased consanguinity of the population to a few superior jersey bulls.
a genome-wide scan identified more than  <dig> regions with a substantial change in autozygosity.
