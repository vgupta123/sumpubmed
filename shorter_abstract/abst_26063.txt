metacram is a lossless method compatible with standard cram formats, and it allows for fast selection of relevant files in the compressed domain via maintenance of taxonomy information.
metacram integrates algorithms for taxonomy identification and assembly, and introduces parallel execution methods; furthermore, it enables genome reference selection and cram based compression.
in order to overcome these data processing issues, we introduce metacram, the first de novo, parallelized software suite specialized for fasta and fastq format metagenomic read processing and lossless compression.
we described the first architecture for reference-based, lossless compression of metagenomic data.
the performance of metacram as a stand-alone compression platform was evaluated on various metagenomic samples from the ncbi sequence read archive, suggesting 2- to 4-fold compression ratio improvements compared to gzip.
this leads to challenges in analyzing, transferring and storing metagenomic data.
metacram also uses novel reference-based compression methods designed through extensive studies of integer compression techniques and through fitting of empirical distributions of metagenomic read-reference positions.
sequenced metagenomic samples usually comprise reads from a large number of different bacterial communities and hence tend to result in large file sizes, typically ranging between 1â€“ <dig> gb.
the compression scheme proposed offers significantly improved compression ratios as compared to off-the-shelf methods such as zip programs.
furthermore, it enables running different components in parallel and it provides the user with taxonomic and assembly information generated during execution of the compression pipeline.
