we investigated the transcriptome profiles of two geographically distinct b. bovis virulent and attenuated strain pairs to better understand virulence loss and to gain insight into pathogen adaptation strategies.
expression microarray and rna-sequencing approaches were employed to compare transcriptome profiles of two b. bovis strain pairs, with each pair consisting of a virulent parental and its attenuated derivative strain.
b. bovis, which infects cattle, has naturally occurring virulent strains that can be reliably attenuated in vivo.
when compared with their attenuated derivatives, divergently oriented ves genes were included among the upregulated ves genes in the virulent strains, while none of the upregulated ves genes in the attenuated derivatives were oriented head to head.
we conclude that ves heterodimer pair upregulation and overall higher frequency of ves gene expressions in the virulent strains is consistent with the involvement of this gene family in virulence.
these included genes encoding for vesa <dig>  smorfs, undefined membrane and hypothetical proteins.
differentially regulated transcripts were identified within each strain pair.
previous studies suggest the virulence loss mechanism may involve post-genomic modification.
there was a disproportionately greater number of ves genes upregulated in the virulent parental strains.
however, upregulation of some ves genes in the attenuated derivatives suggests that the consequence of upregulation is gene-specific.
one gene family whose specific members were consistently and significantly upregulated in expression in both attenuated strains was spherical body protein   <dig> encoding gene where sbp <dig> truncated copies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were all upregulated.
furthermore, upregulation of the spherical body protein  <dig> gene family may play a role in the attenuated phenotype.
