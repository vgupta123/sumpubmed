our analysis of all publicly available dna barcode sequences shows a high accuracy as well as rapid results.
it provides a robust and efficient solution for sequence search on the web.
we developed an alignment independent character based algorithm based on dividing a sequence library  and query sequence to words.
we have developed a novel algorithm and implemented it for searching species-specific genomic sequences, dna barcodes, by using popular web-based methods such as google.
the integration of our search method for large-scale sequence libraries such as dna barcodes provides an excellent web-based tool for accessing this information and linking it to other available categories of information on the web.
