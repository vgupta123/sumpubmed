accounting for significant proportion of many plant genomes, ltr elements have been well established as one of the major forces underlying the evolution of plant genome size, structure and function.
the accessibility of more than 40% of genomic sequences of the model legume medicago truncatula  has made the comprehensive study of its ltr elements possible.
we also estimate that more than ten million bp of the mt genomic sequences have been removed by the deletion of ltr elements and the removal of the full-length structures in mt has been more rapid than in rice.
we use a newly developed tool ltr_finder to identify ltr retrotransposons in the mt genome and detect  <dig> full-length elements as well as a great number of copies related to them.
the majority of the ltr retrotransposons belong to either copia or gypsy superfamily and the others are categorized as trims or lards by their length.
this report is the first comprehensive description and analysis of ltr retrotransposons in the mt genome.
our results may outline the ltr retrotransposon landscape of the model legume.
these elements constitute about  <dig> % of currently available genomic sequences.
for several important families, we describe in detail their abundance, conservation, insertion time and structure.
long terminal repeat retrotransposons  are ubiquitous eukaryotic tes that transpose through rna intermediates.
we investigate the amplification-deletion pattern of the elements and find that the detectable full-length elements are relatively young and most of them were inserted within the last  <dig>  my.
we find that the copy-number of copia-like families is  <dig> times more than that of gypsy-like ones but the latter contribute more to the genome.
