we have previously shown that expression deregulation of human asap results in profound defects in mitotic spindle formation and mitotic progression leading to aneuploidy, cytokinesis defects and/or cell death.
asap associates to the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules, and represents a key factor of mitosis with possible involvement in other cell cycle processes.
bona fide asap orthologs are found in vertebrates with more distantly related potential orthologs in invertebrates.
we have cloned the asap orthologs in mouse and xenopus, two valuable models to study the function of asap.
as with human asap, the mouse and xenopus proteins localize to the microtubule network in interphase and to the mitotic spindle during mitosis.
the conservation of asap indicated in our results reflects an essential function in vertebrates.
possible involvement in neuron dynamics also highlights asap as a candidate target in neurodegenerative diseases.
mouse and xenopus cdnas were cloned, the tissue expression characterized and the overexpression profile analyzed.
tissue expression of asap revealed a high expression in brain and testis, two tissues rich in microtubules.
it may have a role in spermatogenesis and also represents a potential new target for antitumoral drugs.
in situ hybridization in testis localized asap to the germ cells, whereas in culture neurons asap localized to the cell body and growing neurites.
in the present work we analyze the structure and evolution of the asap gene, as well as the domain composition of the encoded protein.
different sequence features may suggest a role in dna damage response.
the protein contains map, mit-like and thy domains in the c-terminal part indicative of microtubule interaction, while the n-terminal part is more divergent.
