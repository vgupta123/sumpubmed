automated comparison of complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes can provide insight on the genetic basis of differences in biological traits between species.
there is a surprising lack of statistical approaches for comparing complete genomes at all levels of go.
we applied this method to find statistically significant differences between two cyanobacteria, synechocystis sp.
we also studied how the results vary when only subsets of the genes were used in the comparison of human vs. mouse and that of saccharomyces cerevisiae vs. schizosaccharomyces pombe.
we propose a statistical approach to find reliable differences between the complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes at all levels of go.
pcc <dig>  we then studied how the set of identified differences vary when different blast cutoffs are used.
current approaches calculate the fold of unweighted or weighted differences between two species at the high-level go functional categories.
however, to ensure the reliability of the differences detected, it is important to evaluate their statistical significance.
