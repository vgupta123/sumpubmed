we have developed absidconvert, a methodology for converting between genomic identifiers by first mapping them onto a common universal coordinate system using an interval tree which is subsequently queried for overlapping identifiers.

all annotations, no matter the granularity, can be aligned to genomic sequences and therefore annotated by genomic intervals.
absidconvert has many potential uses, including gene identifier conversion, identification of features within a genomic region, and cross-species comparisons.
the utility is demonstrated in three case studies: 1) comparative genomic study mapping plasmodium gene sequences to corresponding human and mosquito transcriptional regions; 2) cross-species study of incyte clone sequences; and 3) analysis of human ensembl transcripts mapped by affymetrixÂ®; and agilent microarray probes.
absidconvert currently supports id conversion of  <dig> species for a given list of input identifiers, genomic sequence, or genome intervals.
existing bioinformatic methodologies categorize and compare these elements using inferred descriptive annotation given this sequence information irrespective of the fact that it may not be representative of the identifier as a whole.
