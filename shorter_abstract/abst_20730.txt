the na+- and atp-dependent alkalization of the proteoliposome lumen was stimulated by carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenylhydrazone  but was inhibited by a permeant anion nitrate.
a secondary event, na+- and atp-dependent h+ efflux from proteoliposomes, is driven by the electric potential generated by na+-stimulated atpase.
the apparent km values for na+ and atp were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively.
the apparent km values for this uptake were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm for na+ and atp, respectively.
the data demonstrate that na+-stimulated atpase from a. halophytica, a likely member of f-type atpase, functions as an electrogenic na+ pump which transports only na+ upon hydrolysis of atp.
until now, the atpase involved in na+ transport in cyanobacteria has not been characterized.
here, the characterization of atpase and its role in na+ transport of alkaliphilic halotolerant aphanothece halophytica were investigated to understand the survival mechanism of a. halophytica under high salinity conditions.
the mechanism of na+ transport mediated by na+-stimulated atpase in a. halophytica was revealed.
the enzyme is likely the f1f0-atpase based on the usual subunit pattern and the protection against n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibition of atpase activity by na+ in a ph-dependent manner.
the proteoliposomes showed both atpase activity and atp-dependent na+ uptake activity.
