results indicate that both the algorithm performance and the predicted tf-binding energy-level of a motif are significantly influenced by pbm data quality, where poor pbm data quality is linked to specific protein domains .
additionally, a biophysical model of tf-dna interactions including adjacent dinucleotide interdependence was implemented in a new program - bayespi <dig>  where sparse bayesian learning and relevance vector machine are used to predict unknown model parameters.
subsequently, computational methods to model tf sequence specificity were evaluated between the two groups.
here, new quality-control parameters such as principal component analysis  ellipse is proposed to assess the data quality for either single or paired pbms.
especially, the new dinucleotide energy-dependent model  offers great improvement in testing prediction accuracy over the simple energy-independent model, for at least 21% of analyzed the tfs.
then,  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge were classified into two groups  based on the paired pbm quality-control parameters.
