condor-copasi provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel.
condor-copasi can effectively use a condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks.
as models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power.
we present condor-copasi, a server-based software tool that integrates copasi, a biological pathway simulation tool, with condor, a high-throughput computing environment.
http://code.google.com/p/condor-copasi/, along with full instructions on deployment and usage.
result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays.
