specifically, hypertrophic expansion of adipose tissues is related to increased cardiometabolic risk leading to type  <dig> diabetes.
studying mechanisms underlying adipocyte hypertrophy could lead to the identification of potential targets for the treatment of these conditions.
we generated a highly curated metabolic network of the human adipose tissue and used it to identify potential targets for adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of type  <dig> diabetes.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
we also used expression data from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues to compare the effect of single gene deletions between adipocytes from each compartment.
we validated the network obtaining  <dig> % accuracy by comparing experimental gene essentiality in various cell lines to our predictions of biomass production.
using flux balance analysis under various test conditions, we predict the effect of gene deletion on both lipid droplet and biomass production, resulting in the identification of  <dig> genes that could reduce adipocyte hypertrophy.
