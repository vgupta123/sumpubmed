the present study elucidated the changes in 293t cells upon cva <dig> infection at transcriptome level, containing highly up-regulated scarb <dig> and genes in ecm-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways, and key mirnas in gene expression regulation.
these results provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of hfmd induced by cva <dig> infection.
at the same time, we found that differentially expressed mirna target genes were mainly reflected in the extracellular membrane -receptor interaction and circadian rhythm pathways, which may be related to clinical symptoms of patients infected with cva <dig>  such as aphthous ulcers, cough, myocarditis, somnolence and potentially meningoencephalitis.
in this study, we compared the mrna and mirna expression profiles of human embryonic kidney 293t cells infected and non-infected with cva <dig>  we highlighted that the transcription of scarb <dig>  a cellular receptor for both cva <dig> and ev <dig>  was up-regulated by nearly 10-fold in infected cells compared to non-infected cells.
this explanation would partly account for the co-circulation and genetic recombination of a great number of ev <dig> and cva <dig> viruses.
based on correlation analysis of mirnas and genes, we speculated that the high expression of scarb <dig> is modulated by down-regulation of mirna has-mir-3605-5p.
the mirnas hsa-mir-149-3p and hsa-mir-5001-5p may result in up-regulation of genes in these morbigenous pathways related to cva <dig> and further cause clinical symptoms.
although many studies have focused on infection and pathogenic mechanisms, the transcriptome profile of the host cell upon cva <dig> infection is still largely unknown.
