however, there is no clear understanding of the performance of these software packages; it is therefore difficult to select one or several software packages for cnv detection based on the snp array platform.
copy number variations  are usually inferred from single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays by use of some software packages based on given algorithms.
we selected four publicly available software packages designed for cnv calling from an affymetrix snp array, including birdsuite, dchip, genotyping console  and penncnv.
compared with the cgh-based dataset, the success rate, average stability rate, sensitivity, consistence and reproducibility of these four software packages were assessed compared with the “gold standard”.
specially, we also compared the efficiency of detecting cnvs simultaneously by two, three and all of the software packages with that by a single software package.
thereafter we investigated the detection consistency produced by one certain software package and the rest three software suits.
the publicly available dataset generated by array-based comparative genomic hybridization , with a resolution of  <dig> million probes per sample, was considered to be the “gold standard”.
