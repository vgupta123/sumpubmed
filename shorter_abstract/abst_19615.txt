transcripts related to the pp2c family  were found to be up-regulated in the pd vs ed comparison and down-regulated in the sb vs ed and sb vs pd comparisons.
comparisons of transcript expression levels among three stages of dormancy, paradormancy  vs endodormancy , summer buds  vs ed and sb vs pd, resulted in the detection of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, respectively.
rt-qpcr assay results for  <dig> selected transcripts validated the data obtained by rna-seq.
at this stage, taking into account the results obtained so far, it is possible to put forward a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism underlying grape bud dormancy, which may pave the way for ultimate improvements in the grape industry.
kegg analysis revealed that secondary metabolites biosynthesis and plant hormone signaling was found most enriched out of the  <dig> total pathways.
this work was aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism regulating bud dormancy in grape.
bud dormancy is an important biological phenomenon of perennial plants that enables them to survive under harsh environmental circumstances.
in the comparisons of the pd vs ed and sb vs ed stages of grape buds, the gibberellin  and abscisic acid  pathways were found to be the most enriched.
the aba and ga pathways were further analyzed to observe the expression pattern of differentially expressed transcripts.
grape  is one of the most grown fruit crop worldwide; however, underlying mechanisms involved in grape bud dormancy are not yet clear.
gid <dig> family transcripts  were up-regulated while della family transcripts were down-regulated during the three dormancy stages.
we have performed transcriptome and differential transcript expression analyses of “shine muscat” grape buds using the illumina rna-seq system.
