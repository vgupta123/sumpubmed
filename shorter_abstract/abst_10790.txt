the distribution of gnrh-containing neurons throughout the preoptic area around the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis was studied following visualisation using immunohistochemistry.
during the preovulatory surge of gonadotropin-releasing hormone , a very large amount of the peptide is released in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal blood for 24-36h <dig>  to study whether this release is linked to a modification of the morphological organization of the gnrh-containing neurons, i.e.
these results indicate that the morphological organization of the gnrh-containing neurons in ewes is modified during the follicular phase.
clusters of gnrh-containing neurons  were more numerous during the late follicular phase  than during the luteal phase , and the percentage of clusters was higher during the beginning of the follicular phase than during the luteal phase.
the cycle stage was verified by determination of progesterone and lh concentrations in the peripheral blood samples collected prior to euthanasia.
the molecular signal inducing this plasticity has not yet been identified, but oestradiol might play an important role, since in sheep it is the only signal which initiates the gnrh preovulatory surge.
morphological plasticity, we conducted experiments in intact ewes at  <dig> different times of the oestrous cycle .
