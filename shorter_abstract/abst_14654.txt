local structures of target mrnas play a significant role in determining the efficacies of antisense oligonucleotides , but some structure-based target site selection methods are limited by uncertainties in rna secondary structure prediction.
the local structures of the target site 5' and 3' termini were also shown to be important in target selection.
features of structural consistency seemed to be more highly correlated with efficacy than indices of the proportion of bases in single-stranded or double-stranded regions.
neural network efficacy predictors using these features, defined on integrated structures as inputs, performed well in "minus-one-gene" cross-validation experiments.
statistical analysis on a dataset with  <dig> odns against  <dig> different mrnas revealed  <dig> features quantitatively associated with efficacy.
topologically different target mrna structures can be merged into integrated representations and then used in computer-aided odn design.
the results of this paper imply that some features characterizing multiple predicted target site structures can be used to predict odn efficacy.
if all the predicted structures of a given mrna within a certain energy limit could be used simultaneously, target site selection would obviously be improved in both reliability and efficiency.
in this study, some key problems in odn target selection on the basis of multiple predicted target mrna structures are systematically discussed.
several parameters were derived to characterize local target site structures.
