in nb <dig> cells undergoing retinoic acid mediated differentiation, the level of endogenous hard <dig> and nath protein decreases while the level of hard <dig> protein is stable.
hard <dig> mrna and protein are expressed in several human cell lines.
we here describe a human protein, hard <dig>  with  <dig> % sequence identity to hard <dig>  the gene encoding hard <dig> most likely originates from a eutherian mammal specific retrotransposition event.
several human protein acetyltransferases have been characterized, most of them catalyzing ε-acetylation of histones and transcription factors.
we recently described the human protein acetyltransferase hard <dig> .
a human protein n-α-acetyltransferase is herein described.
immunoprecipitation experiments show that hard <dig> protein potentially interacts with nath, suggesting that hard2-nath complexes may be responsible for protein n-α-acetylation in human cells.
ard <dig> potentially complements the functions of ard <dig>  adding more flexibility and complexity to protein n-α-acetylation in human cells as compared to lower organisms which only have one ard.
protein acetylation is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism regulating a variety of cellular functions.
