using such methods we are able to characterize different organisms where genome sequence is available with respect to their mucin repertoire.
we have developed computational methods to identify mucin genes and proteins based on these properties of the proteins.
however, the chicken has an additional gene inserted between muc <dig> and muc5ac that encodes the the Î±-subunit of ovomucin, a protein similar to muc <dig>  but it is lacking a pts domain.
mucins are large glycoproteins that cover epithelial surfaces of the body.
unlike previously known mucins, the pts domain of muc <dig> is encoded by multiple exons, where each exon encodes a repeat unit of the pts domain.
three transmembrane mucins  and four gel-forming mucins  were identified.
mucins are also characterized by von willebrand d  domains or sea domains.
all mucins contain at least one pts domain, a region rich in proline, threonine and serine.
finally, our finding that the chicken muc <dig> is distributed between multiple exons raises the interesting possibility that the length of the pts domain could be controlled by alternative splicing.
the gel-forming mucins are encoded within a locus similar to the corresponding human mucins.
