comparative genomic analysis with three of the previously sequenced serratia species, s. marcescens db <dig> and s. proteamaculans  <dig>  and serratia sp.
scbi genome underscores the fact that in epn formation the composite end result â€“ killing, bioconversion, cadaver protection and recolonization- can be achieved by dissimilar mechanisms.
we report the complete genome sequence of a new member of the enterobacterial genus serratia that forms a putative entomopathogenic complex with caenorhabditis briggsae.
the majority of unique sequences in serratia sp.
by revealing the early stages of adaptation to this lifestyle, the serratia sp.
these two highly coevolved associations were results of convergent evolution.
scbi  are found in ~ <dig> genomic islands of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and are enriched in putative functions that are biologically relevant to an entomopathogenic lifestyle, including non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, bacteriocins, fimbrial biogenesis, ushering proteins, toxins, secondary metabolite secretion and multiple drug resistance/efflux systems.
entomopathogenic associations between nematodes in the genera steinernema and heterorhabdus with their cognate bacteria from the bacterial genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, respectively, are extensively studied for their potential as biological control agents against invasive insect species.
