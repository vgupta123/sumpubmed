the subtelocentric pair  <dig> had a terminal secondary constriction in the short arm, corresponding to the nucleolar organizer region , similar to the erethizontid sphiggurus villosus, 2n =  <dig> and fn =  <dig>  and different from the echimyids, in which the secondary constriction is interstitial.
the genus chaetomys was originally regarded as a porcupine in the family erethizontidae, but some authors classified it as a spiny-rat in the family echimyidae.
the high levels of molecular and morphological divergence suggest that chaetomys belongs to an early radiation of the erethizontidae that may have occurred in the early miocene, and should be assigned to its own subfamily, the chaetomyinae.
cytogenetically, chaetomys subspinosus showed 2n =  <dig> and fn =  <dig>  although the sexual pair could not be identified, we assumed that the x chromosome is biarmed.
all topologies recovered in our molecular phylogenetic analyses strongly supported chaetomys subspinosus as a sister clade of the erethizontids.
in the present study, we used nucleotide-sequence data from the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and karyotypic information to address this issue.
in addition to being threatened, it is poorly known, and even its taxonomic status at the family level has long been controversial.
the thin-spined porcupine, also known as the bristle-spined rat, chaetomys subspinosus , the only member of its genus, figures among brazilian endangered species.
our molecular analyses included one individual of chaetomys subspinosus from the state of bahia in northeastern brazil, and other hystricognaths.
