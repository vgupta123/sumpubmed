in linkage analyses of the traits virus extinction, infection rate, and the symptom red edges, a highly associated major qtl was identified on chromosome  <dig>  this qtl explained 45% of the phenotypic variance for the traits virus extinction and infection rate and 30% for the symptom red edges.
therefore, the objectives of this study were  the identification of quantitative trait loci  for bydv resistance in five connected segregating maize populations in a field experiment and  their comparison with the qtl detected under greenhouse conditions.
furthermore, this qtl could also be confirmed in the greenhouse experiment.
with increasing winter temperatures, barley yellow dwarf virus  is expected to become an increasing problem in maize cultivation in germany.
the qtl on chromosome  <dig> could be observed in the connected linkage analyses and in the single population analyses.
our results let suggest that this qtl is involved in multiple virus resistance and the markers are promising for marker assisted selection.
we could show that bydv resistance traits are oligogenically inherited.
molecular markers would accelerate the development of bydv resistant maize.
