data from the various programs are integrated and information regarding the probable domains predicted from the sequence is reported.
in this context, the problem of identifying new domains in the unassigned regions of a protein sequence assumes a crucial importance.
we had earlier demonstrated that accumulation of domain information of sequence homologues can substantially aid prediction of new domains.
query sequence is processed using different automated filtering steps based on length, presence of coiled-coil regions, transmembrane regions, homologous sequences and percentage of secondary structure content.
we have implemented pure protocol as a web server for rapid and comprehensive analysis of unassigned regions in the proteins.
protein domains are the structural and functional units of proteins.
in this paper, we propose a computationally intensive, multi-step bioinformatics protocol as a web server named as pure  for the detailed examination of stretches of unassigned regions in proteins.
later, the filtered sequence segments and their sequence homologues are fed to psi-blast, cd-hit and hmmpfam.
