the results indicate that restriction fragment length heterogeneity in bac libraries used to construct physical maps lower the length and the depth of the contigs, but is not an absolute barrier to the successful application of the technology.
the hessian fly bac-clone assembly, and the names and positions of the bac clones used in the fish experiments are publically available at .
it has tractable genetics, polytene chromosomes, and a small genome .
an fpc-based genome wide physical map of the hessian fly was constructed and anchored to the insect's polytene chromosomes.
fluorescence in situ hybridization  co-localized two bac clones from each of the  <dig> longest contigs on the polytene chromosomes.
investigation of the hessian fly presents excellent opportunities to study plant-insect interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying genome imprinting and chromosome elimination.
only  <dig> % of the bac-end sequence was composed of transposable elements, helicases, ribosomal repeats, simple sequence repeats, and sequences of low complexity.
the hessian fly  is an important insect pest of wheat.
bacterial artificial chromosome  clones corresponding to 12-fold coverage of the hessian fly genome were fingerprinted, using high information content fingerprinting  methodology, and end-sequenced.
a physical map is needed to improve the ability to perform both positional cloning and comparative genomic analyses with the fully sequenced genomes of other dipteran species.
this physical map provides the foundation for high-resolution genetic mapping, map-based cloning, and assembly of complete genome sequencing data.
nearly 1% of the end sequence was composed of simple sequence repeats .
