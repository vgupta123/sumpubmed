another complicating factor is the lack of known protein homologs, which frustrates searches against established protein databases.
either of two svm models may be employed: if a putative protein is found, a protein-dependent svm model is used; if it is not found, a protein-independent svm model is used instead.
only ab initio features are extracted, so that no homology information is needed.
there is ncrna screening software available that is specific for transcriptome sequences, but their analyses are optimized for those transcriptomes that are well represented in protein databases, and also assume that input ests are full-length and high quality.
sequences are translated by software that is resistant to sequencing errors, and the predicted putative proteins, along with their source transcripts, are evaluated for coding potential by a support vector machine .
