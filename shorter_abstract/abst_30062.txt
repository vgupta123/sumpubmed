long-range amplification of full-length hla genes from four loci was performed in separate polymerase chain reactions  using primers and pcr conditions that were optimized to reduce co-amplification of other hla loci.
all four loci of an individual were then tagged with one unique index combination.
high-resolution hla typing that is not restricted to the peptide-binding region can decrease hla allele ambiguities.
the mit-ngs method generated sequence reads from the four loci were then discriminated using commercially available ngs hla typing software.
comparison of the mit-ngs with sanger sequence-based hla typing methods showed that all the ambiguities and discordances between the two methods were due to the accuracy of the mit-ngs method.
the mit-ngs method enabled accurate, robust and cost effective simultaneous analyses of four hla loci per sample and produced  <dig> or 8-digit high-resolution unambiguous phased hla typing data from  <dig> individuals in a single ngs run.
amplicons from the four hla loci of each individual were then pooled and subjected to enzymatic library generation.
