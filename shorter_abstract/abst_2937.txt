it contains  <dig>  open reading frames  predicted by glimmer  <dig> , of which  <dig>  were annotated by pgaap,  <dig>   were annotated by ncbi nr blast,  <dig>  by cog database and  <dig>  by kegg database.
genomic island- and pathogenicity island-like regions were also predicted, in which some showed association with trna and potential virulence factors.
erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is the causative agent of animal erysipelas and, to a fewer occurrences, human erysipeloid.
complete genome sequencing of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, the causative agent of animal erysipelas, was performed.

making use of the complete genome sequencing of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> and comparative genome analysis between the three highly pathogenic strains , the genomic structure and putative functional elements, such as pathogenicity island -like regions, potential virulence factors and horizontal transferring genes of the bacteria are identified.

molecular identification of various genomic elements pave the way to the better understanding of mechanisms underlying metabolic capabilities, pathogenicity of swine erysipelas and prospective vaccine targets besides the widely used spaa antigens.
