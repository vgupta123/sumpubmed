gene content and gene structure were relatively well conserved among the homologous haplotypes.
to investigate the origin and evolution of haplotypes in the bru <dig> genomic regions in sugarcane cultivars, we identified two bac clones from s. spontaneum and four from s. officinarum and compared to seven haplotype sequences from sugarcane hybrid r <dig>  the results clarified the origin of seven homologous haplotypes in r <dig>  four haplotypes originated from s. officinarum, two from s. spontaneum and one recombinant.. retrotransposon insertions and sequences variations among the homologous haplotypes sequence divergence ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % with an average of  <dig>  %.
tajima’s d results emphasized the crucial role of this fungal disease resistance gene for enhancing the fitness of this species and indicating that the brown rust resistance gene in r <dig> is from s. spontaneum.
sugarcane cultivars are frequently aneuploid with chromosome number ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  consisting of 70–80 % s. officinarum, 10–20 % s. spontaneum, and 10 % recombinants between these two species.
comparison of exon splitting among the homologous haplotypes suggested that the genome rearrangements in saccharum hybrids after hybridization.
retrotransposon insertions and sequences variations among the homologous haplotypes sequence divergence may allow sequencing and assembling the autopolyploid saccharum genomes and the auto-allopolyploid hybrid genomes using whole genome shotgun sequencing.
tajima’s d analysis revealed that s. spontaneum hapotypes in the bru <dig> genomic regions were under strong directional selection.
species-specific indel, sequences similarity and phylogenetic analysis of homologous genes can be used for identifying the origin of s. spontaneum and s. officinarum haplotype in saccharum hybrids.
the combined minimum difference at  <dig>  % among homologous chromosomes in s. officinarum would be sufficient for proper genome assembly of this autopolyploid genome.

analysis of a genomic region in the progenitor autoploid genomes of sugarcane hybrid cultivars will reveal the nature and divergence of homologous chromosomes.
exon splitting occurred in haplotypes of the hybrid genome but not in its progenitor genomes.
