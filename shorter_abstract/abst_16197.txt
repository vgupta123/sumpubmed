in e. songoricum, esdreb2b transcript accumulation was induced by a variety of abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, heat, heavy metal, mechanical wounding, oxidative stress and exogenous abscisic acid  treatment.
in transgenic yeast, overexpression of esdreb2b increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses.
heterologous expression of esdreb2b in tobacco showed improved tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, and the transgenic plants exhibited no reduction in foliar growth.
consistent with the predicted role as a transcription factor, esdreb2b was targeted to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells and exhibited transactivation activity of a gal4-containing reporter gene in yeast.
our findings indicate that esdreb2b can enhance stress tolerance in other plant species.
dreb2-type proteins are particularly important in plant responses to drought, salt and heat.
phylogenetic analysis and motif prediction indicate that esdreb2b encodes a truncated dreb <dig> polypeptide that belongs to a legume-specific dreb <dig> group.
based upon these findings, esdreb2b encodes an abiotic stress-inducible, transcription factor which confers abiotic stress-tolerance in yeast and transgenic tobacco.
we observed that esdreb2b is a functional dreb2-orthologue able to influence the physiological and biochemical response of transgenic tobacco to stress.
dreb <dig> genes have been identified and characterized in a variety of plants, and dreb <dig> genes are promising candidate genes for the improvement of stress tolerance in plants.
