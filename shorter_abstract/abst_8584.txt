hair samples were collected from ten horses that received drug treatments and analyzed in segments of  <dig>   <dig> or 6 cm in length.
analytes were detected in hair samples with a length of up to 70 cm.
fourteen out of  <dig> hair samples were positive for at least one of the tested drugs.
no analytes were detected in the light-colored mane and tail hair samples from one horse despite preceding administrations of acepromazine and phenylbutazone.
the aim of this study was to establish and validate a highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  method for the detection and quantification of frequently prescribed opioids, sedatives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the mane and tail hair of horses.
this study describes a sensitive and selective technique suitable for the validated detection and quantification of frequently prescribed veterinary drugs in horse hair.
based on an average growth rate of about 2 cm per month, times of administration reported by horse owners or veterinary physicians were related to drug localizations in hair.

compared to blood or urine, drugs can be detected for much longer periods in the long hair of horses.
hair segments were decontaminated, cut into fragments and methanol-extracted under sonication.
segmentation allowed for time-resolved monitoring of periods of  <dig> to 3 months of drug administration.
