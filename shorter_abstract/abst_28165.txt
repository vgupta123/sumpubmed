in this study, the existence of various forms of ngal in urine  was determined and whether these forms are related to the different urinary diseases found in dogs is further discussed.
determining the molecular forms of ungal present in diseased dogs may provide clinical workers with a tool that will help the early and more precise detection of different urinary diseases.
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin  is a useful biomarker for the early prediction of renal diseases.
the ungal concentrations of dogs with pyuria  were significantly higher than those of the healthy control animals  , but lower than those of dogs with renal diseases .
in particular, monomer was detected more frequently in patients with renal disease than those with non-renal diseases; while the dimer form appeared in a significantly higher percentage of cases with pyuria compared to those without pyuria.
ungal concentrations and their molecular forms in dogs were measured by elisa and western blot analysis, respectively.
different molecular forms of ungal can indicate different origins of the urinary abnormalities.
eighty-one urine samples from dogs with different forms of renal disease , pyuria  and a number of non-renal related diseases , as well as healthy dogs , were collected.
the ngal/mmp- <dig> complex was found to exist not only in the patients with cystitis, but also in the cases with renal injury.
each ngal molecular form could be detected in dog urine.
