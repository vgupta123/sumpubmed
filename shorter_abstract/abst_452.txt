hpg pore can run on both individual computers and in the hadoop distributed computing framework, which allows easy scale-up to manage the large amounts of data expected to result from extensive use of nanopore technologies in the future.
in addition, other new instruments are expected to be released soon, which promise to outperform the current short-read technologies in terms of throughput.
here we present hpg pore, a toolkit for exploring and analysing nanopore sequencing data.
hpg pore allows for virtually unlimited sequencing data scalability, thus guaranteeing its continued management in near future scenarios.
hpg pore is available in github at http://github.com/opencb/hpg-pore.
