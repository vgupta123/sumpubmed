moreover, silencing sp <dig> in hek293t cells resulted in a marked decrease of acvrl <dig> transcriptional activity.
the 5'-proximal promoter region of acvrl <dig>  was analyzed in silico, finding that it lacks tata/caat boxes, but contains a remarkably high number of gc-rich sp <dig> consensus sites.
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated multiple sp <dig> binding sites along the proximal promoter region of acvrl <dig> in endothelial cells.
furthermore, demethylation of cpg islands, led to an increase in acvrl <dig> transcription, whereas in vitro hypermethylation resulted in the abolishment of sp1-dependent transcriptional activation of acvrl <dig>
moreover, our data show that the methylation status of cpg islands markedly modulates the sp <dig> regulation of acvrl <dig> gene transcriptional activity.
in spite of its patho-physiological relevance, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of acvrl <dig>  here, we have studied the different origins of acvrl <dig> transcription, we have analyzed in silico its 5'-proximal promoter sequence and we have characterized the role of sp <dig> in the transcriptional regulation of acvrl <dig>
our results describe two new transcriptional start sites in acvrl <dig> gene, and indicate that sp <dig> is a key regulator of acvrl <dig> transcription, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of acvrl <dig> gene.
activin receptor-like kinase  <dig>  is a transforming growth factor-Î²  receptor type i, mainly expressed in endothelial cells that plays a pivotal role in vascular remodelling and angiogenesis.
