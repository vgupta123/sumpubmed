molecular dynamics simulation of both enzymes was performed to analyze the dynamic nature of their active site residues in the absence and presence of the inhibitor.
secondary structure changes of both enzymes during the simulation time revealed the importance of β-sheet structure of r145/r <dig> for its binding with the terminal carboxylate group of the inhibitor.
the results evaluated are in good agreement with available experimental data, thus providing detailed molecular models which can explain the structural and specificities differences between both zinc peptidases.
x-converting enzyme  involved in nervous control of respiration, is a member of the m <dig> family of zinc peptidases, for which no natural substrate has been identified yet.
secondary structure calculations using dssp method reveals the folding of r145/r <dig> residue of ece-1/xce into β-sheet structure while unfolding of the s2’ subsite residues in aece- <dig> and sustained compact folding of that of axce.
to explore the structural differences between xce and ece- <dig>  homology model of xce was built using the complex structure of ece- <dig> with phosphoramidon  as template.
