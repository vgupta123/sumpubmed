the sequences of primers used in this study are freely available to those interested in quantifying gpcr expression comprehensively.
to illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we determined the repertoire of gpcrs expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and neuroblasts during postnatal development.
we identified tens of gpcrs that were not detected previously in this cell type; these gpcrs represent novel candidate players in the development and survival of cerebellar granule neurons.
the corresponding genes are usually expressed at low levels, making accurate, genome-wide quantification of their expression levels a challenging task using microarrays.
we first draw an inventory of all endo-gpcrs encoded in the murine genome.
to profile gpcrs genome-wide accurately, sensitively, comprehensively, and cost-effectively, we designed and validated a collection of primers that we used in quantitative rt-pcr experiments.
g protein-coupled receptors  are major players in cell communication, regulate a whole range of physiological functions during development and throughout adult life, are affected in numerous pathological situations, and constitute so far the largest class of drugable targets for human diseases.
