the microbes were performing distinct biochemistry on the available substrates, and subsystems such as carbon utilization, iron acquisition mechanisms, nitrogen assimilation, and respiratory pathways separated the two communities.
comparisons of the microbes and the subsystems identified in the two samples highlighted important differences in metabolic potential in each environment.
contrasting biological, chemical and hydrogeological analyses highlights the fundamental processes that shape different environments.
furthermore, subsystem comparisons rapidly identify the important metabolisms employed by the microbes in different environments.
here we have used pyrosequencing, a rapid and relatively inexpensive sequencing technology, to generate environmental genome sequences from two sites in the soudan mine, minnesota, usa.
in addition, the communities were also completely different from other microbial communities sequenced to date.
