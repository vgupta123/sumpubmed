our results indicate that alpk <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of motor coordination.
the transposon-inserted alpk <dig> homozygous mutants  displayed severe defects in motor coordination in a series of behavioral analysis, including dowel test, hanging wire test, rotarod analysis and footprint analysis.
the motor coordination deficits in the alpk1pb/pb mice were rescued by transgenic mice expressing the full-length alpk1-coding sequence under the control of the ubiquitous expression promoter.
however, the cerebellar architecture, purkinje cell morphology and electrophysiology of the purkinje cells appeared normal in mutants.
alpk1pb/pb mice would be a useful model to provide a clue to the better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of alpk <dig> in the control of fine motor activities.
