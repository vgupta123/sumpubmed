it also has the ability to rank the predicted metabolites based on the activity and abundance of enzymes involved in xenobiotic transformation.
we present a new prediction tool, which we call proximal  for identifying possible transformation products of xenobiotic chemicals in the liver.
given a compound of interest, proximal searches for substructures that match the sites cataloged in the look-up tables, applies the corresponding modifications to generate a panel of possible transformation products, and ranks the products based on the activity and abundance of the enzymes involved.
using reaction data from drugbank and kegg, proximal builds look-up tables that catalog the sites and types of structural modifications performed by phase i and phase ii enzymes.

an open question is whether these chemicals transform into potentially more active or toxic derivatives via xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes expressed in the body.
we evaluate the accuracy of proximal’s predictions through case studies on two environmental chemicals with suspected endocrine disrupting activity, bisphenol a  and 4-chlorobiphenyl .
proximal can predict transformations of chemicals that contain substructures recognizable by human liver enzymes.
