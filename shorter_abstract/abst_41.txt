to stimulate use of these resources by the songbird research community and to maintain consistent technical standards, we devised a "community collaboration" mechanism whereby individual birdsong researchers develop experiments and provide tissues, but a single individual in the community is responsible for all rna extractions, labelling and microarray hybridizations.
we produced a spotted cdna microarray with  <dig>  addresses representing  <dig>  non-redundant products of an estimated  <dig> â€“ <dig>  genes, validating it by analysis of immediate-early gene  gene activation following song exposure and by demonstrating effective cross hybridization to genomic dnas of other songbird species in the passerida parvorder.
the results are publicly available in the estima:songbird database.
in response, we developed a core set of genomic tools and a novel collaborative strategy to probe gene expression in diverse songbird species and natural contexts.
we end-sequenced cdnas from zebra finch brain and incorporated additional sequences from community sources into a database of  <dig>  high quality reads.
when the two arrays were hybridized to cdnas from the same set of male and female zebra finch brain samples, both arrays detected a common set of regulated transcripts with a pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig> .
immediately, these results set the foundation for a coordinated set of  <dig> planned experiments by  <dig> research groups probing fundamental links between genome, brain, evolution and behavior in songbirds.
our assembly was also used in the design of the "lund-zfa" affymetrix array representing ~ <dig>  non-redundant sequences.
