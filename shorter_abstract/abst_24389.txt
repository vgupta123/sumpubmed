doseâ€“response modeling of rna-seq and microarray data demonstrated similar point of departure  and ed <dig> estimates for common degs.
dose-dependent differential gene expression provides critical information required for regulatory decision-making.
however, rna-seq provided superior quantitative data, identifying more genes and degs, as well as qualitative information regarding identity and annotation for dose response modeling in support of regulatory decision-making.
rna-seq analysis for differentially expressed genes  varied dramatically depending on the p <dig> cut-off while microarray results varied more based on the fold change criteria, although responses strongly correlated.
however, concordance between rna-seq and microarray analyses in dose response studies has not been adequately vetted.
rna-seq and microarray analysis identified a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively, that were expressed in the liver.
verification by wafergen smartchip qrtpcr revealed that rna-seq had a false discovery rate of 24% compared to 54% for microarray analysis.
