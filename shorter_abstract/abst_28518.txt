pharmacological inhibition of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> signaling blocked the deleterious effects of the proinflammatory cytokines on barrier function.
these data strongly suggest that downstream effectors of map kinase signaling pathways mediate the tnfα/ifnγ-induced junctional reorganization that modulates mdck cell barrier function.
occludin, claudin- <dig>  claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> are integral membrane proteins found in the tight junction of mdck cells.
exposure of mdck cells to tnfα/ifnγ resulted in a marked sustained elevation of transepithelial electrical resistance  as well as elevated paracellular permeability.
we examined mdck cell barrier function in response to challenge by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α  and interferon-γ .
alteration of these tight junction protein complexes during pathological events leads to impaired epithelial barrier function that perturbs water and electrolyte homeostasis.
the tight junction is a dynamic structure that is regulated by a number of cellular signaling processes.
