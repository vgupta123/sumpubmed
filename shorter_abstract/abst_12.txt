further expression analysis revealed that some new founding mirnas maybe regulate leaf senescence in arabidopsis, and the findings highlight the important role of mirnas in dark-induced leaf senescence.
to find the mirnas that may be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, we identified mirnas by microarray platform using arabidopsis thaliana leaves from both whole darkened plants  and individually darkened leaves .
of these differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> mirnas  have been previously reported to be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, and the remaining  <dig> mirnas have not been implicated in leaf senescence before.
target genes of all  <dig> mirnas were predicted, and some of them, such as nac <dig>  at3g <dig>  at2g <dig> and at2g <dig>  were found in the leaf senescence database .
a microarray analysis about dark-induced mirnas involved in leaf senescence are present here.
we found that the expressions of  <dig> mirnas  were significantly changed both in dp and idl leaves.
go and kegg analysis of  <dig> mirnas showed that the predicted target genes were significantly enriched in transcription regulation, development-related biological processes and metabolic pathways.
micrornas  are endogenous small  single-stranded non-coding rnas that typically function by guiding cleavage of target genes.
among them, the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were relative higher than others .
expression levels of some of the corresponding mirna targets  were analysed and found to be significantly different in dp/idl than that in wt.
