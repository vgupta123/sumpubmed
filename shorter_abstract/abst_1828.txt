several phylogenomic analyses have recently demonstrated the need to account simultaneously for incomplete lineage sorting  and hybridization when inferring a species phylogeny.
inspired by recent work on the pseudo-likelihood of species trees based on rooted triples, we introduce the pseudo-likelihood of a phylogenetic network, which, when combined with a search heuristic, provides a statistical method for phylogenetic network inference in the presence of ils.
a maximum likelihood approach was introduced recently for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of both processes, and showed very good results.
the method is computationally efficient and has produced very good results on the data sets we analyzed.
the nonuniqueness of phylogenetic networks encoded by a system of rooted triples notwithstanding, the proposed method infers the correct network under certain scenarios, and provides candidates for further exploration under other criteria and/or data in other scenarios.
maximum pseudo-likelihood allows for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of hybridization and ils, while scaling to much larger data sets than is currently feasible under full maximum likelihood.
however, computing the likelihood of a model in this case is computationally infeasible except for very small data sets.
