the study used a set of  <dig> human extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains  isolated from  skin and soft tissue infections,  respiratory infections,  intra-abdominal infections, and  genital smears.
results obtained from the group of expec strains were compared to data from our previously published analyses of  <dig> fecal commensal e. coli strains.
while some microcin determinants  were associated with virulent strains, other bacteriocin types  were associated with fecal flora.
microcin producers and microcin determinants dominated in expec strains, while colicin producers and colicin determinants were more frequent in fecal e. coli .
human expec strains were shown to differ from human fecal strains in a number of parameters including bacteriocin production, prevalence of several bacteriocin and virulence determinants, and prevalence of phylogenetic groups.
the set was tested for bacteriocin production, for prevalence of bacteriocin and virulence determinants, and for phylogenetic typing.
expec strains had a significantly higher prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig>  compared to fecal e. coli strains .
the frequency of bacteriocinogeny was significantly higher in the set of expec strains , compared to fecal e. coli .
higher production of microcin m and lower production of microcin b <dig>  colicin ib, and js was detected in the set of expec strains.
differences in these parameters were also identified within subgroups of expec strains of diverse origin.
