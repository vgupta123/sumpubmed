we identified multiple functional motifs and conserved sequence motifs in the disordered tails, discovered the correlation between cancer-associated mutations and functional motifs, explored the abundance of protein intrinsic disorder in the interactomes of beta-catenin, and elaborated a working model on the regulatory roles of disordered tails in the functional pathways of beta-catenin.
in this study, we focused on the characterization of sequential, structural, and functional features of the disordered tails of beta-catenin.
in addition, it is interesting to note that the three sequential regions have different structural features: the middle armadillo domain is structured, but both n- and c-terminal tails are disordered.
accomplishing these two functions requires synergistic action of various sequential regions of the same beta-catenin molecule, including the n-terminal tail, the middle armadillo domain, and the c-terminal tail.
although the middle armadillo domain is the major functional unit of beta-catenin, the involvement of tails in the regulation of interaction between beta-catenin and its partners has been well observed.
these motifs interact with each other and the armadillo domain of beta-catenin to regulate the function of beta-catenin in both cadherin junction formation pathway and wnt signaling pathway.
disordered tails of beta-catenin contain multiple functional motifs.
beta-catenin has two major functions: coordinating cell-cell adhesion by interacting with cadherin in cadherin junction formation pathway; and regulating gene expression through wnt signaling pathway.
