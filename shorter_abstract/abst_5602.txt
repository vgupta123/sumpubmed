coexpression of αt2ib and mouse tlr <dig> in hek <dig> cells led to efficient retention and accumulation of tlr <dig> inside the er compartment.
our results show persistent paralysis of tlr <dig> activity and thus inhibition of immune activation.
intracellular antibodies expressed and retained inside the endoplasmatic reticulum  are applied to block translocation of secreted and cell surface molecules from the er to the cell surface resulting in functional inhibition of the target protein.
cell activation via tlr <dig> and other pattern recognition receptors  contributes to sepsis pathology and chronic inflammation both relying on overamplification of an immune response.
the generated anti-tlr <dig> scfv intrabody inhibits specifically and very efficiently tlr <dig> ligand-driven cell activation in vitro and ex vivo.
co-immunoprecipitation of human tlr <dig> with αt2ib indicated interaction of αt2ib with its cognate antigen within cells.
transduction with advαt2ib specifically inhibited tlr <dig> surface expression of murine raw <dig>  and primary macrophages derived from bone marrow .
this indicates a therapeutic potential of αt2ib in microbial or viral infections.
