two divergent mapt haplotypes, h <dig> and h <dig> are described with distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns across the region reflecting the inversion status at this locus.
we find the expression of several genes in and at the borders of the inversion to be affected; specific either to whole blood or different regions of the human brain.
given the link between the inversion status and different neurological diseases, these genes may also be involved in disease pathology, possibly in a tissue-specific manner.
however, our results show that the inversion status affects expression of other genes in the 17q <dig>  region as well.
studies thus far have focused on the expression of mapt in the inversion region.
the mapt h <dig> haplotype has been associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, parkinson’s disease and alzheimer’s disease, while the h <dig> is linked to recurrent deletion events associated with the 17q <dig>  microdeletion syndrome, a disease characterized by developmental delay and learning disability.
chromosome 17q <dig>  contains a common inversion polymorphism of approximately 900 kb in populations with european ancestry.
