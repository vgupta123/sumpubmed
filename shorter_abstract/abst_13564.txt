animals were killed after  <dig> days of carprofen administration.
in experiment  <dig> three groups of  <dig> rats received different doses  of carprofen from surgery.
carprofen interferes with wound healing in the rat ileum at a very early stage.
in significant contrast to buprenorphine, which never did so, carprofen induced frequent signs of anastomotic leakage, which were already present at day  <dig>  if first administration was delayed for  <dig> hours, the leakage rate was significantly reduced .
throughout the study, the anastomotic bursting pressure was lowest in animals who displayed signs of anastomotic leakage.
this study aims to characterize the negative effects of carprofen on early anastomotic healing in the rat ileum.
loss of anastomotic integrity did not coincide with reduced levels of hydroxyproline or increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases.
