furthermore, understanding the molecular genetic basis of mosquito chemosensory behavior has important implications for vector control.
using genome-guided alignments and de novo transcriptome assembly, our re-annotation includes  <dig> new putative protein-coding genes and updates to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of existing transcripts within coding sequences and untranslated regions, respectively.
using this updated annotation, we detail gene expression in each tissue, identifying large numbers of transcripts regulated by blood-feeding and sexually dimorphic transcripts that may provide clues to the biology of male- and female-specific behaviors, such as mating and blood-feeding, which are areas of intensive study for those interested in vector control.
a complete genome sequence and the advent of genome editing open up non-traditional model organisms to mechanistic genetic studies.
we used comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of adult gene expression to improve the genome annotation and to provide a detailed tissue-specific catalogue of neural gene expression at different adult behavioral states.
furthermore, we examined gene expression across three important phases of the female reproductive cycle, a remarkable example of behavioral switching in which a female mosquito alternates between obtaining blood-meals from humans and laying eggs.
