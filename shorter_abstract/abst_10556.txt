expression of the two transcription factors microphthalmia-associated transcription factor  and signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  are tightly connected to cell proliferation and survival, and are important for melanocyte development.
in addition, a set of experiment-specific parameters was derived for each of  <dig> experiments reported in the literature.
the model seems capable of accounting for most of these experiments in terms of observed temporal development of protein amounts and phosphorylation states.
further, the results also suggest that this system possesses some regulatory features yet to be elucidated.
we present a mathematical model describing the mitf-pias3-stat <dig> signalling network.
a better quantitative understanding of this regulation is likely to be important for elucidation of the melanocyte biology.
