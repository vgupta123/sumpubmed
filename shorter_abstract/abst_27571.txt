for measurements repeated after 24Â hours we found on average correlation of  <dig> , even after one year profiles still correlated with  <dig> , demonstrating the enormous stability of the cell type specific mirnomes.
in sum, our results provide evidence that blood cell type specific mirnomes are very consistent between individuals and over time.
highest correlation was found for cd <dig> positive cells, exceeding pearson correlation of  <dig> .
besides serum, patterns from whole blood are increasingly considered as markers for human pathologies.
we measured the mirna repertoire for each cell type and whole blood for two individuals at three time points over the course of one year in order to provide evidence that the cell type mirnomes can be reproducibly detected.
usually, the contribution of different cell types to the respective signature remains however unknown.
in order to estimate the complexity and variability of the cell type specific mirnomes, we generated profiles for all considered cell types in a total of seven unaffected individuals.
in this study we provide insights into the human mirnome of different compounds of the blood including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> positive cells as well as exosomes.
while cd <dig> positive cells showed the most complex mirnome consisting of  <dig> mirnas, we detected significantly less mirnas  in cd <dig> positive cells.
interestingly, exosomes were enriched just for onco-mirnas but not for mirna tumor suppressors.
