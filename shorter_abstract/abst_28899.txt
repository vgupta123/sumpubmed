cascade selects representative nodes for each cluster and iteratively refines clusters based on a combination of the occurrence probability and graph topology between every protein pair.
an important strength of cascade is that the percentage of proteins that are discarded to create clusters is much lower than the other approaches which have an average discard rate of 45% on the yeast protein-protein interaction network.
here, we present a novel clustering methodology for ppi networks wherein the biological and topological influence of each protein on other proteins is modeled using the probability distribution that the series of interactions necessary to link a pair of distant proteins in the network occur within a time constant .
the cascade approach is compared to nine competing approaches.
quantitative characterization of the topological characteristics of protein-protein interaction  networks can enable the elucidation of biological functional modules.
the clusters obtained by each technique are compared for enrichment of biological function.
cascade generates larger clusters and the clusters identified have p-values for biological function that are approximately 1000-fold better than the other methods on the yeast ppi network dataset.
