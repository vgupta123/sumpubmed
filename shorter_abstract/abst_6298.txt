within  <dig> hrs of the insult regional specific changes in neuronal firing patterns were evident as:  a dramatic reduction in the ability of ca <dig> to generate firing; and  a contrasting increase in the frequency and duration of synchronized neuronal firing events in ca <dig>  two distinct processes underlie the increased propensity of ca <dig> to generate synchronized burst firing; a lack of ability of the ca <dig> region to 'pace' ca <dig> resulting in an increased frequency of synchronized events; and a change in the 'intrinsic' properties limited to the ca <dig> region, which is responsible for increased event duration.
the effect of an excitotoxic insult  on mg2+-free-induced synchronized neuronal firing was tested in organotypic hippocampal culture by measuring extracellular field activity in ca <dig> and ca <dig>
synchronous neuronal firing can be induced in isolated hippocampal slices and involves all regions of this structure, thereby providing a measure of circuit activity.
these results provide novel insight into adaptation of hippocampal circuits following excitotoxic injury.
the adaptations of neuronal circuits in response to such insults may be expected to play an underlying role in pathogenesis.
