most of the proteins over-expressed in cmm were shown to have putative function in metabolism, of which seven were involved in amino acid transport and metabolism or lipid metabolism.
many of the virulence determinants and putative vaccine candidates for bacterial pathogens are known to be surface localized.
the factors involved in these complex processes are largely unknown and of crucial importance to understanding microbial pathogenesis.
based upon bioinformatic analysis; choloylglycine hydrolase family protein, cell wall-associated serine proteinase, and rhomboid family protein were predicted as surface protein markers for specific detection of c. perfringens from the environment and food.
riboflavin biosynthesis protein, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, cystathionine beta-lyase, and threonine dehydratase were the predominant proteins that exhibited  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold increase in the expression level in cells growing on cmm.
ornithine carbamoyltransferase and cystathionine beta-lyase were over-expressed in cells grown on cooked meat medium and also identified in the surface protein fraction and the former was immunogenic; making them potential vaccine candidates.
clostridium perfringens is a medically important clostridial pathogen causing diseases in man and animals.
using 2-de mass spectrometry strategy, we identified major surface  and cell envelope  proteins from clostridium perfringens atcc <dig> and those differentially expressed  in cells grown on cooked meat medium  in comparison with cells grown in reference state .
to invade, multiply and colonize tissues of the host, a pathogen must be able to evade host immune system, and obtain nutrients essential for growth.
