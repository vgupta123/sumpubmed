a normalized and full-length enriched cdna library from  <dig> ~  <dig> days old immature seeds was constructed and randomly sequenced, leading to generation of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  which then formed  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons with  <dig> % uniests being putative full-length open reading frames.
in this study, we carried out a large scale of expressed sequence tags  sequencing from developing sesame seeds and further conducted analysis on seed storage products-related genes.
homologous genes involved in oil biosynthesis were identified including some conservative transcription factors regulating oil biosynthesis such as leafy cotyledon <dig> , pickle , wrinkled <dig>  and majority of them were found for the first time in sesame seeds.
however, genetic improvement efforts in sesame could not get benefit from molecular biology technology due to poor dna and rna sequence resources.
one hundred and  <dig> ests were identified possibly involved in biosynthesis of sesame lignans, sesamin and sesamolin.
in total,  <dig>  putative functional genes from developing seeds were identified, which accounts for one third of total genes in the sesame genome.
approximately  <dig>  of all these uniests have significant matches to the counterparts in nr database of genbank, and  <dig>  of them were assigned to one or more gene ontology  terms.
these est sequences enriched with full length will contribute to comparative genomic studies on sesame and other oilseed plants and serve as an abundant information platform for functional marker development and functional gene study.
