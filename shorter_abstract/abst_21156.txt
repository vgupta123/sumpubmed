incubations of nagly and recombinant faah demonstrated that nagly is a significantly less efficacious substrate for faah with only ~50% hydrolysis at  <dig> minutes compared to 100% hydrolysis of aea.
co-incubations of aea and glycine with recombinant faah did not, however, produce nagly.
furthermore, the levels of aea in the brain were significantly increased, whereas those of nagly were significantly decreased after systemic injection of urb  <dig> in rats and in faah ko mice further supporting a role for faah in endogenous nagly biosynthesis.
n-arachidonoyl glycine  is an endogenous signaling lipid with a wide variety of biological activity whose biosynthesis is poorly understood.
the other suggests that nagly is an oxidative metabolite of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide , through an alcohol dehydrogenase.
significantly, d4aea produced a d0nagly product only in c <dig> glioma cells suggesting that the hydrolysis of aea yielded aa that was used preferentially in a conjugation reaction.
these data support the hypothesis that the signaling lipid nagly is a metabolic product of aea by both oxidative metabolism of the aea ethanolamine moiety and through the conjugation of glycine to aa that is released during aea hydrolysis by faah.
one suggests that nagly is formed via an enzymatically regulated conjugation of arachidonic acid  and glycine.
