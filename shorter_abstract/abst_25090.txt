we present an efficient method for the local alignment of pyrosequencing reads produced by the gs flx  system against a reference sequence.
an evaluation performed using real and simulated data shows that our proposed method outperforms a number of mainstream tools on the quantity and quality of successful alignments, as well as on the execution time.
over the past few years, new massively parallel dna sequencing technologies have emerged.
among the most critical problems is that of efficiently and accurately mapping reads to a reference genome in the context of re-sequencing projects.
however, these techniques also raise important computational difficulties mostly due to the huge volume of data produced, but also because of some of their specific characteristics such as read length and sequencing errors.
