heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres  for antisera against prrsv  at all sampling time points.
for antisera against prrsv  and prrsv , heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi , respectively.
the main purpose of this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of prrsv .
high viral titres were detected in lungs , tonsils  and inguinal lymph nodes  until  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively.
in the present study, prrsv was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure and designated "lena".
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is divided into a european and north american genotype.
viral titres ranged from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg in nasal secretions between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi and from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg in tonsillar scrapings between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.
to examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the east european subtype  <dig> isolate lena, the european subtype  <dig> strain lelystad and the north american strain us <dig>  sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were tested in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays  with homologous and heterologous viral antigens.
lena is a highly pathogenic east european subtype  <dig> prrsv, which differs from european subtype  <dig> lelystad and north american us <dig> strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.
arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died, and streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized.
east european prrsv isolates have been found to be of the european genotype, but form different subtypes.
the difference in viral titres in sera from prrsv  and prrsv -infected pigs was statistically significant  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi.
the highest viral titres in sera ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml for prrsv  whereas they ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml for prrsv .
