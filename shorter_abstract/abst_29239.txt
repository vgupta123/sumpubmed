listeria monocytogenes  can cause invasive diseases in humans and farm animals and is frequently isolated from dairy products and poultry.
two hundred and twelve isolates of l. monocytogenes  from food sources from  <dig> provinces/cities in china were analysed by serotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and multi-locus sequence typing .
however little is known of genetic diversity of chinese l. monocytogenes  isolates and their relationships with global isolates.
this study also enhances our understanding of genetic diversity of l. monocytogenes  in china.
the  <dig> most common sts were st <dig> , st <dig>  and st <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of the isolates.
listeriosis is uncommon in china but l. monocytogenes  has been isolated from foods and food processing environments in china.
