screening sperm samples from potential founders provides much better information on germline transmission rates and crucially the sequence of the particular insertions/deletions  that will be transmitted.
the methods described will streamline the production of large numbers of knockout alleles in selected genes for phenotypic analysis, complementing existing efforts using random mutagenesis.
