among these genes we find the non-coding snorna genes as a large novel class of myc targets.
this work shows that myc acts as a master regulator of snornp biogenesis.
myc proteins are essential regulators of animal growth during normal development, and their deregulation is one of the main driving factors of human malignancies.
the loss of snornas impairs growth during normal development, whereas their overexpression increases tumor mass in a model for neuronal tumors.
we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  and rnaseq approaches in drosophila tissue culture cells to identify a core set of less than  <dig> myc target genes, whose salient function resides in the control of ribosome biogenesis.
