this study provides an insight into some of the varied and novel molecular networks that operate during the regionalization of embryonic neural tissue and expands our knowledge of molecular repertoire used during development.
however, it is clear that much remains to be learned about the complete set of molecular cues that are employed to establish the identity and intrinsic neuronal diversity of these territories.
others represent genes whose embryonic expression has not been previously reported.
during early development the vertebrate neural tube is broadly organized into the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord regions.
