the intestinal cells of caenorhabditis elegans are filled with heterogeneous granular organelles that are associated with specific organ functions.
haf- <dig> and haf- <dig> are atp-binding cassette  transporter proteins that are homologous to the mammalian lysosomal peptide transporter tapl .
our results indicate that the haf-4- and haf-9-localizing organelles are distinct intestinal organelles associated with the endocytic pathway.
using transgenic worms expressing fluorescent protein-tagged marker proteins, we demonstrated that the haf-4- and haf-9-localizing organelles are not lipid droplets and do not participate in yolk protein transport.

the best studied of these organelles are lipid droplets and acidified gut granules associated with glo- <dig>  a homolog of the small gtpase rab <dig>  in this study, we characterized a subset of the intestinal granules in which haf- <dig> and haf- <dig> localize on the membrane.
they were also ruled out as glo-1-positive acidified gut granules.
