in the case of speech, this may lead to a match of bottom-up sensory input with lexical expectations resulting in resonant states which are reflected in the induced gamma-band activity .
the words were a minimal pair in german and differed with respect to the degree of specificity of segmental phonological information.
thus, the degree of specificity of phonological information in the mental lexicon correlates with the intensity of the matching process of bottom-up sensory input with lexical information.
the delineated alignment of pre-existing knowledge with sensory input is in accordance with recent ideas about the role of internal forward models in speech perception.
these results together with those of a behavioural control experiment support the notion of multi-level mechanisms involved in the repair of deficient speech.
how does the brain repair obliterated speech and cope with acoustically ambivalent situations?
the induced gba was larger when the expected lexical information was phonologically fully specified compared to the underspecified condition.
