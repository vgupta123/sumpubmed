on the other hand, the β-sheet propensities obtained by several studies differed significantly, indicating that the context significantly affects β-sheet propensity.
however, β-sheet propensities calculated for exposed residues differ from those for buried residues, indicating that the exposed-residue fraction is one of the major factors governing amino acid composition in β-strands.
furthermore, the correlations we detected suggest that amino acid composition is related to folding properties such as the twist of a β-strand or association between two β sheets.
at buried sites in β-strands, the content of tyr, trp, gln and ser correlates negatively with the content of val, ile and leu .
we also found some fold dependence on amino acid frequency in β-strands.
results showed that α-helix propensities do not differ significantly by fold, but β-sheet propensities are diverse and depend on the fold.
the obtained propensities for α-helices are consistent with each other, and the pair-wise correlation coefficient is frequently high.
a large number of studies have been carried out to obtain amino acid propensities for α-helices and β-sheets.
we calculated amino acid propensities for α-helices and β-sheets for  <dig> and  <dig> protein folds, respectively, and addressed whether they correlate with the fold.
the α-helix propensities are similar for all folds and for exposed and buried residues.
the propensities calculated for exposed sites and buried sites are similar for α-helix, but such is not the case for the β-sheet propensities.
