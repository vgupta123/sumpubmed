to benchmark the snp identification method,  <dig> snps, in which the polymorphism was represented twice in the sequence alignment, were selected and tested on a panel of three purebred boar lines and wild boar.
available bac and bac-end sequences and their naming and mapping information, all obtained from sangerinstitute ftp site, served as a rough assembly of a reference genome.
of these  <dig> in silico identified snps,  <dig> were shown to be polymorphic in our animal panel.
benchmarking in an animal panel showed that more than 80% of the predicted snps represented true genetic variation.
this snp identification method, which mines for snps in publicly available porcine shotgun sequences repositories, provides thousands of high quality snps.
a total of  <dig>  million whole genome shotgun sequences obtained from the ncbi trace-repository with center name "sdjvp", and project name "sino-danish pig genome project" were analysed for the presence of snps.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are ideal genetic markers due to their high abundance and the highly automated way in which snps are detected and snp assays are performed.
