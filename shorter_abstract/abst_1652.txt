caspases are cysteine proteases with essential functions in the apoptotic pathway; their proteolytic activity toward various substrates is associated with the morphological changes of cells.
together with the identification of autophagy genes, the results of our screen suggest that autophagy counteracts dcp-1-induced apoptosis.
our results showing that dcp- <dig> and autophagy-related genes influence each other will aid future investigations of the complicated relationships between apoptosis and autophagy.
recent reports have described non-apoptotic functions of caspases, including autophagy.
taken together, these data suggest that autophagy suppresses dcp-1-mediated apoptotic cell death, whereas dcp- <dig> positively regulates autophagy, possibly through feedback regulation.
consistent with this idea, we show that expression of egfp-atg <dig> rescued the eye phenotype caused by dcp- <dig> gf.
we screened ~ <dig>  ep lines and identified  <dig> dcp-1-interacting genes that were classified into  <dig> groups based on their functions and pathways:  <dig> apoptosis signaling genes,  <dig> autophagy genes,  <dig> insulin/igf and tor signaling pathway genes,  <dig> map kinase and jnk signaling pathway genes,  <dig> ecdysone signaling genes,  <dig> ubiquitination genes,  <dig> various developmental signaling genes,  <dig> transcription factors,  <dig> translation factors, and  <dig> other unclassified genes including  <dig> functionally undefined genes.
among them, insulin/igf and tor signaling pathway, map kinase and jnk signaling pathway, and ecdysone signaling are known to be involved in autophagy.
we identified a number of dcp- <dig> modifiers that genetically interact with dcp-1-induced cell death.
