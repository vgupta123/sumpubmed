a number of computational methods for mirna genes finding have been proposed in the past decade, yet the problem is far from being tackled, especially when considering the imbalance issue of known mirnas and unidentified mirnas, and the pre-mirnas with multi-loops or higher minimum free energy .
aiming at better prediction performance, an ensemble support vector machine  classifier is established to deal with the imbalance issue, and multi-loop features are included for identifying those pre-mirnas with multi-loops.
we collected a representative dataset, which contains  <dig> real mirna precursors identified by experimental procedure and other computational methods, and  <dig> pseudo ones from several datasets.
mirensvm is an ensemble support vector machine  classification system for better detecting mirna genes, especially those with multi-loop secondary structure.
compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, mirensvm obtained better prediction results.
this paper presents a new computational approach, mirensvm, for finding mirna genes.
