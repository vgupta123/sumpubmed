by focusing our search to the relatively short regions  sandwiched by conserved sequences, we successfully predict  <dig> intergenic and  <dig>  sense or antisense ncrna candidates, which were found in the pairwise alignments with stable consensus secondary structure and low sequence identity .
aligning rna sequences with low sequence identity has been a challenging problem since such a computation essentially needs an algorithm with high complexities for taking structural conservation into account.
by manual inspection of the results, moreover, we obtained four multiple alignments with low sequence identity which reveal consensus structures shared by three species/sequences.
the benchmark results showed that our new algorithm is accurate and efficient in both time and memory usage.
by comparing with the previous predictions, we found that > 92% of the candidates is novel candidates.
the present method gives an efficient tool complementary to sequence-alignment-based ncrna finders.
then, combining with the originally trained svm, we applied the new algorithm to novel ncrna discovery where we compared s. cerevisiae genome with six related genomes in a pairwise manner.
the estimated rate of false positives in the predicted candidates is 51%.
