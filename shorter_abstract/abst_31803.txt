in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the conserved ins/igf- <dig> signaling pathway regulates many biological processes including life span, stress response, dauer diapause and metabolism.
after genorm analysis, cdc- <dig>  pmp- <dig> and y45f10d.
the methodology used in this study is generally applicable to reliably quantify gene expression levels in the nematode c. elegans using quantitative pcr.
our findings emphasize the importance of accurate normalization using stably expressed reference genes.
the aim of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for gene expression analysis in c. elegans.
real-time quantitative pcr was used to evaluate the expression stability of  <dig> candidate reference genes  in wild-type, three ins/igf- <dig> pathway mutants, dauers and l <dig> stage larvae.
appropriate normalization is an essential prerequisite for obtaining accurate and reproducible quantification of gene expression levels.
