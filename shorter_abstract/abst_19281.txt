we present a method that normalizes and statistically scores microscopy based rnai screens, exploiting individual cell information of hundreds of cells per knockdown.
we present results on two infection screens for hepatitis c and dengue virus, both showing considerable effects on observed phenotypes due to population context.
this leads to the identification of new host dependency factors of the hepatitis c and dengue viruses and higher reproducibility of results.
microscopy based screening allows phenotypic observations at the level of individual cells.
furthermore, our approach results in the identification of considerably more significantly enriched pathways in hepatitis c virus replication than using a standard analysis approach.
it was recently shown that a cell's population context significantly influences results.
using a cell-based analysis and normalization for population context, we achieve improved sensitivity and specificity not only on a individual protein level, but especially also on a pathway level.
each cell's individual population context is employed in normalization.
however, standard analysis methods for cellular screens do not currently take individual cell data into account unless this is important for the phenotype of interest, i.e.
