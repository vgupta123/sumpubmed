to develop new microalgal bioprospecting tools to aid in the search of environmental samples for algae that share similar cell wall and cell surface components, we have produced single-chain camelid antibodies raised against cell surface components of the single-cell alga, chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
in addition, mcherry-tagged vhh b <dig> was used along with fluorescence activated cell sorting  to select individual axenic isolates of presumed wild relatives of c. reinhardtii and other chlorphyceae from the same environmental samples.
the live-cell elisa procedure was employed to detect algae sharing cell surface components with c. reinhardtii in water samples from natural environments.
cell walls are essential for most bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and land plants to provide shape, structural integrity and protection from numerous biotic and abiotic environmental factors.
in the case of eukaryotic algae, relatively little is known of the composition, structure or mechanisms of assembly of cell walls in individual species or between species and how these differences enable algae to inhabit a great diversity of environments.

this elisa technique was demonstrated to be as accurate as standard elisas that employ proteins from cell lysates and that generally require >24 hours to complete.
among the cloned vhhs, vhh b <dig>  exhibited the highest affinity  for the c. reinhardtii cell surface.
we have cloned the variable-region domains  from the camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies and overproduced tagged versions of these monoclonal-like antibodies in e. coli.
