all microsatellite markers showed a high level of polymorphism .
damask roses  are mainly used for essential oil production.
nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of  <dig> accessions of r. damascena collected across major and minor rose oil production areas in iran.
this is the first study that uncovered genetic diversity within damask rose.
our results will guide new collection activities to establish larger collections and manage the iranian damask rose genetic resources.
cluster analysis of genetic similarities revealed that these microsatellites identified a total of nine different genotypes.
