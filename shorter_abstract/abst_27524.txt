comparison of these transcriptome profiles to an in-house generated microarray-based transcriptomics database comprising of  <dig> stages/tissues of vegetative as well as reproductive development in rice resulted in the identification of  <dig>  genes specifically expressed in anther stages.
in addition, the gene sets that have been produced will assist the plant reproductive community in building a deeper understanding of underlying regulatory networks and in selecting gene candidates for functional validation.
in flowering plants, the anther is the site of male gametophyte development.
it is likely that many of these candidates may therefore contribute to specific aspects of anther and/or male gametophyte development in rice.
further, these transcriptomes have been compared with the transcriptomes of  <dig> stages of rice vegetative and seed development to identify genes that express specifically during anther development.
two major events in the development of the male germline are meiosis and the asymmetric division in the male gametophyte that gives rise to the vegetative and generative cells, and the following mitotic division in the generative cell that produces two sperm cells.
anther transcriptomes have been analyzed in many plant species at progressive stages of development by using microarray and sequence-by synthesis-technologies to identify genes that regulate anther development.
here we report a comprehensive analysis of rice anther transcriptomes at four distinct stages, focusing on identifying regulatory components that contribute to male meiosis and germline development.
transcriptome profiling of four stages of anther development in rice including pre-meiotic , meiotic , anthers at single-celled  and tri-nucleate pollen  revealed about  <dig>  genes expressing in at least one of the anther developmental stages, with the highest number in ma  and the lowest  in tpa.
not only have we provided the transcriptome constituents of four landmark stages of anther development in rice but we have also identified genes that express exclusively in these stages.
gene ontology and pathway analysis of stage-specific genes revealed that those encoding transcription factors and components of protein folding, sorting and degradation pathway genes dominated in ma, whereas in tpa, those coding for cell structure and signal transduction components were in abundance.
the expression pattern of selected genes has been validated using real time pcr and in situ hybridizations.
