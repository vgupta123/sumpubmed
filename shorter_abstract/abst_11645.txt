although formal demonstration of algorithmic computability remains elusive for , we discuss the extent to which our bio-pepa representation of  allows us to sidestep rosenâ€™s fundamental objections to computational systems biology.
if -like structures are present in real biological networks, this suggests that many biological networks will be non-computable, with implications for those branches of systems biology that rely on in silico modelling for predictive purposes.
we instantiate  using the process algebra bio-pepa, and discuss the extent to which our model represents a true realization of .
