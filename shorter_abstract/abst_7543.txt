urine within the urinary tract is commonly regarded as "sterile" in cultivation terms.
the bacterial profiles in the female urine samples studied were complex; considerable variation between individuals was observed and a common microbial signature was not evident.
the number of operational taxonomic units  for individual samples varied substantially and was in the range of  <dig> -  <dig>
here, we present a comprehensive in-depth study of bacterial 16s rdna sequences associated with urine from healthy females by means of culture-independent high-throughput sequencing techniques.
