real-time quantitative pcr, which is essential for the characterization of lower abundance genes, was used to examine  <dig> ecm genes potentially relevant for endurance-exercise adaptation.
ecm genes profiled included the angiopoietin  <dig> and related genes  and  <dig> , vascular endothelial growth factor  and related receptors , thrombospondin- <dig>  α2-macroglobulin and transforming growth factor β <dig>
the fourfold-greater increase in aerobic fitness and markedly differing gene expression profile in the hrg indicates that these ecm genes may be critical for physiological adaptation to exercise in humans.
in addition, we show that, without careful demonstration of physiological adaptation, conclusions derived from gene expression profiling of human skeletal muscle following exercise may be of limited value.
we propose that future studies should  investigate the mechanisms that underlie the apparent link between physiological adaptation and gene expression and  use the genes profiled in this paper as candidates for population genetic studies.
we have demonstrated that over  <dig> genes are activated in response to endurance-exercise training, including modulation of muscle extracellular matrix  genes.
