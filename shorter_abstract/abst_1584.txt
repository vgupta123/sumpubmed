reduced oxygen tension severely impaired adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of human msc.
elevation of oxygen from 1% to 3% restored osteogenic differentiation.
after transferring msc from atmospheric oxygen levels of 21% to 1%, hif-1Î± expression was induced, indicating efficient oxygen reduction.
human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  can be isolated from various tissues including bone marrow.
in this compartment, the oxygen tension is low and oxygen partial pressure is estimated to range from 1% to 7%.
we analyzed the effect of low oxygen tensions on human msc cultured with platelet-lysate supplemented media and assessed proliferation, morphology, chromosomal stability, immunophenotype and plasticity.
physiologic oxygen tension during in vitro culture of human msc slows down cell cycle progression and differentiation.
however, no chromosomal abnormalities in human msc under either culture condition were detected using high-resolution matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization.
hypoxic stress as well as free oxygen radicals may affect chromosomal stability.
further studies are needed to analyze these aspects of msc in tissue regeneration.
