a  <dig>  kb tαc promoter fragment is sufficient to direct cone-specific expression in transgenic larvae.
pre- <dig> is not required for cone-specific expression directed from a  <dig>  kb tαc promoter.
we demonstrate that pre- <dig>  but not pre-1-rho, is sufficient to enhance expression from a heterologous uv cone promoter.
pre- <dig> is also sufficient to enhance expression from a heterologous rhodopsin promoter without altering its rod photoreceptor specificity.
to date, only a few cis-regulatory elements that control cone photoreceptor-specific expression have been characterised.
in order to better understand the molecular genetics controlling the initiation of cone photoreceptor-specific expression in vivo, we have utilised zebrafish to identify cis-regulatory elements in the upstream promoter region of the tαc gene.
pre- <dig> specifically binds nuclear factors expressed in ocular tissue.
pre-1-rho which has the highest sequence and structural homology to pre- <dig> is located in the rhodopsin promoter.
however, pre-1-like sequences, with potential functional redundancy, are located in this  <dig>  kb promoter.
finally, mutations in consensus e-box and otx sites prevent pre- <dig> from forming complexes with eye nuclear protein and enhancing photoreceptor expression.
the alpha-subunit of cone transducin  is specifically expressed in cone photoreceptors and is required for colour vision.
pre- <dig> is a novel cis-regulatory module that is sufficient to enhance the initiation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression in differentiating rod and cone photoreceptors.
