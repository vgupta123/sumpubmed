using in silico analysis, we found the presence of one hif-1alpha  motif  overlapping e-box  and two ap-1-like binding sites , one of which is also overlapped with hif-1alpha sequence.
hypoxia treatment also led to the up-regulation of cd <dig> expression.
the functions of cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig> remain relatively unknown.
in this study, we investigated the function of cis-regulatory elements within the promoter of cd <dig>  we fused the 5'-flanking region of cd <dig> to a luciferase reporter vector.
these results suggest that cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig> overlapping hif-1alpha/e-box/ap-1-like sequences may play important regulatory roles.
determination of the optimal promoter region and transcription factors governing cd <dig> expression is useful in understanding cd <dig> functions.
cd <dig>  is a sialomucin which has been suggested to participate in regulating the proliferation, cell adhesion and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
the minimal promoter region was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.
co-transfection of c-jun, hif-1alpha and minimal promoter region construct demonstrated that c-jun and hif-1alpha bound the cd <dig> promoter and promoted cd <dig> expression.
chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the hif-1alpha bound the minimal promoter region.
