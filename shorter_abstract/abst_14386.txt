this first draft b. tryoni genome resembles other dipteran genomes in terms of size and putative coding sequences.
amongst the tephritidae, the genus bactrocera, containing over  <dig> species, presents various species groups of potential utility for genetic studies of speciation, behaviour or pest control.
unscaffolded assemblies of b. neohumeralis and b. jarvisi were then produced; comparison with b. tryoni showed that the species are more closely related than any drosophila species pair.
over  <dig>  maker-derived gene models showed a large degree of overlap with other dipteran reference genomes.
the male genome  includes approximately 150mb of interspersed repetitive dna sequences and 60mb of satellite dna.
for all three species included in this study, we have identified a comprehensive set of non-redundant repetitive sequences, including the ribosomal rna unit, and have quantified the major satellite dna families.
