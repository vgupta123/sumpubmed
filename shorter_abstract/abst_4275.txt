to test the behavior of immobilized lipases, they were assayed in triolein transesterification, where the best results were observed for lipases immobilized on accurel mp <dig>
to reduce costs of eventual scaling-up, the new lipases were obtained directly from crude cell extracts or from growth culture supernatants, and immobilized by simple adsorption on accurel ep <dig>  accurel mp <dig> and celiteÂ® <dig>  the enzymes evaluated were lipa and lipc from pseudomonas sp.
best immobilization results were obtained on accurel ep <dig> for lipa and on accurel mp <dig> for lipc and its thermostable variant.
in this context, four non-commercial lipases from pseudomonas species were prepared, immobilized on different low-cost supports, and examined for potential biotechnological applications.
there is an increasing interest to seek new enzyme preparations for the development of new products derived from bioprocesses to obtain alternative bio-based materials.
the suggested protocol does not require protein purification and uses crude enzymes immobilized by a fast adsorption technique on low-cost supports, which makes the method suitable for an eventual scaling up aimed at biotechnological applications.
