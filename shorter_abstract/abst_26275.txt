the role of trehalose in resting-egg formation and survival remains unclear since there was no significant difference between resting-egg producing females and amictic females in the expression of the tps- <dig> gene.
these included genes associated with antioxidant activity, low molecular weight heat shock proteins and late embryonic abundant  proteins.
the survival of the population is ensured via the production of resting eggs that show a remarkable tolerance to unfavorable conditions and remain viable for decades.
four normalized and four subtractive libraries were constructed to provide a resource for rotifer transcriptomics associated with resting-egg formation, storage and hatching.
real-time pcr confirmed that lea transcripts, small heat-shock proteins and some antioxidant genes were upregulated in resting eggs, therefore suggesting that desiccation tolerance is a characteristic feature of resting eggs even though they do not necessarily fully desiccate during dormancy.
in view of the absence of vitellogenin transcripts, matches to lipoprotein lipase proteins suggest that, similar to the situation in dipterans, these proteins may serve as the yolk proteins in rotifers.
microscopic monogonont rotifers, including the euryhaline species brachionus plicatilis, are typically found in water bodies where environmental factors restrict population growth to short periods lasting days or months.
about 28â€“55%  of the clones produced significant matches against the swissprot and trembl databases.
the  <dig>  ests expand significantly the current sequence resource of b. plicatilis.
it describes, for the first time, genes putatively associated with resting eggs and will serve as a database for future global expression experiments, particularly for the further identification of dormancy related genes.
genes known to be associated with desiccation tolerance during dormancy in other organisms were identified in the est libraries.
