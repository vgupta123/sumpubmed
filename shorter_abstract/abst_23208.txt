experiments confirmed great ecophenotyic plasticity in some invasive populations, which, in combination with the overlap in disparity with native populations, masks invaders and their dispersal through africa.
the accumulation of invasive taxa in combination with other stressors in these ecosystems may alter the habitats to which native taxa are adapted, which could elicit evolutionary changes in native populations and their ecological interactions.
molecular phylogenetics and ancestral range reconstructions allowed us to identify several independent asian invasions in lakes malawi and tanganyika, the congo river, nigeria and cameroon.

assessing ecological and evolutionary consequences of invasions simultaneously may therefore be the most effective approach to study taxa with complex invasion histories.
finally, the results of geographic modeling indicate that cryptic m. tuberculata invasions occurred primarily in densely populated areas.
some invasive m. tuberculata populations display much variation in shell morphology, and overlap in morphospace with m. tuberculata populations native to africa.
several of the affected ecosystems have high endemicity in cerithioidea: lake tanganyika has an unparalleled diversity in freshwater cerithioids  and the congo basin and lake malawi are home to the two largest endemic species clusters of melanoides in africa .
we reveal the continental nature of invasions of asian m. tuberculata to africa.
non-indigenous taxa currently represent a large fraction of the species and biomass of freshwater ecosystems.
here we apply such an integrated approach to the cerithioid gastropod melanoides tuberculata, a model system in invasion biology.
