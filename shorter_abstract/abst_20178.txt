illustrations of the spatio-temporal development of such processes are not only used in biomedical education, but also can serve scientists as an additional platform for in-silico experiments.
we demonstrate the suitability of our approach in the context of several polymerization processes and report from a first evaluation with domain experts.
our approach of a complementary fusion of three systems combines the strong points from the different modeling approaches and is capable to bridge different spatial and temporal scales.
research in cell biology is steadily contributing new knowledge about many aspects of physiological processes, both with respect to the involved molecular structures as well as their related function.
in this paper, we contribute a new, three-level modeling approach to illustrate physiological processes from the class of polymerization at different time scales.
