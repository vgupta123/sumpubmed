using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and rt-pcr, we show that our method is suitable for studying and isolating proximal tubular cells with an anti prominin- <dig> antibody.
hundreds of thousands of proximal tubular cells are then isolated by magnetic separation followed by direct analysis or primary cell culture.
it is also a simple method to obtain a specific primary cell culture from any animal strain.
using our method, we detect phenotypic changes in the proximal tubular cells after renal ischemia reperfusion, and we isolate the proximal tubular cells, with a purity over 80%.
kidneys are subjected to mechanical dissociation followed by flow-cytometry analysis.

here, we describe a method for analyzing and isolating specific cell types from the kidney and studying the phenotype they have acquired in vivo.
experimental models are inevitably a compromise between accurately reproducing a pathological situation and schematically simplifying it, which is intended to provide both relevance and conclusiveness.
