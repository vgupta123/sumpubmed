interestingly, that gene displayed domain similarities to the receptor for egg jelly  protein involved in sperm-egg recognition in sea urchins.
surface receptors involved in fertilization are targets of sexual selection, reinforcement, and other evolutionary forces including positive selection.
evolutionary studies of genes that mediate recognition between sperm and egg contribute to our understanding of reproductive isolation and speciation.
selected genes were sequenced in a representative number of strains from distant geographical locations and varying stages of reproductive isolation, to search for signatures of adaptive evolution.
altogether, this gene could contribute to gamete interaction during reproduction as well as reproductive isolation in ectocarpus and is therefore a good candidate for further functional evaluation.
male gamete specific genes were identified by comparing transcriptome data covering different stages of the ectocarpus life cycle and screened for characteristics expected from gamete recognition receptors.
we have identified a male gamete specific gene with similarity to known gamete recognition receptors and signatures of adaptation.
this observation was made across different lineages of the eukaryotic tree from land plants to mammals, and is particularly evident in free-spawning animals.
one of the genes  showed evidence of selective pressure.
