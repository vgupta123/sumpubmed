we have successfully generated shrnas that knock down npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> in a neuronal cell line.
rnai is a powerful tool to knock down semaphorin receptor expression in neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo.
unexpectedly however, aav1-mediated expression of npn- <dig> shrnas and a control shrna in the red nucleus resulted in an adverse tissue response and neuronal degeneration.
the observed toxicity was dose dependent and was not seen with control gfp expressing aav vectors, implicating the shrnas as the causative toxic agents.
however, when shrnas are expressed at high levels in cns neurons, they trigger an adverse tissue response leading to neuronal degradation.
after a spinal cord lesion, axon regeneration is inhibited by the presence of a diversity of inhibitory molecules in the lesion environment.
