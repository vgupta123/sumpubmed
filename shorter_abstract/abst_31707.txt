we hypothesized that npe, evoked by cerebral hypoxia in the presence of systemic normoxia, would be accompanied by sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, and compensatory antioxidant mechanisms.
thirteen walker hounds were assigned to cerebral hypoxia  with systemic normoxia  , cerebral and systemic  hypoxia  , or cerebral and systemic normoxia  .
cerebral hypoxia, with systemic normoxia, is not systematically associated with an increase in oxidative stress and compensatory antioxidant enzymes in lung, suggesting oxidative stress did not contribute to npe in lung.

however, increased sns activity may play a role in the induction of npe during hypoxia.
expression of hemeoxygenase- <dig> in brain was higher in ch compared to gh and con, despite no group differences in oxidative damage in any tissue.
neurogenic pulmonary edema  is a non-cardiogenic form of pulmonary edema that can occur consequent to central neurologic insults including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and seizure.
lung wet to lung dry weight ratios  were assessed as an index of pulmonary edema in addition to hemodynamic measurements.
total glutathione, protein carbonyls, and malondialdehyde were assessed as indicators of oxidative stress.
plasma catecholamines were measured as markers of sympathetic nervous system  activity.
npe is a public health concern due to high morbidity and mortality, yet the mechanism are unknown.
