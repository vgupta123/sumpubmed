a bioinformatics infrastructure for data storage and access, and user-friendly web-based tool for analysis and sharing output is needed to make gs more practical for breeders.
genomic selection  promises to improve accuracy in estimating breeding values and genetic gain for quantitative traits compared to traditional breeding methods.

solgs enables breeders to store raw data and estimate gebvs of individuals online, in an intuitive and interactive workflow.
it has an intuitive web-interface for selecting a training population for modeling and estimating genomic estimated breeding values of selection candidates.
analysis output is graphically visualized and can be interactively explored online or downloaded in text format.
its reliance on high-throughput genome-wide markers and statistical complexity, however, is a serious challenge in data management, analysis, and sharing.
