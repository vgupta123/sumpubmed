two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  is a powerful technique for studying protein isoforms and their modifications.
we anticipate that the gel2de correlation software will be a useful tool for future bioinformatics discoveries through 2d gel electrophoresis.

2d immunoblot time course analysis of p <dig> protein stabilization in response to ionizing irradiation shows that pixel-by-pixel analysis can yield an overall activation biosignature for p <dig>  despite changing spots shape, size and position.
pixel-by-pixel correlation analysis, an analysis technique for identifying relations between protein patterns in gel images and external variables, can overcome such limitations in spot analysis.
we have implemented the first publically available pixel-by-pixel correlation analysis tool, the software gel2de.
pixel-by-pixel correlation of aligned 2d images permits analysis of complex protein patterns.
