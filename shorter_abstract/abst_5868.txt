in this case, the array data among k treatments tend to be correlated because of block effect.
we propose to use the blocked one-way anova f-statistic to test if each gene is differentially expressed among k treatments.
with fdr level and effect sizes of genes specified, our formula provides a sample size for a given number of true discoveries.
we propose a sample size calculation method for microarray experiments with a blocked one-way design.
the marginal p-values are calculated using a permutation method accounting for the block effect, adjusting for the multiplicity of the testing procedure by controlling the false discovery rate .
the calculated sample size is shown via simulations to provide an accurate number of true discoveries while controlling the fdr at the desired level.
one of the main objectives of microarray analysis is to identify differentially expressed genes for different types of cells or treatments.
