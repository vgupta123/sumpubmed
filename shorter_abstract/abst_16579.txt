sequencing technologies have different biases, in single-genome sequencing and metagenomic sequencing; these can significantly affect orfs recovery and the population distribution of a metagenome.
results show that biases against organisms of interest could be compensated combining different sequencing technologies, due to the differences of their genome-level sequencing biases even if the species was present in not very different abundances in the metagenomes.
in this paper we investigate how well different technologies represent information related to a considered organism of interest in a metagenome, and whether it is beneficial to combine information obtained using different technologies.
in each dataset, the abundance of the reads annotated to b. fulgida was much lower than the abundance expected from available cell count information.
nevertheless, by considering the union of b. fulgida reads over the three datasets, the number of b. fulgida orfs recovered for at least 80% of their length was twice the amount recovered by the best technology.
indeed, while taxonomic distributions of reads in the three datasets were similar, the respective sets of b. fulgida orfs recovered for a large part of their length were highly different, and depth of coverage patterns of  <dig> and sanger were dissimilar.
this was due to the overrepresentation of gc-richer organisms, as shown by gc-content distribution of the reads.
