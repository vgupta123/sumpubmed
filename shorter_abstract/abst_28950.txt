though fusarium proliferatum was recovered more often , it is pestalotiopsis microspora  that increased the absolute amounts  of vanillin , vanillyl alcohol , vanillic acid  and p-hydroxybenzoic acid  by significant amounts.
also, to establish their biotransformation abilities of flavor-related metabolites.
all plants studied contained endophytic fungi and the isolation of the endophytes was conducted from plant organs at nine sites in réunion island including under shade house and undergrowth conditions.
the objective of the work was to characterize fungal endophytes from aerial parts of vanilla planifolia.
fungi from green pods were cultured on mature green pod based media for 30 days followed by 1h nmr and hplc-dad analysis.
endophytic variation occured between cultivation practices and the type of organ.
