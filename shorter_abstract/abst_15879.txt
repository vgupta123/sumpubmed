limited numbers of studies are present to show etiological factors beyond this anomaly in turkish community belonging to caucasian racial family.
the ratio of gt haplotype is less in the hypodontia group meaning that the gt carriers are in risk group in terms of hypodontia risk.
the outcomes suggest that the individuals having ac haplotype carry less risk in having hypodontia compared with the rest of the haplotype groups .
these results indicate that polymorphisms in the promoter region of pax <dig> gene may have an influence on the transcriptional factors and activity of this gene and are associated with hypodontia in caucasian individuals.
the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between the two different single nucleotide polymorphisms that are g-1031a and t-912c with hypodontia in caucasians.
