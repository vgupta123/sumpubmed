the expression of the tyrs gene present in the tdc cluster of e. durans is transcriptionally regulated by tyrosine concentration and extracelular ph.
mapping of the tyrs transcriptional start site revealed an unusually long untranslated leader region of  <dig> bp, which displays the typical features of the t box transcriptional attenuation mechanism.
the tyrosine concentration regulation of tyrs was found to be mediated by a transcription antitermination system, whereas the specific induction at acidic ph was regulated at transcription initiation level.
the tyramine producer enterococcus durans ipla <dig> contains all the necessary genes for tyramine biosynthesis, grouped in the tdc cluster.
this work shows that tyrs was maximally transcribed in absence of tyrosine at acidic ph, showing a greater than 10-fold induction in mrna levels over levels occurring in presence of tyrosine.
the regulation is mediated by both an antitermination system and the promoter itself.
