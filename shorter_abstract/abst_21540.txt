a new anatoxin-a-producing member of the nostocaceae, anabaena sp.
wa <dig> encodes anatoxin-a biosynthetic genes, as does its close relative anabaena sp.
these strains are distinguished by differences in the genes for light-harvesting phycobilins, with anabaena sp.
biologically relevant structural variants in the anabaena sp.
strikingly, there was no synteny with the genome of its nearest fully assembled relative, anabaena sp.
structural and functional genome analyses indicate that anabaena sp.
wa <dig> genome were detected only by long-read sequencing: a tandem triplication of the anabcd promoter region in the anatoxin-a synthase gene cluster  and a 5-kbp deletion variant present in two-thirds of the population.
the closed and draft genome assemblies are compared, showing a correlation between long repeats in the genome and the many gaps in the short-read assembly.
wa <dig>  <dig>  mbp genome assembly has been closed with long-read, single-molecule sequencing and separately a draft genome assembly has been produced with short-read sequencing technology.
the genome has a large number of mobile elements .
wa <dig>  was isolated from a freshwater lake in washington state, usa, in  <dig> and maintained in non-axenic culture.
