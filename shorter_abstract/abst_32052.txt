this survey was undertaken to update an earlier postal survey in  <dig>  and was the first occasion in which a large-scale postal survey had been repeated.
finally, within-flock transmission following exposure was more likely to occur in hill flocks compared to other farm types; in flocks which bred a greater proportion of replacement animals; and in farms which kept a certain crossbreed of ewe.
the risk factors identified from the  <dig> and  <dig> anonymous postal surveys in great britain were similar.
in november  <dig>  an anonymous postal survey of sheep farmers in great britain  was conducted to identify factors associated with the flock-level occurrence of scrapie.
the results of the  <dig> survey indicated that scrapie was more likely to occur in certain geographic regions; in purebred compared to commercial flocks; in larger flocks; in flocks which lambed in group pens compared to those which lambed in individual pens; in flocks which always lambed in the same location compared to those which did not; and in farms which kept certain breeds of sheep.
in addition to these factors, the likelihood of the disease occurring in homebred animals was higher in flocks which bred a greater proportion of replacement animals or which bought-in lambs.
these differences are most likely a consequence of changes in farmer awareness and the impact of the  <dig> foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, respectively.
