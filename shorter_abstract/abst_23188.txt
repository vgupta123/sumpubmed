the anatomical structure of the natural vital hypsodont tooth must be kept in mind, so that the findings of this study do not create a deceptive sense of security with regard to the time-dependent heating of the native pulp.
the data obtained showed that doubling the rotational speed of the disk results in halving the time span after which the critical intra-pulp temperature increase in maxillary ct is reached.
during grinding experiments, imitating real dental treatments, the time span for an intra-pulp temperature increase of  <dig> °c was determined.
for mandibular ct, the time span even drops by two thirds.
the minimum time recorded for an intra-pulp temperature increase of  <dig> °c was 38 s in mandibular ct  and 70 s in maxillary ct .
the use of standardized hypsodont ct enabled comparative studies of intra-pulp heating during the grinding of occlusal tooth surfaces using different tools and techniques.
hence, the capability to continuously form secondary dentine is lost, and may lead, due to equine-typical occlusal tooth abrasion, to an opening of the pulp cavity.
