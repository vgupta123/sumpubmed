x-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a disorder characterized by abnormal development of tissues and organs of ectodermal origin caused by mutations in the eda gene.
the mutation determines the deletion of the entire exon  in the rna processing, causing a severe alteration of the protein structure and thus the disease.
the bovine eda gene encodes the ectodysplasin a, a membrane protein expressed in keratinocytes, hair follicles and sweat glands, which is involved in the interactions between cell and cell and/or cell and matrix.
we identified a new single nucleotide polymorphism  at the 9th base of exon  <dig> in the eda gene in two calves of holstein friesian cattle breed affected by ectodermal dysplasia.
we identified a mutation, never described before, that changes the regulation of alternative splicing in the eda gene and causes ectodermal dysplasia in cattle.
four mutations causing ectodermal dysplasia in cattle have been described so far.
