more importantly, similar results were also observed in cells transfected with this set of  <dig> r cdnas.
our study is the first demonstration of an internal ribosome entry site as a mechanism ensuring the production of  <dig> kda isoforms of protein  <dig> r. this mechanism might also account for the generation of  <dig> kda isoforms of  <dig> r from a downstream aug <dig>  our results reveal an additional level of control to  <dig> r gene expression pathways and will contribute to the understanding of the biology of proteins  <dig> r and their homologues, comprising an ample family of proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization.
while the expression pattern of  <dig> r in mature red cells is relatively simple, a rather complex array of  <dig> r protein isoforms varying in n-terminal extensions, internal sequences and subcellular locations has been identified in nucleated cells.
by analyzing the in vitro expression of a panel of naturally occurring  <dig> r cdnas, we observed that all aug1/aug2-containing cdnas gave rise to both long,  <dig> kda, and short,  <dig> kda,  <dig> r isoforms.
among these,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda isoforms have different n-terminal extensions and are expressed either from aug1- or aug2-containing mrnas, respectively.
mutational studies indicated that the short isoforms were not proteolytic products of the long isoforms but products synthesized from aug <dig>  the presence of a cryptic promoter in the  <dig> r cdna sequence was also discounted.
in red blood cells, protein  <dig>   is an  <dig> kda protein that stabilizes the spectrin-actin network and anchors it to the plasma membrane through its ferm domain.
when a  <dig> nt sequence comprised between aug <dig> and aug <dig> was introduced into bicistronic vectors it directed protein expression from the second cistron.
