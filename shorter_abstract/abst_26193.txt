body-weight normalized pvf , lr , vi  and pvp  were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs.
asi of lr and vi were higher in the forelimbs than in the hind limbs.
velocity clearly influences npvf, nlr and npvp, and all kinetic variables have higher values in forelimbs than in hind limbs.
four kinetic parameters were recorded for all four limbs: peak vertical force , load rate , vertical impulse  and peak vertical pressure .
however, these variables present a significant variability between-session, which may be due to conformational changes of the young, growing piglets.
in this study, a pressure mat was used to establish baseline kinetic data for gait and its longitudinal development in growing, weaned piglets.
ten clinically healthy weaned piglets were trained to trot over a pressure mat.
kinetic pressure mat measurements from healthy weaned piglets are highly replicable within-session.
the present study supports the use of a pressure mat as an objective way to analyze and quantify porcine gait.
