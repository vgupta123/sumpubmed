incorrect attachments of kinetochore microtubules  lead to chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, which is often associated with developmental abnormalities such as down syndrome and diseases including cancer.
with the right balance, incorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented conformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors.
the interaction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with frequent attachments and detachments.
for faithful chromosome segregation during cell division, correct attachments must be established between sister chromosomes and microtubules from opposite spindle poles through kinetochores .
to gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a simple mathematical model of kinetochore–microtubule interactions during cell division in general, i.e.
however, it remains unclear how chromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic process.
firstly, the model reveals that the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kmts is crucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation.
the model reveals that chromosome bi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organisation, rather than a sophisticated process of error detection and correction.
in addition, the model explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division  than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle assembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.
the proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand one of the primary causes of chromosomal instability—aberrant kinetochore–microtubule interactions.
