we found three cases in which the human-specific isoform conferred novel molecular function in the human cells: the human-specific imup protein isoform induces apoptosis of the trophoblast and is implicated in pre-eclampsia; the intronization of a part of smox gene exon produces inactive spermine oxidase; the human-specific nub <dig> isoform shows reduced interaction with ubiquitin-like proteins, possibly affecting ubiquitin pathways.
here, we analyzed annotated human protein-coding exons and identified human-specific splice sites that arose after the human-chimpanzee divergence.
many novel splice sites are derived from repetitive elements and may not contribute to protein products.
evolution of splice sites is a well-known phenomenon that results in transcript diversity during human evolution.
we analyzed multiple alignments of the annotated human protein-coding exons and their respective orthologous mammalian genome sequences to identify  <dig> novel splice sites  in the human genome.
although the generation of novel protein isoforms does not equate to adaptive evolution, we propose that these cases are useful candidates for a molecular functional study to identify proteomic changes that might bring about novel phenotypes during human evolution.
