there is a correlation between the number of proliferating cells and the number of cells of neuronal lineage  and the number of pyknotic cells , respectively.
since it is not known whether cell proliferation and neurogenesis in wild living mice can be experimentally changed, this study investigates the responsiveness of ahn to voluntary running and to environmental change in wild caught long-tailed wood mice .
here, we demonstrate that voluntary running and environmental changes which are effective in house mice and brown rats cannot influence ahn in long-tailed wood mice.
this indicates that in wild long-tailed wood mice different regulatory mechanisms act on cell proliferation and neurogenesis.
statistical analyses show that running had no impact on cell proliferation , neurogenesis  or survival of newly born neurons .
plasticity of adult neurogenesis is an established feature in strains of house mice and brown rats.
studies of adult hippocampal neurogenesis  in laboratory rodents have raised hopes for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders, as ahn can be modulated by physical exercise, stress and environmental changes in these animals.
