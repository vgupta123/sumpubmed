using the information from trypanosomatids proteomes, we developed a pipeline for the identification, characterization and analysis of idps.
our results indicate that idps in trypanosomatids contain disorder-promoting amino acids and order-promoting amino acids.
the exploratory data analysis allowed us to develop hypotheses regarding the idpsâ€™ association with key biological features of these parasites, including transcription and transcriptional regulation, rna processing and splicing, and cytoskeleton.
interestingly, all significant associations detected in the contingency analysis were observed when the protein disorder content reached approximately 40%.
the results obtained from the idp pipeline showed that leishmania and trypanosoma species have approximately 70% and 55% idps, respectively.
because there is no pipeline or database addressing idps in trypanosomatids, the pipeline described here represents the first attempt to establish possible correlations between protein function and structural disorder in these eukaryotes.
a relevant association was observed between the disordered residue numbers within predicted idps and their subcellular location, lack of transmembrane domains and lack of predicted function.
at the core of the idp pipeline, there is a relational database that describes the protein disorder knowledge in a logically consistent manner.
