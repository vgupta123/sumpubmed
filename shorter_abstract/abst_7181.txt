genetic algorithms , consume enormous computational time because they require iterative numerical integrations for differential equations.
rbfn reduce the number of numerical integrations by replacing derivatives with slopes derived from the distribution of searching points.
in addition, we adopted logarithmic transformation that smoothes the fitness surface to obtain a solution simply.
when the target model is stiff, the computational time for reaching a solution increases further.
conventional global optimization methods used for parameter estimation, e.g.
in an attempt to solve this problem, we explored a learning technique that uses radial basis function networks  to achieve a parameter estimation for biochemical models.
in this work, our rbfn technique was effective for parameter optimization of stiff biochemical models.
we conducted numerical experiments to validate our methods and compared the results with those obtained by ga. we found that the calculation time decreased by more than 50% and the convergence rate increased from 60% to 90%.
the modeling of dynamic systems requires estimating kinetic parameters from experimentally measured time-courses.
to introduce a slight search bias, we implemented additional data selection using a ga that searches data-sparse areas at low computational cost.
