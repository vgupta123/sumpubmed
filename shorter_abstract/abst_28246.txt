we further focused on genes not represented on the microarray and candidates for the regulation of the target genes belonging to cluster- <dig> and - <dig> and involved in lipid metabolism.
further studies are needed to precise their role in the complex regulatory network controlling lipid metabolism.
after  <dig> h of fasting, genes involved in ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial or peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, were up-regulated  whereas genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis were down-regulated .
for all genes tested, the microarray data was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr.
gene ontology, kegg and ingenuity databases were then used to identify the metabolic processes associated to each cluster.
the present study aimed to describe the evolution of global gene expression profiles in liver of 4-week-old male chickens during a  <dig> h fasting period using a chicken  <dig> k oligoarray.
starvation triggers a complex array of adaptative metabolic responses including energy-metabolic responses, a process which must imply tissue specific alterations in gene expression and in which the liver plays a central role.
the central role of lipid and acetyl-coa metabolisms and its regulation at transcriptional level are confirmed in chicken liver in response to short-term fasting.
this study evidences numerous genes altered by starvation in chickens and suggests a global repression of cellular activity in response to this stressor.
a large number of genes were modulated by fasting ;  <dig> showed an amplitude of variation higher than +/- 40% among those,  <dig> presented an human ortholog, allowing to collect functional information.
a notable exception was the hmg-coa synthase  <dig> gene, which was up-regulated following  <dig> and  <dig> h of fasting while the other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were down-regulated as reported in mammalian studies.
