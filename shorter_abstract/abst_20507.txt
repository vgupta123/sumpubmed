centibin  is a tool for the computation and exploration of centralities in biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks.
the elucidation of whole-cell regulatory, metabolic, interaction and other biological networks generates the need for a meaningful ranking of network elements.
central elements of biological networks have been found to be, for example, essential for viability.
it supports different input formats, especially for biological networks, and the export of the computed centralities to other tools.
centibin helps systems biology researchers to identify crucial elements of biological networks.
centibin is available in two different versions: a java web start application and an installable windows application.
centibin supports the exploration of the centrality distribution by visualising central elements within the network and provides several layout mechanisms for the automatic generation of graphical representations of a network.
centrality analysis ranks network elements according to their importance within the network structure and different centrality measures focus on different importance concepts.
centibin including a user guide and example data sets is available free of charge at .
it computes  <dig> different centralities for directed or undirected networks, ranging from local measures, that is, measures that only consider the direct neighbourhood of a network element, to global measures.
