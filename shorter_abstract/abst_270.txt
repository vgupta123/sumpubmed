bioactive components isolated from natural dcxc possess a wide range of pharmacological actions.
bacterial and fungal communities were more diverse in the environmental sample than in the natural dcxc sample.
many efforts have been directed towards isolating the fungi based on culture-dependent methods for investigation of fungal diversity in order to determine the anamorph of natural dcxc and find new medicinal fungi resources, and the results have been varied.
the main bacterial groups were proteobacteria, acidobacteria, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria and firmicutes, while the ascomycota, basidiomycota and zygomycota were the main fungal phyla.
this study revealed an abundant endogenetic fungal and bacterial resources and a variety of genetic information in natural dcxc by high-throughput  <dig> sequencing technology.
proteobacteria presented  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of all bacteria in the sclerotia, stromata, external mycelial cortices and soil, respectively.
as the main fungi phyla, ascomycota presented  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the sclerotia, stromata, external mycelial cortices and soil, respectively.
microorganism that had been discovered in natural dcxc will provide sources for screening the new bioactive metabolites and its biotechnological application.
in the present study, a total of  <dig>  bacterial and  <dig>  fungal sequences corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig> putative operational taxonomic units  were respectively identified by a roche/454-based, high throughput sequence analysis of 16s rrna genes and its regions.
microbial communities were obviously distinct in each sample.
