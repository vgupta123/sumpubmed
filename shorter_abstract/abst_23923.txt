we found that in d. melanogaster the average nighttime sleep bout duration exhibits a latitudinal cline such that sleep bouts of equatorial populations are roughly twice as long as those of temperate populations.
drosophila melanogaster often shows correlations between latitude and phenotypic or genetic variation on different continents, which suggests local adaptation with respect to a heterogeneous environment.
we also found evidence for geographic variation for sunrise anticipation.
here, we studied latitudinal variation in sleep in d. melanogaster populations from north and central america.
in parallel, we used rna-seq to identify interpopulation gene expression differences.
our rna-seq experiment carried out on heads from a low and high latitude population identified a large number of gene expression differences, most of which were time dependent.
our results are consistent with a mechanistic and selective decoupling of nighttime and daytime activity.
previous phenotypic analyses of latitudinal clines have investigated mainly physiological, morphological, or life-history traits.

furthermore, the present study suggests that natural selection plays a major role in generating transcriptomic variation associated with circadian behaviors.
