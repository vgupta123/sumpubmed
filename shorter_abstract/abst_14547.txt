for comparison, sequences of c. abortus, c. psittaci, c. caviae, c. felis, c. pecorum , c. muridarum  and of candidatus protochlamydia and simkania negevensis were also included.
cluster analyses of concatenated sequences of the chlamydophila and chlamydia species together with those of candidatus protochlamydia amoebophila and simkania negevensis resulted in a tree identical to that obtained with 23s rna gene sequences.
the difference in genetic diversity between c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae is in concordance with a later assimilation to the human host of the latter.
the lgv strains grouped in a single cluster, while the urogenital strains were distributed over two separated groups, one consisted solely of strains with frequent occurring serovars .
a collection of  <dig> strains of c. trachomatis of different serovars and clinical presentation and  <dig> strains of c. pneumoniae were included in the study.
analysis of allelic profiles by eburst revealed three non-overlapping clonal complexes among the c. trachomatis strains, while the c. pneumoniae strains formed a single group.
these data show that c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae are highly uniform.
an upgma tree produced from the allelic profiles resulted in three groups of sequence types.
the distribution of the different serovars over the three groups was not consistent, suggesting exchange of serovar encoding ompa sequences.
the obligate intracellular growing bacterium chlamydia trachomatis causes diseases like trachoma, urogenital infection and lymphogranuloma venereum with severe morbidity.
the related chlamydophila pneumoniae, of which no subtypes are recognized, causes respiratory infections worldwide.
in one instance, exchange of fumc sequences between strains of different groups was observed.
