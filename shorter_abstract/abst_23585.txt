in addition, natural elf <dig> alleles seem to differentially integrate temperature and photoperiod information to induce architectural changes.
we identified giraffe <dig> , a major qtl explaining ~18 % of the phenotypic variation for temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation in the bay- <dig> x sha recombinant inbred line population.
the source of variation could be allocated to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the elf <dig> coding region, resulting in differential expression of pif <dig> and its target genes, likely causing the observed natural variation in thermo-responsive growth.
perception and transduction of temperature changes result in altered growth enabling plants to adapt to increased ambient temperature.
while phytochrome-interacting factor <dig>  has been identified as a major ambient temperature signaling hub, its upstream regulation seems complex and is poorly understood.
in combination with other recent studies, this work establishes the role of elf <dig> in the ambient temperature signaling network.

here, we exploited natural variation for thermo-responsive growth in arabidopsis thaliana using quantitative trait locus  analysis.
natural variation of elf3-mediated gating of pif <dig> expression during nightly growing periods seems to be affected by a coding sequence quantitative trait nucleotide that confers a selective advantage in certain environments.
transgenic complementation demonstrated that allelic variation in the circadian clock regulator early flowering <dig>  is underlying this qtl.
