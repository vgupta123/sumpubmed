cluster iv contained all isolates from group b <dig> and cluster iv isolates had the strongest pathogenicity in a mouse infection model.
here, we investigated the virulence genotypes and clonal structure of collected strains to improve the knowledge of phylogenetic traits of porcine expecs in china.
as phylogenetic group b <dig> and d expec isolates are generally considered virulent, multilocus sequence typing  analysis was performed for these isolates to further investigate genetic relationships.
this study reveals significant genetic diversity among expec isolates and helps us to better understand their pathogenesis.

among the nine clonal complexes identified among our group b <dig> and d isolates, cc <dig> and cc <dig> have been indicated to have high zoonotic pathogenicity.
the distinction between group b <dig> and non-b <dig> isolates in virulence and genotype accorded with mlst analysis.
