it is found that gfs outperforms other transformation techniques in all three aspects.
gene expression data produced on high-throughput platforms such as microarrays is susceptible to much variation that obscures useful biological information.
however, it is known that standard normalization methods perform poorly, specially in the presence of substantial batch effects and heterogeneity in gene expression data.
our approach to preprocessing is a stronger alternative to popular normalization techniques.

using four sets of publicly available datasets containing batch effects and heterogeneity, we compare gfs with three standard normalization techniques as well as raw gene expression.
each method is evaluated with respect to the quality, consistency, and biological coherence of its processed output.
we demonstrate that it achieves the essential goal of preprocessing – it is effective at making expression values from multiple samples comparable, even when they are from separate platforms, in independent batches, or belong to a heterogeneous phenotype.
