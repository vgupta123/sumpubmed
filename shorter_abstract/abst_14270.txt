a consistent model can be exported to sbml or copasi formats.
this reduces the cognitive load for a given model, thereby making it easier for modelers to build more complex models.
this reduces the number of reactions needed to represent certain molecular systems, thereby reducing the complexity of model creation.
extensive feedback is given during all stages of the model creation process on the existing state of the model.
the many interactive editing support features provided by msmb make it easier for modelers to create syntactically valid models, thus speeding model creation.
we show the effectiveness of msmb’s multistate syntax through models of the cell cycle and mrna transcription.
a simple but powerful syntax is used to describe multistate species.
writing a model is a creative effort that calls for more flexibility and interactive support than offered by many of today’s biochemical model editors.
