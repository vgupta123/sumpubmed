effective transformation of recombinant dna into these bacteria constitutes a critical step of such efforts.
adding donor dna to t. sp.
both t. neapolitana chromosomal dna and thermotoga-e. coli shuttle vectors effectively transformed t. sp.
with the optimized method, t. sp.
strain rq <dig> sustained a transformation frequency in the order of 10- <dig> with both genomic and plasmid dna.
both chromosomal dna and plasmid dna serve as suitable substrates for transformation.
the kan gene carried by the shuttle vector pdh <dig> was detected by pcr from the plasmid extract of the transformants, and the amplicons were verified by restriction digestions.
a procedure for natural transformation of thermotoga spp.
our findings lend a convenient technical tool for the genetic engineering of thermotoga spp.
this study aims to establish natural competency in thermotoga spp.
foreign dna was found to be relatively stable in the supernatant of a thermotoga culture for up to 6Â hours.
thermotoga species are organisms of enormous interest from a biotechnological as well as evolutionary point of view.
