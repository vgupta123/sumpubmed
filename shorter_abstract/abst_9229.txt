our results showed that two fragments of gst, named f <dig> peptide  and f <dig> peptide , can significantly inhibit the gst activity.
therefore, it appears to be important to find new gst inhibitors to prevent the resistance of cells to anticancer drugs.
when these two fragments were compared with several known potent gst inhibitors, the order of inhibition efficiency  and glutathione as substrates) was determined as follows: tannic acid > cibacron blue > f <dig> peptide > hematin > f <dig> peptide > ethacrynic acid.
in order to search for glutathione transferase  inhibitors, a novel method was designed.
it is proposed that the novel method, described in this report, might be useful for screening the inhibitors of not only gst but also other enzymes.
