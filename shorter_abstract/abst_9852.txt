identifying these genes, while simultaneously controlling false positives, is challenging.
among available statistical methods, the mixed linear model  has been the most flexible and powerful for controlling population structure and individual unequal relatedness , the two common causes of spurious associations.
this study introduces another model parameter to develop an enriched cmlm .
the inheritance of most human diseases and agriculturally important traits is controlled by many genes with small effects.
simulations show that the ecmlm increases statistical power.
