snp locus outliers detected by a combined forward genetics and population genetics approach can provide markers with utility for the conservation of wild accessions and for trait improvement in the cultivated genepool.
two of the snp locus outliers were associated with testa color.
of these,  <dig> related to selection during domestication, while the other  <dig> likely gradually became monomorphic as a result of prolonged selection during post domestication.
