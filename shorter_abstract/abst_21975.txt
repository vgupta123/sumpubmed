interestingly, a large proportion of predicted redundant gene pairs were relatively old duplications , suggesting that redundancy is stable over long evolutionary periods.
in withholding analysis, one of the methods used here, support vector machines, was two-fold more precise than single attribute classifiers, reaching a level where the majority of redundant calls were correctly labeled.
methods to increase sensitivity in identifying genetic redundancy can improve the efficiency of reverse genetics and lend insights into the evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication.
gene duplication can lead to genetic redundancy, which masks the function of mutated genes in genetic analyses.
machine learning techniques that combine multiple attributes led to a dramatic improvement in predicting genetic redundancy over single trait classifiers alone, such as blast e-values or expression correlation.
machine learning techniques are well suited to classifying gene family members into redundant and non-redundant gene pairs in model species where sufficient genetic and genomic data is available, such as arabidopsis thaliana, the test case used here.
the predictions and gene pair attributes for arabidopsis provide a new resource for research in genetics and genome evolution.
machine learning predicts that most genes will have a functionally redundant paralog but will exhibit redundancy with relatively few genes within a family.
