further, the required fold increases in sensitivity are within experimental ranges from experiments that use ip3r <dig> phosphorylation status to adjust its sensitivity to ip <dig>  results from our simulations of polyglutamine scas suggest that downregulation of some calcium signaling proteins may be partially compensatory.
on the other hand, in mouse models of the human polyglutamine  ataxias, sca <dig>  and sca <dig>  the primary finding appears to be hyperactive ip3r1-mediated calcium release.
specifically, the model has been used to investigate sca15/ <dig>  sca <dig>  sca <dig>  and sca <dig>  results suggest that experimental studies treating mouse models of any of these ataxias with appropriately chosen peptides resembling the c-terminal of ip3r <dig> could adjust receptor sensitivity, and thereby modulate calcium release and normalize ip <dig> response.
finally, our model suggests that the calcium-activated voltage-gated potassium channels may provide an important link between calcium metabolism and membrane potential in purkinje cell function.
we create a computational model of pathological alterations in calcium signaling in cerebellar purkinje neurons to investigate several forms of spinocerebellar ataxia associated with changes in the abundance, sensitivity, or activity of the calcium channel ip3r <dig>  we find that increasing ip3r <dig> sensitivity to ip <dig> in computational models of sca15/ <dig> can restore normal calcium response if ip3r <dig> abundance is not too low.
we posit that increasing ip3r <dig> sensitivity to ip <dig> in ataxias with reduced ip3r <dig> could restore normal calcium response.
it has been suggested that the polyq sca <dig> mice may also show hyperactive ip3r <dig>  yet, sca <dig> mice show downregulated gene expression of ip3r <dig>  homer, metabotropic glutamate receptor , smooth endoplasmic reticulum ca-atp-ase , calbindin, parvalbumin, and other calcium signaling proteins.
however, the downregulation of calcium buffer proteins observed in the sca <dig> mice may contribute to pathology.
