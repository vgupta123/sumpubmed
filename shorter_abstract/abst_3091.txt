of the  <dig> measures evaluated, the likelihood ratio and normalized mutual information  are measures that consistently improve the detection and power of mdr in simulated data over using classification error.
we simulated  <dig> genetic models, varying the number of disease loci in the model , allele frequencies of the disease loci  and the broad-sense heritability of the model .
mdr performs a dimensional reduction by assigning multi-locus genotypes to either high- or low-risk groups and measuring the percentage of cases and controls incorrectly labelled by this classification â€“ the classification error.
these measures also reduce the inclusion of spurious variables in a multi-locus model.
multifactor dimensionality reduction  has been introduced previously as a non-parametric statistical method for detecting gene-gene interactions.
overall, detection using nmi was  <dig> % across all models, and specific detection was  <dig> % versus detection using classification error at 62% and specific detection was  <dig> %.
the correctly and incorrectly labelled cases and controls can be expressed as a two-way contingency table.
in this study, we compare the detection and power of mdr using a variety of measures for two-way contingency table analysis.
we sought to improve the ability of mdr to detect gene-gene interactions by replacing classification error with a different measure to score model quality.
