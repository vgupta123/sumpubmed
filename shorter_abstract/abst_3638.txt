inference of protein interaction networks from various sources of data has become an important topic of both systems and computational biology.
as a data source, the method utilizes gene expression time series for prediction of interactions among regulatory proteins and their target genes.
the results were compared with independent data sources.
results show that our algorithm gives, in most cases, results identical with the independent experiments, when compared with the yeastract database.
