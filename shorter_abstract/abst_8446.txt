analysis of gene expression patterns of lifecycle in b. malayi has provided novel insights into the biology of filarial parasites.
the results also indicate that genes with similar transcription patterns were often involved in similar functions or cellular processes.
brugia malayi is a nematode parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis, a disfiguring and disabiling tropical disease.
we also used pair-wise comparisons to identify transcriptional changes between life cycle stages and sexes.
although a first draft genome sequence was released in  <dig>  very little is understood about transcription programs that govern developmental changes required for the parasiteâ€™s development and survival in its mammalian and insect hosts.
approximately 41% of transcripts with detectable expression signals were differentially expressed across lifecycle stages.
k-means clustering of differentially expressed transcripts revealed five major transcription patterns that were associated with parasite lifecycle stages or gender.
we used a microarray with probes that represent some 85% of predicted genes to generate gene expression profiles for seven parasite life cycle stages/sexes.
examination of known stage-associated transcripts validated these data sets and suggested that newly identified stage or gender-associated transcripts may exercise biological functions in development and reproduction.
