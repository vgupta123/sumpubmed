hsp <dig> family members underwent multiple duplications and also subsequent losses during their evolution.
mitochondrial trap and endoplasmic reticulum hsp90b separately originated from the ancestors of htpg group a in firmicutes-like organisms very early in the formation of the eukaryotic cell.
the proeukaryote hsp <dig> homologue, htpg, exists in most bacteria species but not in archaea, and it evolved into three lineages  via two gene duplication events.
the conserved regions across all protein sequences, and signature sequences in each subfamily were determined, and a standardized nomenclature system for this gene family is presented.
this study established an overall framework of information for the family of genes, which may facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across all organisms.
hsp <dig> proteins are essential molecular chaperones involved in signal transduction, cell cycle control, stress management, and folding, degradation, and transport of proteins.
the present study presents the first comparative genomic study and evolutionary analysis of the hsp <dig> family of genes across all kingdoms of organisms.
the chromosomal location, exon splicing, and prediction of whether they are functional copies were documented, as well as the amino acid length and molecular mass of their polypeptides.
