at last, we found some non-synonymous mutations in the genes participating in homogentisate pathway or working as regulators of penicillin biosynthesis.
these findings demonstrate the potential information for insights into the high-penicillin yielding mechanism and metabolic engineering in the future.
to reveal more insights into the genome structural variations of high-penicillin producing strain, we sequenced an industrial strain p. chrysogenum ncpc <dig>  by whole genome comparative analysis, we observed a large number of mutations, insertions and deletions, and structural variations.
therefore, genome sequencing of a high-penicillin producing industrial strain is very meaningful.
there are  <dig> new genes that not exist in the genome sequence of wisconsin54- <dig> and some of them are involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism.
the genomic variations we discovered are related with energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and so on.
most importantly, we discovered a  <dig>  kb "new shift fragment" in a seven copies of determinative penicillin biosynthesis cluster in ncpc <dig> and the arrangement type of amplified region is unique.
we provided the first high-quality genome sequence of industrial high-penicillin strain of p. chrysogenum and carried out a comparative genome analysis with a low-producing experimental strain.
moreover, we presented two large-scale translocations in ncpc <dig>  containing genes involved energy, nitrogen metabolism and peroxysome pathway.
through classical mutagenesis of wisconsin54- <dig>  product titers and productivities of penicillin have dramatically increased, but what underlying genome structural variations is still little known.
