we recently demonstrated that s strains have defective iron storage systems, leading us to propose that these strains might experience iron toxicity when excess iron is provided in the medium.
taken together, our study revealed that c and s strains of map utilize divergent metabolic pathways to accommodate in vitro iron stress.
paratuberculosis  exist - s and c map strains that primarily infect sheep and cattle, respectively.
two genotypically and microbiologically distinct strains of mycobacterium avium subsp.
under iron-replete conditions, c strain upregulated iron storage , virulence associated , and ribosomal proteins.
the iron-sparing response to iron limitation was unique to the c strain as evidenced by repression of non-essential iron utilization enzymes  and upregulation of proteins of essential function .
we first complemented m. smegmatisÎ”ider with ider of c map or that derived from s map and compared their transcription profiles using m. smegmatis mc <dig> microarrays.
in the presence of iron, sider repressed expression of bfra and map2073c, a ferritin domain containing protein suggesting that transcriptional control of iron storage may be defective in s strain.
in striking contrast, s strain downregulated these proteins under iron-replete conditions.
we next performed transcriptional and proteomic profiling of the two strain types of map under iron-deplete and -replete conditions.
two of these were upregulated by a c map strain in response to iron supplementation.
to test this hypothesis, we carried out transcriptional and proteomic profiling of these map strains under iron-replete or -deplete conditions.
the knowledge of the metabolic pathways these divergent responses play a role in are important to 1) advance our ability to culture the two different strains of map efficiently, 2) aid in diagnosis and control of johne's disease, and 3) advance our understanding of map virulence.
