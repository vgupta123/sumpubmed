provision of such data would enable the resolution of a debate regarding the formation of the hypaxial dermomyotome.
therefore, despite being under independent signalling controls, both the dorsomedial and ventrolateral lip fulfil the same function, i.e.
our study demonstrates that the dermomyotome ventrolateral lip is essential for the hypaxial myotome formation and supports the lip extension model.
they extend into adjacent regions permitting the growth of the myotome.
the myotome is the primitive skeletal muscle that forms within the embryonic metameric body wall.
although the ventrolateral lip  of the dermomyotome is believed to be required for the formation of the hypaxial myotome, experimentally evidence for this statement still needs to be provided.
we found that the hypaxial myotome did not form after vll ablation.
in contrast, the removal of an intermediate portion of the dermomyotome had very little effect of the hypaxial myotome.
these results demonstrate that the vll is required for the formation of the hypaxial myotome.
it can be subdivided into an epaxial and hypaxial domain.
it has been shown that the formation of the epaxial myotome requires the dorsomedial lip of the dermomyotome .
the first proposes that the intermediate dermomyotome undergoes cellular expansion thereby pushing the ventral lateral lip in a lateral direction .
using time lapse confocal microscopy, we observed that the gfp-labelled ventrolateral lip  of the dermomyotome grows rather than translocates in a lateral direction.
