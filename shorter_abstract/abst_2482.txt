neuroanatomical studies in cerebral cortex of rtt mouse models revealed delayed maturation of neuronal morphology and autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous reduction in dendritic complexity of postnatal cortical neurons.
however, both morphometric parameters and high-resolution expression profile of cortical neurons at embryonic developmental stage have not yet been studied.
we show that embryonic primary cortical neurons of mecp <dig> null mice display reduced neurite complexity possibly reflecting transcriptional changes.

our results support the need to investigate both mecp <dig> morphological as well as molecular effect in neurons since prenatal developmental stage, long time before onset of rett symptoms.
here we address these topics by using embryonic neuronal primary cultures from mecp <dig> loss of function mouse model.
