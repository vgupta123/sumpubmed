the same analysis showed that bcg mexico  <dig> shares 62% of its protein spots with the bcg danish strain, 61% with the bcg phipps strain and only 48% with the bcg tokyo strain.
in addition, this strain contains three new rds, which are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp  long, and  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing non-synonymous mutations compared to bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo.
bcg mexico  <dig> has a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with a g+c content and numbers of genes and pseudogenes similar to those of bcg tokyo and bcg pasteur.
bcg mexico  <dig> has a smaller genome than the bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo strains.
studies of mycobacterium bovis bcg strains used in different countries and vaccination programs show clear variations in the genomes and immune protective properties of bcg strains.
two specific deletions in bcg mexico  <dig> are described .
