the rice genus  contains many wild genetic resources that are vital to the well-being of humans.
the rice genus provides an excellent case supporting the idea that range expansion and invasion of novel habitats can drive the diversification of a group.
here, we integrated the phylogenetic, molecular dating and biogeographic methods to investigate the spatial-temporal patterns of oryza diversification, and used a series of model tests to examine whether intercontinental migrations and/or key innovations were associated with significant changes in diversification rates in the genus.
we inferred at least  <dig> migration events out of tropical asia since the pleistocene, mainly involving the species adapting open habitat.
intercontinental migrations from tropical asia to other tropical regions were positively correlated with shift in habitat, but not with changes in life history.
a rapid increase in diversification rates of the whole oryza occurred during the pleistocene.
a habitat preference shift from shade tolerant to open habitat predated the burst in diversification rates.
significant increase in diversification rates occurred during the pleistocene and is associated with range expansion and habitat shift, but not with life history.
oryza became differentiated in tropical asia in the miocene.
rice species may have been pre-adapted to invade open habitat.
there were two migrations from the ancestral area into africa and australia during the miocene.
