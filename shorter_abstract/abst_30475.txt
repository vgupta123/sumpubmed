lcpa protein of e. hirae atcc  <dig> has been produced and purified with and without its transmembrane helix.
the interaction of lcpa with e. hirae cell wall indicates that lcpa binds enterococcal peptidoglycan, regardless of the presence of secondary cell wall polymers.
immunolocalization experiments showed that lcpa and pbp <dig> are localized at the division site of e. hirae.
proteins from the lytr-cpsa-psr family are found in almost all gram-positive bacteria.
lcpa belongs to the lytr-cpsa-psr family.
the psr protein from enterococcus hirae, here renamed lcpa, previously associated with the regulation of the expression of the low-affinity pbp <dig> and Î²-lactam resistance, has been characterized.
although lcp proteins have been studied in other pathogens, their functions in enterococci remain uncharacterized.
its topology, localization and binding to peptidoglycan support, together with previous observations on defective mutants, that lcpa plays a role related to the cell wall metabolism, probably acting as a phosphotransferase catalyzing the attachment of cell wall polymers to the peptidoglycan.
