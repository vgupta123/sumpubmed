bovine anaplasmosis has been reported in several european countries, but the vector competency of tick species for anaplasma marginale from these localities has not been determined.
<dig> was confirmed by examination of giemsa-stained blood smears and msp <dig> pcr.
in addition, a. marginale colonies were detected by light microscopy in the salivary glands of the acquisition fed ticks.
as a vector of a. marginale in the united states, we tested the vector competency of d. reticulatus for a. marginale.
further studies are needed to confirm the vector competency of d. reticulatus for other a. marginale strains from geographic areas in europe.
male d. reticulatus were allowed to feed for  <dig> days on a calf persistently infected with a zaria isolate of a. marginale, after which they were removed and held off-host for  <dig> days.
because of the wide distributional range of dermacentor reticulatus within europe and the major role of dermacentor spp.
this study demonstrates that d. reticulatus males are competent vectors of a. marginale.
transmission of a. marginale to calf no.
ticks were dissected after transmission feeding and presence of a. marginale was confirmed in  <dig> % of the dissected ticks.
