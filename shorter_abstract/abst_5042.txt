here we demonstrate that mice with transgenic expression of a constitutively active epor isoform  in pyramidal neurons of cortex and hippocampus exhibit enhancement of spatial learning, cognitive flexibility, social memory, and attentional capacities, accompanied by increased impulsivity.
superior cognitive performance is associated with augmented long-term potentiation of cepor expressing neurons in hippocampal slices.
this property of epor signaling should be exploited for defining novel strategies to therapeutically enhance cognitive performance in disease conditions.
active epor stimulates neuronal plasticity independent of any hematopoietic effects and in addition to its neuroprotective actions.
