a search for conserved ggdef and eal domains in three sequenced k. pneumoniae genomes showed that there were multiple copies of ggdef and eal containing proteins.
both single domain and hybrid ggdef proteins were identified:  <dig> in k. pneumoniae kp <dig>   <dig> in k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> and  <dig> in k. pneumoniae ntuh-k <dig>  the majority had only the ggdef domain, most with the ggeef motif, and hybrid proteins containing both ggdef and eal domains were also found.
the comparative analysis of proteins containing ggdef/eal domains in k. pneumoniae showed that most copies were shared among the three strains and that some were unique to a particular strain.
the second messenger bis--cyclic dimeric gmp  is a ubiquitous signal in bacteria that controls biofilm formation as well as several other cellular processes.
many bacteria contain multiple copies of these proteins with diverse organizational structure that highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of this signaling network.
klebsiella pneumoniae can be found in environmental habitats as well as in hospital settings where it is commonly associated with nosocomial infections.
the i site for allosteric control was identified only in single ggdef domain proteins and not in hybrid proteins.
this work was undertaken to identify dgcs and pdes and analyze the domain structure of these proteins in k. pneumoniae.
eal-only proteins, containing either intact or degenerate domains, were also identified:  <dig> in kp <dig>   <dig> in mgh  <dig> and  <dig> in ntuh-k <dig>  several input sensory domains and transmembrane segments were identified, which together indicate complex regulatory circuits that in many cases can be membrane associated.
