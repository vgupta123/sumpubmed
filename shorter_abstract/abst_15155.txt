the bromeliad-dense regions of these primary forest habitats provide a unique natural micro-habitat within the forests and the opportunity to better identify the role of fungal communities in the c and n cycles in tropical soils.
bromelia pinguin  is a terrestrial bromeliad commonly found under forest stands throughout the neotropics that has been shown to have antifungal activity in vitro.
a previous study in the lowland forest of costa rica showed the soil beneath these bromeliads had decreased fungal its dna and differences in c and n levels compared to adjacent primary forest soils.

in this follow-up study, we found that the bromeliad soils had lower rates of c and n biomass development and lower phenol oxidase activity .
the results of t-rflp and cloning-based taxonomic analyses showed the community level diversity and abundance of fungal its dna was less in bromeliad soils.
sequence analysis of fungal its dna clones showed marked differences in fungal community structure between habitats of basidiomycota , ascomycota , and zycomycota populations.
the data show there to be differences in the soil nutrient dynamics and fungal community structure and activity associated with these bromeliads, as compared to the adjacent primary forest.
