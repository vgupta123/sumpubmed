these results provide evidence to support an important role for at1rs in mediating the renal effects of angiotensin ii during postnatal maturation in conscious developing animals.
two experiments were carried out in each animal and consisted of the assessment of renal variables including glomerular and tubular function, for 30 min before  and 60 min after infusion of zd  <dig> and pd  <dig>  respectively.
zd  <dig> infusion was associated with a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction at one but not six weeks; urinary flow rate decreased significantly in older animals, whereas sodium excretion and free water clearance were not altered.
statistical significance was determined using parametric testing  as appropriate.
there was an age-dependent effect on potassium handling along the nephron, potassium excretion decreasing after zd  <dig> infusion in younger but not in older lambs.
this study was designed to investigate the roles of angiotensin receptors type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  in regulating glomerular and tubular function during postnatal development.
pd  <dig> had no significant effects on glomerular filtration rate and tubular function in either age group.
in contrast to a role for at2rs later in life, there appears to be no role for at2rs in influencing the renal effects of angiotensin ii in the postnatal period.

evidence suggests a critical role for the renin-angiotensin system in regulating renal function during postnatal development.
however, the physiological relevance of a highly elevated renin-angiotensin system early in life is not well understood, nor which angiotensin receptors might be involved.
