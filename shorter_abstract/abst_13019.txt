to date, heterologous production of the gene kivrfp from fusarium has not been achieved.
the gene kivrfp contained a  <dig>  bp open reading frame  encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular mass of 52 kda.
the kivrfp gene was subcloned and expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> using the pet expression system.
it also exhibited the high level of stability over wide temperature and ph spectra and in the presence of metal ions or detergents.
a new ketoisovalerate reductase kivrfp was identified and characterized from the depsipeptide-producing fungus f. proliferatum.
the ketoisovalerate reductase  is required for the formation of beauvericin via the nonribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic pathway.
sequence analysis indicated that it showed 61% and 52% amino acid identities to ketoisovalerate reductase from beauveria bassiana atcc  <dig>  and metarhizium acridum cqma  <dig> , respectively; and several conserved regions were identified, including the putative nucleotide-binding signature site, gxgxxg, a catalytic triad .
however, little is known about the bioinformatics’ data about the 2-kiv reductase in fusarium.
kivrfp has been shown to have useful properties, such as moderate thermal stability and broad ph optima, and may serve as the starting points for future protein engineering and directed evolution, towards the goal of developing efficient enzyme for downstream biotechnological applications.
