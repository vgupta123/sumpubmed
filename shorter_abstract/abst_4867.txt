here we show a  <dig> % increase in energy consumption in response to non-pathogenic immune stimulation.
this increase in energy consumption along with other results suggests that immunity is one of the most important physiological systems, with other systems being sacrificed for its continuing efficiency.
the concept of a costly immune system that must be traded off against other important physiological systems is fundamental to the burgeoning field of ecological immunity.
