renal allografts and peripheral blood were collected on day  <dig> after transplantation for histological examination and mechanism investigation.
we found that inhibition of ezh <dig> by dznep after transplantation significantly ameliorated acute rejection , with decreased histological injury and reduced inflammatory infiltration in renal allografts.
attenuation of ar was due to the prohibited activation of alloreactive t cells, the subsequent impaired production of inflammatory cytokines, and also the elevated apoptosis of alloreactive t cells in both renal allografts and periphery.
disruption of ezh <dig> by dznep suppressed the immune responses of alloreactive t cells and ameliorated ar of renal allografts.

in this study, we investigate whether histone methylation regulation can impact renal allograft rejection in rat models.
this suggests a therapeutic potential of targeting histone methyltransferases ezh <dig> in treating allograft rejection after solid organ transplantation.
although histone methyltransferases ezh <dig> has been proved to have significant regulatory effect on the immune rejection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, its role in solid-organ transplantation remains uncovered.
