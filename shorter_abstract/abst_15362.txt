analysis of the gene pairs using the blast2go software suite showed that the molecular functions , cellular components , and biological processes  associated with the bidirectional transcripts were similar among the five plant species.
we conducted a genome-wide search in maize using genome sequencing results from the inbred line b <dig>  in total,  <dig> bidirectional transcript pairs were identified using a modified search model.
bidirectional gene pairs exist as a specific form of gene organization in microorganisms and mammals as well as in model plant species, such as arabidopsis and rice.
a comparative study of bidirectional gene pairs performed for three monocot  and two dicot  plant genomes showed that bidirectional gene pairs were abundant in the five plant species.
the evolutionary analysis of the function and structure of orthologous bidirectional gene pairs in various plant species revealed a potential pathway of their origin, which may be required for the evolution of a new species.
we functionally characterized the promoter activity of the intergenic regions of most of the bidirectional transcript pairs that were expressed in embryos using a maize embryo transient expression system.
orthologous bidirectional gene pairs were clearly distinguishable between the monocot and dicot species although the total numbers of orthologous bidirectional genes were similar.
little is known about bidirectional gene pairs in maize, which has a large genome and is one of the most important grain crops.
