the domestic pig is an excellent animal model to study human microbial diseases due to its similarity to humans in terms of anatomy, physiology, and genetics.
we also identified increased development of cellular junctions over the culture period.
after the nptr cells reached confluence, the apical medium was removed and the cells were fed by medium from the basal side.
using immunofluorescence and electronic microscopy we evaluated the presence of goblet and ciliated cells, the epithelial junction organization, and the transepithelial electrical resistance.
this cell line offers a wide microbial susceptibility spectrum to both viruses and bacteria.
we assessed the cellular layerâ€™s capacity to polarize and differentiate in ali conditions.
the culture of nptr cells in ali conditions allows a partial in vitro representation of porcine upper airway tissue that could be used to investigate some aspects of host/respiratory pathogen interactions.
we found that the cellular layer develops a variable density of mucus producing cells and acquires a transepithelial resistance.
