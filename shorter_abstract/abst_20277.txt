we identified a transcription factor repertoire encoded by the coral genome and found consistencies of the domain architectures of transcription factors and conserved regulatory subnetworks across eumetazoan species, providing insight into how regulatory networks have evolved.
here, we develop and apply a new system-wide approach in order to infer combinatorial transcription factor networks of the reef-building coral acropora millepora.
this study provides the first look at transcription factor networks in corals.
analysis of the network across a phylogenetically broad sample of five species, including human, reveals that despite the apparent simplicity of corals, their transcription factors repertoire and interaction networks seem to be largely conserved.
coral reefs are disturbed on a global scale by environmental changes including rising sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification.
by integrating sequencing-derived transcriptome measurements, a network of physically interacting transcription factors, and phylogenetic network footprinting we were able to infer such a network.
like in any other organism, the response of corals to stress is tightly controlled by the coordinated interplay of many transcription factors.
in addition, we were able to identify interactions among transcription factors that appear to be species-specific lending strength to the novel concept of "taxonomically restricted interactions".
little is known about how corals respond or adapt to these environmental changes especially at the molecular level.
