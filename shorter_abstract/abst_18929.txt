no significant difference was detected  between seroprevalence in female and male cats and in cats from urban and suburban districts of qatar.
cats are essential in the life cycle of toxoplasma gondii as they can shed the environmentally resistant oocysts after acquiring infection.
the analysis revealed an overall seroprevalence of 82%.
the current study is the first to estimate the seroprevalence of t. gondii in the feral cat population in qatar.
we investigated the seroprevalence of t. gondii among  <dig> adult cats from urban and suburban districts in qatar.
despite the seasonal difference, the observed seroprevalence of t. gondii suggests high environmental contamination throughout the year, with some female cats generating more intense responses compared to males.
using results from the modified agglutination test, we fitted statistical models with host sex, area and season as explanatory factors and seropositivity as the outcome.
seroprevalence was significantly higher in the summer season .
human populations living in cities with high densities of feral cats are therefore likely to be at risk of infection.
