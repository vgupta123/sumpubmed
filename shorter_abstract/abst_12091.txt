all other p <dig> variants were released into the supernatant, in general as a  <dig> kda protein encompassing the helical part of p <dig>  incubation of m. hominis cells in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with divalent cations revealed that the release of mycoplasma proteins into the supernatant was inhibited by high concentrations of calciumions.
in general the p <dig> protein is transported across the membrane and remains complexed to p <dig>  surface-exposed and membrane anchored via the uncleaved signal sequence.
in mycoplasma hominis, the genes encoding the surface-localized membrane complex p60/p <dig> are in an operon with a gene encoding a cytoplasmic, nucleotide-binding protein with a characteristic histidine triad motif .
western blot analysis of recombinant p <dig> mutants expressed in e. coli and differing in the n-terminal region revealed that mutation of the + <dig> position of the mature protein  which is important for signal peptidase i recognition resulted in reduced p <dig> secretion.
as the membrane anchored p <dig> carries an n-terminal uncleaved signal peptide we have proposed that the n-terminus extends into the cytoplasm and interacts with the cytosolic hint.
further characterization of p <dig> suggested that the  <dig>  kda signal peptide is protected from cleavage only in the membrane bound form.
loss of the  <dig>  kda signal peptide seems to be a pre-requisite for p <dig> secretion, which is followed by a proteolytic process leading to a helical  <dig> kda product.
