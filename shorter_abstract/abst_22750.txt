we developed a network-based comparative analysis approach that integrates protein-protein interactions with gene expression profiles and biological function annotations to reveal dynamic functional modules under different biological states.
the dynamics of these modules between normal and disease states further suggest a potential molecular model of dilated cardiomyopathy.
we found that hub proteins in condition-specific co-expressed protein interaction networks tended to be differentially expressed between biological states.
although previous studies have identified putative biomarkers or therapeutic targets for heart failure, the underlying molecular mechanism of dilated cardiomyopathy remains unclear.
dilated cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure.
applying this method to a cohort of heart failure patients, we identified two functional modules that significantly emerged from the interaction networks.
it successfully reveals network modules closely related to heart failure; more importantly, these network dynamics provide new insights into the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.
the revealed molecular modules might be used as potential drug targets and provide new directions for heart failure therapy.
we propose a novel framework to analyze the interaction networks in different biological states.
while protein-protein interaction data constitute static network maps, integration of condition-specific co-expression information provides clues to the dynamic features of these networks.
