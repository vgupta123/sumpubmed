a recent study revealed a surprising positive correlation between increased anxiety and elevated neurogenesis following chronic voluntary wheel running and multiple behavioural testing in mice, suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in the genesis of anxiety.
furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the amount of proliferation, but not maturation, and anxiety measures in the open field of the 28â€‰day running mice.
to exclude the possible confounding effect of multiple testing that may have occurred in the aforementioned study, we assessed  the effects of mouse voluntary wheel running  on anxiety in just one behavioural test; the open field, and , using different markers, proliferation, differentiation, survival and maturation of newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus immediately afterwards.
overall, this evidence suggests that without repeated testing, newly born mature neurons may not be involved in the genesis of anxiety per se.
effects of wheel running on anxiety-related behaviour were confirmed in a separate batch of animals tested in another test of anxiety, the light/dark box test.
