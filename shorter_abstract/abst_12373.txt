on the other hand, a simple heuristic to select a random subset of 3-way alignments  yields accuracy comparable to averaging all 3-way alignments with substantially less computational effort.
the first employs exhaustive computation of exact 3-way alignments, while the second employs an efficient heuristic to compute a much smaller number of exact 3-way alignments.
calculation of lower bounds on sp cost  can be improved by employing a mixture of 3-way and 2-way alignments.
two standard and two new methods are considered for using exact 2-way and 3-way alignments to compute lower bounds on total sp alignment cost; one new method fares well with respect to accuracy, while the other reduces the computation time.
calculating all 3-way alignments exactly and computing their average improves lower bounds on sum of sp cost in v-way alignments.
however judicious selection of a subset of all 3-way alignments can yield a further improvement with minimal additional effort.
as more effort is invested in improving upper bounds , it is therefore important to improve lower bounds as well.
exponential growth in computation time appears to be inevitable when an optimal alignment is required for many sequences.
in the absence of an optimal alignment with which to compare, lower bounds may be calculated to assess the quality of the alignment.
