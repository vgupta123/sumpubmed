the biomoby interoperability system was created with the goal of facilitating the movement of data from one web-based resource to another to fulfill the requirements of non-expert bioinformaticians.
with the availability of the biomoby plug-in to taverna, we believe that biomoby-based web services are now significantly more useful and accessible to bench scientists than are more traditional web services.
the exposed biomoby functionality aids in the design of "sensible" biomoby workflows, aids in pipelining biomoby and non-biomoby-based resources, and ensures that end-users need only a minimal understanding of both biomoby, and the taverna interface itself.
users are guided through the construction of syntactically and semantically correct workflows through plug-in calls to the moby central registry.
here we describe the marriage of these two projects in the form of a taverna plug-in that provides access to many of biomoby's features through the taverna interface.
moby central provides a menu of only those biomoby services capable of operating on the data-type that exist at any given position in the workflow.
