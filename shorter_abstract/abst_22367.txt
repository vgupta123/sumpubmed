up-regulated transcripts seem to exert their function mainly within the cell nucleus, and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in preconditioning induced neuroprotection.
data were analyzed with the bioconductor limma package, which showed  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated transcripts in the fa-group.
we validated these findings with rt-qpcr for adh <dig>  edn <dig>  leptin, rdh <dig>  and smad <dig>  moreover, we investigated differences in gene expression across different brain regions.
in addition, we performed gene set enrichment analysis  which revealed  <dig> significantly down-regulated gene sets, mainly involved in neurotransmission and ion transport.
fetal asphyctic  preconditioning is effective in attenuating brain damage incurred by a subsequent perinatal asphyctic insult.
whole genome transcription was investigated with affymetrix gene <dig> st chip.
here we identify for the first time differential gene expression after asphyctic preconditioning in fetal brain tissue, with the majority of differentially expressed transcripts being down-regulated.
therefore we investigated whole genome differential gene expression in the preconditioned rat brain.
