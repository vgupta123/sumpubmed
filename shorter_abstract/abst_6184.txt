third, they claimed that the phylogenetic position of chaetognaths could not be accurately inferred from a rp dataset because of the persistence of two problems: a long branch attraction  artefact and a compositional bias.
first, the authors stated that rp genes present paralogous copies, which have arisen through allopolyploidization.
we find that their evidence for paralogous copies relies on faulty pcr experiments since they attempted to amplify dna fragments absent from the genomic template.
however, the previous study came to incorrect conclusions on the basis of experiments that omitted validation procedures.
then, we showed that the lack of phylogenetic resolution observed by these authors is due to limited taxon sampling and not to lba or to compositional bias.
three main conclusions were drawn in this paper.
a ribosomal protein dataset thus fully supports the position of chaetognaths as sister group of all other protostomes.
we reconsider here the results described in barthélémy et al.
second, they reported two alternate nucleotide stretches conserved within the 5' untranslated regions  of multiple ribosomal cdnas and they suggested that these motifs are involved in the differential transcriptional regulation of paralogous rp genes.
