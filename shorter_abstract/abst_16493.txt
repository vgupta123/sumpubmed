since existent sl data is mainly restricted to yeast screenings, the road towards human sl candidates is limited to inference methods.
as cancer cells exhibit a large number of mutations, the identification of these mutated genes' sl partners may provide specific anti-cancer drug candidates, with minor perturbations to the healthy cells.
novel sl screening analysis and the use of highly curated databases would contribute to improve the results of this methodology.
the detection of sl gene pairs constitutes a promising alternative for anti-cancer therapy.
in the present work, we use phylogenetic analysis and database manipulation  in order to reconstruct the phylogenetically-inferred sl gene network for human.
two genes are called synthetic lethal  if mutation of either alone is not lethal, but mutation of both leads to death or a significant decrease in organism's fitness.
