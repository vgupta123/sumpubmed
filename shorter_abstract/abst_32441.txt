three of the four genes encode opsins predicted to be most sensitive to different wavelengths of light because they vary at key amino acid positions.
between-gene pcr and dna sequencing show that two of the guppy lws opsins are linked in an inverted orientation.
enhanced wavelength discrimination, a possible consequence of opsin gene duplication and divergence, might have been an evolutionary prerequisite for color-based sexual selection and have led to the extraordinary coloration now observed in male guppies and in many other poeciliids.
one, an intronless gene, was produced prior to the divergence of families fundulidae and poeciliidae.
to test the hypothesis that the evolution of elaborate coloration in male guppies  is also associated with opsin gene diversity, we sequenced long wavelength-sensitive  opsin genes in six species of the family poeciliidae.
sequences of four lws opsin genes were amplified from the guppy genome and from mrna isolated from adult guppy eyes.
this family of lws opsin genes was produced by a diversity of duplication events.
this inverted tandem duplication event occurred near the base of the poeciliid tree in the common ancestor of poecilia and xiphophorus.
the fourth sequence has been uncovered only in the genus poecilia.
