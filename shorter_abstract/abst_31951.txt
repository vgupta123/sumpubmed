it should be possible, in turn, to apply advanced computational approaches to these datasets to develop models of biological processes.
we describe specific challenges associated with experimental design in populus, including selection of optimal genotypes for different technical approaches and development of antibodies against populus transcription factors.
execution of the experimental design included the generation and analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  data for rna polymerase ii and transcription factors involved in wood formation.
in this paper we discuss some of these challenges for chip-seq and rna-seq experiments using the undomesticated tree species of the genus populus.
in a practical sense, working with non-model organisms presents unique challenges.
we also describe the evaluation of chip-seq data from populus, and discuss the comparison between chip-seq and rna-seq data and biological interpretations of these comparisons.
these and other "lessons learned" highlight the challenges but also the potential insights to be gained from extending next generation sequencing-supported network analyses to undomesticated non-model species.
