our results show that after differentiation, diva/bclb expression was decreased and reciprocally, ndpkb/nm23h <dig> expression was increased and it translocated into the nucleus.
our results showed a novel role for diva/bclb in neuronal differentiation.
overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> promoted pc- <dig> neuronal differentiation by increasing neurite outgrowth and arresting cell cycle progression.
its downregulation during neuronal differentiation may be necessary to allow ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin interaction that promotes ndpkb/nm23h <dig> mediated differentiation.
diva/bclb has been shown to interact with ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  which is involved in cellular differentiation.
this was due to an increase in the formation of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> complexes as well as diva/bclb and β-tubulin complexes.
concomitantly, there was a decrease in formation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes.
overexpression of diva/bclb also resulted in a higher percentage of s-phase cells.
