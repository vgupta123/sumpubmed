based on the lincrna-mrna co-expression network and the competing endogenous rna hypothesis, we predicted that  <dig> lincrnas that function as mirna targets and  <dig> lincrnas that function as mirna decoys participate in cellular and metabolic processes, and play role in catalytic activity and molecular binding functions.
the function of lincrnas as mirna targets were predicted via a lincrna-mrna co-expression network, and the function of lincrnas as mirna decoys were predicted according to the competing endogenous rna  hypothesis.
conservation analysis of lincrnas as mirna targets or decoys were conducted using blastn and mafft.
lincrnas as mirna targets or decoys were predicted via gstar.pl script with a set of rules, and lincrnas as mirna targets were validated by degradome data.
long intergenic noncoding rnas  are endogenous non-coding rnas  that are transcribed from ‘intergenic’ regions of the genome and may play critical roles in regulating gene expression through multiple rna-mediated mechanisms.
we found that lincrnas acting as mirna targets or decoys are a common phenomenon, which indicates that the regulated networks of mirnas also involve lincrnas.
in this work, we developed a computational method and systematically predicted  <dig> lincrnas as  <dig> mirna targets and  <dig> lincrnas as  <dig> mirna decoys in maize .
this work provides a comprehensive view of mirna-regulated networks and indicates that lincrnas can participate in a layer of regulatory interactions as mirna targets or decoys in plants, which will enable in-depth functional analysis of lincrnas.
furthermore,  <dig> lincrnas predicted as  <dig> mirna targets were validated based on degradome data.
