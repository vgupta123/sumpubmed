while the  <dig> kda proteins could be reproducibly separated in three bands electrophoretically, the exact nature of the individual protein forms present in those bands remained partially ambiguous.
one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  was used to visualize the relative changes of abundance of the  <dig> kda proteins in ppfb and pvfb as well as hemolymph from day  <dig> of v instar larval stage to day  <dig> of pupal stage.
gel electrophoresis and chromatography were used to separate the  <dig> kda proteins from both ppfb and pvfb as well as hemolymph total proteomes.
they even seemed to aggregate as was indicated by native gel electrophoresis.
mass spectrometry  was employed to elucidate individual protein sequences.
in b. mori larvae and pupae,  <dig> kda lipoproteins lp <dig> to lp <dig> and l301/ <dig> were detected in ppfb and pvfb tissue as well as in hemolymph.
high-resolution separation techniques will be necessary before ms and other structural analysis can shed more light on the complexity of the  <dig> kda subproteome in b. mori.
a first attempt to that end allowed isolation of a b. mori lp3-like protein, the complete structure, properties and function of which will now be elucidated in detail.
gas phase fragmentation was used to generate peptide sequence information, which was matched to the available nucleotide data pool of more than ten highly homologous insect  <dig> kda lipoproteins.
however, detailed protein structural information for individual ppfb and pvfb tissues during larval and pupal developmental stages is still missing.
the amino acid sequences of all known  <dig> kda proteins showed very high homology.
a group of abundant proteins of ~ <dig> kda is synthesized in silkworm larval peripheral fat body  tissues and transported into the open circulatory system  in a time-depended fashion to be eventually stored as granules in the pupal perivisceral fat body  tissues for adult development during the non-feeding stage.
typically, three protein bands were observed  in 1d-page, which were subjected to ms-based protein identification along with spots excised from 2d-gels run for those proteomes.
lipoproteins lp <dig> to lp <dig> and l301/ <dig> could be matched to peptides extracted from all bands suggesting the presence of full length and truncated or modified protein forms in all of them.
