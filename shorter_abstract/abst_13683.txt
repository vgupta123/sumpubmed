using genetically diverse but fully inbred strains of mice it has been shown that host sequence variants have a strong influence on the severity of influenza a disease progression.
analysis of multiple gene expression data sets and sequence variants in these strains highlights about  <dig> strong candidate genes across all loci that may control influenza a susceptibility and resistance.
we have mapped influenza susceptibility loci to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  body weight and survival loci have a time-dependent profile that presumably reflects the temporal dynamic of the response to infection.
qivr <dig>  was the largest and most significant qtl for weight loss.
there is strong but mostly circumstantial evidence that genetic factors modulate the severity of influenza infection in humans.
we monitored body weight, survival, and mean time to death for 13â€‰days after infection.
