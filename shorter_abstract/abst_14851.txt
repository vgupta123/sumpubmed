this collective comparative evidence provides the first multi-taxa transcriptomic-based perspective on differences between elasmobranchs and teleosts, and suggests various unique features associated with the adaptive immune system of elasmobranchs, pointing in particular to the potential importance of mhc class ii.
this paper reports a comparative rna-seq analysis of heart tissue from seven species, including four elasmobranchs and three teleosts, focusing on immunity, but concomitantly seeking to identify genetic similarities shared by the two lamnid sharks and the single billfish in our study, which could be linked to convergent evolution of regional endothermy.
a repeatedly represented functional category, in both the uniquely expressed elasmobranch genes  and the elasmobranch go enrichment results, involved antibody-mediated immunity, either in the recruitment of immune cells  or in antigen presentation, including such terms as “antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via mhc class ii”, and such genes as mhc class ii, hla-dpb <dig>  molecular adaptation analyses identified three genes in elasmobranchs with a history of positive selection, including legumain , a gene with roles in both innate and adaptive immunity including producing antigens for presentation by mhc class ii.

comparisons between the endothermic and ectothermic species revealed an enrichment of go terms associated with cardiac muscle contraction in endotherms, with  <dig> genes expressed solely in endotherms, several of which have significant roles in lipid and fat metabolism.
across seven species, we identified an average of  <dig>  swiss-prot annotated genes from an average of  <dig>  open reading frames within each species’ heart transcriptome.
