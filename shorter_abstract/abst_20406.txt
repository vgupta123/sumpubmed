severe acute respiratory syndrome  is a severe respiratory illness caused by a novel virus, the sars coronavirus .
our results suggest that the 3clpro may suppress expression of gm-csf in transfected a <dig> cells through down-regulation of nf-kb production.
furthermore, the protein levels of nf-kb decreased in 3clpro-transfected a <dig> cells when compared to egfp transfected cells.
