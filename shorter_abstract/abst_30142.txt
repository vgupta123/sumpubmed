wood formation in tree species is regulated by multiple factors at various layers.
alternative splicing  occurs within a large number of genes in wood formation.
in the process of wood formation, about 28% of as-occurring genes were putative orthologs and  <dig> conserved as events were identified in the two species.

however, the functional implications and conservation of the as occurrence are not well understood.
in this study, we profiled as events in wood-forming tissues of populus and eucalyptus, and analyzed their functional implications as well as inter-species conservation.
around 42% of the as events resulted in changes to the original reading frame.
<dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the as events may cause protein domain modification.
through analysis of as events in developing xylem of two tree species, this study reveals an array of new information regarding as occurrence and function in tree development.
