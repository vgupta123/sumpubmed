as a result, the inability of identifying low abundance proteins in a proteomic study is the main bottleneck in protein biomarker discovery.
the key feature of the new algorithm is that the observed isotope patterns registered in multiple scans are combined together for estimating the likelihood of the peptide existence.
increasing evidence has shown that biomarkers are often low abundance proteins.
however, lc/ms systems are subject to considerable noise and sample variability, whose statistical characteristics are still elusive, making computational identification of low abundance proteins extremely challenging.
the evaluation shows better peak detection accuracy for low abundance proteins than other lc/ms peak detection methods.
in lc/ms, peptides elute during a certain time period and as a result, peptide isotope patterns are registered in multiple ms scans.
an isotope pattern matching score based on the likelihood probability is provided and utilized for peak detection.
the identification and quantification of proteins using label-free liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  play crucial roles in biological and biomedical research.
in this paper, we propose a new peak detection method called information combining peak detection  for high resolution lc/ms.
