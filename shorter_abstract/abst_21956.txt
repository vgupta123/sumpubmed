the ptc portal allows users to upload a large number of sequences to be aligned by the parallel version of tc that cannot be aligned by a single machine due to memory and execution time constraints.
in this paper we show how ptc can be easily deployed and controlled on a super computer architecture using a web portal developed using rapid.
the web portal provides a user-friendly solution.
parallel t-coffee  was the first parallel implementation of the t-coffee multiple sequence alignment tool.
