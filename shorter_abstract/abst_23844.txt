we show that scd <dig> from plasma contributes to lps/tlr <dig> signalling in platelets to allow significant release of soluble cd40l, thereby elucidating the mechanism of lps-induced platelet responses and providing new insights for reducing lps toxicity in the circulation.
platelets are instrumental to primary haemostasis; in addition, as they are central to endothelium vascular repair, they play a role in physiological inflammation.
here we show that cd <dig>  required for optimal response to lps stimulation, is obtained from plasma, but used with restrictive regulation.
platelets have also been demonstrated to be key players in innate immunity and inflammation, expressing toll-like receptors  to sense microbial infection and initiate inflammatory responses.
they are equipped to decipher distinct signals, to use alternate pathways of signalling through a complete signalosome, despite their lack of a nucleus, and to adjust the innate immune response appropriately for pathogens exhibiting different types of ‘danger’ signals.
