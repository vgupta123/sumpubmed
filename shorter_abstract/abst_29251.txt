whilst criteria of low egg hatch-rate and female-biased progenic sex ratio have been used to identify female hosts of male-killers, variation in vertical transmission efficiency and host genetic factors may result in variation in these phenotypic indicators of male-killer presence.
this male-killer trait was maternally inherited and antibiotic treatment produced a full, heritable cure.
molecular identification of bacteria and screening for bacterial presence provide us with a more accurate method than breeding data alone to link the presence of the bacteria to the male-killing phenotype.
a male-killer was detected in the japanese coccinellid, propylea japonica  a species not previously known to harbour male-killers.
rickettsia presence correlates with the male-killing trait, but there is some variation in the phenotypic expression of the trait due to interaction with host factors.
molecular analysis identified rickettsia to be associated with the trait in this species of ladybird.
families produced by female p. japonica showed significantly female-biased sex ratios.
we conclude that p. japonica is host to a bacterial male-killer that is vertically inherited with variable transmission efficiency.
phylogenetic analysis using the 16s rrna and  <dig> kda antigen genes suggests there may have been horizontal transfer of rickettsial male-killers between different ladybird hosts.
