in this work we propose gpu-dupremoval, a new implementation of our method able to  cluster reads without constraints on the maximum length of the prefixes,  support both single- and paired-end read libraries, and  analyze large clusters of potential duplicates.
ideally, duplicate reads should be characterized by identical nucleotide sequences.
moreover, large clusters of potential duplicates are split into smaller with the aim to guarantees a reasonable computing time.
read sequences with identical prefix are considered potential duplicates.
removing nearly-identical duplicates can result in a notable computational effort.
to deal with this challenge, we recently proposed a gpu method aimed at removing identical and nearly-identical duplicates generated with an illumina platform.
in particular, it cannot to detect potential duplicates in the event that prefixes are longer than  <dig> bases, and it does not provide support for paired-end read libraries.
