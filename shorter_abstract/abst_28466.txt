hbv genotypes may also influence pathogenic properties and therapeutic features.
disparities in routes of transmission  and in pathogenic properties  among hbv genotypes may explain the presence of rare genotypes in the present work.
a high  proportion of patients submitted to long term lamivudine therapy displayed resistant mutations, with elevated viral load.
only 4/ <dig>  patients were hbv dna negative.
lamivudine resistance mutations were identified in 20/ <dig>  hbv dna positive samples.
three samples were from genotype g, which had not been previously detected in brazil.
the three isolates of genotype g were entirely sequenced.
all three showed the double mutation l180m/m204v and displayed a large genetic divergence when compared with other full-length genotype g isolates.
half of the patients were homosexual men.
lamivudine is an oral nucleoside analogue widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b. the main limitation of lamivudine use is the selection of resistant mutations that increases with time of utilization.
here, we analyzed the hbv genotype distribution and the nature and frequency of lamivudine resistant mutations among  <dig> patients submitted to lamivudine treatment for  <dig> to  <dig> months.
mean hbv loads of patients with and without lamivudine resistance mutations were not very different .
the identification of genotypes c and g, rarely detected in south america, seems to indicate a genotype distribution different to that observed in non treated patients.
