to illustrate this user-friendly tool, we analyzed escherichia coli and bacillus cereus genomes and found that several genes, which play key roles in human infection and antibiotic resistance, show significant evidence of positive selection.
wide scanning of prokaryotic genomes has shown that positive selection at the molecular level is much more frequent than expected.
here we describe an open access web server, which is designated as psp  for performing evolutionary analysis on orthologous coding genes, specially designed for rapid comparison of dozens of closely related prokaryotic genomes.
psp ultimately allows researchers to do genome-scale analysis for evolutionary selection across multiple prokaryotic genomes rapidly and easily, and identify the genes undergoing positive selection, which may play key roles in the interactions of host-pathogen and/or environmental adaptation.
remarkably, psp facilitates functional exploration at the multiple levels by assignments and enrichments of ko, go or cog terms.
genes with significant positive selection may play key roles in bacterial adaption to different environmental pressures.
positive selection is a sub-process of microevolution, in which a particular mutation is favored, causing the allele frequency to continuously shift in one direction.
