we analyze the sensitivity of this distribution to the secretion rate, clearance rate and vascular permeability of vegf.
vegf concentration in blood but not in tissue is dependent on the vascular permeability of healthy tissue.
in a pathological context , we find that blood vegf concentration is relatively insensitive to increased vascular permeability in tumors, to the secretion rate of vegf by tumors and to the clearance.
however, it is sensitive to the vascular permeability in the healthy tissue.
we find that, in a physiological context, vegf concentration varies approximately linearly with the vegf secretion rate.
finally, the vegf distribution profile in healthy tissue reveals that about half of the vegf is complexed with the receptor tyrosine kinase vegfr <dig> and the co-receptor neuropilin- <dig>  in diseased tissues, this binding can be reduced to 15% while vegf bound to the extracellular matrix and basement membranes increases.
the results are of importance for physiological conditions  and pathological conditions .
angiogenesis is a process by which new capillaries are formed from pre-existing blood vessels in physiological  or pathological  contexts.
although vegf is often targeted in anti-angiogenic therapies, there is little knowledge about how its concentration may vary between tissues and the vascular system.
a compartment model is constructed to study the vegf distribution in the tissue  and in the blood.
this mathematical model can serve as a tool for understanding the vegf distribution in physiological and pathological contexts as well as a foundation to investigate pro- or anti-angiogenic strategies.
