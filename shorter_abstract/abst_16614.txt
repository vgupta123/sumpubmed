the use of the iem-bootstrap procedure considerably reduces the space of possible haplotype configurations to be explored, greatly reducing computation time, while the adaptation of the gibbs sampler with a recombination model on this restricted space maintains high accuracy.
analogously with phase, there are  <dig> versions of ishape: ishape <dig> which uses a simple coalescence model for the pseudo gibbs sampler step, and ishape <dig> which uses a recombination model instead.
for snps spaced by  <dig> kb, ishape <dig> yields similar results to phase <dig>  in terms of accuracy, and both outperform the other software.
these results show that the ishape heuristic approach for haplotyping is very competitive in terms of accuracy and speed and deserves to be evaluated extensively for possible future widespread use.
we have developed a new haplotyping program based on the combination of an iterative multiallelic em algorithm , bootstrap resampling and a pseudo gibbs sampler.
we compared this software, ishape , with reference programs such as phase, fastphase, and pl-em.
we tested the program on  <dig> types of real snp datasets derived from hapmap: adjacent snps  and snps spaced by  <dig> kb .
for adjacent snps ishape <dig> is superior to the other software both in terms of speed and accuracy.
on large snp datasets , we used a segmented approach based on a specific partition-ligation strategy.
