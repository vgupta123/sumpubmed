the same indica and japonica subpanels were identified.
the japonica subpanel, which was more highly differentiated, was divided into  <dig> populations , including a temperate type .
linkage disequilibrium decayed faster in the indica subpanel  than in the japonica subpanel , likely because of the strongest differentiation of the japonica subpanel.
the development of genome-wide association studies  in crops has made it possible to mine interesting alleles hidden in gene bank resources.
this study presents the development of a panel of rice varieties from vietnam for gwas purposes.
however, the number of usable dart markers  was too small for gwas purposes.
we analyzed the panel structure, identified two subpanels corresponding to the indica and japonica sub-species and selected  <dig> non-redundant accessions.

a matrix adapted for gwas was built by eliminating the markers with a minor allele frequency below 5% and imputing the missing data.
some of the upland rice varieties appeared to belong to indica populations, which is uncommon in this region of the world.
passport data and phenotypic traits were used to characterize these populations.
some populations were exclusively composed of glutinous types .
the indica subpanel was further divided into six populations  using a model-based approach.
