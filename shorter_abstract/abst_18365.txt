it is aimed towards simple integration into standard analysis pipelines as a default qc metric that is especially useful for low-input and single cell rna-seq data sets.
the bioconductor package dupradar offers straight-forward methods to assess rna-seq datasets for quality issues with pcr duplicates.
especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for ngs data sets.
apart from the bioconductor package dupradar we provide shell scripts for easy integration into processing pipelines.
up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for rna-seq data.
