using in vivo rnai knockdown of ctf <dig> in drosophila we show that ctf <dig> is required for viability, s phase progression, sister chromatid cohesion, endoreplication, and coping with replication stress.
proper coordination of the functions at the dna replication fork is vital to the normal functioning of a cell.
the ctf <dig> protein has been shown to be a central member of the replication fork and links the replicative mcm helicase and dna polymerase α primase.
in addition, it has been implicated as a member of a complex that promotes replication fork stability, the fork protection complex , and as being important for sister chromatid cohesion.
we show that ctf <dig> function is conserved and that drosophila can be effectively used as a model to further probe the precise function of ctf <dig> as a member of the replication fork and possible roles in development.
specifically the precise coordination of helicase and polymerase activity is crucial for efficient passage though s phase.
we find that drosophila ctf <dig> is a conserved protein that interacts with members of the gins complex, mcm <dig>  and polymerase α primase.
ctf <dig> remains a central player in dna replication.
