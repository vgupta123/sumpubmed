the developed pcr-rflp technique resulted in efficient discrimination of the tested species and subspecies and allowed the construction of a dichotomous key in order to differentiate the most widely distributed bifidobacterium species as well as the subspecies belonging to b. pseudolongum and b. animalis.
this work illustrates a simple and cheap molecular tool for the identification of bifidobacterium species.
the in silico restriction analysis of bifidobacterial hsp <dig> partial sequences allowed the identification of a single endonuclease  able to provide different pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  patterns in the bifidobacterium spp.
these species share a high sequence homology of 16s rdna and several molecular techniques already applied to discriminate among them give ambiguous results.
the hsp <dig> universal primers were used in a simple pcr procedure for the direct amplification of 590Â bp of the hsp <dig> sequence.
hsp <dig> can be considered an excellent additional marker for inferring the taxonomy of the members of bifidobacterium genus.
