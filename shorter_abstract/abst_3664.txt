five isolates, including four from wounded syrian patients and one from a lebanese patient, were positive for blandm- <dig>  blaoxa-51-like sbt revealed the presence of  <dig> variants, where blaoxa- <dig> was the most common and present in  <dig> isolates, followed by blaoxa- <dig> in  <dig> isolates.
mlst analysis identified  <dig> sequence types  and showed a concordance with blaoxa-51-like sbt.
the blaoxa- <dig> with an upstream insertion of isaba <dig> was the major carbapenem resistance mechanism and detected in  <dig> isolates.
one hundred sixteen non-duplicate isolates isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> in different hospitals in tripoli, lebanon from lebanese patients and wounded syrian patients during syrian war were studied.
our results showed a successful predominance of international clone  <dig> with a widespread occurrence of oxa- <dig> carbapenemase in lebanese hospitals.
these findings emphasise the urgent need of effective measures to control the spread of a. baumannii in this country.
in this study, we investigate the molecular epidemiology and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a. baumannii in tripoli, northern lebanon.
antibiotic susceptibility testing was determined by agar disc diffusion and etest.
a. baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen with an outstanding ability to acquire multidrug resistant mechanisms.
of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  showed a carbapenem resistance phenotype.
all isolates were typed by blaoxa-51-like sequence based typing  and  <dig> isolates were also analysed by mlst using pasteurâ€™s scheme followed by eburst analysis.
