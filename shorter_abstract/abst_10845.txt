in order to describe the features of fci four situations were selected from real data collected during an international external quality assessment program for quantitative assays based on real-time pcr.
this algorithm estimates standard curve features as well as nucleic acid concentrations and confidence intervals according to fieller's theorem.
fci is an r code for analyzing data from real-time pcr experiments.
we have provided a freeware programme using this algorithm specifically designed to increase the information content of the real-time pcr assay.
