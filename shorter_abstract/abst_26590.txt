the polymorphic ssr markers detected  <dig> to  <dig> alleles with an average of  <dig>  per locus.
these markers showed a good level of pic value in cultivated germplasm and therefore would be very useful for germplasm analysis, linkage mapping, diversity studies and phylogenetic relationships in cultivated groundnut as well as related arachis species.
majority of the genotypes representing subspecies hypogaea were grouped together in one cluster, while the genotypes belonging to subspecies fastigiata were grouped mainly under two clusters.
among these ssrs, the gt/ca repeat motifs were the most common  followed by ga/ct repeat motifs .
<dig>  primer pairs yielded scorable amplicon and  <dig>  primers showed polymorphism among  <dig> cultivated groundnut genotypes.
the primer pairs could be designed for a total of  <dig> ssrs and were optimized initially on two genotypes.
due to its origin through a single and recent polyploidization event, followed by successive selection during breeding efforts, cultivated groundnut has a limited genetic background.
newly developed set of  <dig> markers extends the repertoire of ssr markers for cultivated groundnut.
