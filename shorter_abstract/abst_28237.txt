the software is written in perl-cgi, hosted on a linux server, and is freely available to non-commercial users.
we have developed h-mapd, a web-based tool that automates the generation and selection of probes for human genomic mlpa.
h-mapd greatly reduces the efforts for human genomic mlpa probe design.
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  is an efficient and reliable technique for gene dosage analysis.
the software performs physical-chemical property tests using unafold software, and uniqueness tests using the ucsc genome browser.
since its introduction in  <dig>  mlpa has been rapidly adopted in both clinical and research situations.
