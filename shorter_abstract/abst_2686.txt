pgk overexpression improved the productivity in l-arginine and l-ornithine production strains.
unlike many bacterial pgks, c. glutamicum pgk is active as a homodimer.
corynebacterium glutamicum cg1790/pgk encodes an enzyme active as a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase   catalyzing phosphoryl transfer from  <dig> -biphosphoglycerate  to adp to yield 3-phosphoglycerate  and atp in substrate chain phosphorylation.
c. glutamicum 3-phosphoglycerate kinase was purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of recombinant e. coli.
a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase negative c. glutamicum strain ∆pgk was constructed and shown to lack the ability to grow under glycolytic or gluconeogenic conditions unless pgk was expressed from a plasmid to restore growth.
pgk is essential for growth of c. glutamicum with carbon sources requiring glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.
the maximal activity of pgkhis was estimated to be  <dig> and  <dig> u mg- <dig> with km values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm for 3-phosphoglycerate and atp, respectively.
competitive inhibition by adp reveals the critical role of pgk in gluconeogenesis by energy charge.
