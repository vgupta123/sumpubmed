the currently available annotation of the l. gasseri atcc  <dig> genome describes numerous putative genes involved in carbohydrate utilization, yet the specific functions of many of these genes remain unknown.
the experiments revealed the extensive contribution of pts transporters to carbohydrate utilization by l. gasseri atcc  <dig> and the general inadequacy of the annotated sugar specificity of lactobacilli pts transporters.
analysis of the l. gasseri atcc  <dig> genome identified fifteen complete  pts transporters.
transcript expression profiles in response to various carbohydrates  were analyzed for the fifteen complete pts transporters in l. gasseri.
lactobacilli can utilize a variety of carbohydrates which reflects the nutrient availability in their respective environments.
no pts transporter was induced by glucose, fructose or mannose.
insertional inactivation of pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> significantly impaired growth on cellobiose and sucrose, respectively.
as predicted by bioinformatics, insertional inactivation of pts  <dig> confirmed its role in mannose utilization.
a common lactobacilli in the human gastrointestinal tract, lactobacillus gasseri, was selected for further study.
