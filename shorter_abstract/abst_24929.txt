sat is designed to successively perform base calling and quality evaluation of chromatograms, eliminate cloning vector, adaptors and low quality sequences, detect chimera or partially digested sequences, search for ssr motifs, cluster and assemble the redundant sequences, and design ssr primer pairs.
a common method for the development of ssr markers is the construction of genomic dna libraries enriched for ssr sequences, followed by dna sequencing.
simple sequence repeats , or microsatellites, are among the most powerful genetic markers known.
a database allows users to store and query results, and to redo individual steps of the workflow.
however, designing optimal ssr markers from bulk sequence data is a laborious and time-consuming process.
sat  is a user-friendly web application developed to minimize tedious manual operations and reduce errors.
the sat web application is available at , and a standalone command-line version is also freely downloadable.
although certain steps are compulsory, such as ssr motifs search and sequence assembly, users do not have to run the entire pipeline, and they can choose selectively which steps to perform.
