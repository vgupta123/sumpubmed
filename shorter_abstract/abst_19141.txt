no significant difference  was found among the treatment groups on overall feed intake, egg weight, egg mass and feed conversion efficiency.
the lowest levels  of plasma and egg yolk cholesterol were observed in com <dig>  followed by com <dig> and com <dig>  there was no significant difference in terms of yolk weight between the treatment groups.
in addition, the metabolite combinations, com <dig> had reduced the faecal ph and faecal enterobacteriaceae population, improved the faecal lactic acid bacteria, reduced the plasma and yolk cholesterol and improved the faecal volatile fatty acids content.
probiotics are beneficial bacteria that are able to colonize the host digestive system, increasing the natural flora and preventing colonization of pathogenic organisms and thus, securing optimal utility of the feed.
com <dig> had a significant reduction  in faecal ph compared to the other groups at 28 weeks of age onwards.
significant reduction of faecal enterobacteriaceae  were observed in com <dig> and com <dig> from 30 weeks of age onwards.
postbiotic metabolite combinations can be used as an alternative feed additive to achieve high productivity and better animal health while reducing the use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as in-feed antimicrobials.
com <dig> had significant higher  level of lactic acid bacteria counts from 30 weeks of age onwards, followed by com <dig> and com <dig> at  <dig> and 34 weeks of age, respectively.
the present study demonstrated the positive effects of metabolite combinations supplementation in laying hens.
however, commercial probiotic often do not meet the expected standards and the viability of the efficacy of these strains remains questionable.
significant higher  content of c18: <dig>  c20: <dig> and c22: <dig> were found in treatments supplemented with metabolite combinations as compared with the control group.
increase in hen-day egg production was observed in all treatments supplemented with metabolite combinations.
another major issue has been highlighted in relation to the application of antibiotic resistant probiotics, the antibiotic resistant gene can be transferred between organisms.
recently, postbiotic metabolites produced from microbes have been extensively studied as feed additive in order to substitute in-feed antibiotics.
