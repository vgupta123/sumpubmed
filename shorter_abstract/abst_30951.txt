intriguingly, expression of early meiotic proteins occurs within a narrow time window.
bifurcation analyses on feedback loops indicate that multiple feedback loops are coordinated to modulate sporulation efficiency.
further, sporulation efficiency is strikingly different for yeast strains with distinct mutations or genetic backgrounds.
in particular, positive auto-regulation of ime <dig> produces a bistable system with a normal meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state.
our mathematical model uncovers key regulations that can be manipulated to enhance sporulation efficiency, an important first step in the development of new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.
the model is validated by quantitative sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts.
the mathematical model is capable of simulating the orderly and transient dynamics of meiotic proteins including ime <dig>  the master regulator of meiotic initiation, and ime <dig>  a kinase encoded by an early gene.
by systematically scanning through feedback loops in the mathematical model, we demonstrate that, in yeast, the decisions to terminate protein expression and to sporulate at different efficiencies stem from feedback signals toward the master regulator ime <dig> and the early meiotic protein ime <dig>  we argue that the architecture of meiotic initiation pathway generates a robust mechanism that assures a rapid and complete transition into meiosis.
initiation of the process is tightly controlled by intricate networks of positive and negative feedback loops.
virtual perturbations on feedback loops suggest that both positive and negative feedback loops are required to terminate expression of early meiotic proteins.
to investigate signal transduction pathways that regulate transient protein expression and sporulation efficiency, we develop a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations.
