in the present work  <dig> feline mammary lesions consisting of feline mammary carcinomas , benign neoplasms, and hyperplastic/dysplastic tissues were evaluated histologically and by immunohistochemistry for expression of basal and luminal cytokeratins , vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, calponin, estrogen receptor  alpha , and progesterone receptor .
thirty-seven fmcs with  <dig> matched non-neoplastic controls were also investigated for gene expression of era, er beta, pr, and her <dig>
human breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified by molecular subtyping into luminal a, luminal b, her2-overexpressing, basal-like, claudin-low and normal-breast like.
these results indicate and potentially explain the high incidence of triple-negative, vimentin + aggressive tumors in cats that may used to elucidate some of the challenging features of tnbcs in women.
immunohistochemical evaluations of cytoplasmic filaments indicated that hrs- fmcs are vimentin+, ck14+, and ck5_6+ carcinomas that may resemble the tnbcs  described in women.
