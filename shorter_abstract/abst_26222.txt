rad tags were sequenced from the genomic dna of three c. cardunculus mapping population parents, generating  <dig>  million reads, corresponding to ~ <dig> gbp of sequence.
the rad tag sequencing approach is a cost-effective and rapid method to develop snp markers in a highly heterozygous species.
we have combined the recently developed restriction-site associated dna  approach with the illumina dna sequencing platform to effect the rapid and mass discovery of snp markers for c. cardunculus.
the genomic k-mers distribution and cpg rate of c. cardunculus, compared with data derived from three whole genome-sequenced dicots species, provided a further evidence of the random representation of the c. cardunculus genome generated by rad sampling.
the shared sequences allowed for the discovery of ~ <dig>  snps and nearly  <dig> indels, equivalent to a snp frequency of  <dig>  per  <dig>  nt, and an indel frequency of  <dig>  per  <dig>  nt.
no snp markers are in the public domain.
a sample of heterozygous snp loci was mapped by caps assays and this exercise provided validation of our mining criteria.
