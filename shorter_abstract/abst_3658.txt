these results suggest that the higher yield of royal jelly in apis mellifera may be due to the higher expression level of these degs.
our results indicated that the gene expression difference was associated with the difference in the royal jelly yield between these two species.
these results provide an important clue for clarifying the mechanisms underlying hypopharyngeal gland development and the production of royal jelly.
apis cerana is adept at collecting sporadic nectar in mountain and forest region and exhibits stiffer hardiness and acarid resistance as a result of natural selection, whereas apis mellifera has the advantage of producing royal jelly.
of these,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed an expression difference at the newly emerged worker, nurse, and forager stages, respectively.
finally, a total of  <dig> genes in apis mellifera and  <dig> in apis cerana were found to exhibit an expression difference among the three developmental stages.
apis mellifera and apis cerana are two sibling species of apidae.
twelve dge-tag libraries were constructed and sequenced using the total rna extracted from the hgs of newly emerged workers, nurses, and foragers of apis mellifera and apis cerana.

the nurse stage exhibited the highest number of degs between these two species and most of these were found to be up-regulated in apis mellifera.
to identify differentially expressed genes  that affect the development of hypopharyngeal gland  and/or the secretion of royal jelly between these two honeybee species, we performed a digital gene expression  analysis of the hgs of these two species at three developmental stages .
