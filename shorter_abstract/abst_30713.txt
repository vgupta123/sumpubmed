a tunel assay showed fragmented ndna in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages.
the leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles.
mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories  based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential .
results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as pcd progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental pcd.
the lace plant  produces perforations in its leaves through pcd.
this treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-pcd cells.
overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated pcd in the lace plant.
a single areole within a window stage leaf  was divided into three areas based on the progression of pcd; cells that will not undergo pcd , cells in early stages of pcd , and cells in late stages of pcd .
the following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated pcd in vivo in a. madagascariensis.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental pcd.
window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye mitotracker red cmxros and examined.
chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging.
programmed cell death  is the regulated death of cells within an organism.
