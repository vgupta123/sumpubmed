a predictor published seven years ago has been very successful with claimed prediction accuracy of 98%.
this new approach has increased the sensitivity by 22%, the specificity by 3%, and the total prediction accuracy by 10% compared with the previous predictor using the same blind data.
a new approach has been developed for predicting sulfotyrosine sites using the random forest algorithm after a careful evaluation of seven machine learning algorithms.
the random forest algorithm is able to deliver a better model compared with the hidden markov model, the support vector machine, artificial neural networks, and others for predicting sulfotyrosine sites.
the success shows that the random forest algorithm together with an amino acid hydrophobicity scale encoding can be a good candidate for peptide classification.
a web tool has been implemented at  for public use.
tyrosine sulfation is one of the most important posttranslational modifications.
due to its relevance to various disease developments, tyrosine sulfation has become the target for drug design.
in addition, the random forest model has an excellent feature for ranking the residues flanking tyrosine sites, hence providing more information for further investigating the tyrosine sulfation mechanism.
meanwhile, both negative and positive predictive powers have been increased by 9%.
in order to facilitate efficient drug design, accurate prediction of sulfotyrosine sites is desirable.
however, it has a particularly low sensitivity when predicting sulfotyrosine sites in some newly sequenced proteins.
