intact skin microbiota reduced immune activation and can minimize subclinical costs of infection.
determining the relative contributions of factors influencing disease resistance is critical for effective conservation management.
innate immune defenses in amphibian skin are vital host factors against a number of emerging pathogens such as ranaviruses and the amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis .
adult water frogs from switzerland  collected in the field with their natural microbiota intact were exposed to bd after experimental reduction of microbiota, skin peptides, both, or neither to determine the relative contributions of these defenses.
naturally-acquired bd infections were detected in 10/ <dig> p. lessonae and 4/ <dig> p. esculentus, but no disease outbreaks or population declines have been detected at this site.
microbiota-reduced frogs increased peptide production upon bd infection.
tolerance of bd or ranavirus infection may differ with ecological conditions.
ranavirus was undetectable in all but two frogs that appeared healthy in the field, but died within a week under laboratory conditions.
forty percent of initially uninfected frogs became sub-clinically infected upon experimental exposure to bd.
reduction of both skin peptide and microbiota immune defenses caused frogs to gain less mass when exposed to bd than frogs in other treatments.
