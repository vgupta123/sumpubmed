the expression patterns of  <dig> mapk genes reveal their important roles in diverse functions in cotton, in both various developmental stages of vegetative and reproductive growth and in the stress response.
their phylogenetic relationships, transcript expression patterns and responses to various stressors were verified.
phylogenetic analysis showed that the mapk candidates could be classified into the four known a, b, c and d groups, with more mapks containing the tey phosphorylation site  than the tdy motif .
furthermore,  <dig> cdna sequences of mapks with complete open reading frames  were identified in g. hirsutum via pcr-based approaches, including  <dig> novel mapks and eight with homologs reported previously in tetraploid cotton.
these mapk members were anchored onto  <dig> chromosomes in g. raimondii, with uneven distribution.
this study presents a comprehensive identification of  <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase genes in g. raimondii.
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses.
knowledge about the mapk gene family in cotton is limited, and systematic investigation of mapk family proteins has not been reported.

using a reverse genetics approach based on tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing , we further verified that mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> confer resistance to defoliating isolates of verticillium dahliae in cotton.
