many surface protein genes were missing or truncated, unlike immune evasion genes, and several distinct variants were identified.
surface and immune evasion genes are candidates for s. aureus vaccines, and their distribution and functionality is key.
whole genome sequences of  <dig> strains of s. aureus in the public domain and data from multi-strain microarrays were compared to assess variation in the sequence of proteins known or putatively interacting with host.
surprisingly, sequenced strains from four animal s. aureus strains had surface and immune evasion proteins remarkably similar to those found in human strains, yet putative targets of these proteins vary substantially between different hosts.
s. aureus is a coloniser and pathogen of humans and mammals.
vaccines should contain cocktails of antigens representing all variants or they will not protect against naturally occurring s. aureus populations.
however, the most variant protein domains were the putative functional regions and there is biological evidence that variants can be functional, arguing they do play a role.
