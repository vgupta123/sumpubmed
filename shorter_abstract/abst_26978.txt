receptor downregulation and desensitization increase the filter bandwidth thereby enabling the receptor systems to decode inputs in a wider frequency range.
in addition to initiating signaling events, the activation of cell surface receptors also triggers regulatory processes that restrict the duration of signaling.
furthermore, engineering metaphors such as the ones described here could prove to be invaluable in understanding the design principles of biological systems.
our findings suggest that in addition to serving as mechanisms for adaptation, receptor downregulation and desensitization can play a critical role in temporal information processing.
frequency response analysis indicates that upstream elements of the egfr and gpcr networks behave like low-pass filters with the system being able to faithfully transduce inputs below a critical frequency.
here we use the epidermal growth factor receptor  and g-protein coupled receptors  as model systems to respectively examine the effects of downregulation and desensitization on the ability of signaling receptors to decode time-varying ligand stimuli.
using a mathematical model, we show that downregulation and desensitization mechanisms can lead to tight and efficient input-output coupling thereby ensuring synchronous processing of ligand inputs.
further, system-theoretic analysis reveals that the receptor systems are analogous to classical mechanical over-damped systems.
