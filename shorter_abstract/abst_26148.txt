computational analysis of metagenomes requires the taxonomical assignment of the genome contigs assembled from dna reads of environmental samples.
because of its speed, simplicity, and accuracy raiphy can be successfully used in the binning process for a broad range of metagenomic data obtained from environmental samples.
with the introduction of the relative abundance index metric and an iterative classification method, we propose a taxonomic classification algorithm that performs competitively for a large range of dna contig lengths assembled from metagenome data.
comparison with computationally more intensive sequence similarity methods shows that raiphy performs competitively while being significantly faster.
raiphy performs better than these algorithms at varying clade-levels.
we propose a robust taxonomic classification method, raiphy, that uses a novel sequence similarity metric with iterative refinement of taxonomic models and functions effectively without these limitations.
current taxonomic classification algorithms provide accurate classification for long contigs or for short fragments from organisms that have close relatives with annotated genomes.
we have tested raiphy with synthetic metagenomics data ranging between  <dig> bp to  <dig> kbp.
