we apply this framework to compute adair-klotz constants from existing models of calmodulin and hemoglobin, two extreme cases of the general framework.
we propose a way of computing apparent adair-klotz constants from microscopic association constants and allosteric parameters of a generalised concerted model with two different states , with an arbitrary number of non-equivalent ligand binding sites.
we provide such a method for comparing generalised mwc allosteric models to experimentally determined adair-klotz constants.
instead, experimentalists widely use the adair-klotz approach in order to describe their experimental data.
