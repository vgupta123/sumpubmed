in addition clovr supports use of remote cloud computing resources to improve performance for large-scale sequence processing.
clovr is implemented as a single portable virtual machine  that provides several automated analysis pipelines for microbial genomics, including 16s, whole genome and metagenome sequence analysis.
cloud computing platforms provide on-demand access to computing infrastructure over the internet and can be used in combination with custom built virtual machines to distribute pre-packaged with pre-configured software.
the clovr vm runs on a personal computer, utilizes local computer resources and requires minimal installation, addressing key challenges in deploying bioinformatics workflows.
we describe the cloud virtual resource, clovr, a new desktop application for push-button automated sequence analysis that can utilize cloud computing resources.
the clovr vm and associated architecture lowers the barrier of entry for utilizing complex analysis protocols on both local single- and multi-core computers and cloud systems for high throughput data processing.
in a case study, we demonstrate the use of clovr to automatically process next-generation sequencing data on multiple cloud computing platforms.
next-generation sequencing technologies have decentralized sequence acquisition, increasing the demand for new bioinformatics tools that are easy to use, portable across multiple platforms, and scalable for high-throughput applications.
