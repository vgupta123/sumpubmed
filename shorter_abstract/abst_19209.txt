the unique feature of the algorithm, which is implemented in the inforbio software, is that it can identify the phenotypic characteristics that discriminate and are associated with the clusters of a phylogenetic tree.
thus, we devised an algorithm that objectively identifies discriminative characteristics for focused clusters on generated trees from a dataset composed of coded data, such as phenotypic information.
thresholds for the scores are defined to identify discriminative characteristics for clusters efficiently from a database.
the algorithm in the inforbio software is a novel and useful approach for microbial polyphasic studies.
the inforbio software is available from the download site .
genotypic information, such as ssu rrna gene sequences, now plays a more prominent role in microbial systematics than does phenotypic information.
we successfully applied this algorithm to the study of phylogenetic clusters of pseudomonas species.
there are a number of different methods for generation of trees and algorithms for phylogenetic analysis in the study of bacterial taxonomy.
however, the integration of genotypic and phenotypic information for polyphasic studies is necessary for the classification and identification of microbes.
