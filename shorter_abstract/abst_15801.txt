results of these fast-evolving methods are highly correlated with those of the historically standard dna-dna hybridization technique.
together, the results of these studies support the proposed division of the r. solanacearum species complex into three species, consistent with recent literature, and demonstrate the utility of proteomic and genomic approaches to delineate bacterial species.
they are thus a technically accessible replacement for species delineation.
this assay allowed us to clearly and easily differentiate phylotype ii and iv strains from phylotype i and iii strains.
further, genomic dissection of the pathway distinguished between proposed subspecies within the current phylotype iv.
here, we use several genomic comparison methods, supported by our own proteomic analyses and metabolic characterization as well as previously published dna-dna hybridization analyses, to differentiate members of the ralstonia solanacearum species complex into three species.
we used three different methods to compare the complete genomes of  <dig> strains from the r. solanacearum species complex.
proteomic profiles together with genomic sequence comparisons consistently and comprehensively described the diversity of the r. solanacearum species complex.
in addition, genome-driven functional phenotypic assays excitingly supported an old hypothesis ), that closely related members of the r. solanacearum could be identified through a simple assay of anaerobic nitrate metabolism.
the assay revealed large scale differences in energy production within the r. solanacearum species complex, indicating coarse evolutionary distance and further supporting a repartitioning of this group into separate species.
this pathogen group consists of diverse and widespread strains that cause bacterial wilt disease on many different plants.
