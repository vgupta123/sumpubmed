as laccase production is highly dependent on medium components and cultural conditions, optimization of the same is essential for efficient product production.
production of laccase by fungal strain marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig> under solid state fermentation was optimized by the taguchi design of experiments  methodology.

the optimum condition formulated was temperature , ph , galactose , cupric sulphate , inoculum concentration   and substrate length .
an orthogonal array  was designed using qualitek- <dig> software to study the interactions and relative influence of the seven selected factors by one factor at a time approach.
any successful application of the enzyme requires large scale production.
a final production of  <dig>  ± 13 iu/ml laccase activity paves way for the application of this strain for industrial applications.
study optimized lignin degrading laccases from marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig>  this laccases can thus be used for further applications in different scales of production after analyzing the properties of the enzyme.
statistical optimization leads to the elimination of an insignificant medium component ammonium dihydrogen phosphate from the process and contributes to a  <dig>  fold increase in enzyme production.
study also confirmed the use of taguchi method for optimizations of product production.
