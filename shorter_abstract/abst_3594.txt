while macrophages and t cells have been shown to be important in containing m. tuberculosis disease our study has shown that neutrophils may also play an important role in the containment of this organism.
m. tuberculosis mutants which grow and persist in the mouse lungs, but have attenuated disease progression, have the immunopathology  phenotype.
the antigenic properties of these strains may alter the progression of disease due to a reduction in host immune cell recruitment to the lungs resulting in disease attenuation and prolonged host survival.
aerosol infection of dba/ <dig> and scid mice with the m. tuberculosis Δsigc mutant, complemented mutant and wild type strain showed proliferation of mutant bacilli in mouse lungs, but with decreased inflammation and mortality in dba/ <dig> mice.
our observations suggest that the immunopathology phenotype is associated with the inability to trigger a strong early immune response, resulting in disease attenuation.
scid mice shared the same phenotype as the dba/ <dig> mice in response to the Δsigc mutant, however, they succumbed to the infection faster.
similarly, there was a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of scid mice.
in this study we focused on the mouse immune response to one such mutant; the m. tuberculosis Δsigc mutant.
a possible mechanism of attenuation in the Δsigc mutant may be a reduction in neutrophilic-influx in the alveolar spaces of the lungs, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion.
bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid analysis revealed elevated numbers of infiltrating neutrophils in the lungs of mice infected with wild type and complemented Δsigc mutant strains but not in mice infected with the Δsigc mutant.
