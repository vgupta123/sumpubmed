chemical bioavailability is an important dose metric in environmental risk assessment.
our results demonstrate that a prediction accuracy of r2 =  <dig> – <dig>  was achievable at a relatively low model complexity with as few as 3– <dig> predictor genes per model.
in the present study, we further compared  <dig> different regression models and performed variable selection simultaneously with parameter estimation.
these results are much more encouraging than our previous ones.
previously, we developed a new genomics-based approach that integrated microarray technology and regression modeling for predicting bioavailability  of explosives compounds in exposed earthworms.
