different polymorphisms have been described as markers to classify the lineages of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.
the analysis of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms  was used to describe seven snps cluster groups .
besides, the description of a new pattern shared by two isolates “scg-6c” reinforces the interest of snps to follow the evolution of m. tuberculosis complex.
the m. tuberculosis complex isolates collected in  <dig> in our region were analysed.
, ag85c <dig> and rdrio deletion were detected.
this work has permitted to achieve a better classification of aragonian strains into scgs and in some cases, to assign strains to its certain lineage.
