differences in microsatellite coverage and composition between symbiotic and non-symbiotic cnidaria suggest the presence/absence of dinoflagellates might place restrictions on the host genome.
sequences from the three available cnidarian genomes  were added to the analysis for a total of eleven species representing two classes, three subclasses and eight orders within the phylum cnidaria.
our results support previous studies that found tri- and tetranucleotides to be the most abundant motifs in invertebrates.
further, comparisons between cnidaria harboring intracellular dinoflagellates and those that do not, show microsatellite coverage is higher in the latter group.
trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeats were the most abundant motifs, followed by hexa- and dinucleotides.
microsatellite loci have high mutation rates and thus are indicative of mutational processes within the genome.
by concentrating on the symbiotic and aposymbiotic cnidarians, we investigated if microsatellite abundances follow a phylogenetic or ecological pattern.
