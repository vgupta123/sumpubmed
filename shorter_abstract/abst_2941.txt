approximately 98% of the  <dig> , <dig> amino acid sequences are matching, allowing instantaneous retrieval of their respective cross-references.
the corbank site contains also updated publication of the exhaustive results obtained by comparing refseq and genome reviews versions of each genome.
although such differences are acceptable as reflecting different views, we suggest that curators of both genome databases could help reducing further divergence by agreeing on a minimal dialogue and attempting to publish the point of view of the other database whenever it is technically possible.
we found that the refseq and genome reviews versions are perfectly matching for only  <dig> of the  <dig> complete genomes we have analyzed.
accordingly, this web site allows easy search of cross-references between refseq, genome reviews, and uniprot, for either a single cds or a whole replicon.
corbank is very efficient in rapid detection of the numerous differences existing between refseq and genome reviews versions of the same curated genome.
secondly, the two reannotated versions of the same genome differ at the level of their structural annotation.
