though it has some rgs selectivity, 5nd appears to be a partially random cysteine modifier.
the distinct expression patterns and pathophysiologic regulation of rgs proteins suggest that inhibitors may have therapeutic potential.
peptide 5nd activity is abolished by either changing its disulfide bridge to a methylene dithioether bridge, which cannot form disulfide bridges to the rgs, or by removing all cysteines from the rgs protein.
regulators of g protein signaling  accelerate gtp hydrolysis by gα subunits and profoundly inhibit signaling by g protein-coupled receptors .
these data suggest that it inhibits rgs <dig> by forming disulfide bridges with the protein.
we recently described a focused one-bead, one-compound  library screen to identify peptide inhibitors of rgs <dig>  here we extend our observations to include another peptide with a different mechanism of action.
however, no single cysteine in rgs <dig> is completely necessary or sufficient for 5nd activity.
peptide 5nd  blocks the rgs4-gαo interaction with an ic <dig> of  <dig> μm.
