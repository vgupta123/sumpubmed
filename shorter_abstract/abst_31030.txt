to determine if these effects occurred we instrumented twelve goats with peripheral and pulmonary arterial catheters to measure systemic and pulmonary pressures before and after etorphine administration.
the po <dig> gradient was not correlated with global changes in the ventilation perfusion ratio  but was correlated positively with the mean pulmonary artery pressure , indicating that pulmonary pressure played a significant role in altering pulmonary gas exchange.
whether etorphine-induced pulmonary hypertension negatively influences pulmonary gas exchange and exacerbates the effects of ventilator depression and the resultant hypoxemia is unknown.
attempts to alleviate etorphine-induced hypoxia therefore should focus not only on reversing the opioid-induced respiratory depression, but also on improving gas exchange by preventing etorphine-induced pulmonary hypertension.
etorphine, a potent opioid agonist, causes pulmonary hypertension and respiratory depression.

within 6 min of etorphine administration hypoxia was twice  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ) as poor than that expected from etorphine-induced hypoventilation alone.
etorphine induced hypoventilation  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ), hypoxia  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ), hypercapnia  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ) and pulmonary hypertension  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ).
this disparity appeared to result from a decrease in the movement of oxygen  across the alveoli membrane, as revealed by an increase in the po <dig> gradient  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ).
