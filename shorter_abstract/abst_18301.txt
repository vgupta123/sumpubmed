cisplatin treatment increased p <dig> and bax and decreased c-myc mrna expression, which was reversed upon co-culture with bmscs.
after 3 months, the apoptosis rate in the bmsc group was significantly lower than that of the control group .
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  on the apoptosis of granulosa cells  in rats.

cisplatin increased gc apoptosis from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the control and cisplatin treatment groups, respectively, which was significantly reduced upon co-culture with bmscs to  <dig> %.
bmsc therapy may protect against gc apoptosis induced by cisplatin and perimenopause.
gc apoptosis was analyzed by annexin v staining and real-time pcr analysis for apoptosis-related genes.
after  <dig> and 3 months, gc apoptosis was evaluated by tunel analysis.
as compared to young rats, increased apoptosis was observed in the perimenopausal rats .
the effect of bmscs was also determined in  <dig> to 10 month-old perimenopausal rats that were separated into the following groups: saline control, bmsc transplantation , and estrogen treatment  groups.
further studies are necessary to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of bmscs.
gcs were separated into one of the following three groups: an untreated control group , a cisplatin  treatment group , and group co-cultured with bmscs and treated with cisplatin .
