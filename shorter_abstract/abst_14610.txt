these results suggest that ppar-γ agonists like troglitazone may be useful in the clinical treatment of ibd.
we found that troglitazone , significantly reduced the tnf-α  mediated induction of endothelial madcam- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, achieving a  <dig> % to  <dig> % reduction in induced madcam- <dig>  trogliazone  reduced tnf-α induced vcam- <dig>  icam- <dig> and e-selectin expression.
cytokine mediated induction of the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- <dig> expression is associated with the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease .
moreover, troglitazone significantly reduced α4β7-integrin dependent lymphocyte adhesion to tnf-α cultured endothelial cells.
