the described technological solution and both its separate components slicsel and nasba-microarray technology independently are applicative for many different areas of microbial diagnostics.
using slicsel designed microarray probes and nasba we were able to detect s. pneumoniae tmrna from a series of total rna dilutions equivalent to the rna content of  <dig> - <dig> cfu.
a slicsel minimum binding energy difference criterion of  <dig> kcal/mol was sufficient to design of streptococcus pneumoniae tmrna specific microarray probes.
we present a comprehensive technological solution for bacterial diagnostics using tmrna as a marker molecule.
with lower binding energy difference criteria, additional hybridization specificity tests on the microarray were needed to eliminate non-specific probes.
we developed a new web-based program slicsel for the design of hybridization probes, based on nearest-neighbor thermodynamic modeling.
