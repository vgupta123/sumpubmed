the present study showed that the increased ros production and no release in activated bv- <dig> microglial cells by lps were associated with increased expression of nox- <dig> and inos.
dexamethasone  has been shown to suppress the ros production, no release and inflammatory reaction of activated microglial cells.
dex suppressed the upregulation of nox- <dig> and inos, as well as the subsequent ros production and no synthesis in activated bv- <dig> cells.
on the other hand, knockdown of nox- <dig> in bv- <dig> cells suppressed the lps-induced ros production and no release.
dex induced-suppression of nox- <dig> and -upregulation of mkp- <dig> was also evident in the activated microglia from corpus callosum of postnatal rat brains.
in conclusion, it is suggested that downregulation of nox- <dig> and overexpression of mkp- <dig> that regulate ros and no may form the potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.
nox-dependent ros generation and nitric oxide  release by microglia have been implicated in a variety of diseases in the central nervous system.
nox- <dig> , a subunit component of nadph oxidases, generates reactive oxygen species .
