the first aims to facilitate the coding process of clinical free texts contained in electronic health records and discharge summaries, whereas the second aims at improving information retrieval through electronic health records.
in addition to query normalizations and exact phonetic term matching, we tested two approximate string comparators: the similarity score function of stoilos and the normalized levenshtein edit distance.
according to the total number of suggestions , at a threshold comparator score of  <dig> , the normalized levenshtein edit distance gave the highest f-measure  and at a threshold comparator score of  <dig> , the stoilos function gave the highest f-measure .
despite the widely known high performance of the normalized edit distance of levenshtein, we show in this paper that its combination with the stoilos algorithm improved the results for misspelling correction of user queries.
these encouraging results have enabled the integration of this method into two projects funded by the french national research agency-technologies for health care.
several methods have been proposed to improve information retrieval: query expansion, syntactic and semantic techniques or knowledge-based methods.
the internet is a major source of health information but most seekers are not familiar with medical vocabularies.
we propose here to combine them to increase the number of matched medical terms in french.
however, queries are composed by several terms that may be combination of medical terms.
accuracy is improved by combining spelling, phoneme-based information and string normalizations and segmentations into medical terms.
in this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method in order to correct misspellings of queries submitted by health information seekers to a medical online search tool.
