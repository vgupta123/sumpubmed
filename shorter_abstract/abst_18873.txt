the tag array experiments can have a complex experimental design, such as time course measurements and drug treatment with multiple dosages.
it also has a downloadable version for execution on pcs running windows.
tagsmart has the following advantages over previously described analysis procedures: 1) it is user-friendly software rather than merely a description of analytical procedure; 2) it can handle complicated experimental designs, such as multiple time points and treatment with multiple dosages; 3) it has higher sensitivity and specificity; 4) it allows users to mask out "bad" tags in the analysis.
a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants  of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been systematically constructed.
tagsmart identified  <dig> mutant strains as sensitive to cincreasin treatment.
tag microarrays are widely used to measure the fitness of each mutant in a mutant mixture.
first, we generated titration mixtures of mutant strains, in which the relative concentration of each strain was controlled.
tagsmart is a web application for analysis and visualization of saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant fitness data measured by tag microarrays.
tagsmart web application is assessable by windows, mac, and linux users.
it implements a robust statistical approach to assess the concentration differences among s. cerevisiae mutant strains.
