initial experiments indicated that about 2% of the total proteins characterized were expressed at different levels in isolates with or without the prophage.
additional experiments were conducted using c. jejuni isolates with and without cjie <dig> grown on four different media: mueller hinton  media containing blood; mh media containing  <dig> % sodium deoxycholate, which is thought to result in increased expression of virulence proteins; mh media containing  <dig> % oxgall; and mhwithout additives.
it has recently been demonstrated that the presence of the prophage cjie <dig> is associated with increased adherence and invasion of c. jejuni isolates in cell culture assays.
the presence of the cjie <dig> prophage was associated with differences in protein expression levels under different conditions.
they also demonstrated a general bile response involving a majority of the proteome and clearly showed the induction of almost all proteins known to be involved with iron acquisition.
quantitative comparative proteomics experiments were undertaken using three closely related isolates with cjie <dig> and one isolate without cjie <dig> to determine whether there was a corresponding difference in protein expression levels.
these experiments provided further evidence that cjie <dig> affected protein expression, including virulence-associated proteins.
