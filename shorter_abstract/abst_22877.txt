the dbvor database allows us to select subsets of the data by several different criteria and to merge their results into a coherent and consistent whole.
in addition, we store pedigree and phenotype data for our subjects.
when studying the genetics of a human trait, we typically have to manage both genome-wide and targeted genotype data.
the results can be presented in columnar, mega <dig>  or plink format.
we have developed the dbvor database, which is designed to hold data efficiently for both genome-wide and targeted experiments.
