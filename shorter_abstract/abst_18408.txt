for the decision on the presence or absence of a particular function under noisy conditions we propose a statistical mixture model enabling unsupervised estimation of a detection threshold.
the annotation of biomolecular functions is an essential step in the analysis of newly sequenced organisms.
we simulated the de novo prediction of biomolecular functions for arabidopsis thaliana using a comprehensive rna-seq data set.
our results indicate that the prediction of the biomolecular functions from the kegg database is possible with a high sensitivity up to  <dig> percent.
the analysis of an organismâ€™s transcriptome can provide a solid basis for the prediction of biomolecular functions.
we have conducted a study to investigate to what degree it is possible to reconstruct the functional profile of an organism from unassembled transcriptome data.
using rna-seq short reads directly, the functional profile of an organism can be reconstructed in a computationally efficient way to provide a draft annotation in cases where the classical genome-based approaches cannot be applied.
we evaluated the prediction performance using several homology search methods in combination with different evidence measures.
up to now, it is unclear how much of the functional repertoire of an organism can be reliably predicted from unassembled rna-seq short reads alone.
for functional analysis it is also possible to use a de novo transcriptome assembly but the computational requirements can be demanding.
furthermore, we found that our statistical approach even outperforms the prediction from a de novo transcriptome assembly.
