we discuss adjustments for technical variability, data quality assessment, model parameter fitting and fit diagnostics, choice of scale, and assessment of statistical significance.
the reliable extraction of presence, absence, and strength of interactions provides insights into molecular mechanisms.
the interpretation of co-rnai data requires computational and statistical analysis in order to detect interactions reliably and sensitively.
systematic measurement of genetic interactions by combinatorial rnai  is a powerful tool for mapping functional modules and discovering components.
as a result, we obtain quantitative genetic interactions and interaction networks reflecting known biological relationships between target genes.
