dicer <dig> is dispensable for formation and differentiation of fetal tissues derived from the sf1-positive adrenogonadal primordium.
however, increasing numbers of apoptotic cells were first detected in the dicer <dig> knockout adrenal cortex at  <dig>  days post coitum , followed by apoptosis of somatic cells and germ cells in the testis at postnatal day  <dig>  affected adrenal and testes underwent complete degeneration  <dig> hrs after the onset of apoptosis.
dicer <dig> is essential for maintaining cell survival in adrenal and testis; however, development of the ovary from fetal stages to postnatal day  <dig> does not require the presence of dicer <dig>  our results reveal a tissue-specific requirement of dicer <dig> and micrornas.
lack of dicer <dig> in the sf1-positive cells did not affect formation and early differentiation of the adrenals and gonads.
to target dicer <dig> deletion specifically in developing adrenals and gonads, we used steroidogenic factor 1-cre  line in which cre recombinase is active in the progenitor cells of adrenals and gonads.
