this study used mlva methodology providing a new perspective on the ethnic groups and distribution characteristics of h. pylori.
<dig> vntr loci presented with high various polymorphisms, and the results demonstrated very close relationships between genotypes and ethnic groups.
h. pylori  is the major causative agent of chronic active gastritis.
the population of h. pylori shows a high genomic variability among isolates.
its long term colonization of the stomach caused different clinical outcomes, which may relate to the high degree of genetic variation of h. pylori.
a variety of molecular typing tools have been developed to access genetic relatedness in h. pylori isolates.
the mlva  method is useful for performing phylogenetic analysis and is widely used in bacteria genotyping; however, there's little application in h. pylori analysis.
this article is the first application of the mlva method to investigate h. pylori from different districts and ethnic groups of china.
mlva of  <dig> vntr loci with high discrimination power based on  <dig> candidates were performed on a collection of  <dig> strains of h. pylori which originated from five regions of china and japan.
