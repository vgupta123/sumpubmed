the aim was to determine the possible involvement of swine h1n <dig> iav strain on reproductive disorders in pregnant gilts under experimental conditions.
the results of the study indicate that infection of pregnant gilts with swine h1n <dig> iav in the second month of pregnancy does not cause abortion and other reproduction disorders.
however, due to subclinical course of influenza in the present experiment caution should be taken in extrapolating these results to the cases of acute influenza.
the course of swine influenza in pigs is reported to be similar to human influenza.
the serum concentrations of c-reactive protein remained stable during study, while haptoglobin concentrations increased significantly after inoculation.
abortions may be a consequence of high fever, pro-inflammatory cytokines or transplacental transmission of the virus.
no evidence for transplacental transmission of swine h1n <dig> iav was found.
occasionally abortions and other reproduction disorders have been associated with influenza a virus  infection in pigs.
the gestation length was from  <dig> to  <dig> days, no abortion or any other reproduction disorders were noted.

it cannot be excluded that other subtypes of iav could be associated to reproduction failure in pigs.
in the nasal swabs from control gilts and newborn piglets, no iav genetic material was found.
a pcr assay confirms the presence of iav in the nasal swabs taken from inoculated gilts between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.
the role of iav in the complications observed during pregnancy has been scanty and the true importance of this agent as a cause of reproductive problems in swine is not known.
the other limitation is iav diversity.
