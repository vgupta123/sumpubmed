the two tests were in accordance at sbv-neutralizing antibody titers of 1: <dig> or higher.
schmallenberg virus  first emerged in europe in  <dig>  and in sweden in late  <dig>  the virus was still circulating in parts of europe in  <dig>  in recent testing, the virus has not been detected in swedish domestic animals, indicating that it is no longer circulating in sweden.
the sampling occurred in the southern and middle part of sweden during three time periods: 1) before the vector season in  <dig>  2) after the vector season in  <dig>  and 3) after the vector season in  <dig>  animals from periods  <dig> and  <dig> were of varying ages, whereas animals collected in period  <dig> were born after the vector season  <dig>  animals from period  <dig>  and  <dig>  were seronegative, but, 53%  of animals from period  <dig> were seropositive, determined by sbv competitive elisa.
interpretations are limited by the small sample-size, but the results suggest that the sbv competitive elisa has high specificity but might have slightly lower sensitivity compared to a seroneutralization assay, when using samples from wild cervids.
ninety-two sera from moose , red deer , fallow deer , and roe deer  were collected and analyzed for antibodies against sbv.

the aim of this study was to investigate whether sbv has circulated, and is still circulating among wild cervids in sweden.
our results show that sbv circulated among wild cervids during the vector season of  <dig>  three years later, no sbv-antibodies were detected in animals born after the vector season  <dig>  the likely absence of sbv circulation in sweden, in contrast to other parts of europe, might be explained by the annual occurrence of a vector-free season due to climate conditions.
such antibodies were detected in 16/ <dig> sbv-n-antibody-positive, 3/ <dig> negative and 2/ <dig> doubtful sera.
