further, the two different ops evoked distinguishable changes in gene expression; about half the differences are in genes involved in detoxification, likely reflecting differences in the chemical structure of the two ops.
to elucidate early steps in the mechanisms of op toxicity, we studied alterations in global gene and protein expression in caenorhabditis elegans exposed to ops using microarrays and mass spectrometry.
changes in the expression of a number of sequences of unknown function were also discovered, and these molecules could provide insight into novel mechanisms of op toxicity or adaptation in future studies.
many of the genes and proteins affected by the ops are expressed in neuronal and muscle tissues and are involved in lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, apoptosis/cell death, and detoxification.
the wide use of organophosphorus  pesticides makes them an important public health concern.
persistent effects of exposure and the mechanism of neuronal degeneration are continuing issues in op toxicology.
exposure to ops elicits a pattern of changes in gene expression in exposed worms distinct from that of the unrelated neurotoxicant, mefloquine.
