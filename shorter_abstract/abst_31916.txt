in this paper, we construct a new clustering algorithm for predicting protein complexes through the use of genetic algorithms.

the application of earlier clustering techniques to protein–protein interaction networks in order to predict protein complexes within the networks does not yield good results due to the small-world and power-law properties of these networks.
our algorithm can identify protein complexes that are significantly enriched in the gold-standard data sets.
protein–protein interaction networks are receiving increased attention due to their importance in understanding life at the cellular level.
although clustering techniques have been proposed for clustering protein–protein interaction networks, those techniques suffer from some drawbacks.
we design an objective function for exclusive clustering and overlapping clustering.
