the total assay time was only three hours, including the time required for the dna extraction, pcr and microarray steps in sequence.
during the course of a bacterial infection, the rapid identification of the causative agent is necessary for the determination of effective treatment options.
the feasibility of this assay in routine diagnostic testing was evaluated using  <dig> blood culture positive and  <dig> blood culture negative samples.
comparison of our results with those of a conventional culture-based method revealed a sensitivity of 96%  and specificity of 98%.
we included meca-specific primers and probes in the same assay to indicate the presence of methicillin resistance in the bacterial species.
we have developed a method based on a modified broad-range pcr and an oligonucleotide microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of  <dig> bacterial pathogens at the species level.
the broad-range pcr primer mixture was designed using conserved regions of the bacterial topoisomerase genes gyrb and pare.
the probes on the microarray were designed from the alignments of species- or genus-specific variable regions of the gyrb and pare genes flanked by the primers.
