interaction of proteins with other molecules plays an important role in many biological activities.
we analyzed the huge amount of structure data for the hydrogen bonding interactions between proteins and nucleic acids and developed a database called dbbp .
analysis of the huge amount of structure data of protein-nucleic acid complexes is labor-intensive, yet provides useful information for studying protein-nucleic acid interactions.
however, the information on the binding sites between proteins and nucleic acids is not readily available from the structure data since the data consists mostly of the three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms in the complexes.
dbbp provides the detailed information of hydrogen-bonding interactions between proteins and nucleic acids at various levels from the atomic level to the residue level.
the binding information can be used as a valuable resource for developing a computational method aiming at predicting new binding sites in proteins or nucleic acids.
dbbp contains  <dig>  hydrogen bonds  of protein-dna interactions and  <dig>  h-bonds of protein-rna interactions.
as many structures of protein-dna complexes and protein-rna complexes have been determined in the past years, several databases have been constructed to provide structure data of the complexes.
