cells lacking apra or cfad proliferate faster than wild-type cells, and adding recombinant apra or cfad to cells slows their proliferation.
compared with wild-type cells, the proliferation of galpha8-, galpha9- and gbeta- cells are only weakly inhibited by recombinant apra .
this study shows that galpha <dig> and gbeta are part of the signal transduction pathway used by apra to inhibit proliferation but not growth in dictyostelium, whereas galpha <dig> is part of a differealnt pathway that regulates both proliferation and growth, and that a chalone signal transduction pathway uses g proteins.
both apra-induced gtp binding and the gtpgammas inhibition of rapra binding require galpha <dig> and gbeta but not galpha <dig>  like apra- cells, galpha8- cells have reduced spore viability.
galpha8- cells show normal cell-surface binding of rapra, whereas galpha9- and gbeta- cells have fewer cell-surface rapra binding sites, suggesting that galpha <dig> and gbeta regulate the synthesis or processing of the apra receptor.
we show here that cells lacking the g protein components galpha <dig>  galpha <dig>  and gbeta proliferate faster than wild-type cells despite secreting normal or high levels of apra and cfad.
