dna of the sorted arm was amplified and sequenced using an illumina hiseq  <dig> with ~45x coverage.
by exploring the 5mg short arm  of aegilops geniculata, we can apply chromosome genomics for the discovery of snp markers and their use for monitoring alien introgressions in wheat .
the short arm of chromosome 5mg of ae.
monitoring alien introgressions in crop plants is difficult due to the lack of genetic and molecular mapping information on the wild crop relatives.
of the selected snps, 97% mapped to a chromosome 5mg addition to wheat , and 94% to 5mg introgressed from a different accession of ae.
the tertiary gene pool of wheat is a very important source of genetic variability for wheat improvement against biotic and abiotic stresses.
the sequence data was used for snp discovery against wheat homoeologous group- <dig> assemblies.
a total of  <dig>  unique, 5mgs-specific snps were discovered.
randomly selected samples of  <dig> 5mgs-specific snps were tested  and 84% were validated.
geniculata substituting for chromosome 5d of wheat.
the development of a large number of snp markers will facilitate the precise introgression and monitoring of alien segments in crop breeding programs and further enable mapping and cloning novel genes from the wild relatives of crop plants.
snps , tagging chromosome t5dl · 5ds-5mgs with the smallest introgression carrying resistance to leaf rust  and stripe rust , were validated in two released germplasm lines with lr <dig> and yr <dig> genes.
