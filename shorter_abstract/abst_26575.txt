using the cq method, we successfully identified known y sequences from homo sapiens and drosophila melanogaster.
the chromosome quotient  is a novel approach to systematically discover y chromosome genes.
all six genes are expressed in the early embryo.
the anopheles y genes discovered by the cq method provide unique markers for population and phylogenetic analysis, and opportunities for novel mosquito control measures through the manipulation of sexual dimorphism and fertility.
y chromosomes are responsible for the initiation of male development, male fertility, and other male-related functions in diverse species.
the cq method can reliably identify y chromosome sequences using the ratio of alignments from male and female sequence data.
comparisons to transcriptome sequence data with blastn led to the discovery of six anopheles y genes, three from each species.
the cq method is widely applicable to species with fragmented genome assemblies produced from next-generation sequencing data.
however, y genes are rarely characterized outside a few model species due to the arduous nature of studying the repeat-rich y.
stephensi y genes were recently acquired from the autosomes or the x. although an.
gambiae belong to the same subgenus, we found no evidence of y genes shared between the species.
analysis of the six y genes characterized in this study indicates rapid y chromosome evolution between an.
the female to male ratio of the number of alignments to a reference sequence, a parameter called the chromosome quotient , is used to determine whether the sequence is y-linked.
in the cq method, genomic dna from males and females is sequenced independently and aligned to candidate reference sequences.
the cq method facilitated the discovery of y chromosome sequences from the malaria mosquitoes anopheles stephensi and an.
