rmse is based on the level of error of prediction whereas auc is based on binary classification task.
chlorophyll-a have been used to estimate algal biomass in aquatic ecosystem as it is common in most algae.
fl and rann models were developed using parameters selected through sensitivity analysis.
same data set was used for models development and the data was divided into two sets; training and testing to avoid biasness in results.
rmse, r, and auc values for mlr model were , fl model were , rann model were  and hea model were  respectively.
performances of the models are assessed using root mean square error , correlation coefficient , and area under the receiving operating characteristic  curve .
the selected variables were water temperature, ph, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and secchi depth.
this study assesses four predictive ecological models; fuzzy logic , recurrent artificial neural network , hybrid evolutionary algorithm  and multiple linear regressions  to forecast chlorophyll- a concentration using limnological data from  <dig> through  <dig> of unstratified shallow, oligotrophic to mesotrophic tropical putrajaya lake .
algal biomass indicates of the trophic status of a water body.
hea model used parameters selected using genetic algorithm .
performance inconsistencies between four models in terms of performance criteria in this study resulted from the methodology used in measuring the performance.
dissolved oxygen, selected through stepwise procedure, was used to develop the mlr model.
the selected parameters were ph, secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen.
