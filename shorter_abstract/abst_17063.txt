the histopathological lesions observed in the pituitary gland included hemorrhage, congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration, hydropic degeneration, necrosis and edema.
whole blood was collected in edta vials at stipulated time points , while tissue sections of the pituitary glands were collected and transported to the histopathology laboratory in 10% buffered formalin for processing and hematoxylin and eosin staining.

lastly, groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  were orally and subcutaneously inoculated with 10 ml of bacterial omps.
group  <dig>  served as the negative control group and were inoculated orally with 10 ml sterile phosphate buffer saline , groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  were inoculated orally and subcutaneously with 10 ml of  <dig> colony forming unit  of p.multocida type b:  <dig>  while groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  received 10 ml of bacterial lps orally and intravenously, respectively.
hemorrhagic septicemia is a fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes caused by p. multocida.
in this study, twenty one healthy prepubertal female buffaloes aged 8 months were divided into seven groups of  <dig> buffaloes each .
these changes were higher  in distribution and severity in g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  hormonal concentrations of lh, fsh, pg, est and gnrh declined in all inoculation groups as time elapsed and were lower  than that of the control group.
although the pathogenesis of the bacteria has been well established in literature, there is a paucity of information on the possible role of the bacteria and its immunogens; lipopolysaccharide  and outer membrane proteins  on the reproductive capacity of buffalo heifers.
based on these findings, p.multocida b:  <dig> and its immunogens can be said to negatively affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in decreased levels of reproductive hormones which may predispose to infertility in buffalo heifers.
