meta-qtl analyses identified a common chromosomal region that plays an important role in fiber development.
in the present study, we used  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  markers, which included  <dig>  gossypium raimondii  sequence-based ssr markers to identify polymorphism between two upland cotton strains 0– <dig> and sgk <dig>  a total of  <dig> polymorphic primers were finally selected and used to genotype  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  derived from a cross between  <dig> and  <dig> and sgk <dig> and used to construct a linkage map.
the map covered a distance of  <dig>  cm, which represents about  <dig>  % of the upland cotton genome, and with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
meta-clusters on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were identified as stable qtl clusters and were considered more valuable in mas for the improvement of fiber quality of upland cotton.

the identification of quantitative trait loci  that are stable and consistent across multiple environments and populations plays an essential role in marker-assisted selection .
we identified  <dig> qtls for fiber quality traits, of which  <dig> qtls were determined to be stable across multiple environments.
the broad sense heritability estimates of fiber quality traits were high for fiber length , fiber strength , fiber micronaire , and fiber uniformity , but low for fiber elongation .
the ril population was evaluated for fiber quality traits in six locations in china for five years.
a meta-analysis was performed using biomercator v <dig>  to integrate qtls from  <dig> environmental datasets on the ril populations of the above mentioned parents and previous qtl reports.
multiple environmental evaluations of an intraspecific ril population were conducted to identify stable qtls.
sixteen clusters in the at sub-genome comprised  <dig> qtls, whereas  <dig> clusters in the dt sub-genome that included  <dig> qtls for fiber quality were identified.
therefore, qtls identified in the present study are an ideal candidate for mas in cotton breeding programs to improve fiber quality.
stable qtls identified in this intraspecific cross could be used in future cotton breeding program and with fewer obstacles.
