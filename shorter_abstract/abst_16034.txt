horizon charts are a relatively new visualization method that, under the right circumstances, maximizes data density without losing graphical perception.
horizon charts have been successfully applied to understand multi-metric time series data.
we have adapted an existing javascript library  that implements horizon charts for the time series domain so that it works effectively with genomic datasets.
horizon charts can be an effective visual tool to explore complex and large genomic datasets.
we call this new library dnaism.
computational biologists daily face the need to explore massive amounts of genomic data.
