we show that this result is robust against the system used to define duplicate genes.
moreover these duplicate genes have more often arisen through whole-genome rather than small-scale duplication.
finally, self-interacting wgd genes tend to have more interaction partners in general in the pin, which can be explained by their overall greater age.
this work adds to our growing knowledge of the importance of contextual factors in gene duplicability.
there is increasing interest in the evolution of protein-protein interactions because this should ultimately be informative of the patterns of evolution of new protein functions within the cell.
one model proposes that the evolution of new protein-protein interactions and protein complexes proceeds through the duplication of self-interacting genes.
we examined the relationship between gene duplication and self-interaction in the human genome.
after controlling for age differences between the two sets of duplicates this result can be explained by the time since the gene duplication.
we investigated the patterns of self-interaction and duplication among  <dig> interactions encoded by  <dig> human genes, and show that self-interacting proteins are encoded by genes with higher duplicability than genes whose proteins lack this type of interaction.
