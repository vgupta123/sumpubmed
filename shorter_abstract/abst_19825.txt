although the features of the trg and tra/trd loci organization reflect those of the so far examined artiodactyls, genomic results highlight in dolphin an unusually simple trg locus.
expression analysis from blood of a subject allowed us to assign unambiguously eight trav genes to those annotated in the genomic sequence and to twelve new genes, belonging to five different subgroups.
comparing multiple different individuals, evidence is found for a “public” gamma delta tcr repertoire thus suggesting that in dolphins as in human the gamma delta tcr repertoire is accompanied by selection for public gamma chain.
blood and skin from four unrelated subjects expression data provide evidence for an unusual ratio of productive/unproductive transcripts which arise from the trg v-j gene rearrangement and for a “public” gamma delta tr repertoire.
the cdna analysis reveal productive tra/trd transcripts and unusual ratios of productive/unproductive trg transcripts.
the high frequency of trgv1-j2/trdv1- d1-j <dig> productive rearrangements in dolphins may represent an interesting oligo-clonal population comparable to that found in human with the trgv9- jp/trdv2-d-j t cells and in primates.
the bottlenose dolphin  is a mammal that belongs to the cetartiodactyla and have lived in marine ecosystems for nearly  <dig> millions years.
the dolphin trg locus is the smallest and simplest of all mammalian loci as yet studied.
the productive cdna sequences, shared both in the same and in different individuals, include biases of the trgv <dig> and trgj <dig> genes.

we have identified in silico the trg and tra/trd genes and analyzed the relevant mature transcripts in blood and in skin from four subjects.
it shows a genomic organization comprising two variable , three joining  and a single constant , genes.
