the h3k4me <dig> chip-seq data from this study paves the way to understanding the chromatin landscape and epigenomic architecture of xylogenesis in plants, and complements rna-seq evidence of gene expression for the future improvement of the e. grandis genome annotation.
in developing e. grandis xylem, h3k4me <dig> enrichment is an indicator of active transcription, consistent with its known role in sustaining pre-initiation complex formation in yeast.
we investigated the role of the modified histone h3k4me <dig>  in gene expression during the early stages of wood formation using chip-seq in eucalyptus grandis, a woody biomass model.
h3k4me <dig> library coverage, peaking ~ <dig> -  <dig> bp downstream of the transcription start site, was highly correlated with gene expression levels measured with rna-seq.
a “nano-chip-seq” procedure was employed for chip dna amplification.
investigating chromatin organization in wood-forming tissue and its role in regulating gene expression allows us to understand the mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation during xylogenesis  and identify novel functional regions in plant genomes.
relative expression of h3k4me3-enriched genes in developing secondary xylem was higher than unenriched genes, however, and highly expressed secondary cell wall-related genes were enriched for h3k4me <dig> as validated using chip-qpcr.

histone modifications play an integral role in plant development, but have been poorly studied in woody plants.
however, woody tissue poses unique challenges for using high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation  techniques for studying genome-wide histone modifications in vivo.
