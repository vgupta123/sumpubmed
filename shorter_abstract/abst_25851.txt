borrelia miyamotoi is the only relapsing fever spirochete transmitted by the same tick.
the aim of the present study was to perform an epidemiological survey to determine the presence of b. burgdorferi sensu lato in rodents occurring in slovenia and to explore the presence of borrelia miyamotoi.
borrelia miyamotoi dna was detected in 1/ <dig>  and in 1/ <dig>  heart specimens, in the retrospective and prospective parts of the study, respectively.
during the prospective part of the study, borrelia was isolated from 2/ <dig>  lung specimens and from 10/ <dig>  heart specimens of rodents.
borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of lyme borreliosis, is mainly maintained in natural foci through the transmission cycles of competent tick vectors  and a vertebrate reservoir.
borrelia dna was successfully detected by one or other of the pcr methods in 18/ <dig>  and 75/ <dig>  samples in the prospective and retrospective studies, respectively.
specific rodents have been identified as the principal reservoir of borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in europe.
we determined the prevalence of b. afzelii in rodents and report for the first time the presence of b. miyamotoi in slovenia.
detection and identification of borrelia was performed by molecular methods and additionally in the prospective study by isolation and genotyping .
all isolated strains were identified as b. afzelii subtype mla <dig>  and mlst analysis revealed  <dig> distinct sequence types.
