the high ppo legume, red clover, has a significant economic and environmental role in sustaining low-input organic and conventional farms.
multiple ppo <dig> copies were identified and characterised revealing a subfamily comprising three variants ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig>  six ppo genes clustered within the genome: four separate bac clones could be assembled onto a predicted 190– <dig> kb single bac contig.
in relation to the food industry, ppo-induced browning causes unacceptable discolouration in fruit and vegetables: from an agriculture perspective, ppo can protect plants against pathogens and environmental stress, improve ruminant growth by increasing nitrogen absorption and decreasing nitrogen loss to the environment through the animal's urine.
a bacterial artificial chromosome  library comprising  <dig>  bac clones with an average  <dig> kb insert size, was constructed from trifolium pratense l. , a diploid legume with a haploid genome size of 440– <dig> mb.
this ppo cluster covers a longer region of the genome than clusters detected in rice or previously reported in tomato.
two single copy ppo genes, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  were identified to add to a family of three, previously reported, paralogous genes .
three of these genes have high homology, suggesting a more recent evolutionary event.
molecular markers for a range of important agricultural traits are being developed for red clover and improved knowledge of ppo genes and their structure will facilitate molecular breeding.
full-length coding sequences from ppo <dig>  ppo <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> will facilitate functional studies and provide genetic markers for plant breeding.
a ppo gene family in red clover resides as a cluster of at least  <dig> genes.
