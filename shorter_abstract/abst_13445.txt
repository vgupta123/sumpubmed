moreover, we identified  <dig> target genes of known and new mirnas and ta-sirnas.
however, little is known about mirnas involved in maize ear development.
we used deep-sequencing, mirna microarray assays and computational methods to identify, profile, and describe conserved and non-conserved mirnas at four ear developmental stages, which resulted in identification of  <dig> conserved and 21-maize-specific mirna families together with their corresponding mirna*.
identification and characterization of these important classes of regulatory genes in maize may improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling ear development.
the objective of this study is to identify conserved and novel mirnas and their target genes by combined small rna and degradome sequencing at four inflorescence developmental stages.
comparison of mirna expression in these developmental stages revealed  <dig> differentially expressed mirna families.
in plants, micrornas  are endogenous ~ <dig> nt rnas that play important regulatory roles in many aspects of plant biology, including metabolism, hormone response, epigenetic control of transposable elements, and stress response.
in maize, most mirnas and their target genes were analyzed and identified by clearly different treatments, such as response to low nitrate, salt and drought stress.
this study confirmed  <dig> conserved mirna families and discovered  <dig> novel mirnas in maize.
finally, a total of  <dig> genes  targeted by  <dig> small rnas including  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> ta-sirnas were identified by genomic-scale high-throughput sequencing of mirna cleaved mrnas.
of these,  <dig> genes  targeted by  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas may attribute to the development of maize ears.
extensive studies of mirnas have been performed in model plants such as rice and arabidopsis thaliana.
