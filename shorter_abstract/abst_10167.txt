leptin, triglyceride  and cholesterol levels were higher in the obese group .
adiponectin and 5ht levels were higher in the lean group compared to the obese group .
serotonin  is associated with numerous behavioral and psychological factors and is a biochemical marker of mood.
the aim of this study was to find any differences in leptin, adiponectin, and 5ht between lean and obese dogs and to identify correlations among these factors.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate peripheral 5ht levels in obese dogs.
5ht is an important appetite control neurotransmitter, but there are limited studies for 5ht levels related to obesity in dogs.
leptin , tg  and cholesterol  were positively correlated with body condition score , and adiponectin  and 5ht  were negatively correlated with bcs.
5ht is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of energy consumption.
further studies will be needed to further elucidate the role of low serum 5ht levels in canine obesity.
from this research, we can assume that 5ht may be correlated with canine obesity.
