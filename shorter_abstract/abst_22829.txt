we characterized the bacterial symbionts of megastigmus , a lineage of seed-parasitic chalcid wasps, with the goal of identifying microbes that might play an important role in aiding development within seeds, including supplementing insect nutrition or manipulating host trees.
douglas-fir ovules and the parasitoid eurytoma sp.
the success of herbivorous insects has been shaped largely by their association with microbes.
the bacterial community associated with m. spermotrophus remained constant throughout wasp development and was dominated by a single otu â€“ a strain of ralstonia, in the betaproteobacteria, comprising over 55% of all bacterial otus from megastigmus samples.
we also performed culture independent surveys of larvae, pupae, and adults of m. spermotrophus using  <dig> pyrosequencing.
were also surveyed using pyrosequencing to help elucidate possible transmission mechanisms of the microbial associates of m. spermotrophus.
the m. spermotrophus microbiome is dominated by five bacterial otus, including lineages commonly found in other insect microbiomes and in environmental samples.
little is known about the microbial associates of seed-parasitic insects.
the developing wasp larva feeds on megagametophyte tissue, which contains the seed storage reserves and is especially rich in nitrogen.
males and females were infected at similar frequencies, suggesting that these bacteria do not distort sex ratios.
this is the first report of ralstonia being an abundant and potentially important member of an insect microbiome, although other closely-related betaproteobacteria, such as burkholderia, are important insect symbionts.
this major pest of douglas-fir is the best-studied megastigmus, and was previously shown to manipulate its tree host into redirecting resources towards unfertilized ovules.
future studies using ralstonia-specific markers will determine its distribution in other megastigmus species, its mode of transmission, and its role in wasp nutrition.
