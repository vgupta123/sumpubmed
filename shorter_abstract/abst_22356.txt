the gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  are common sources of functionally grouped gene sets.
we define a series of gene set consistency metrics directly related to the most common classes of statistical analyses for gene expression data, and then perform a comprehensive analysis of  <dig> affymetrixÂ® gene expression arrays across  <dig> diverse bacteria.
despite the widespread use of go and kegg gene sets in bacterial gene expression data analysis, the seed and microbesonline provide more consistent sets for a wide variety of statistical analyses.
increased use of the seed and microbesonline gene sets in the analysis of bacterial gene expression data may improve statistical power and utility of expression data.
statistical analyses of whole genome expression data require functional information about genes in order to yield meaningful biological conclusions.
