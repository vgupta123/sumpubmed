gene-expression profiles were derived from laser microdissected hpc niches from lobular dissecting hepatitis  and normal liver tissue, with a focus on wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling.
gene-expression confirmed higher expression of wnt/β-catenin and notch pathway components and target genes in activated hpc niches in diseased liver compared to quiescent hpc niches from normal liver.
immunohistochemistry showed proliferating hpcs during ldh, and double immunofluorescence showed downregulation of wnt/β-catenin and notch in differentiating hpcs.
vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, was expressed on a subset of undifferentiated hpcs.
however, as is the case in severe liver diseases, this replication may become insufficient or exhausted and hepatic progenitor cells  can be activated in an attempt to restore liver function.
