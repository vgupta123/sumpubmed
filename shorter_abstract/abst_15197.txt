our data suggest that peroxynitrite is involved, at least in part, in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and protein nitration.
however, it has not completely established if reactive nitrogen species and nitrosative stress are involved in this experimental model.
in rats treated with cisplatin , renal nitrosative stress was made evident by the increase in 3-nitrotyrosine on day  <dig>  in addition, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was evident by the histological damage of proximal tubular cells and by the increase in  serum creatinine,  blood urea nitrogen, and  urinary excretion of n-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and total protein.
cisplatin-induced nitrosative stress and nephrotoxicity were attenuated by fetpps-treatment .
nitrosative stress is involved in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.
oxidative stress is involved in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity.
