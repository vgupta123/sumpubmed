we applied this novel methodology to an in-house developed customized work flow enabling clinical-grade analysis of all iem with a known genetic basis, represented by a database containing  <dig> disease genes which is continuously updated.
the strategy conforms to international guidelines for clinical mps, as only validated disease genes are investigated and as clinical specialists take responsibility for translation of results.
we have developed a conceptually novel approach for acute mps, by analysing pulsed whole genome sequence data in real time, using automated analysis combined with data reduction and parallelization.
we have adapted mps to fit into the dynamic, multidisciplinary work-flow of acute metabolic medicine.
as the extent of irreversible damage in patients with iem often correlates with timing and accuracy of management in early, critical disease stages, our novel methodology is predicted to improve patient outcome.
the correct disease-causing mutations were identified and presented to the clinical team after  <dig> and 18 hours from start of sequencing, respectively.
in many cases irreversible damage can be reduced by initiation of specific treatment, provided that a correct molecular diagnosis can be rapidly obtained.
massively parallel dna sequencing  has the potential to revolutionize diagnostics, in particular for monogenic disorders.
inborn errors of metabolism  constitute a large group of monogenic disorders with highly variable clinical presentation, often with acute, nonspecific initial symptoms.
