furthermore, patients infected by caga strains possessing more than one epiya c segment showed decreased serum levels of pepsinogen i in comparison with those infected by strains containing one or less epiya c repeat.
higher number of epiya c segments was also associated with gastric precancerous lesions as demonstrated by histological gastric atrophic and metaplastic changes and decreased serum levels of pepsinogen i.
the number of epiya c segments was significantly associated with the increased risk of gastric carcinoma  even after adjustment for age and gender.
higher number of epiya c segments was also associated with gastric atrophy  and intestinal metaplasia .
otherwise, the number of epiya c segments did not associate with duodenal ulcer.
our results demonstrate that infection with h. pylori strains harbouring more than one caga epiya c motif was clearly associated with gastric cancer, but not with duodenal ulcer.
we studied associations between h. pylori caga epiya patterns and gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer, in an ethnically admixed western population from brazil.
helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most common infections worldwide and is associated with gastric cancer and peptic ulcer.
a total of  <dig> patients were included, being  <dig> with gastric cancer,  <dig> with duodenal ulcer and  <dig> with gastritis.
