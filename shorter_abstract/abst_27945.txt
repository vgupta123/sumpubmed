we carried out a coevolution experiment using the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, and its natural microsporidian parasite, paranosema whitei.
in all parasite treatments of the experiment, coevolution resulted in extinction of the host population, with a pronounced increase in virulence being seen.
the extinction of host populations was unexpected, particularly as parasite virulence is often seen to decrease in host-parasite coevolution.
we additionally took a modelling approach to further assess the importance of transmissive parasite stages on virulence evolution.
our modelling approach highlighted the presence of environmental transmissive parasite stages as being critical to the trajectory of virulence evolution in this system.
this, in combination with the increase in virulence and results obtained from the model, suggest that the inclusion of transmissive parasite stages is important to improving our understanding of virulence evolution.
the majority of coevolution experiments, however, do not allow for environmental transmission or persistence of long lived parasite stages, in spite of the fact that these may be critical for the evolutionary success of spore forming parasites under natural conditions.
host-parasite coevolution is predicted to result in changes in the virulence of the parasite in order to maximise its reproductive success and transmission potential, either via direct host-to-host transfer or through the environment.
