we used several different outcome measures depending on the cue presented.
specifically, we find that rt slope for a variety of reflexive attention outcome measures is dependent on dat <dig> genotype.
drd <dig> was near significant for one outcome measure in the final  model.
reflexive attention is an important component of overall attention because  it participates in determining where attention is allocated and how susceptible to distractors the subject might be.
to our knowledge, this is the first study that has associated neurotransmitter genotypes with rt slope on a reflexive attention experiment.

improved understanding of attention may eventually be critical to early identification and treatment of attentional deficits.
that is, those with two risk alleles for adhd  either got slower as the task progressed or had the least improvement.
those with no risk alleles  had the most improvement in rt as the task progressed.
one step in that direction is to acquire a better understanding of genetic associations with performance on a task measuring reflexive  visual attention.
here we report on the contributions of genetic markers to rt increases or decreases over the course of the task .
we have previously studied the relationship between selected genes and mean response time .
