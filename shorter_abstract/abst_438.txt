transgenic complementation tests were performed for functional analysis.
finally, through histological observations, we demonstrate that both monocot and dicot susceptibility alleles of the mlo genes predispose to penetration of a non-adapted pm fungal species in plant epidermal cells.
with this study, we provide insights on the evolution and function of mlo genes involved in the interaction with pm fungi.
previous studies indicated that monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility proteins are phylogenetically divergent.
we also tested whether different molecular features between monocot and dicot mlo proteins are specifically required by pm fungal species to cause pathogenesis.
with respect to breeding research, we show that transgenic complementation assays involving phylogenetically distant plant species can be used for the characterization of novel mlo susceptibility genes.
these represent ideal targets for future approaches of reverse genetics, addressed to the selection of loss-of-function resistant mutants in cultivated species.
our results show that monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility proteins evolved class-specific conservation patterns.
many of them appear to be the result of negative selection and thus are likely to provide an adaptive value.
in both cases, we observed restoration of pm symptoms.
specific members of the plant mildew locus o  protein family act as susceptibility factors towards powdery mildew , a worldwide-spread fungal disease threatening many cultivated species.
moreover, we provide an overview of mlo protein molecular features predicted to play a major role in pm susceptibility.
