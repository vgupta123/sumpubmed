c. coli bfr-ca- <dig> shares one  of these, but four orfs could be assigned to putative type i rm-systems, seven orfs to type ii rm-systems and three orfs to type iv rm-systems.
the goal of the study was to analyze the methylome of a c. coli strain susceptible to dpni digestion, to identify its methylation motifs and restriction modification systems , and compare them to related organisms like c. jejuni and helicobacter pylori.
the genome contains a cjie1-like element prophage and is phylogenetically closer to c. coli clade  <dig> isolates than clade  <dig>   <dig>  6-methylated adenines  that are predominantly arranged in eight different methylation motifs and  <dig>  4-methylated cytosines  have been detected.
only five dominant methylation motifs have been identified in c. jejuni, which have been associated with known rm-systems.
the remaining methylation motifs are specific for c. coli bfr-ca- <dig> and have been neither detected in c. jejuni nor in h. pylori.
campylobacter species are the most prevalent bacterial pathogen causing acute enteritis worldwide.
in contrast to campylobacter jejuni, about 5 % of campylobacter coli strains exhibit susceptibility to restriction endonuclease digestion by dpni cutting specifically 5’-gmatc-3’ motifs.
the results of this study give us new insights into epigenetics of campylobacteraceae and provide the groundwork to resolve the function of rm-systems in c. coli.
in accordance with dpni prescreening rm-system iip, methylation of gatc motifs was detected in c. coli bfr-ca- <dig>  a homologous iip rm-system has been described for h. pylori.
using one smrt cell and the pacbio rs sequencing technology followed by pacbio modification and motif analysis the complete genome of the dpni susceptible strain c. coli bfr-ca- <dig> was sequenced to 500-fold coverage and assembled into a single contig of  <dig>  mbp.
this indicates significant differences in dna methylation between both microbial species.
