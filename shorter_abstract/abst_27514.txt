our key observations are:  fraction of proteome dedicated to aarss in p. falciparum is very high compared to many other organisms;   <dig> out of  <dig> pf-aars sequences contain signal peptides possibly directing them to different cellular organelles;  expression profiles of pf-aarss vary considerably at various life cycle stages of the parasite;  several pfaarss posses very unusual domain architectures;  phylogenetic analyses reveal evolutionary relatedness of several parasite aarss to bacterial and plants aarss;  three dimensional structural modelling has provided insights which could be exploited in inhibitor discovery against parasite aarss.
using various computational and bioinformatics tools, we have identified  <dig> aarss in p. falciparum.
aminoacyl-trna synthetases  are pivotal enzymes for protein translation and other vital cellular processes.
we have annotated all  <dig> pf-aarss based on predicted localization, phylogenetics, domain architectures and their overall protein expression profiles.
our data reveal several unique attributes in this protein family.
