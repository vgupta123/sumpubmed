we did not identify any other distally encoded genes or gene clusters that correlate with cyn production.
the fact that the additional genomic differences between toxic and non-toxic strains were primarily associated with stress and adaptation genes suggests that cyn production may be linked to these physiological processes.
interestingly, we also identified a cryptic secondary metabolite gene cluster in strain cs- <dig>  and a second cryptic cluster common to cs- <dig> and the reference strain, cs- <dig> .
our results confirm that the most important factor contributing to toxicity in c. raciborskii is the presence or absence of the cyr gene cluster.
in order to examine the fundamental differences between toxic and non-toxic c. raciborskii strains, we sequenced the genomes of two closely related isolates, cs- <dig>  and cs- <dig>  sourced from different lakes in tropical queensland, australia.
strains cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> contained at least  <dig> and  <dig> strain-specific  genes, respectively, most of which were associated with dna repair and modification, nutrient uptake and transport, or adaptive measures such as osmoregulation.
at least  <dig>  genes were shared among all three strains, including the taxonomically important rpoc <dig>  ssurna, lsurna, cpca, cpcb, nifb and nifh, which exhibited  <dig> -100% nucleotide identity.
through examining the genomes of toxic and non-toxic strains of c. raciborskii, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the degree of similarity between these strains of common geographical origin, and what the primary differences between these strains might be.
these genomes were then compared to a third  genome from c. raciborskii cs- <dig> .
