improved domaindiscovery uses a support vector machine  approach and a unique training dataset built on the principle of consensus among experts in defining domains in protein structure.
in this present study, we demonstrate that the performance of domaindiscovery is improved significantly by including the inter-domain linker index value for domain identification from sequence-based information.
the svm was trained using a pssm , secondary structure, solvent accessibility information and inter-domain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence.
the ability to identify domains without the knowledge of the structure – by using sequence information only – is an essential step in many types of protein analyses.
improved domaindiscovery compares favourably to the performance of other methods and excels in the identification of domain boundaries for multi-domain proteins as a result of introducing support vector machine with benchmark_ <dig> dataset.
knowledge of protein domain boundaries is critical for the characterisation and understanding of protein function.
improved domaindiscovery achieves 70% accuracy for domain boundary identification in multi-domains proteins.
