multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  family is an important group of the multidrug efflux transporters that extrude organic compounds, transporting a broad range of substrates such as organic acids, plant hormones and secondary metabolites.
a total of  <dig> genes encoding mate transporters were identified from the whole genome sequence of soybean , which were denominated as gmmate <dig> - gmmate <dig>  these  <dig> gmmate genes were unevenly localized on soybean chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig>  with both tandem and segmental duplication events detected, and most genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns.
the cis-elements and expression patterns of eight soybean mate genes related to al detoxification/iron translocation were analyzed, and gmmate <dig> was identified as a candidate gene for al tolerance in soybean.
differential gene expression analysis of these eight gmmate genes in response to al stress helps us identify gmmate <dig> as the candidate gene for al tolerance in soybean, whose relative transcript abundance increased at  <dig>   <dig> and 24Â h after al treatment, with more fold changes in al-tolerant than al-sensitive cultivar, which is consistent with previously reported al-tolerance related mate genes.
eight soybean mate transporters clustered together with the previously reported mate proteins related to aluminum  detoxification and iron translocation were further analyzed.
however, genome-wide analysis of mate family in plant species is limited and no such studies have been reported in soybean.
seven stress-responsive cis-elements such as abre, are, hse, ltr, mbs, as well as a cis-element of art <dig> , ggnvs, were identified in the upstream region of these eight gmmate genes.
a total of  <dig> mate transporters were identified in soybean and their potential functions were proposed by phylogenetic analysis with known plant mate transporters.
soybean mate family could be classified into four subfamilies comprising ten smaller subgroups, with diverse potential functions such as transport and accumulation of flavonoids or alkaloids, extrusion of plant-derived or xenobiotic compounds, regulation of disease resistance, and response to abiotic stresses.
this study provides a first insight on soybean mate family and their potential roles in soybean response to abiotic stresses especially al toxicity.
