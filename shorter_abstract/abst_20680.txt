finally, we used the new models and mitochondrial protein data to certify that testudines, aves, and crocodylia form one separated clade within amniotes.
however, only few empirical models have been estimated from restricted mitochondrial protein data of a hundred species.
we noted remarkable distances from phylogenies with the existing models to the maximum likelihood phylogenies that indicate a considerable number of incorrect bipartitions in phylogenies with the existing models.
we selected  <dig>  mitochondrial protein sequences from  <dig>  species in the metazoan kingdom to estimate new amino acid substitution models targeting metazoa, vertebrates and invertebrate groups.
the new models help to find significantly better likelihood phylogenies in comparison with the existing models.
the new models outperform the existing models in inferring phylogenies from metazoan mitochondrial protein data.
we strongly recommend researchers to use the new models in analysing metazoan mitochondrial protein data.
amino acid substitution models play an essential role in inferring phylogenies from mitochondrial protein data.
we introduced new mitochondrial amino acid substitution models for metazoan mitochondrial proteins.

the existing models are unlikely to represent appropriately the amino acid substitutions from hundred thousands metazoan mitochondrial protein sequences.
