bgx performs well relative to other widely used methods at estimating expression levels and fold changes.
the package employs a novel adaptive markov chain monte carlo  algorithm that raises considerably the efficiency with which the posterior distributions are sampled from.
finally, bgx incorporates various ways to analyse the results, such as ranking genes by expression level as well as statistically based methods for estimating the amount of up and down regulated genes between two conditions.
the software takes into account additive and multiplicative error, non-specific hybridisation and replicate summarisation in the spirit of the model outlined in  <cit> .
most algorithms extract the signal from genechip experiments in a sequence of separate steps, including background correction and normalisation, which inhibits the simultaneous use of all available information.
affymetrix 3' genechip microarrays are widely used to profile the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously.
it also provides a posterior distribution for the expression of each gene.
they principally provide a point estimate of gene expression and, in contrast to bgx, do not fully integrate the uncertainty arising from potentially heterogeneous responses of the probes.
moreover, bgx can take into account probe affinity effects from probe sequence information where available.
bgx is a new bioconductor r package that implements an integrated bayesian approach to the analysis of 3' genechip data.
