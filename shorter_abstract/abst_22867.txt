bacterial cells with polyp deficiencies due to knocking out the ppk <dig> gene are affected in many structural and important cellular functions such as motility, quorum sensing, biofilm formation and virulence among others.
finally, we used comparative proteomics in order to elucidate the cellular adjustments that occurred during polyp deficiency in this bacterium and found some clues that helped to understand the structural and functional defects observed.
the results obtained suggest that during polyp deficiency energy metabolism and particularly nucleoside triphosphate  formation were affected and that bacterial cells overcame this problem by increasing the flux of energy-generating metabolic pathways such as tricarboxilic acid  cycle, Î²-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and by reducing energy-consuming ones such as active transporters and amino acid biosynthesis.
furthermore, our results suggest that a general stress response also took place in the cell during polyp deficiency.
colony morphology phenotype, lipopolysaccharide  structure changes and cellular division malfunction were observed.
by using this approach we found new structural and functional defects in the polyp-accumulating bacteria pseudomonas sp.
polyp is synthesized in bacterial cells by the actions of polyphosphate kinases  and degraded by exopolyphosphatase .
