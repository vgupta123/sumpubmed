during the investigation,  <dig> different mutations in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  gene and  <dig> different mutations in the cellulose synthase-like  β-glucan biosynthesis gene were identified.
the oat tilling population produced in this work carries, on average, hundreds of mutations in every individual gene in the genome.
genomic dna was prepared from the m <dig> population and the mutation frequency was determined.
increased demand for novel oat products has also put pressure on oat breeders to produce new oat varieties with specific properties such as increased or improved β-glucan-, antioxidant- and omega- <dig> fatty acid levels, as well as modified starch and protein content.
the population  will be available for academic research via nordgen http://www.nordgen.org as soon as enough seeds are obtained.
the estimated mutation frequency was one mutation per  <dig> kb by rapd-pcr fingerprinting, one mutation per  <dig> kb by maldi-tof analysis and one mutation per  <dig>  kb by dna sequencing.
thus, the overall mutation frequency in the population is estimated to be one mutation per 20- <dig> kb, depending on if the method used addressed the whole genome or specific genes.
