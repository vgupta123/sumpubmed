this has impelled the production of many strategies to built protein structures from its sequence, generating a considerable amount of alternative models.
besides, our approach has the advantage of identifying the most relevant terms involved in the stability of the protein structure.
finally, we also use the composite zscores to assess the conformation of models and to detect local errors.
using the simplest composite score () we obtained predictions similar to state-of-the-art methods.
recent advances on high-throughput technologies have produced a vast amount of protein sequences, while the number of high-resolution structures has seen a limited increase.
the selection of the closest model to the native conformation has thus become crucial for structure prediction.
the new scores have detected near-native structures as accurately as state-of-art methods and have been successful to identify wrongly modeled regions of many near-native conformations.
our strategy allows circumventing the problem of defining the reference state.
we have introduced a method to split knowledge-based potentials and to solve the problem of defining a reference state.
here, we present and demonstrate a theory to split the knowledge-based potentials in scoring terms biologically meaningful and to combine them in new scores to predict near-native structures.
