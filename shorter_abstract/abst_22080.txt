leaf pigment content is an important trait involved in environmental interactions.
the pale-green mutant was investigated by comparing pigment content and gene/protein expression profiles to wild-type plants at anthesis.
this study provides insight on the effect of pigment content in the molecular response to drought.
we also compared the two genotypes under irrigated and rain-fed field conditions over three years, finding that the greater oxidative stress and corresponding molecular changes in the pale-green mutant were associated to a yield reduction.

transcriptomic analysis under control conditions showed that defense genes  were upregulated in the mutant, suggesting the presence of mild oxidative stress that was compensated without altering the net rate of photosynthesis.
transcriptomic analysis under terminal water stress conditions, revealed the modulation of antioxidant enzymes, photosystem components, and enzymes representing carbohydrate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating that the mutant was exposed to greater oxidative stress than the wild-type plants, but had a limited capacity to respond.
identified genes differentially expressed under terminal water stress may be valuable for further studies addressing drought resistance in wheat.
in order to determine its impact on drought tolerance in wheat, we characterized a pale-green durum wheat mutant  under contrasting water availability conditions.
