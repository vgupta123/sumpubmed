comparative analyses between sugarcane and sorghum suggest that these two species retain homologous mirnas and targets in their genomes.
sugarcane  is an important biofuel crop with publicly available expressed sequence tag and genomic survey sequence databases, but little is known about mirnas and their targets in this highly polyploid species.
in this study, we have computationally identified  <dig> distinct sugarcane mirna precursors, of which several are highly similar with their sorghum homologs at both nucleotide and secondary structure levels.
conversely, target genes of lineage-specific mirnas seem to play roles in diverse physiological processes, such as sscbp <dig>  sscbp <dig> was experimentally confirmed to be a target for the monocot-specific mir <dig>  our findings support the notion that the regulation of sscbp <dig> by mir <dig> is shared at least within graminaceous monocots, and this mirna-based post-transcriptional regulation evolved exclusively within the monocots lineage after the divergence from eudicots.
therefore, computational identification and further experimental validation of mirnas from non-model organisms is both feasible and instrumental for addressing mirna-based gene regulation and evolution.
using publicly available nucleotide databases,  <dig> sugarcane mirna precursors and one new sorghum mirna precursor were identified and classified into  <dig> families.
the accumulation pattern of mature mirnas varies in organs/tissues from the commercial sugarcane hybrid as well as in its corresponding founder species s. officinarum and s. spontaneum.
micrornas  are small regulatory rnas, some of which are conserved in diverse plant genomes.
several targets for highly conserved mirnas are transcription factors that play important roles in plant development.
based on our computational tool, a total of  <dig> potential targets were identified for the  <dig> sugarcane mirnas.
