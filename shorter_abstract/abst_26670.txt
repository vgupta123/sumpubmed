when integrated properly to functional genomics data, r-gsns can help enable future research on systems biology and translational bioinformatics.

several types of gene set networks have been used to study complex molecular networks such as co-membership gene set networks  and co-enrichment gene set networks .
we collected several gene set collections and high-quality gene regulation data in order to construct r-gsns in a comparative study with co-membership gene set networks .
we described a method for constructing both global and disease-specific r-gsns and determining their significance.
in this study, we proposed a new approach for constructing directed, regulatory gene set networks  to reveal novel relationships among gene sets or pathways.
