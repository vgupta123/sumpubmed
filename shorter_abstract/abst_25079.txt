these data indicate that despite conclusions drawn from 16s rrna sequences suggesting rapid evolution, the m. pneumoniae genome is extraordinarily stable over time and geographic distance across the globe with a striking lack of evidence of horizontal gene transfer.
results from the comparative genomic analysis indicate that although about  <dig> snp and indel variants exist between type <dig> and type  <dig> strains, there is an overall high degree of sequence similarity among the strains .
within the two subtypes, conservation of most genes, including the cards toxin gene and arginine deiminase genes, was observed.
mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in people of all ages, responsible for up to 40 % of community-acquired pneumonias.
phylogenetic studies of the organism have been generally restricted to specific genes or regions of the genome, because whole genome sequencing has been completed for only  <dig> strains.
illumina miseq whole genome sequencing was performed on the  <dig> strains and all genome sequences were completed.
multiple hsds genes  with variable tandem repeat copy numbers were found in all  <dig> genomes.
to better understand the physiology and pathogenicity of this important human pathogen, we performed comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> strains of m. pneumoniae that were isolated between the 1940s to  <dig> from respiratory specimens and cerebrospinal fluid originating from the usa, china and england.
