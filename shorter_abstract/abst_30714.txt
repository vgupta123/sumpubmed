three-fold/ten-fold cross validation based tests performed on three independent, low-identity datasets show that the distance based depth  predicted by rdpred is characterized by  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig>  correlation with the actual depth, by the mean absolute errors equal  <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> , and by the mean relative errors equal  <dig> %/ <dig> %,  <dig> %/ <dig> %, and  <dig> %/ <dig> %, respectively.
the results show that three-fold cross validation underestimates the variability of the prediction quality when compared with the results based on the ten-fold cross validation.
finally, we show that the secondary structure of coils and strands is useful in depth prediction, in contrast to helices that have relatively uniform distribution over the protein depth.
our analysis reveals that evolutionary information encoded using pssm is characterized by stronger correlation with the depth for hydrophilic amino acids  and aliphatic aas when compared with hydrophobic aas and aromatic aas.
a new method, rdpred, for the real-value depth prediction from protein sequence is proposed.
residue depth allows determining how deeply a given residue is buried, in contrast to the solvent accessibility that differentiates between buried and solvent-exposed residues.
accurate prediction of residue depth would provide valuable information for fold recognition, prediction of functional sites, and protein design.
application of the predicted residue depth to prediction of buried/exposed residues shows consistent improvements in detection rates of both buried and exposed residues when compared with the competing method.
the proposed method, rdpred, provides statistically significantly better predictions of residue depth when compared with the competing method.
we also show that the hydrophilic and flexible residues are predicted more accurately than hydrophobic and rigid residues.
finally, we contrasted the prediction performance among distance based  and volume based  depth definitions.
rdpred combines information extracted from the sequence, psi-blast scoring matrices, and secondary structure predicted with psipred.
the mean absolute and the mean relative errors are shown to be statistically significantly better when compared with a method recently proposed by yuan and wang .
