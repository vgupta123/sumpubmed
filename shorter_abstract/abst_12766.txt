results obtained from its use in a real case study have been analyzed and validated through both literature data and preliminary wet-lab experiments, showing the potential of this tool when performing exploratory analysis.
since cytransfinder has been designed to support exploratory analysis, it does not rely on expression data.
signal transduction pathways are molecular circuits that model how cells receive, process, and respond to information from the environment providing snapshots of the overall cell dynamics.
we observed a lack of computational instruments supporting explorative analysis on this type of three-component signal transduction pathways.
cytransfinder supports the reconstruction of small signal transduction pathways among groups of genes.
however, networks involving a single type of regulator and neglecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations mediated by transcription factors and micrornas, respectively, may not fully reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of a cell.
to show the potential of the plugin we have applied it in a study of two mirnas that are particularly relevant in human melanoma progression, mir-146a and mir- <dig>
we have developed cytransfinder, a new cytoscape plugin able to infer three-component signal transduction pathways based on user defined regulatory patterns and including mirnas, tfs and genes.
most of the attempts to reconstruct signal transduction pathways are limited to single regulator networks including only genes/proteins.
