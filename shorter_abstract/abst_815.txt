even with  <dig> ng of starting rna, the positive results are reliable although many differentially expressed genes are missed.
the implications for experimental design, and the integration of data from different starting quantities, are complex.
in this paper we investigate the costs of reducing the starting quantity of rna for the illumina beadarray platform.
the beadarray platform maintains a low false discovery rate even when small amounts of starting rna are used.
