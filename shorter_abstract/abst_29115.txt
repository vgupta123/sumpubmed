in this study, we explored the role of l. plantarum derived evs in modulating host responses to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium  using both caenorhabditis elegans and human cells.
similarly, l. plantarum wcfs <dig> derived extracellular vesicles  also significantly protected the worms against vre infection.
we have found that evs produced from l. plantarum wcfs <dig> up-regulate the expression of host defense genes and provide protective effects on hosts.
to dissect the molecular mechanisms of this ev-induced protection, we found that treatment of c. elegans with ldevs significantly increased the transcription of host defense genes, cpr- <dig> and clec- <dig>  both cpr- <dig> and clec- <dig> have been previously reported to have protective roles against bacterial infections.
probiotic bacteria are known to modulate host immune responses against various pathogens.
our previous work has shown that probiotic conditioning c. elegans with l. acidophilus ncfm prolongs the survival of nematodes exposed to vre.
incubating human colon-derived caco- <dig> cells with fluorescent dye-labeled ldevs confirmed that ldevs could be transported into the mammalian cells.
using probiotic-derived evs instead of probiotic bacteria themselves, this study provides a new direction to treat antimicrobial resistant pathogens, such as vre.
recently, extracellular vesicles  have emerged as potentially important mediators of host-pathogen interactions.
