consensus sequences of dwv for each sample showed little phylogenetic divergence, low nucleotide diversity, and strongly negative values of fu and li’s d statistic, suggesting a recent population bottleneck and/or purifying selection.
in this study, we mined existing illumina sequence reads to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms  within two rna viruses of the western honey bee , deformed wing virus  and israel acute paralysis virus .

the kakugo strain of dwv fell outside of all other dwv sequences at 100% bootstrap support.
fst values were bimodal for dwv, likely reflecting neutral divergence in two low-diversity populations, whereas iapv had several sites that were strong outliers with very low fst.
iapv consensus sequences supported the existence of multiple clades as had been previously reported, and fu and li’s d was closer to neutral expectation overall, although a sliding-window analysis identified a significantly positive d within the protease region, suggesting selection maintains diversity in that region.
deep sequencing of viruses isolated from infected hosts is an efficient way to measure population-genetic variation and can reveal patterns of dispersal and natural selection.
this initial survey of genetic variation within honey bee rna viruses suggests future directions for studies examining the underlying causes of population-genetic structure in these economically important pathogens.
all viral rna was extracted from north american samples of honey bees or, in one case, the ectoparasitic mite varroa destructor.
