the description of mirnas in eucalyptus contributes to scientific knowledge of this vast genre, which is the most widely planted hardwood crop in the tropical and subtropical world, adding another important element to the annotation of eucalyptus grandis reference genome.
initially described as post-transcriptional regulators involved in development, two decades ago, mirnas have been proven to regulate a wide range of processes in plants such as germination, morphology and responses to biotic and abiotic stress.
experimental evidence based on the exclusive expression of a set of small rnas across  <dig> species within myrtaceae further highlighted variable patterns of conservation and diversity of these regulatory elements.
micro rnas are a class of small non coding rnas of 20â€“ <dig> nucleotides transcribed as single stranded precursors from mir gene loci.

in addition to discovering small rna sequences, mir loci were mapped onto the reference genome and interspecific variability investigated.
characterization of eucalyptus small rna sequences showed  <dig> orthologous to conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas.
interspecific analysis reinforces the variability in small rna repertoire even between closely related species.
sequencing was carried out for the two most world widely planted species, e. grandis and e. globulus.
we describe the first genome wide survey of eucalyptus mirnas based on high throughput sequencing.
to maximize discovery, e. grandis samples were from brasuz <dig>  the same tree whose genome provided the reference sequence.
in silico target prediction confirmed  <dig> novel mirnas and degradome sequencing experimentally confirmed several hundred targets.
