we made transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants in which alternative respiratory pathway capacity was either increased by constitutive expression of aox, or decreased by expression of a dominant-negative mutant protein .
antimycin a  and sa triggered resistance to tobacco mosaic virus .
n. benthamiana was used because it is a natural mutant that does not express a functional rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>
unexpectedly, aox-transgenic plants infected with potato virus x  showed markedly increased susceptibility to systemic disease induction and virus accumulation in inoculated and systemically infected leaves.
we conclude that aox-regulated mechanisms not only play a role in sa-induced resistance but also make an important contribution to basal resistance against certain viruses such as pvx.
salicylic acid  regulates multiple anti-viral mechanisms, including mechanism that may be negatively regulated by the mitochondrial enzyme, alternative oxidase , the sole component of the alternative respiratory pathway.
sa-induced resistance to pvx was compromised in aox-transgenic plants but plants expressing aox-e exhibited enhanced sa-induced resistance to this virus.
