they represent a monophyletic group within the class mollicutes  and are characterized by a small genome with a low gc content, and the lack of a firm cell wall.
p. mali' strain at is  <dig>  bp in size and has a gc content of  <dig> %.
p. asteris' by a smaller genome, a lower gc content, a lower number of paralogous genes, fewer insertions of potential mobile dna elements, and a strongly reduced number of abc transporters for amino acids.
the small linear chromosome with large terminal inverted repeats and covalently closed hairpin ends, the extremely low gc content and the limited metabolic capabilities reflect unique features of 'ca.
the chromosome is further characterized by large terminal inverted repeats and covalently closed hairpin ends.
p. australiense', examined so far have circular chromosomes, as is the case for almost all walled bacteria.
phytoplasma mali', the causative agent of apple proliferation disease, has a linear chromosome.
linear chromosomes were also identified in the closely related provisional species 'ca.
p. mali' has an extended set of genes for homologous recombination, excision repair and sos response than 'ca.
p. mali' also differs from 'ca.
p. mali', not only within phytoplasmas, but all mycoplasmas.
due to the apparent lack of other metabolic pathways present in mycoplasmas, it is proposed that maltose and malate are utilized as carbon and energy sources.
p. asteris', is incomplete in 'ca.
