maintaining xiap levels in mecs by expressing exogenous xiap protected them from all apoptotic stimuli tested.
here we examined the expression of iaps during the post-natal development of the mouse mammary gland, which is a tissue that exhibits a profound induction of apoptosis during involution.
six out of eight mammalian iap family members are expressed in the mammary gland.
in cultured mammary epithelial cells , xiap levels decreased in response to inhibition of growth factor signalling.
these data suggest that the developmental regulation of iap expression in vivo contributes to naturally occurring programmes of cell death.
notably, quantitative pcr and immunoblotting revealed that xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> are down-regulated in pregnancy and lactation, and prior to the onset of involution.
