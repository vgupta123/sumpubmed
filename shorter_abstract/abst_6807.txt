the fixation of cooperation has higher probability than that of on static graphs, and this effect is more prevalent at high benefit to cost ratios.
evolution of cooperative behaviour is widely studied in different models where interaction is heterogeneous, although static among individuals.
we also find an optimal number of partners, for which the fixation probability of cooperation shows a maximum.
