the conservation of dpgs in d. melanogaster is of significance as they are mostly housekeeping genes characterized by the absence of tata box in their promoter sequences.
such architectural organizations, including convergently-paired genes  may associate with transcriptional regulation and have significant functional relevance.
the combination of initiator and downstream promoter element may play an important role in regulating dpgs in d. melanogaster, providing an excellent niche for studying the molecular details for transcription regulations.
divergently-paired genes  are defined as two adjacent genes that are transcribed toward the opposite direction  and shared their transcription start sites  less than  <dig>  base pairs apart.
drosophila melanogaster has a significant fraction  of dpgs which are remarkably conserved relative to its gene density as compared to other eukaryotes.
our survey and comparative analysis revealed different evolutionary patterns among dpgs between insect and vertebrate lineages.
by sharing promoters, the gene pairs take the advantage of co-regulation albeit bearing doubled mutational burdens in maintaining their normal functions.
dpgs appear to have arisen independently among different evolutionary lineages, such as the insect and vertebrate lineages, and exhibit variable degrees of conservation.
