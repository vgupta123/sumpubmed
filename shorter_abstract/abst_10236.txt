we identified  <dig>  mb of non-redundant sequence scaffolds derived from euchromatic regions of rh and  <dig>  mb from the pericentromeric heterochromatin.
in the euchromatic regions, the sequence collinearity between the three chromosomal homologs is good, but interruption of collinearity occurs at nine gene clusters.
our results show that among homologous potato chromosomes large regions are present with dramatic loss of sequence collinearity.
for  <dig>  mb of the rh sequences the correct position and order on chromosome  <dig> was determined, using genetic markers, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and alignment to the dm reference genome.
this ordered fraction of the rh sequences is situated in the euchromatic arms and in the heterochromatin borders.
these rh sequences have very few syntenic regions and represent a non-alignable region between the rh and dm heterochromatin haplotypes of chromosome  <dig>
the discovery of three highly diverged pericentric heterochromatin haplotypes within one species is a novelty in plant genome analysis.
within a plant species, however, it is assumed that different haplotypes of the same chromosome align well.
in this paper we have compared three de novo assemblies of potato chromosome  <dig> and report on the sequence variation and the proportion of sequence that can be aligned.
in the most central heterochromatin, a total of  <dig>  mb sequence from both rh haplotypes remained unordered.
towards and into the heterochromatin borders, absence of collinearity due to structural variation was more extensive and was caused by hemizygous and poorly aligning regions of up to 450 kb in length.
