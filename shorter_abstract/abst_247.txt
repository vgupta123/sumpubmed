several strains of bacteria have sequenced and annotated genomes, which have been used in conjunction with biochemical and physiological data to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks.
we present the first manually curated elementally and charge balanced genome-scale reconstruction and model of s. aureus' metabolic networks and compute some of its properties.
we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network of s. aureus strain n <dig>  this reconstruction, termed isb <dig>  consists of  <dig> genes that catalyze  <dig> metabolic reactions.
the reconstructed metabolic network can be used to predict cellular phenotypes and thus advance our understanding of a troublesome pathogen.
when the capabilities of the reconstructed network were analyzed in the context of maximal growth, we formed hypotheses regarding growth requirements, the efficiency of growth on different carbon sources, and potential drug targets.
such reconstruction amounts to a two-dimensional annotation of the genome.
staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that has evolved resistance to many antibiotics, representing a significant health care concern.
these networks have been analyzed with a constraint-based formalism and a variety of biologically meaningful results have emerged.
isb <dig> represents comprehensive biochemically and genetically structured information about the metabolism of s. aureus to date.
