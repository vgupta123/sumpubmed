we also demonstrated the usefulness of dget for synexpression studies by querying genes with expression profile similar to the mesodermal master regulator twist.
using dget, we compared whole tissue profile and sub-region/cell-type specific datasets and estimated a potential source of false positives in one dataset.
altogether, dget provides a flexible tool for expression data retrieval and analysis with short or long lists of drosophila genes, which can help scientists to design stage- or tissue-specific in vivo studies and do other subsequent analyses.
next-generation sequencing technologies have greatly increased our ability to identify gene expression levels, including at specific developmental stages and in specific tissues.
in particular, we show that evolutionary conserved genes expressed at high or moderate levels in both fly and human tend to be expressed in similar tissues.
we report dget, a drosophila gene expression tool , which stores and facilitates search of rna-seq based expression profiles available from the modencode consortium and other public data sets.
using dget, researchers are able to look up gene expression profiles, filter results based on threshold expression values, and compare expression data across different developmental stages, tissues and treatments.

in addition, at dget a researcher can analyze tissue or stage-specific enrichment for an inputted list of genes  and search for additional genes with similar expression patterns.
