the majority of clustering techniques are based on distance or visual similarity measures which may not be suitable for clustering of temporal microarray data where the sequential nature of time is important.
we test our approach on synthesized datasets and real biological datasets obtained for arabidopsis thaliana.
we present a granger causality based technique to cluster temporal microarray gene expression data, which measures the interdependence between two time-series by statistically testing if one time-series can be used for forecasting the other time-series or not.
a gene-association matrix is constructed by testing temporal relationships between pairs of genes using the granger causality test.
the association matrix is further analyzed using a graph-theoretic technique to detect highly connected components representing interesting biological modules.
we show the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing the results using the existing biological literature.
our experiments on synthesized and real microarray datasets show that our approach produces encouraging results.
clustering is an important stage in microarray data analysis where the data is grouped together according to certain characteristics.
we also report interesting structural properties of the association network commonly desired in any biological system.
