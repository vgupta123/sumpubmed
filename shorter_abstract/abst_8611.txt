we explore an alternative approach, where we efficiently compute the k paths of highest probability to explain a sequence and then either use those paths to explore alternative explanations for a sequence or to combine them into a single explanation.
out algorithm uses much less memory than naive approach.
these algorithms provide only a single answer and in practice do not produce good results.
traditional algorithms for hidden markov model decoding seek to maximize either the probability of a state path or the number of positions of a sequence assigned to the correct state.
