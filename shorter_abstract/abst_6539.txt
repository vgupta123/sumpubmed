here we report the origin and evolution dynamics of a human mirna family.
we suggest that in placental species, this mirna family has evolved following the birth-and-death model of evolution.
they emerged at the early stage of the recent  <dig> million years since eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials.
although the conservation scores of the mer53-derived pre-mirna sequences are low, we have identified  <dig> potential paralogs of mer53-derived mir- <dig> genes in the human genome and  <dig> potential orthologs of the human mir- <dig> family in placental mammals.
finally, we have found that the target genes of mir- <dig> are over-represented in transportation, localization, and system development processes and in the positive regulation of cellular processes.
under the birth-and-death model, the mir- <dig> genes have experienced a complex expansion with some members evolving by segmental duplications and some by alu-mediated recombination events.
three possible mechanisms that can mediate mirna duplication in evolutionary history have been proposed: the transposition of the mer <dig> element, segmental duplications and alu-mediated recombination.
many of them are predicted to function in binding and transcription regulation.
