phenotypes are generated based on a disease model, or based on the effect of a quantitative trait nucleotide, both of which can be specified by users.
in addition to single-locus disease models, two-locus disease models have also been implemented that can incorporate any degree of epistasis.
for several commonly used two-locus disease models, the program can automatically calculate penetrances based on the population prevalence and marginal effects of a disease that users can conveniently specify.
with the completion of the hapmap project, a variety of computational algorithms and tools have been proposed for haplotype inference, tag snp selection and genome-wide association studies.
however, there is no tool that is publicly available to generate large scale simulated variation data by taking into account knowledge from the hapmap project.
the first approach takes haplotype pairs from samples as inputs, and the second approach takes patterns of haplotype block structures as inputs.
a computer program  was developed to quickly generate a large number of samples based on real data that are useful for a variety of purposes, including evaluating methods for haplotype inference, tag snp selection and association studies.
in addition to simulations based on population models, empirical data generated by perturbing real data, has also been used because it may inherit specific properties from real data.
both quantitative and qualitative traits have been incorporated in the program.
two approaches have been implemented to generate dense snp haplotype/genotype data that share similar local linkage disequilibrium  patterns as those in human populations.
