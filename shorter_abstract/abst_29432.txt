we examine the relationship between acquired genes and immune function, and compare host-virus homology with gene expression data in stimulated dendritic cells and t-cells.
we found that genes whose expression changes significantly during the innate antiviral immune response had more homologs in animal virus than genes whose expression did not change or genes involved in the adaptive immune response.
we made the results available in the form of a web-based tool that allows viral-centered or host-centered queries to be performed .
genes of host origin that appear commonly in viruses code for proteins that span a wide range of functions, from kinases and phosphotases, to cytokines and their receptors, to ubiquitin ligases and proteases.
