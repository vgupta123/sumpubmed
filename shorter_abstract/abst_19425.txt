in order to diminish the effect of artefacts, only a subset of the detected spots is selected by matching the distribution of the spot sizes to the normal distribution.
thus, it provides the potential of achieving perfect gridding for the vast majority of the spots.
a microarray image is obtained by laser scanning a hybridized cdna microarray, which consists of thousands of spots representing chains of cdna sequences, arranged in a two-dimensional array.
the separation of the spots into distinct cells is widely known as microarray image gridding.
in this paper we propose m3g, a novel method for automatic gridding of cdna microarray images based on the maximization of the margin between the rows and the columns of the spots.
initially the microarray image rotation is estimated and then a pre-processing algorithm is applied for a rough spot detection.
the experimental evaluation was based on a reference set of microarray images containing more than two million spots in total.
the results show that m3g outperforms state of the art methods, demonstrating robustness in the presence of noise and artefacts.
then, a set of grid lines is placed on the image in order to separate each pair of consecutive rows and columns of the selected spots.
complementary dna  microarrays are a well established technology for studying gene expression.
