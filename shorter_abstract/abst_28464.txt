the central element of our approach is based on the fact that many am-related genes are conserved only among am-competent species.
our approach involves genome-wide comparisons at the proteome level of am-competent host species with non-mycorrhizal species.
proteins of these clusters were then analyzed in an extended set of  <dig> plant species and ranked based on their relatedness among am-competent monocot and dicot species, relative to non-mycorrhizal species.
as a result we present a list of yet uncharacterized proteins that show a strongly am-related pattern of sequence conservation, indicating that the respective genes may have been under selection for a function in am.
using a clustering method we first established orthologous/paralogous relationships and subsequently identified protein clusters that contain members only of the am-competent species.
we present a new systematic strategy of gene discovery based on conservation of the protein-coding sequence that complements classical forward and reverse genetics.
