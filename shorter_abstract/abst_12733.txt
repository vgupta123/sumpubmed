we demonstrate that the use of a second genome  for cross-species comparison significantly improves the prediction accuracy of stubb, and is a more sensitive approach than intersecting the results of separate runs over the two genomes.
stubb uses a probabilistic model to score sequences for clustering of transcription factor binding sites, and can exploit multiple species data within the same probabilistic framework.
the discovery of cis-regulatory modules in metazoan genomes is crucial for understanding the connection between genes and organism diversity.
we run the stubb software on the entire d. melanogaster genome, to obtain predictions of modules involved in segmentation of the embryo.
the entire list of predictions is made available online.
it is important to quantify how comparative genomics can improve computational detection of such modules.
