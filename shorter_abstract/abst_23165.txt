we detected two to three rate shifts across the saxifraga phylogeny and two of these shifts led to radiations within two large subclades of saxifraga, sect.
a large number of taxa have undergone evolutionary radiations in mountainous areas, rendering alpine systems particularly suitable to study the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that have shaped diversification patterns in plants.
the species-rich genus saxifraga l. is widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, with high species numbers in the regions adjacent to the qinghai-tibet plateau  in particular the hengduan mountains and the himalayas.
geosse analyses showed that presence in the hengduan mountains had a positive effect on diversification across saxifraga.
in contrast, the evolution of the cushion life form and lime-secreting hydathodes had positive effects on diversification only in selected saxifraga sections, including sect.
in addition, we used state-dependent speciation and extinction models to test the effects of geographic distribution in the hengduan mountains and the entire qtp region as well as of two morphological traits  on the diversification of this genus.

our study underlines the complexity of processes and factors underpinning plant radiations: even in closely related lineages occupying the same life zone, shifts in diversification are not necessarily governed by similar factors.
in conclusion, alpine plant radiations result from a complex interaction among geographical settings and/or climatic modifications providing key opportunities for diversification as well as the evolution of key innovations.
