expression of dominant negative r-ras or knock down of r-ras by sirna prevented integrin accumulation into ruffles, impaired endocytosis of β1-integrin, and decreased β1-integrin-mediated adhesion.
our results suggest that integrin function involves integrin trafficking via a cycle of membrane protrusion, ruffling, and endocytosis regulated by r-ras, providing a novel mechanism by which integrins are linked to r-ras through control of membrane dynamics.
knock-down of r-ras also perturbed the dynamics of another membrane-localized protein, gfp-vsvg, suggesting a more global role for r-ras on membrane dynamics.
moreover, r-ras localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, and regulates membrane protrusion.
gfp-r-ras localized to the plasma membrane, most specifically in membrane ruffles, in cos- <dig> cells.
integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading is dramatically enhanced by activation of the small gtpase, r-ras.
ruffle formation was inhibited by knock-down of endogenous r-ras with sirna, suggesting that activated r-ras is not just a component of, but also an architect of ruffle formation.
importantly, β1-integrin co-localized with endogenous r-ras in ruffles and endocytosed vesicles.
conversely, cells transfected with the constitutively active form of gfp-r-ras contained a greater number of ruffles and large vesicles compared to wild-type transfected cells.
