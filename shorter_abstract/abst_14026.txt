we currently use  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine for the routine decontamination of sputum specimens for the isolation of m. tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis mycobacteria on egg-lecithin containing media.
additionally,  <dig> specimens yielded mycobacteria colonies   , which has yielded a 100 % sensitivity for the chlorhexidine protocol.
as for the  <dig> specimens treated in parallel by both methods we found that when using the standard nalc-naoh decontamination method, 8/ <dig>  specimens yielded m. tuberculosis colonies with a time to detection of  <dig>  ± 3 days and an 8 % contamination rate.
culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis is the gold standard method for the laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, after effective decontamination.
eight sputum specimens were artificially infected with  <dig> colony-forming units /ml mycobacterium tuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans as contaminants.

we evaluated squalamine and chlorhexidine to decontaminate sputum specimens for the culture of mycobacteria.
in a last step, growth of contaminants and mycobacteria was measured in  <dig> consecutive sputum specimens using the routine nalc-naoh decontamination protocol or with  <dig>  % chlorhexidine decontamination and an inoculation on coletsos medium.
in the artificially model, contaminants grew in 100 % of the artificially infected sputum specimens decontaminated using 100 mg/ml squalamine, in  <dig>  % of specimens decontaminated using n-acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide , and in 0 % of specimens decontaminated using  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, or 1 % chlorhexidine .
in our work we showed for the first time that chlorhexidine based decontamination is superior to the standard nalc-naoh method in the isolation of m. tuberculosis from sputum specimens.
in the second step we found that  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine yielded 0 % contamination rate,  <dig>  % for  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine and  <dig>  % for  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine.
time to detection was of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days  and a 0 % contamination rate  using the  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine protocol.
these specimens yielded <102 cfu m. tuberculosis using nalc-naoh and >  <dig> .102 cfu m. tuberculosis when any concentration of chlorhexidine was used .
