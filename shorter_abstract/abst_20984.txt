the objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of icon immunotherapy in cancer using a squamous carcinoma human tongue cancer line tca <dig> in vitro and in vivo in severe combined immunodeficiency  mice.
we conclude that nk cells are crucial for the efficacy of icon immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer.
the results also suggest that impaired nk level/activity could contribute to the resistance to therapeutic antibodies that are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies.
moreover, icon could completely eradicate established human tongue tumour xenografts in vivo in the cb- <dig> strain of scid mice that have functional nk cells at a normal level, whereas it was less effective in scid/beige mice that do not have functional nk cells.
