both elements  are supplied by the blood via trans-epithelial transport.
our aims were to identify genes coding for ion transporters that are upregulated in the uterine portion of the oviduct during eggshell calcification, compared to other tissues and other physiological states, and incorporate these proteins into a general model for mineral transfer across the tubular gland cells during eggshell formation.
a total of  <dig> candidate ion transport genes were selected from our database of overexpressed uterine genes associated with eggshell calcification, and by analogy with mammalian transporters.
our data suggests that na+ transport involved the scnn <dig> channel and the na+/ca2+ exchangers slc8a <dig>   <dig> for cell uptake, the na+/k+ atpase for cell output.
k+ uptake resulted from the na+/k+ atpase, and its output from the k+ channels .
in gallus gallus, eggshell formation takes place daily in the hen uterus and requires large amounts of the ionic precursors for calcium carbonate .
our gallus gallus uterine model proposes a large list of ion transfer proteins supplying ca2+ and hco3- and maintaining cellular ionic homeostasis.
ca2+ movement across the apical membrane likely involves membrane ca2+ pumps and ca2+/na+ exchangers.
our model incorporate cl- ions which are absorbed by the hco3-/cl- exchanger slc26a <dig> and by cl- channels  and might be extruded by cl-/h+ exchanger , but also by na+ k+  <dig> cl- and k+ cl- cotransporters.
protons are absorbed via the membrane’s ca2+ pumps atp2b <dig>   <dig> in the apical membrane and the vacuolar -atpases at the basolateral level.
this avian model should contribute towards understanding the mechanisms and regulation for ionic precursors of caco <dig>  and provide insight in other species where epithelia transport large amount of calcium or bicarbonate.
their uterine expression was compared by qrtpcr in the presence and absence of eggshell formation, and with relative expression levels in magnum  and duodenum .
we identified overexpression of eleven genes related to calcium movement: the trpv <dig> ca2+ channel , 28 kda calbindin , the endoplasmic reticulum type  <dig> and  <dig> ca2+ pumps , and the inositol trisphosphate receptors type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .
