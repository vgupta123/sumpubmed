ckx genes encode cytokinin dehydrogenase enzymes , which metabolize cytokinins in plants and influence developmental processes.
golden promise, was very high, exceeding the relative level of the control lines.
the mean agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency of golden promise was  <dig> % .
the transformation efficiency of golden promise after biolistic transformation was more than twice as low compared to agrobacterium.
the transcript level of hvckx <dig> in segregating progeny of t <dig> lines was decreased to 34%.
the transcript level in segregating progeny of t <dig> lines was decreased to 24%.
these unbalanced ratios of the transcript level and the activity of the ckx enzyme negatively affected kernel germination or anther development and as a consequence setting the seeds.
two cultivars of barley were transformed with the same silencing and selection cassettes by two different methods: biolistic and via agrobacterium.
the phenotypic result, which was higher productivity of silenced lines obtained via agrobacterium, confirms the hypothesis that spatial and temporal differences in expression contributed to functional differentiation.
otherwise, the enzyme activity found in the leaves of the lines after biolistic transformation, especially in cv.
the reduction of the transcript in agrobacterium-derived plants resulted in decreased ckx activity in the developing and developed leaves as well as in  <dig> dap  spikes.
it has already been proven that rna interference -based silencing of hvckx <dig> decreased the ckx level, especially in those organs which showed the highest expression, i.e.
the final phenotypic effect was increased productivity of t <dig> plants and t <dig> lines.
the final phenotypic effect was the decreased productivity of t <dig> plants and t <dig> lines obtained via the biolistic silencing of hvckx <dig>
developing kernels and roots, leading to higher plant productivity and higher mass of the roots  <cit> .
higher productivity was the result of the higher number of seeds and higher grain yield.
