however, classical autoagglutination tests combined with the analysis of specific genetic markers cannot always reliably register phase variable glucose modifications expressed on salmonella o-antigens and additional tools to monitor o-antigen glucosylation phenotypes of s. typhimurium would be desirable.
we developed a test for the phase variable o-antigen glucosylation state of s. typhimurium using the tailspike proteins  of salmonella phages 9na and p <dig>  we used this elisa like tailspike adsorption  assay to analyze a library of  <dig> salmonella strains.
this opens the possibility for flow sorting of cell populations for subsequent genetic analyses or for monitoring phase variations during large scale o-antigen preparations necessary for vaccine production.
elita was successful in discriminating strains that carried glucose 1- <dig> linked to the galactose of o-polysaccharide backbone  from non-glucosylated strains.
the elita test worked rapidly in a microtiter plate format and was highly o-antigen specific.
moreover, tsp as probes could also detect glucosylated strains in flow cytometry and distinguish multiphasic cultures differing in their glucosylation state.
this was shown by o-antigen compositional analyses of the respective strains with mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis.
in this study, 9na and p22tsp as probes could specifically distinguish glucosylation phenotypes of salmonella on microtiter plate assays and in flow cytometry.
