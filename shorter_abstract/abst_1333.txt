we have used computational sequence analyses and structural predictions of proteins of the tpx <dig> family, supported with circular dichroism  measurements.
structural prediction and molecular modeling, combined with circular dichroism  measurements reveal a predominant alpha-helical content.
our results, represent the first computational and biophysical analysis of the tpx <dig> proteins family and help understand the structure and evolution of this conserved protein family to direct future structural studies.
currently, proteins of the tpx <dig> family have little structural information and only small parts are covered by defined protein domains.
tpx <dig>  is essential for spindle assembly, activation of the mitotic kinase aurora a and for triggering microtubule nucleation.
here, we report our finding that the c-terminal domain of tpx <dig>  which is responsible of its microtubule nucleation capacity and is conserved in all members of the family, is actually formed by tandem repeats, covering well above 2/ <dig> of the protein.
furthermore, we identify full length homologs in fungi and shorter homologs with a different domain organization in diptera .
