we use existing and novel dimension reduction and correlation measures to rank relevant experiments in an entirely data-driven manner, allowing emergent features of the data to drive the results.
experiments across platforms, tissue types, and protocols inform the analysis of new datasets.
we develop methods to retrieve gene expression experiments that differentially express the same transcriptional programs as a query experiment.
with the expansion of public repositories such as the gene expression omnibus , we are rapidly cataloging cellular transcriptional responses to diverse experimental conditions.
we apply this method to index all geo datasets, and demonstrate the utility of our approach by identifying pathways and conditions relevant to transcription factors nanog and foxo <dig>
methods that query these repositories based on gene expression content, rather than textual annotations, may enable more effective experiment retrieval as well as the discovery of novel associations between drugs, diseases, and other perturbations.
avoiding thresholds, we generate differential expression profiles that include a score for each gene measured in an experiment.
a combination of matrix decomposition and p-weighted pearson correlation proves the most suitable for comparing differential expression profiles.
