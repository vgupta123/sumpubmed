the activity of these multiple sigma factors determines the transcriptional program of this bacterium.
this was confirmed by the transcriptional analysis of the sig mrnas as a function of nitrogen starvation.
accordingly, an environmental stress acting on only one of the sigma factors will indirectly modify the expression of most of the other sigma factors.
we used quantitative rt-pcr analysis to measure the relative abundance of the sig mrnas in the four sigma mutants.
our data indicate that a network of mutual transcriptional regulation links the expression of the sigma genes.
the cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc <dig> contains one group  <dig>  and four group  <dig>  sigma factors.
we wanted to study the role of the group  <dig> sigma factors in synechocystis.
we have therefore constructed mutants of each of the group  <dig> sigma factors and investigated their crosstalk.
