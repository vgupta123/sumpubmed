the amino acid residues necessary for enzymatic activity in bacterial pbp-βl proteins, including the catalytic serine residue, are conserved in all metazoan homologs.
metazoan pbp-βl homologs including lactb share unique structural features with bacterial class b low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that metazoan pbp-βl homologs comprise four alloparalogus protein lineages that derive from α-proteobacteria.
metazoan pbp-βl homologs are active-site-serine enzymes that probably have distinct functions in the metabolic circuitry.
the emerging role of lactb, a mammalian mitochondrial pbp-βl homolog, in metabolic signaling prompted us to investigate the evolutionary history of metazoan pbp-βl proteins.
bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases  constitute a large family of serine proteases that perform essential functions in the synthesis and maintenance of peptidoglycan.
while most components of the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery were dumped by early eukaryotes, a few pbp-βl proteins were conserved and are found in metazoans including humans.
we hypothesize that pbp-βl proteins in the early eukaryotic cell enabled the degradation of peptidoglycan from ingested bacteria, thereby maximizing the yield of nutrients and streamlining the cell for effective phagocytotic feeding.
intriguingly, genes encoding pbp-βl homologs occur in many metazoan genomes including humans.
