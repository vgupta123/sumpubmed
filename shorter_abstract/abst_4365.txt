it remains unclear which methods do reflect reality better and thus which method is superior.
there is a lack of information about the reliability of computed tomography angiography  for evaluating residual flow through a pss after treatment.
based on the evaluation of the splenoportography residual flow through shunt was present in  <dig> dogs.
the purpose of this prospective study was to compare the results of cta with splenoportography.
in both imaging modalities the presences of a residual shunt was judged as present or absent and the extent of visibility of portal vasculature was recorded.
the classification of residual shunt present or absent showed a substantial to perfect agreement  between the observers in splenoportography and a slight to moderate agreement  for cta.
significant correlation between cta and splenoportography for the classification of residual shunt was present only in one observer but not in the other two.
more studies were classified as residual shunt positive with cta compared to splenoportography.
many patients with a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt  do not tolerate an immediate shunt closure.
to evaluate the success of shunt closure diagnostic imaging is essential to identify possible residual blood flow through the shunt vessel.
the greater inter-rater agreement for splenoportography suggests a greater reliability of this technique.
