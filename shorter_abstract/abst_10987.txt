we systematically benchmarked predisorder along with  <dig> other protein disorder predictors on the casp <dig> data set and assessed its accuracy using a number of measures.
disordered regions are segments of the protein chain which do not adopt stable structures.
the results show that it compared favourably with other ab initio methods and its performance is comparable to that of the best meta and clustering methods.
as such, protein disorder prediction is important for protein structure prediction, structure determination and function annotation.
it is based on our ab initio prediction method  which, along with our meta  prediction method , was recently ranked among the top disorder predictors in the eighth edition of the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction .
