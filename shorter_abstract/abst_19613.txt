affinity chromatography identified several proteins from the large ribosomal subunit as possible interacting partners of mthsbds.
we determined the crystal structure of the sbds orthologue from methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus .
this structure shows that sbds proteins are highly flexible, with the n-terminal fysh domain and the c-terminal ferredoxin-like domain capable of undergoing substantial rotational adjustments with respect to the central domain.
it is suggested that functional interactions of sbds proteins with their partners could be facilitated by rotational adjustments of the n-terminal and the c-terminal domains with respect to the central domain.
moreover, selex  experiments, combined with electrophoretic mobility shift assays  suggest that mthsbds does not interact with rna molecules in a sequence specific manner.
defects in the human shwachman-bodian-diamond syndrome  protein-coding gene lead to the autosomal recessive disorder characterised by bone marrow dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and skeletal abnormalities.
examination of the sbds protein structure and domain movements together with its possible interaction with large ribosomal subunit proteins suggest that these proteins could participate in ribosome function.
although genomic and biophysical studies have suggested involvement of this protein in rna metabolism and in ribosome biogenesis, its interacting partners remain largely unknown.
