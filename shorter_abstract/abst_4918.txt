existing repeat detection tools do a poor job of identifying crisprs due to the presence of unique spacer sequences separating the repeats.
crt's approach to detecting repetitive sequences is straightforward.
in this paper a new tool was introduced for the automatic detection of crispr elements.
it uses a simple sequential scan of a dna sequence and detects repeats directly without any major conversion or preprocessing of the input.
this tool, crt, showed some important improvements over current techniques for crispr identification.
clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats  are a novel type of direct repeat found in a wide range of bacteria and archaea.
in terms of correctness, crt was shown to be very reliable, demonstrating significant improvements over patscan for measures precision, recall and quality.
both crt and pilercr were comparable in speed, however crt was faster for genomes containing large numbers of repeats.
in this study, a new tool, crt, is introduced that rapidly and accurately identifies crisprs in large dna strings, such as genomes and metagenomes.
in terms of speed, crt proved to be a huge improvement over patscan.
