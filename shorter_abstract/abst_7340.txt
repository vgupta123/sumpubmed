we tested whether this calling signalled nutritional need and specifically the needs of the female  or that of their chicks .
we observed begging and provisioning rates at  <dig> nests of hen harrier  in scotland, explored the factors associated with variation in begging rate and the relationship between begging and provisioning.

these patterns suggested that female begging was an honest signal of need.
at nests where adlib food was provided females reduced their begging rate.
however, begging continued even with adlib food and was only weakly associated with greater provisioning by males, suggesting that these calls may also play an additional role, possibly reflecting sexual or parent-offspring conflict.
female begging rate increased up to a chick age of 3 weeks and then tailed off.
our data provided support for the offspring need hypothesis.
