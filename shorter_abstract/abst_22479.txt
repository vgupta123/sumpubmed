conventional fluorescent proteins, such as gfp, its derivatives and flavin mononucleotide based fluorescent proteins  are often used as fusion tags for detecting recombinant proteins during cultivation.
on the contrary, fbfps are also applicable in an oxygen-limited or even anaerobic environment but are still quite large .
our low-molecular-weight w-tags can be used to monitor the production of antibody fragments on-line.
the binding specificity of the recombinant fusion protein is not affected, even though the binding activity decreases slightly with increasing number of tryptophan residues in the w-tags.
as an alternative to common fluorescent tags we developed five novel tags based on clustered tryptophan residues, called w-tags.
thus, the newly designed w-tags offer a versatile and generally applicable alternative to current fluorescent fusion tags.
we fused these w-tags to a recombinant protein model, the anti-cd <dig> receptor single-chain fragment variable antibody  ki- <dig> and the anti-muci single-chain fragment variable m <dig>  during cultivation in microtiter plates, the overall tryptophan fluorescence intensity of all cultures was measured on-line for monitoring product formation via the different w-tags.
after correlation of the scattered light signal representing biomass concentration and tryptophan fluorescence for the uninduced cultures, the fluorescence originating from the biomass was subtracted from the overall tryptophan signal.
