we purified ompa from s. enterica serovar typhimurium  and characterized the role of ompa-sal in promoting adaptive and innate immune responses.
our findings suggest that ompa-sal modulates the adaptive immune responses to s. enterica serovar typhimurium by activating dendritic cells and driving th <dig> polarization, which are important properties to consider in the development of effective s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines and immunotherapy adjuvant.
interestingly, ompa-sal induced production of interferon-Î³ from t cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions, thus indicating th1-polarizing capacity.
the outer membrane protein a of bacteria plays an important role in pathogenesis.
the expression of surface markers and cytokine production in dendritic cells was mediated by the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in a tlr <dig> knock-out system.
ompa-sal functionally activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by augmenting expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and major histocompatibility complex classes i and ii.
typhoid, which is caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, remains a major health concern worldwide.
