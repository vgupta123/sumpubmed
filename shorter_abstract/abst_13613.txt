one isolate  contained cnl allele  <dig>  and caused empyema in an adult male with bronchiectasis from tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus and a smoking history.
we identified four invasive cnl meningococci through laboratory-based surveillance in south africa from  <dig> through  <dig>  which we aimed to characterize using whole genome data.
although rare, invasive disease by cnl meningococci may be associated with host immunodeficiency and such patients may benefit from protein-based meningococcal vaccines.

the remaining two isolates were from recurrent disease episodes  in a male child with deficiency of the sixth complement component, and with the exception of two single nucleotide polymorphisms, contained identical core genomes.
rare cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by cnl isolates belonging to sequence types  and clonal complexes  st- <dig> , st- <dig> , st- <dig>  and st- <dig>  have been documented.
the meningococcal capsule is an important virulence determinant.
comparison of the south african genomes to  <dig> additional cnl genomes on the pubmlst neisseria database , determined that most putative virulence genes could be found in both invasive and carriage phenotypes.
unencapsulated meningococci lacking capsule biosynthesis genes and containing the capsule null locus  are predominantly non-pathogenic.
three isolates were ng: p <dig> - <dig> -2: fΔ: st- <dig>  and contained cnl allele  <dig>  one patient was an adolescent male with meningitis.
