seventy-two percent of all protein-coding transcripts were leaderless, which emphasized that this pathway is the major pathway for translation initiation in haloarchaea.
a position weight matrix  was derived for the promoter predictions, and the results showed that 64 % of the tsss were preceded by stringent or relaxed basal promoters.
volcanii grown under optimal conditions to the mid-exponential growth phase were used to determine the primary transcriptome and map the 5′-ends of the transcripts.
the other types of novel non-coding transcripts corresponded to internal transcripts overlapping with mrnas  and intergenic small rna  candidates .
a large fraction of the potential novel non-coding transcripts were cis-antisense rnas .
a strong negative correlation between the levels of antisense transcripts and cognate sense mrnas was found, which suggested that the negative regulation of gene expression via antisense rnas may play an important role in haloarchaea.
differential rna-seq  is a recently developed method of performing primary transcriptome analyses that allows for the genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites  and the identification of novel transcripts.
a total of  <dig> of the tsss belonged to potential non-coding rnas, which accounted for an unexpectedly high fraction  of all transcripts.
although the transcriptomes of diverse bacterial species have been characterized by drna-seq, the transcriptome analysis of archaeal species is still rather limited.
