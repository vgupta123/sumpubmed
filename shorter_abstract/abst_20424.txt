gene set enrichment testing has helped bridge the gap from an individual gene to a systems biology interpretation of microarray data.
two breast cancer microarray datasets were analyzed to identify gene sets differentially expressed between histological grade  <dig> and  <dig> breast cancer.
we conclude that, generally, gene set analysis methods with the integration of information from kegg pathway performs better both statistically and biologically.
although gene sets are defined a priori based on biological knowledge, current methods for gene set enrichment testing treat all genes equal.
drawing inspiration from the field of information retrieval, we have developed and present here an approach to incorporate gene appearance frequency  into two current methods, gene set enrichment analysis  and logistic regression-based lrpath framework, to generate more reproducible and biologically meaningful results.
the correlation of normalized enrichment scores  between gene sets, generated by the original gsea and gsea with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated , was compared.
the same datasets were also analyzed by lrpath and lrpath with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated .
the performance of gsea and lrpath can be enhanced with the integration of appearance frequency of genes.
two well-studied lung cancer datasets were also analyzed in the same manner to demonstrate the validity of the method, and similar results were obtained.
gsea-af resulted in higher correlation between experiments and more overlapping top gene sets.
