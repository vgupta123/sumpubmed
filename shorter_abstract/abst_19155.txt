we here present a next-generation sequencing -based approach for assignment of subgenome-specific base-identity at sites containing homeolog-specific polymorphisms : ‘hsp base assignment using ngs data through diploid similarity’ .
we show that hands correctly predicts subgenome-specific base-identity at >90% of assayed hsps in the hexaploid bread wheat  transcriptome, thus providing a substantial increase in accuracy versus previous methods for homeolog-specific base assignment.
the analysis of polyploid genomes is problematic because homeologous subgenome sequences are closely related.
we conclude that hands enables rapid and accurate genome-wide discovery of homeolog-specific base-identity, a capability having multiple applications in polyploid genomics.
