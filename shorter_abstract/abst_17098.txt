similar improvements can be expected for other illumina assays.
we find that the local background estimated by illumina is consistently low, and subtracting this background is beneficial for detecting differential expression .
also, we find that the background normalisation method used in illumina's proprietary software  can cause problems with a standard de analysis.
improvements can however be made by not using background normalisation.
however, little attention has been paid to the pre-processing of illumina data.
however, quality assessment on summarised data may miss spatial artefacts present in the raw data.
access to the raw data allows for a more detailed quality assessment and flexible analyses.
in this paper, we present our experience of analysing the raw data from an illumina spike-in experiment and offer guidelines for those wishing to analyse expression data or develop new methodologies for this technology.
we demonstrate that variances calculated from the raw data can be used as inverse weights in the de analysis to improve power.
in the case of a gene expression study, data can be analysed on an appropriate scale using established tools.
analysing illumina expression data using beadstudio is reasonable because of the conservative estimates of summary values produced by the software.
