lentiviral vectors have emerged as efficient vehicles for transgene delivery in both dividing and non-dividing cells.
the optimised protocol described here is easy to implement and should facilitate the production of high-titre lentivirus with superior transduction efficiency in primary human t cells without the need for further purification methods.
however, despite these advances, the transduction of primary human t cells is still challenging and methods to achieve efficient gene transfer are often expensive and time-consuming.
here we present a simple optimised protocol for the generation and transduction of lentivirus in primary human cd45ra+ t cells.
moreover, we demonstrate that transduction efficiency can be increased with simple modifications to the culturing conditions.
overall, a transduction efficiency of up to 89% in primary human cd45ra+ cells is achievable when these modifications are used in conjunction.
we show that generation of high-titre lentivirus with improved primary t cell transduction is dependent upon optimised ultracentrifuge speed during viral concentration.
a number of different modifications in vector design have increased biosafety and transgene expression.
