remarkably, the ferric iron operon of b. pseudolongum pv8- <dig> is not found in other b. pseudolongum strains and likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer.
in addition, proteins such as elongation factors, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the stress proteins groel and dnak were identified in both secretomes.
analyses of the genome and secretome of b. kashiwanohense pv20- <dig> and b. pseudolongum pv8- <dig> revealed different adaptations to low iron conditions and identified extracellular proteins for iron transport.
the identified extracellular proteins might be involved in competition for iron in the gastrointestinal tract.
here we used combined genomic and proteomic analyses to characterize adaptations to low iron conditions of b. kashiwanohense pv20- <dig> and b. pseudolongum pv8- <dig>   <dig> strains isolated from the feces of iron-deficient african infants and selected for their high iron-sequestering ability.
additionally, the secretomes of the two strains grown under low-iron conditions were analyzed using a combined genomic-proteomic approach.
