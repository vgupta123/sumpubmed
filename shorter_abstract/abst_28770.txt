in addition, it has also a low computational complexity.
for systems biology to succeed in the long run, it is of crucial importance to establish methods that extract large-scale gene networks from high-throughput data that reflect the underlying causal interactions among genes or gene products.
since c3net is based on estimates of mutual information values in conjunction with a maximization step, our numerical investigations demonstrate that our inference algorithm exploits causal structural information in the data efficiently.
our method can contribute to this endeavor by demonstrating that an inference algorithm with a neat design permits not only a more intuitive and possibly biological interpretation of its working mechanism but can also result in superior results.
we compare c3net with four well known methods, aracne, clr, mrnet and rn, conducting in-depth numerical ensemble simulations and demonstrate also for biological expression data from e. coli that c3net performs consistently better than the best known grni methods in the literature.
hence, from a methodological point of view, reliable estimation methods based on observational data are needed to approach this problem practically.
inferring gene regulatory networks from large-scale expression data is an important problem that received much attention in recent years.
