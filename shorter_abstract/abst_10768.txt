a total of  <dig> new mirnas present on the other arm of known pre-mirnas,  <dig> new mirna members,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> high-confidence soybean mirnas were identified using high-throughput sequencing.
additionally, some targets, including a mads-box transcription factor, nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kda subunit, were identified, and they may have some relationship with the programmed cell death, reactive oxygen species accumulation and energy deficiencies, which might lead to soybean male sterility.
two small rna libraries were constructed from the flower buds of the soybean cms line njcms1a and its maintainer njcms1b.
cytoplasmic male sterility  provides crucial breeding materials that facilitate hybrid seed production in various crops, and thus plays an important role in the study of hybrid vigor , in plants.

the results revealed that the mirnas might participate in flower and pollen development, which could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind cms in soybean.
the present study is the first to use deep sequencing technology to identify mirnas and their targets in the flower buds of the soybean cms line njcms1a and its maintainer njcms1b.
to identify the mirnas and their targets that exist in the soybean cms line njcms1a and its maintainer njcms1b, high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis were conducted in this study.
a degradome analysis showed that  <dig> targets were predicted to be targeted by  <dig> mirnas, including a squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor family protein, a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, and an auxin response factor, which were previously shown to be involved in floral organ or anther development in plants.
micrornas  play crucial roles in flower and pollen development by targeting genes that regulate their expression in plants.
