no similarity is found between the trapp and hops complexes and the other tethering factors.
these data further support a highly complex lcea and indicate that the basic architecture of the trafficking system is remarkably conserved and ancient, with the sm proteins and tethering factors having originated very early in eukaryotic evolution.
in membrane trafficking, the mechanisms ensuring vesicle fusion specificity remain to be fully elucidated.
we performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, when relevant, on the sm proteins and components of the tethering complexes, both thought to contribute to vesicle fusion specificity.
overall, our data favour independent origins for the various tethering complexes.
despite evidence suggestive of secondary losses amongst many lineages, the tethering complexes are well represented across the eukaryotes, suggesting an origin predating the radiation of eukaryotic lineages.
the taxa examined possess at least one homologue of each of the four sm protein families; since the four monophyletic families each encompass a wide diversity of eukaryotes, the sm protein families very likely evolved before the last common eukaryotic ancestor .
however, the independent origin of the tethering complexes suggests a novel pattern for increasing complexity in the membrane trafficking system, in addition to the pattern of paralogous machinery elaboration seen thus far.
for example, the major qa/syntaxin snare families are present in most eukaryotic genomes and likely each evolved via gene duplication from a single ancestral syntaxin before the existing eukaryotic groups diversified.
early models proposed that specificity was encoded entirely by snare proteins; more recent models include contributions from rab proteins, syntaxin-binding  proteins and tethering factors.
