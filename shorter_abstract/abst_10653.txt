the aea difference between epileptic and healthy dogs was statistically significant .
values correlated with seizure severity and duration of seizure activity.
dogs with cluster seizures and/or status epilepticus and with seizure activity for more than six months displayed the highest ec concentrations.
in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid  concentrations of the endocannabinoids anandamide  and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol  are altered in epileptic dogs.
aea and total ag were measured at  <dig>   pm and  <dig>   nm in epileptic dogs and at  <dig>   pm and  <dig>   nm in the control group, respectively .
recurrent seizures may lead to an adverse reorganization of the ec system and impairment of its protective effect.
in conclusion, we present the first endocannabinoid measurements in canine csf and confirm the hypothesis that the ec system is altered in canine idiopathic epilepsy.
concentrations of aea and total ag  were measured in  <dig> dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and in  <dig> unaffected, healthy control dogs using liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry.
