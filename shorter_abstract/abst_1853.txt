the adaptation of the crispr-cas <dig> system to pooled library gene knockout screens in mammalian cells represents a major technological leap over rna interference, the prior state of the art.
using bagel, we identify ~ <dig> fitness genes in pooled library knockout screens in human cell lines at 5Â % fdr, a major advance over competing platforms.
coupled with gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, bagel offers significantly greater sensitivity than current methods, while computational optimizations reduce runtime by an order of magnitude.
new methods for analyzing the data and evaluating results are needed.
