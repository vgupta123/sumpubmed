a simple comparison between the prevalence estimates in different countries reveals that, in  <dig>  the abattoir survey appears to detect more scrapie in some countries.
furthermore, we conducted a meta-regression analysis to assess the effect of country-specific characteristics on the variability.
three countries contributed the most to the overall heterogeneity: germany, ireland and the netherlands.
baseline risks, those of the slaughtered populations across europe, and country-specific covariates, available from the european commission report, were inputted in the model to explain the heterogeneity.
our results show the presence of significant heterogeneity in the odds ratios between countries and no reduction in the variability after adjustment for the different risks in the baseline populations.
we applied meta-analysis techniques to study this apparent heterogeneity in the behaviour of the surveys across europe.
the inclusion of country-specific covariates did not, in general, reduce the variability except for one variable: the proportion of the total adult sheep population sampled as fallen stock by each country.
we have chosen the odds ratios between the two surveys to inform the underlying relationship between them and to allow comparisons between the countries under the meta-regression framework.
this is contrary to evidence suggesting the greater ability of the fallen stock survey to detect the disease.
