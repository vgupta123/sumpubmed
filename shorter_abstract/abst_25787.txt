in recent years, a novel regulator known as microrna  has been found to play an important role in gene regulation.
investigating its structure, we found that the feed forward loop is a significant network motif, which plays an important role in gene regulation.
based on the co-regulation of crms and mirnas, we constructed a novel combinatorial regulatory network which was found to play an important role in gene regulation, particularly during embryonic development.
gene regulation is a key factor in gaining a full understanding of molecular biology.
cis-regulatory modules , consisting of multiple transcription factor binding sites, have been confirmed as the main regulators in gene expression.
furthermore, we constructed a regulatory network composed of crms, mirnas, and their target genes.
in addition, we further analyzed the effect of mirnas in embryonic cells, and we found that mir- <dig>  as well as some other mirnas, have significant co-regulation effect with crms in embryonic development.
by analyzing their effect on gene expression profiles, we found that genes targeted by both crms and mirnas express in a significantly similar way.
