in addition, they are usually associated with high rates of both false positive and false negative results.
to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we then compared its performance with the method based on support vector machine .
in this study, we present a novel computational model combining weighted sparse representation based classifier  and global encoding  of amino acid sequence.
on the basis of such a feature representation, novel weighted sparse representation based classifier is introduced to predict protein interaction class.
although high-throughput technologies have generated considerable protein-protein interactions  data for various species, the processes of experimental methods are both time-consuming and expensive.
accordingly, a number of computational approaches have been developed to effectively and accurately predict protein interactions.
the results show that the proposed method achieved a significant improvement.
when the proposed method was evaluated with the ppis data of s. cerevisiae, human and h. pylori, it achieved high prediction accuracies of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> Â % respectively.
extensive experiments were performed for cross-species ppis prediction and the prediction accuracies were also very promising.
therefore, it is very urgent to develop effective computational methods for prediction of ppis solely using protein sequence information.
two kinds of protein descriptors, composition and transition, are extracted for representing each protein sequence.
