however, the ability to understand and modify gene function for crop improvement is hindered by the lack of available genomic resources.
we hope that the use of this reverse genetics resource will enable more researchers to pursue wheat functional genomics and provide novel allelic diversity for wheat improvement.
tilling is a powerful reverse genetics approach that combines chemical mutagenesis with a high-throughput screen for mutations.
in total, we identified over  <dig> novel alleles in eleven targeted gene/genome combinations in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat and have validated the presence of a subset of them in our seed stock.
despite this, few tilling populations are currently available.
we developed mutant populations of pasta and common wheat and organized them for tilling.
this implies a high probability of obtaining knock-out alleles , in addition to multiple missense mutations.
these mutation frequencies predict that screening  <dig>  lines for an effective target region of  <dig>  kb with 50% gc content will result in ~ <dig> hexaploid and ~ <dig> tetraploid mutant alleles.
we developed genome-specific primers to circumvent the presence of multiple homoeologous copies of our target genes.
this detection method had similar sensitivity as traditional li-cor screens, suggesting that it represents a valid alternative.
we have generated reverse genetics tilling resources for pasta and bread wheat and achieved a high mutation density in both populations.
wheat is specially well-suited for tilling due to the high mutation densities tolerated by polyploids, which allow for very efficient screens.
each mutant library was characterized by tilling multiple genes, revealing high mutation densities in both the hexaploid  and tetraploid  populations for 50% gc targets.
