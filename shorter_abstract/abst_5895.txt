remarkably, our study proves that the inclusion of non-specific antigens, detected not only in tumor but also in normal sera, increases the performance significantly, since non-specific antigens contribute additional diagnostic information.
this antigen set was detected by a subset selection method based on mutual information.
we tested several established statistical learning methods on the resulting reactivity patterns using 10-fold cross validation.
our approach offers the possibility to screen members of risk groups as a matter of routine such that tumors hopefully can be diagnosed immediately after their genesis.
the development of effective frameworks that permit an accurate diagnosis of tumors, especially in their early stages, remains a grand challenge in the field of bioinformatics.
for these tumors the best classification result with a specificity of  <dig> %, a sensitivity of  <dig> %, an accuracy of  <dig> %, and an area under the roc curve of  <dig>  was achieved using a set of  <dig> antigen markers only.
our approach uses statistical learning techniques applied to multiple antigen tumor antigen markers utilizing the immune system as a very sensitive marker of molecular pathological processes.
the early detection will finally result in a higher cure- and lower morbidity-rate.
