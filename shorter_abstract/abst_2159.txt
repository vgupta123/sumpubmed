mitogenome data demonstrate an overall strong resolution of deep-level phylogenies of polyneoptera but not insecta.
characterization of z. medoensis mitogenome contributes to our understanding of the enigmatic zoraptera.
to characterize zoraptera mitogenome features and provide insights into its phylogenetic placement, here we sequenced, for the first time, one complete mitogenome of zoraptera and reconstructed the phylogeny of polyneoptera.
however, both zoraptera and embioptera exhibit very long branches in phylogenetic trees.
fourth, truncated secondary structures of trna genes occur with loss of dihydrouridine  arm in trnc, trnr, and trns and loss of tΨc arm in trnh and trnt.
although phylogenetic analyses based on a wide array of morphological and/or nuclear data have been performed, the position of zoraptera is still under debate.
the phylogenetic analyses based on the mitogenome sequence information indicate that zoraptera, represented by z. medoensis, is recovered as sister to embioptera.
the mitogenome of zorotypus medoensis with an a + t content of  <dig> % is composed of  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes, and a noncoding a + t-rich region.
third, z. medoensis mitogenome has experienced an accelerated substitution rate.

first, it is very compact, comprising  <dig>  bp, and is the smallest among all known polyneopteran mitogenomes.
it is preferable to expand taxon sampling of zoraptera and other poorly represented orders in future to break up long branches.
this mitogenome shows a number of very unusual features.
the gene content and arrangement are identical to those considered ancestral for insects.
