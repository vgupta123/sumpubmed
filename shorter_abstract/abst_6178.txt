we conclude that ngs.plot is a useful tool to help fill the gap between massive datasets and genomic information in this era of big sequencing data.
we have developed ngs.plot â€“ a standalone program to visualize enrichment patterns of dna-interacting proteins at functionally important regions based on next-generation sequencing data.
