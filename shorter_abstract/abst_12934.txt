there is a much higher estimated seroprevalence of locations with goats exposed to btv <dig> than can be inferred from the rather low number of reported clinical outbreaks in goats.
this is probably due to the fact that clinical signs in infected goats are far less obvious than in sheep.
there was a wide range in within-location seroprevalence in locations with goats and sheep .
the wide range in within-location seroprevalence observed means that the proportion of animals protected in  <dig> by a natural infection in  <dig> and/or  <dig> can differ highly between flocks.
in august  <dig> a major epidemic of bluetongue virus serotype  <dig>  started off in north-west europe.
recently, the european union decided to start vaccination against btv <dig>  in order to improve the understanding of the epidemiological situation, it was necessary to execute a cross-sectional serological study at the end of the bt vector season.
on the basis of our cross-sectional study, the estimated seroprevalence of btv8-exposed locations in the netherlands in  <dig> was 0% for goats  and  <dig> % for sheep .
in the course of  <dig> it became evident that btv <dig> had survived the winter in north-west europe, re-emerged and spread exponentially.
cattle were the target species for cross-sectional serological studies in europe at the end of  <dig> and  <dig>  however, there was no information on the btv8-seroprevalence in sheep and goats.
