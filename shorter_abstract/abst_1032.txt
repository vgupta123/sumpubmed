we identified  <dig> e. coli genes responsive to prophage induction, which included pleiotropic stress response pathways, the arc and cpx regulons, and global regulators crp and lrp.
our study confirmed known host-phage interactions of induction of the heat shock regulon, escape replication, and suppression of genes involved in cell division and initiation of replication.
several hundred genes involved in central metabolism, energy metabolism, translation and transport were down-regulated late in induction.
we observed a temporally coordinated program of phage gene expression, with distinct early, middle and late transcriptional classes.
overall, we observe that prophage induction has a surprisingly low impact on host physiology.
to address this question, we collected transcriptional profiles of escherichia coli and bacteriophage lambda throughout lysogenic induction by uv light.
this study provides the first global dynamic picture of how host processes respond to lambda phage induction.
the transition from viral latency to lytic growth involves complex interactions among host and viral factors, and the extent to which host physiology is buffered from the virus during induction of lysis is not known.
