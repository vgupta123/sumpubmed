we present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches.
the utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition.
we evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best.
