infection of the type i fcov was dominant, with a seropositive rate of  <dig> %, whereas  <dig> % of cats were infected with the type ii fcov.
moreover, most of the cats  infected with a genotypic untypable virus bearing a type i fcov antibody.
type i fcov was found to be predominant compared with type ii virus.
however,  <dig> %  fip cats and  <dig> %  clinically healthy cats were found to possess antibodies against both viruses.
a total of  <dig> cases from a teaching hospital was surveyed for prevalence of different fcov infections.
a relatively simple serotyping method to distinguish between two types of fcov infection was developed.
based on this method, two types of fcov infection in taiwan was first carried out.
in most cases, results derived from serotyping and genotyping were highly agreeable.
results derived from serotyping and genotyping support our current understanding of evolution of disease-related fcov and transmission of fip.
an immunofluorescence assay based on cells infected with the recombinant viruses that was capable of distinguishing between the two types of viral infection was established.
feline infectious peritonitis  is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus .
