due to the symmetric nature of b-ions and y-ions peaks, the self-convolution result of a good spectrum would produce a highest mid point intensity peak.
the quality score was defined as the ratio of the intensity at the mid point to the remaining peaks of the convolution result.
the results were encouraging, revealing a high percentage of positive prediction rates for spectra with good quality scores.
the proposed method measures the qualities of ms data sets based on the symmetric property of b- and y-ion peaks present in a ms spectrum.
we conclude that the algorithm performs well and could potentially be used as a pre-processing for all mass spectrometry based protein identification tools.
by pre-determining the quality of tandem ms data before subjecting them to protein identification algorithms, spurious protein predictions due to poor tandem ms data are avoided, giving scientists greater confidence in the predicted results.
many algorithms have been developed for deciphering the tandem mass spectrometry  data sets.
the first performs searches on theoretical mass spectrum database, while the second based itself on de novo sequencing from raw mass spectrometry data.
self-convolution on ms data and its time-reversal copy was employed.
