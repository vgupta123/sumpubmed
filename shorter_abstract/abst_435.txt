we used a longitudinal dataset on wild galapagos sea lions  to develop a relatively new perspective on this problem, by testing for associations between heterozygosity and immune variation across age classes and between ecological contexts.
homozygosity by locus was negatively correlated with serum immunoglobulin g production in pups , suggesting that reduced genetic diversity has a detrimental influence on the early development of immune defence in the galapagos sea lion.
these findings demonstrate the environmental context-dependency of the phenotypic expression of immune variation, which is implicit in the theory of ecoimmunology, but which has been rarely demonstrated in the wild.
in addition, homozygosity by locus was positively correlated with total circulating leukocyte concentration in juveniles , but only in a colony subject to the anthropogenic environmental impacts of development, pollution and introduced species, which suggests that reduced genetic diversity influences mature immune system activity in circumstances of high antigen exposure.
