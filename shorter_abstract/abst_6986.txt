kaposi’s sarcoma , which is induced by the etiological infectious agent ks-associated herpesvirus , is a peculiar neoplasm that expresses both blood and lymphatic endothelial markers and possesses extensive neovasculature.
by small rna sequencing , we revealed that  <dig>  %  of kaposin b up-regulated and  <dig>  %  of kaposin b down-regulated known mirnas were regulated by c-myc.

since kaposin b is a nuclear protein with no dna-binding domain, it may regulate gene expression by incorporating itself into a transcription complex.
micrornas  have emerged as master regulators of angiogenesis and other cancer-related events.
kaposin b is one of the latent viral genes and is expressed in all kshv tumor cells.
we demonstrated that c-myc and kaposin b form a transcription complex and bind to the mir-221/- <dig> promoter, thereby affecting their expression and anti-angiogenic ability.
we also found that  <dig> novel mirna were up-regulated and  <dig> novel mirnas were down-regulated in cells expressing both c-myc and kaposin b compared with cells expressing kaposin b only.
our study identifies known and novel c-myc-regulated micrornas and reveals that a c-myc-oriented program is coordinated by kaposin b in kshv-infected cells.
using kshv and its proteins as baits will be an efficient way to discover new angiomirs in endothelial cells.
