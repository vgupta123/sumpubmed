furthermore, we show that these defects are completely rescued by fzy-1/cdc <dig>  suggesting that regulation of the apc/ccdc <dig> by the sac component mdf- <dig> is important for proper postembryonic cell proliferation.
furthermore, we provide evidence, by monitoring seam cell lineage, that one of the checkpoint genes is required for proper postembryonic cell proliferation.
however, postembryonic spatial analysis revealed distinct, tissue-specific expression of sac genes with striking co-expression in seam cells, as well as in the gut.
the importance of sac genes for genome stability is well established; however, the roles these genes play, during postembryonic development of a multicellular organism, remain largely unexplored.
our results indicate that sac genes display different tissue-specific expression patterns during postembryonic development in c. elegans with significant co-expression in hypodermal seam cells and gut cells, suggesting that these genes have distinct as well as overlapping roles in postembryonic development that may or may not be related to their established roles in mitosis.
we have shown that regulatory sequences for all of the sac genes drive ubiquitous gfp expression during early embryonic development.
additionally, we show that the absence of mdf-2/mad <dig>  leads to aberrant number and alignment of seam cell nuclei, defects mainly attributed to abnormal postembryonic cell proliferation.
we have used gfp fusions of 5' upstream intergenic regulatory sequences to assay spatiotemporal expression patterns of eight conserved genes implicated in the spindle assembly checkpoint function in caenorhabditis elegans.
