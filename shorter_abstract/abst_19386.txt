based on a phylogenetic tree these clones had 100% similarity to escherichia fergusonii and enterococcus faecium.
mucosal lesions were found in 36/ <dig> stomachs and included hyperplastic rugae, polypoid structures and focal erosions.
stomach lesions, as well as normal appearing mucosa were obtained from horses slaughtered for human consumption.
the equine glandular stomach is commonly affected by erosion and ulceration.
in samples of lesions, as well as normal samples, clones with 99% similarities to lactobacillus salivarius and sarcina ventriculi were found.
escherichia like bacterium clones and enterococcus clones were demonstrated in one focal erosion.
all samples were tested for urease activity using the pyloritekÂ® assay, while mucosal bacterial content was evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
none of the samples were tested positive for urease activity or for fish using the helicobacter genus specific probe.
the enterococcus were found colonising the mucosal surface, while e. fergusonii organisms were also demonstrated intraepithelial.
since e. fergusonii has been described as an emerging pathogen in both humans and animals, the finding of this bacterium in gastric erosion warrants further clarification to whether gastric infection with this type bacterium is important for horses.
could not be verified as being involved in lesions of the glandular stomach of the horse.
