cichlid fishes, particularly tilapias, are an important source of animal protein in tropical countries around the world.
this physical map is a powerful tool for accelerating genomic studies in cichlid fishes, including comparative mapping among fish species, long-range assembly of genomic shotgun sequences, and the positional cloning of genes underlying important phenotypic traits.
to support selective breeding of these species we are constructing genetic and physical maps of the tilapia genome.
physical maps linking collections of bac clones are a critical resource for both positional cloning and assembly of whole genome sequences.
we constructed a genome-wide physical map of the tilapia genome by restriction fingerprinting  <dig>  bacterial artificial chromosome  clones using high-resolution capillary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
