the expression of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetases  is induced by type  <dig> interferons  in response to viral infection.
the main oas <dig> isoform expressed in daudi and ht <dig> cells was p <dig>  and the main oas <dig> isoform expressed in hela cells was p <dig>  in addition, low levels of the oas <dig> p <dig> mrna was detected in hela cells and p <dig> mrna in daudi cells, and trace amounts of p44a mrna were detected in the three cell lines treated with type  <dig> interferon.
the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform localizes to the mitochondria, therefore a full 2-5a system can now be found in the mitochondria.
we have used three human cell lines with different genotypes in the oas <dig> snp rs <dig>  hela cells with the aa genotype, ht <dig> cells with ag, and daudi cells with gg.
we have investigated the functional effect of two common snps in the oas <dig> gene.
the oas proteins have a unique ability to produce 2′-5′ oligoadenylates, which bind and activate the ribonuclease rnase l. the rnase l degrades cellular rnas which in turn inhibits protein translation and induces apoptosis.
in daudi and ht <dig> cells the p <dig> isoform is the most abundantly expressed isoform associated with the g allele, whereas in hela cells the most abundantly expressed isoform is p <dig> associated with the a allele.
we show that the oas <dig> p <dig> isoform was localized in the mitochondria in daudi cells, whereas the oas <dig> isoforms in hela cells were primarily localized in cytoplasmic vacuoles/lysosomes.
