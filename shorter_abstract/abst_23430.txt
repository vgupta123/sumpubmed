our data show that the bovine silv gene generates an unexpectedly large number of different transcripts occurring in skin as well as in non-pigmented tissues, e.g.
furthermore, the splice variants of the bovine silv gene represent a comprehensive natural model to refine the knowledge about functional domains in the silv protein.
the silver homologue gene plays a major role in melanosome development.
this hypothesis is further supported by transcript variants lacking functional key elements of the silv protein relevant for eumelanosome development.
the alternative splice sites are generated by internal splicing and primarily remove complete exons.
our study exemplifies that the extent of alternative splicing is presumably much higher than previously estimated and that alternatively spliced transcripts presumably can generate molecules of deviating function compared to their constitutive counterpart.
in contrast to previous results in other species reporting silv expression exclusively in pigmented tissues, our experiments provide evidence that the bovine silv gene is expressed in a variety of tissues independent of pigmentation.
thus, the bovine silv gene can serve as a model for the investigation of the putative additional functions of silv.
alternative splicing predominantly affects the repeat domain of the protein, which has a functional key role in fibril formation during eumelanosome development.
while there are many studies addressing silv function upon a eumelaneic pigment background, there is a substantial lack of information regarding the further relevance of silv, e.g.
the expression of the bovine silv gene independent of pigmentation suggests silv functions exceeding melanosome development in cattle.
