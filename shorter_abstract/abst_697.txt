the seasonality and time dependency of the activity of single farms in the networks requires a careful assessment of the actual time period included to determine farm level criteria.
a cumulative score was calculated per farm, including the following parameters; the maximum monthly ingoing contact chain , the average number of animals per incoming movement, use of mixed alpine pastures and the number of weeks in  <dig> a farm had movements registered.
this study focused on the descriptive analysis of cattle movements and farm-level parameters derived from cattle movements, which are considered to be generically suitable for risk-based surveillance systems in switzerland for diseases where animal movements constitute an important risk pathway.
the final scores ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  validation of the scores against results from the bvd surveillance programme  <dig> gave promising results for setting the cut off for each of the five selected farm level criteria at the 50th percentile.
restricting testing to farms with a score ≥  <dig> would have resulted in the same number of detected bvd positive farms as testing all farms, i.e., the outcome of the  <dig> surveillance programme could have been reached with a smaller survey.
a framework was developed to select farms for surveillance based on a risk score summarizing  <dig> parameters.

the proposed method is a promising framework for the selection of farms according to the risk of infection based on animal movements.
