to ensure reliable retrieval of multiple ribbons from the boat of a diamond knife we introduce a substrate holder with  <dig> axes of translation or rotation specifically designed for that purpose.
one is array tomography, where ribbons of ultrathin serial sections are deposited on solid substrates like silicon wafers or glass coverslips.
now, technical advances have lead to several electron microscopy  large volume imaging techniques.
imaging such arrays in a standard wide field fluorescence microscope produces reconstructions with 200 nm lateral resolution and 100 nm  resolution in z.
in our first example, a cell population isolated from zebrafish spleen, we characterize different cell types according to their organelle inventory by segmenting 3d reconstructions of complete cells imaged with nanoscale resolution.
we demonstrate, that em volume data at different levels of resolution can yield comprehensive information, including statistics, morphology and organization of cells and tissue.
our custom-designed substrate holder allows reproducible generation of section libraries, which can then be imaged in a hierarchical way.
imaging large volumes such as entire cells or small model organisms at nanoscale resolution seemed an unrealistic, rather tedious task so far.
with the second example, the root tip of cress, we illustrate how combining information from intermediate resolution data with high resolution data from selected regions of interest can drastically reduce the amount of data that has to be recorded.
in addition, by screening large numbers of cells at decreased resolution we can define the percentage at which different cell types are present in our preparation.
