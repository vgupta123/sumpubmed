conformational changes induced by the mutation r289k causes loss of number of hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and the h7n <dig> viral neuraminidase in  <dig> out of  <dig> complexes.
and it is likely that the novel influenza a  virus adopts a higher probability to acquire resistance to peramivir than the other two inhibitors.
combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that zanamivir forms more favorable and stable complex than oseltamivir and peramivir when binding to the active site of the h7n <dig> neuraminidase.
however, how these inhibitors work and affect the binding cavity of the novel h7n <dig> neuraminidase in the presence of potential mutations has not been disclosed.
since late march  <dig>  there has been another global health concern with a sudden wave of flu infections by a novel strain of avian influenza a  virus in china.
in addition, our results of binding-affinity relationships of the  <dig> inhibitors with the viral neuraminidase proteins of previous pandemics  and the current novel h7n <dig> reflected the extent of binding effectiveness of the  <dig> inhibitors to the novel h7n <dig> neuraminidase.
the results are novel and specific for the a/hangzhou/1/ <dig> influenza strain.
