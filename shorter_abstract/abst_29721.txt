genetic linkage maps are important tools for many genetic applications including mapping of quantitative trait loci , identifying dna markers for fingerprinting, and map-based gene cloning.
we previously reported a random amplified polymorphic dna -based genetic linkage map derived from dianthus capitatus ssp.
andrezejowskianus and a simple sequence repeat -based genetic linkage map constructed using data from intraspecific f <dig> populations; however, the number of markers was insufficient, and so the number of linkage groups  did not coincide with the number of chromosomes .
we improved the ssr-based genetic linkage map using ssr markers derived from a genomic library, expression sequence tags, and rna-seq data.
we added  <dig> new ssrs, eight rapd, and two sequence-tagged site loci to refine the rapd-based genetic linkage map, which comprised  <dig> lgs consisting of  <dig> loci covering  <dig>  cm.
the improved genetic linkage maps and ssr markers developed in this study will serve as reference genetic linkage maps for members of the genus dianthus, including carnation, and will be useful for mapping qtls associated with various traits, and for improving carnation breeding programs.
we also mapped qtls for two traits  and a phenotypic locus for flower-type by analyzing previously reported genotype and phenotype data.
linkage analysis revealed that  <dig> ssr loci  could be mapped to  <dig> linkage groups  covering  <dig>  cm.
we identified  <dig> loci in carnation using the two linkage maps.
therefore, we aimed to produce a high-density genetic map to improve its usefulness for breeding purposes and genetic research.
comparison of five minor lgs covering less than  <dig> cm with lgs in our previous rapd-based genetic map suggested that four lgs could be integrated into two lgs by anchoring common ssr loci.
