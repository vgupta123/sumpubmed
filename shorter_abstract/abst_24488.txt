we investigated: 1) the correlation between pigmentation traits within and between the thorax and the fourth abdominal segment, and 2) their associations with different geographical and ecological variables, using  <dig> lines belonging to  <dig> sub-saharan and cosmopolitan populations.
ecological analyses indicated that the variable most predictive of pigmentation in africa, especially for the thorax, was ultra-violet  intensity, consistent with the so-called gloger's rule invoking a role of melanin in uv protection.
our data suggest that different environmental factors may shape clinal variation in tropical and temperate regions, and may lead to the evolution of different degrees of melanism in different high altitude populations in the tropics.
ethiopian flies have a diffuse wide thoracic trident making the mesonotum and the head almost black, a phenotype that is absent from all other sub-saharan or cosmopolitan populations including high-altitude flies from peru .
pigmentation has a long history of investigation in evolutionary biology.
pigmentation clines substantially differed between sub-saharan and cosmopolitan populations.
in drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal and altitudinal clines have been found but their underlying causes remain unclear.
more importantly, we found that thoracic pigmentation reaches its maximal values in this species in high-altitude populations of ethiopia .
moreover, most studies were conducted on cosmopolitan populations which have a relatively low level of genetic structure and diversity compared to sub-saharan african populations.
