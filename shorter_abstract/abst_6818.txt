to enhance the access of breeders to the diversity of the crop, mungbean core and mini core collections have been established.
the core collection of  <dig>  entries has been built by random selection of 20% of the accessions after geographical stratification and subsequent cluster analysis of eight phenotypic descriptors in the whole collection.
summary statistics, especially the low differences of means, equal variance of the traits in both the whole and core collection and the visual inspection of quantile-quantile plots comparing the variation of phenotypic traits present in both collections indicated that the core collection well represented the pattern of diversity of the whole collection.
the core collection was genotyped with  <dig> simple sequence repeat markers and a mini core set of  <dig> accessions was selected, which depicted the allele and genotype diversity of the core collection.
the mungbean core and mini core collections plus their phenotypic and genotypic data are available for distribution to breeders.

avrdc – the world vegetable center is holding in trust the world’s second largest mungbean  germplasm collection with more than  <dig>  accessions.
large ex situ germplasm collections generally harbor a wide range of crop diversity.
screening large collections for traits of interest is laborious and expensive.
