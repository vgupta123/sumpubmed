when in complex with α <dig> - or α <dig> -sialyllactose, the domain is shown to interact only with the terminal sialic acid.
this domain has been identified to play a critical role in allowing the bacterium to promote adhesion and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and hence may play a key role in promoting bacterial meningitis.
the structure also suggests that small molecules or sialic acid analogues could be developed to fill the acidic pocket and hence provide a new therapeutic avenue against meningitis caused by s. pneumoniae.
upstream of the catalytic domain of nana is a domain that conforms to the sialic acid-recognising cbm <dig> family of the cazy  database.
significantly, a deep acidic pocket adjacent to the sialic acid-binding site is identified, which is occupied by a lysine from a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal.
crystal structures of both apo- and holo- forms of the nana cbm <dig> domain , have been determined to  <dig>  Å resolution.
