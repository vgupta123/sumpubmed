the filtered library also showed enrichment in expressed and gene-like sequences, while the highest-copy repeats were largely under-represented in this library.
we conducted a characterization of the dna methylation patterns of the s. moellendorffii genome by sequencing a set of s. moellendorffii shotgun genomic clones, along with a set of methylation filtered clones.
chloroplast dna, which is typically unmethylated, was enriched in the filtered library relative to the shotgun library, showing that there is dna methylation in the extremely small s. moellendorffii genome.
these results show that genes and repeats are differentially methylated in the s. moellendorffii genome, as occurs in other plants studied.
our results shed light on the genome methylation pattern in a member of a relatively unexplored plant lineage.
the dna methylation data reported here will help understanding the involvement of this epigenetic mark in fundamental biological processes, as well as the evolutionary aspects of epigenetics in land plants.
although genomic information for s. moellendorffii is starting to be produced, little is known about basic aspects of its molecular biology.
the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii is a vascular plant that diverged from the fern/seed plant lineage at least  <dig> million years ago.
methylation filtration genomic libraries select unmethylated dna clones due to the presence of the methylation-dependent restriction endonuclease mcrbc in the bacterial host.
