this array is expected to find widespread usage both in research and commercial application such as in genomic selection, genome-wide association studies, selection signature analyses, fine mapping of qtls and detection of copy number variants.
due to a lower extent of ld in broilers compared to layers, as reported in previous studies, the ratio of broiler and layer snps in the array was kept as 3: <dig>  the final panel was shown to genotype a wide range of samples including broilers and layers with over  <dig> k to  <dig> k informative snps per line.
a principal component analysis was used to demonstrate the ability of the array to detect the expected population structure which is an important pre-investigation step for many genome-wide analyses.
snps were selected to achieve an essentially uniform distribution based on genetic map distance for both broiler and layer lines.
polymorphic snps were further analysed for their population characteristics and genomic effects.
using criteria such as high snp-quality score, acceptable design scores predicting high conversion performance in the final array and uniformity of distribution across the genome, we selected ~ <dig>  m snps for validation through genotyping on an independent set of samples .
about  <dig> million  putative snps were detected by mapping sequence reads to the new reference genome  of which ~ <dig> m appeared to be segregating in different lines.
the final array, designed on the basis of these analyses, consists of  <dig>  snps and includes  <dig>  coding variants.
about 64% of the snps were polymorphic with high call rates , good cluster separation and stable mendelian inheritance.
although the chicken is one of the most important farm animals, no hd array is yet available for high resolution genetic analysis of this species.
