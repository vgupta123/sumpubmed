our data demonstrate that, like eggs, schistosome worms also induce functional type  <dig> responses and that a parasite cysteine protease is an inducer of type  <dig> responses during the early stages of schistosome infection.
we also show that the smcb1-specific ige response is dependent on cognate cd4+ t cell help and il- <dig>  suggesting that pre-patent th <dig> responses provide t cell help for the smcb1-specific ige response.
finally, exposed human subjects also produced ige against smcb <dig>
the induction of this response is independent of schistosome eggs as infection with male or female worms alone also induced smcb1-specific ige.
through analysis of experimental pre-patent infections, we show that the s. mansoni cysteine protease smcb <dig> is rapidly targeted by an antigen-specific ige response.
