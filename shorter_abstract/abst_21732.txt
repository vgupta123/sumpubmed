estimates of genome-wide  recombination rates from  <dig> higher plants showed a significant phylogenetic signal.
the use of different comparative phylogenetic models demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and he , and that trees have higher rates of genome-wide recombination than short-lived herbs and shrubs.
a significant taxonomic component was further made evident by our models, as conifers exhibited lower recombination rates than angiosperms.
however, some of these tree taxa have surprisingly low levels of nucleotide diversity at the dna sequence level, which points to recombination as a potential generator of genetic diversity in these organisms.
recombination is a very labile force, susceptible to evolutionary and life trait related processes, which have also been correlated with general levels of genetic diversity.
altogether, our results illustrate how both common ancestry and life-history traits have to be taken into account for understanding the evolution of genetic diversity and genomic rates of recombination across plant species, and highlight the relevance of species life forms to explain general levels of diversity and recombination.
