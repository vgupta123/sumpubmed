our study is among the first to demonstrate the use of illumina short read sequencing for de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model species, and the first to implement this technology for comparing floral transcriptomes in outcrossing and selfing plants.
by sequencing mrna from tissues sampled at various stages of flower development, our goal was to sequence and assemble the floral transcriptome and identify differential patterns of gene expression.
increased inbreeding has important consequences for floral morphology, population genetic structure and genome evolution.
many of the differentially expressed genes affect floral traits commonly altered in selfing plants and these represent a set of potential candidate genes for investigating the evolution of the selfing syndrome.
all four genotypes had highly correlated gene expression, but the three e. paniculata genotypes were more correlated with one another than each was to e. paradoxa.
the shift from cross-fertilization to predominant self-fertilization is among the most common evolutionary transitions in the reproductive biology of flowering plants.
here, we use short-read sequencing to assemble, de novo, the floral transcriptomes of three genotypes of eichhornia paniculata, including an outcrosser and two genotypes from independently derived selfers, and a single genotype of the sister species e. paradoxa.
our analysis identified  <dig> genes associated with floral development,  <dig> of which were differentially expressed in selfing lineages relative to the outcrosser.
