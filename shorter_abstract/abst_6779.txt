esc1p is the first non-membrane protein of the nuclear periphery which – like proteins of the nuclear lamina of higher eukaryotes – can modify the shape of the yeast nucleus.
since s. cerevisiae undergoes closed mitosis, the nuclear envelope of the daughter nucleus is continuous with that of the maternal nucleus at anaphase.
upon increased esc1p expression, cell division continues and dramatic elaborations of the nuclear envelope extend into the cytoplasm.
the elaborations of the nuclear envelope  which appear upon induction of excess esc1p are not inherited during mitotic growth.
unlike esc1p and the colocalizing protein, mlp1p, overexpression of selected proteins of the inner nuclear membrane is toxic.
moreover, excess esc1p affects the levels of multiple transcripts, not all of which originate at telomere-proximal loci.
these "escapades" include nuclear pores and associate with the nucleolus, but exclude chromatin.
nevertheless, several constitutents of the maternal nucleus are not present in the daughter nucleus.
escapades are not inherited by daughter nuclei.
the present study aims to identify proteins which impact the shape of the yeast nucleus and to learn whether modifications of shape are passed on to the next mitotic generation.
