to address these concerns, we reverse engineered cerna networks  in breast and prostate adenocarcinomas using context-specific tcga profiles, and tested whether cerna interactions can predict the effects of rnai-mediated gene silencing perturbations in pc <dig> and mcf <dig> cells._enref_ <dig> our results, based on tests of thousands of inferred cerna interactions that are predicted to alter hundreds of cancer genes in each of the two tumor contexts, confirmed statistically significant effects for half of the predicted targets.
our results suggest that the expression of a significant fraction of cancer genes may be regulated by cerna interactions in each of the two tumor contexts.
interestingly, reports from multiple groups suggest that mirna targets may be coupled through competitive stoichiometric sequestration.

recent studies have questioned the physiological relevance of cerna interactions, our ability to accurately predict these interactions, and the number of genes that are impacted by cerna interactions in specific cellular contexts.
