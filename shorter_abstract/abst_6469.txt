alternative transcript of slc29a <dig>  was up-regulated only in crc samples, but not in the other tested tumor types.
these eight isoforms encoded by ogdh, col6a <dig>  icam <dig>  phpt <dig>  ppp2r5d, slc29a <dig>  and trib <dig> genes were up-regulated in colorectal tumors, and this is in concordance with the bioinformatics data.
colorectal cancer  is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide.
our results bring new knowledge on alternative splicing in colorectal cancer and suggest a set of mrna isoforms that could be used for cancer diagnosis and development of treatment methods.

crc molecular pathogenesis is heterogeneous and may be followed by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, chromosomal and microsatellite instability, alternative splicing alterations, hypermethylation of cpg islands, oxidative stress, impairment of different signaling pathways and energy metabolism.
in the present work, we have studied the alterations of alternative splicing patterns of genes related to energy metabolism in crc.
the expression of  <dig> alternative mrna isoforms involved in cell energy metabolism was examined.
we identified tumor-specific expression of alternative spliced transcripts of seven genes involved in energy metabolism in crc.
using crosshub software, we analyzed the cancer genome atlas  rna-seq datasets derived from colon tumor and matched normal tissues.
