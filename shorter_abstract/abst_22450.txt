the molecular assembly of the peptides was characterized by the determination of critical micelle concentration  with concentration of 10- <dig> m and the colloidal size distribution.
a promising way in diagnostic and therapeutic applications is the development of peptide amphiphiles .
peptides with a palmitic acid alkylchain were designed and characterized to study the effect of the structure modifications on self-assembling capabilities and the multiple binding capacity to hemagglutinin , the surface protein of influenza virus type a. the peptide amphiphiles consists of a hydrophilic headgroup with a biological functionality of the peptide sequence and a chemically conjugated hydrophobic tail.
the modification of the physico-chemical parameters by producing peptide amphiphiles form monomeric structures which enhances the binding affinity and allows a better examination of the interaction with the virus surface protein hemagglutinin.
