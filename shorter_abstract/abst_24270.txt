we also discovered a fine structure within the guinean group.
given these results, association studies can be used within the species c. canephora.
guinean and congolese breeding populations of c. canephora have been used for this work, with the goal of identifying ways of using these populations in association genetics.
we identified changes in the ld along the genome within the different c. canephora diversity groups.
lastly, our results could be used to improve c. arabica because one of its parents is closely related to c. canephora.
association genetics would help to speed up this program by more rapidly selecting zones of interest in the genome.
this article describes the first results of an ld assessment in a coffee tree species.
however, prior to any such studies, the linkage disequilibrium  needs to be assessed between the markers on the genome.
a reciprocal recurrent selection program has been under way for the coffea canephora coffee tree for approximately thirty years in the ivory coast.
the coffee recurrent selection scheme being implemented in the ivory coast can thus be optimized.
these data are essential for guiding association studies.
in the different diversity groups studied, the ld was variable.
some diversity groups displayed disequilibria over long distances , whereas others had disequilibria not exceeding  <dig> cm.
