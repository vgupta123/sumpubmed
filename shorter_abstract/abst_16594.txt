it has been shown that virus levels in chlorotic tissue are high, while they are low in healthy tissue.
as is observed in experiments high virus levels coincide with high levels of sirnas, and sirnas are also present in the boundaries between infected and healthy tissue.
one common infection symptom in plants is the formation of chlorotic tissue in leaves.
we present a modeling approach in which we combine intra- and inter-cellular dynamics of rna silencing and viral growth.
these results strongly indicate that the interaction between virus growth and rna silencing plays a role in the formation of infection patterns on leaves.
this work shows that rna silencing and virus growth within a cell, and the local spread of virions and sirnas between cells can explain the heterogeneous spread of virus in leaf tissue, and therewith the observed infection patterns in plants.
we study how single- and double-stranded cleavage by dicer and amplification by rna-dependent rna polymerase can affect the patterns formed.
chlorotic and healthy tissue co-occur on a single leaf and form patterns.
here we elucidate the mechanisms leading to infection patterns and the conditions which lead to the various patterns observed.
