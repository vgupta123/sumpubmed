no significant differences were observed between sdsnps at ae dinucleotides and those at constitutive exons  in snp properties including average heterozygosity, snp density, ratio of predicted alleles consistent with the gt-ag rule, and scores of splice sites formed with the predicted allele.
sdsnps are found at ce dinucleotides in addition to those at ae dinucleotides, suggesting two possibilities.
second, similar to sdsnps at ae dinucleotides, those at ce dinucleotides cause differences in as patterns because of the arbitrariness in the classification of exons into alternative and constitutive type that varies according to the dataset.
however, a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  occur at splice dinucleotides.
an intriguing question relating to the evolution of as diversity is whether mutations at splice dinucleotides are maintained as polymorphisms and produce diversity in splice patterns within the human population.
we therefore surveyed validated snps in the database dbsnp located at splice dinucleotides of all human genes that are defined by the h-invitational database.
we found  <dig> validated snps at splice dinucleotides ; these were confirmed to be consistent with the gt-ag rule at either allele.
first, sdsnps at ce dinucleotides may be robust against sdsnps because of unknown mechanisms.
taking into account the absence of differences in sdsnp properties between those at ae and ce dinucleotides, the increased proportion of non-conserved exons found in exons flanked by sdsnps suggests the hypothesis that sdsnps are maintained at the splice dinucleotides of newly generated exons at which negative selection pressure is relaxed.
generally, functional redundancy leads to the generation of new functions through relaxation of selective pressure in evolution, as exemplified by duplicated genes.
it is also known that alternatively spliced exons  are subject to relaxed selective pressure.
