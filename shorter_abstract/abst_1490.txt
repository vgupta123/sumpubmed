these findings provide new insight into the binding partners of hssb <dig> and will likely function as a platform for future research.
by contrast, a large number of proteins were identified with roles in mrna metabolism, reflecting a currently emerging area of hssb <dig> study.

human single-stranded dna-binding protein  <dig>  is one such protein, with described roles in genome stability maintenance and transcriptional regulation.
in this work, hssb <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate samples that had been enriched for non-soluble nuclear proteins and those associating with hssb <dig> identified by mass spectrometry.
unexpectedly, whilst hssb <dig> has largely been studied in a genome stability context, few other dna repair or replication proteins were detected.
in addition, numerous proteins were detected that comprise various chromatin-remodelling complexes.
