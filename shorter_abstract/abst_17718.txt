heart rate  , systolic blood pressure  , and respiratory rate   were significantly lower in the fmm group.
differences in physiological parameters and quality of sedation were compared using area under the curve  method and either mann-witney or t-student tests.
although some depression of physiological parameters was seen with fmm, the variables all remained within the normal ranges in both groups.
onset of a sufficient degree of sedation for safe handling was more rapid with ketamine , but fmm recovery was faster  and of better quality  most probably because of the effectiveness of the reversal agents used.
oxygen  was provided by mask and heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etco <dig> and depth of sedation were assessed every 5 min for 20 min.
fmm provides an easily reversible immobilization with a rapid and good recovery quality and may prove a useful alternative to ketamine.
rhesus macaques ,  received either ketamine   or fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine   both im.
after the last time point, fmm monkeys were reversed with atipamezole-naloxone .
