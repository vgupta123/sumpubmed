amplification of the mycn oncogene is a well established poor prognostic factor found in up to 40% of high risk neuroblastomas.
these cells are further characterized by increased expression of the neuronal differentiation markers nfl and gap <dig>  in addition, we show that induced expression of retrovirally delivered anti-mycn shrna inhibits cell proliferation by increasing the fraction of mna neuroblastoma cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and that the clonogenic growth potential of these cells was also dramatically reduced.
we have developed an efficient mycn-knockdown in vitro model system to study neuronal differentiation in mna neuroblastomas.
several protocols, including exposure to various agents and growth factors, will differentiate neuroblastoma cell lines into neuron-like cells.
by addition of the inducer doxycycline, we show that the kelly and sk-n-be neuroblastoma cell lines efficiently differentiate into neuron-like cells with an extensive network of neurites.
using neuroblastoma cell lines to study neuronal differentiation in vitro is now well established.
in this study we use retrovirally delivered inducible short-hairpin rna  modules to knock down mycn expression in mycn-amplified  neuroblastoma cell lines.
neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer derived from immature cells of the sympathetic nervous system.
