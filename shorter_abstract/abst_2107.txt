these data indicate that zn72d and bel work together to control mle splicing and protein levels.
mle protein was restored to 70% of wild-type levels, although the level of productively spliced mle transcript was still four-fold lower than in wild-type cells.
simultaneous knockdown of zn72d and bel restored msl complex localization to the x chromosome and dosage compensation.
in the absence of zn72d, mle levels are decreased, and as a result, the msl complex no longer localizes to the x chromosome and dosage compensation is disrupted.
the increase in production of mle protein relative to the amount of correctly spliced mle mrna could not be attributed to an alteration in mle stability.
the male specific lethal  complex is enriched on the single x chromosome in male drosophila cells and functions to upregulate x-linked gene expression and equalize x-linked gene dosage with xx females.
thus zn72d and bel may be factors that coordinate splicing and translational regulation.
