these approaches have included improved algorithms for rnai reagent design, incorporation of chemical modifications into sirnas, and the use of various bioinformatics strategies to identify possible otes in screen results.
with the tool, users can either use a built-in database or provide a database of transcripts for analysis.
here, we introduce a user-friendly web application that provides researchers a relatively quick and easy way to perform gess analysis on data from human or mouse cell-based screens using short interfering rnas  or short hairpin rnas , as well as for drosophila screens using shrnas.
significant efforts have been made to eliminate false positive results attributable to sequence-specific otes associated with rnai.
genome-wide enrichment of seed sequence matches  was developed to identify potential off-targeted transcripts in large-scale screen data by seed-region analysis.
for large-scale screens, rnai is used to systematically down-regulate genes of interest and analyze their roles in a biological process.
this makes it possible to analyze rnai data from any organism for which the user can provide transcript sequences.
online gess relies on up-to-date transcript sequence annotations for human and mouse genes extracted from ncbi reference sequence  and drosophila genes from flybase.
online gess provides a straightforward user interface for genome-wide seed region analysis for human, mouse and drosophila rnai screen data.
rna interference  is an effective and important tool used to study gene function.
in addition, the post-screen validation process is time and labor intensive.
