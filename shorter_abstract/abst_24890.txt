simple sequence repeats  are effective and economical tools for mapping traits and genetic improvement.
the integrated consensus map contains  <dig> unique ssr sites, improving the density from  <dig>  cm in the previous map to  <dig>  cm.
with the newly constructed map, we mapped single-gene traits, the qtl of filaments, and a number of ribosomal protein genes.
the purpose of this work was to develop a dense and informative linkage map that would assist in the preliminary mapping and dissection of quantitative trait loci  in a variety of silkworm strains.
