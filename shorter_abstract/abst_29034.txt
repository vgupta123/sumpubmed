in particular, gene loss and gene silencing are commonly observed post-polyploidization.
this species, which also exhibits extensive gene loss, was formed from the diploids t. dubius and t. pratensis.
one other locus  examined did not show methylation, indicating that other transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are likely responsible for silencing that homeologous locus.
comparative bisulfite sequencing revealed cg methylation of parental homeologs for three loci  that were previously identified as silenced in t. miscellus individuals relative to the diploid progenitors.
these results indicate that tragopogon miscellus allopolyploids employ diverse mechanisms, including dna methylation, to respond to the potential shock of genome merger and doubling.
here, we investigated dna methylation as a potential mechanism for gene silencing in tragopogon miscellus , a recent and recurrently formed allopolyploid.

hybridization coupled with whole-genome duplication  leads to a variety of genetic and epigenetic modifications in the resultant merged genomes.
