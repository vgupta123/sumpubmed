a subgroup of as permeable channels that group together in a phylogenetic tree required n-terminal truncation for functional expression in yeast.
expression of these nips sensitized yeast cells to as and antimonite ), and direct transport assays confirmed their ability to facilitate as transport across cell membranes.
here we show that the nodulin26-like intrinsic proteins  atnip5; <dig> and atnip6; <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana, osnip2; <dig> and osnip3; <dig> from oryza sativa, and ljnip5; <dig> and ljnip6; <dig> from lotus japonicus are bi-directional as channels.
on medium containing as, expression of the same nips improved yeast growth, probably due to increased as efflux.
this is the first molecular identification of plant as transport systems and we propose that metalloid transport through nips is a conserved and ancient feature.
arsenic is a toxic and highly abundant metalloid that endangers human health through drinking water and the food chain.
inside cells, as becomes reduced to as for subsequent extrusion or compartmentation.
as is a non-functional phosphate analog that enters the food chain via plant phosphate transporters.
