knowing which chemotherapy protocol yields the highest rate of complete remission and longest survival times would help veterinarians and pet owners select treatment options based on the best evidence available.
our objective was to review the literature to compare the complete remission rates and survival times of ccnu-based protocols to those of other interventions.
the search for, and review and analysis of, the best evidence available as of february  <dig>   <dig>  suggests that ccnu and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin appear to yield the highest rate of complete remission in approximately one-third of dogs with ctcl.
ccnu leads to a complete remission of signs in approximately one-third of dogs with ctcl, but such remissions are of short duration.
with ccnu protocols, the median survival time was 6 months and the one with retinoids , peg l-asparaginase or prednisolone monotherapy was  <dig>   <dig> and 4 months, respectively; all these durations were obtained from small numbers of dogs, however.
further studies are required to investigate the effect of ccnu, alone or in combination, on remission rates, survival times and impact on quality of life.
at this time, even though ccnu is most often recommended to treat dogs with ctcl, there is no clear consensus on the benefit of this drug.
chemotherapy protocols provide variable benefits; they have different side-effects, and they typically require monitoring to detect drug toxicity at a non-negligible cost to the owner.
without any treatment, the mean/median survival time in dogs with ctcl varied between  <dig> and 5 months.
the median survival time after ccnu appears longer than that without treatment, but other drugs appear to provide a better long-term prognosis.
