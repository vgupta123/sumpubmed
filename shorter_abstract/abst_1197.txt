fungi have developed defense mechanisms against te invasion such as rip , mip  and quelling .
we annotated te sequences from  <dig> fungal genomes with different te content .
we identified fungal genomes containing large numbers of tes with many c to t mutations associated with species-specific dinucleotide signatures.
we then used these te sequences to carry out a genome-wide analysis of c to t mutations biases.
transposable elements  are key components that shape the organization and evolution of genomes.

we identified several dinucleotide signatures at these c to t mutation sites .
phylogenomic analysis of fungal dnmt <dig> mtases revealed a previously unreported association between these dinucleotide signatures and the presence/absence of sub-classes of dnmt <dig>
our analysis revealed that dinucleotide signatures are associated with the presence/absence of specific dnmt <dig> subfamilies.
in particular, an rid1-dependent rip mechanism was found only in ascomycota.
genomes from either ascomycota or basidiomycota that were massively invaded by tes  were characterized by a low frequency of c to t mutation bias , whereas other genomes displayed intermediate to high frequencies .
