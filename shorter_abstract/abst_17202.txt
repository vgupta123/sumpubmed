we describe significant differences in gene expression between muscle fibre types for fundamental components of general metabolism, the pi3k/akt/mtor network and myogenesis, including detailed analysis of paralogue expression.
we also provide a comprehensive description of usp family member expression between muscle fibre types and with changing nutritional status.
the primary objectives of the present study were 1) to increase the genetic resources available for the species, 2) to exploit the anatomical separation of myotomal fibres types to compare the transcriptomes of slow and fast muscle phenotypes and 3) to systematically investigate the expression of ubiquitin specific protease  family members in fast and slow muscle in response to fasting and refeeding.
we have generated a 53-fold coverage transcriptome for fast and slow myotomal muscle in the pacu  significantly increasing the genetic resources available for this important aquaculture species.
usp genes in fast muscle showed a similar transient increase in expression with fasting as the better characterized e <dig> ubiquitin ligases.
the pacu  is a member of the characiform family native to the prata basin  and a target for the aquaculture industry.
we successfully annotated nearly 47% of the transcriptome and identified around  <dig>  unique genes and over  <dig> complete coding sequences.
we generated  <dig>  tb of pair-end reads from slow and fast skeletal muscle libraries.
<dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between slow and fast skeletal muscle, respectively.
over  <dig> million reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bp and n50 =  <dig>  bp.
