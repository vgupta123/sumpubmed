recently, the pasbio project proposed a set of propositions and argument structures for biomedical verbs.
pasbio demonstrates the suitability of predicate-argument structures for representing aspects of the semantics of biomedical verbs.
metrics related to theta-criterion violations and to the distribution of arguments are able to detect flaws in semantic representations, given a set of predicate-argument structures and a relatively small corpus annotated with them.
propositional representations of biomedical knowledge are a critical component of most aspects of semantic mining in biomedicine.
this initial set of representations presents an opportunity for evaluating the suitability of predicate-argument structures as a scheme for representing verbal semantics in the biomedical domain.
