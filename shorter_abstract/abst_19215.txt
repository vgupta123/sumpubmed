these results may contribute to better elucidating the causes of poor developmental outcomes in human preterm infants.
insulin tolerance test and glucose tolerance test.
there is increasing evidence that poor growth of preterm infants is a risk factor for poor long-term development, while the effects of early postnatal growth restriction are not well known.
all r groups showed poorer scores in developmental testing when compared with the n- <dig> group during t-maze test .
although r- <dig> were more insulin sensitive than r- <dig> and r- <dig>  all r groups were more glucose tolerant than n- <dig>
rat pups were separated at birth into normal  or restricted intake  litters.
insulin sensitivity was measured by i.p.
in rats, differences in postnatal growth restriction leads to changes in development and in insulin sensitivity.

by d <dig>  the r- <dig> group caught up to the n- <dig> group in weight, the r- <dig> group showed partial catch-up growth and the r- <dig> group showed no catch-up growth.
n pups remained in litters of  <dig> pups/dam .
by d <dig>  n pups weighed 20 % more than r pups .
