we investigate the empirical complexity of the rna secondary structure design problem, that is, the scaling of the typical difficulty of the design task for various classes of rna structures as the size of the target structure is increased.
furthermore, we prove that, according to the standard thermodynamic model, for some structures that the rna-ssd algorithm was unable to design, there exists no sequence whose minimum free energy structure is the target structure.
to gain insights into the practical complexity of the problem, we present a scaling analysis on random and biologically motivated structures using an improved version of the rna-ssd algorithm, and also the rnainverse algorithm from the vienna package.
since primary structure constraints are relevant for designing rna structures, we also investigate the correlation between the number and the location of the primary structure constraints when designing structures and the performance of the rna-ssd algorithm.
the purpose of this work is to understand better the factors that make rna structures hard to design for existing, high-performance algorithms.
our analysis helps to better understand the strengths and limitations of both the rna-ssd and rnainverse algorithms, and suggests ways in which the performance of these algorithms can be further improved.
such understanding provides the basis for improving the performance of one of the best algorithms for this problem, rna-ssd, and for characterising its limitations.
