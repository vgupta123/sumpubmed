analyses of sequence variants of two distinct and highly inbred chicken lines allowed characterization of genomic variation that may be associated with phenotypic differences between breeds.
variant analysis elucidated go functions indicative of breed-predominant phenotypes related to genomic variation in the lines, showing a possible link between the genetic variants and breed traits.
st values for both breeds were used to identify enriched gene ontology terms.
unique within- and between-line genetic diversity was used to define the genetic differences of the two breeds through the use of variant discovery and functional annotation.
over-enriched go annotations were uncovered for functions indicative of breed-related traits of pathogen resistance and reproductive ability for fayoumi and leghorn, respectively.
