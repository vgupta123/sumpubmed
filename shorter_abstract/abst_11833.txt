however, our results do not support the view that acute sleep deprivation has lasting effects on the human antibody titer response to influenza vaccination.
these findings concur with the notion that sleep is a supportive influence in the very early stage of an adaptive immune response to a viral antigen.
in comparison to the sleep group, sleep-deprived males but not females had reduced serum concentration of h1n1-specific antibodies five days after vaccination, whereas antibody titers at later time points did not differ between the conditions.
experimental studies in humans have yielded evidence that adaptive immune function, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, is distinctly impaired when sleep is deprived at the time of first antigen exposure.
