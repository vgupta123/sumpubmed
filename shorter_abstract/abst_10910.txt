a filtering procedure was applied to select a non-redundant dataset of complexes.
data mining was performed to obtain information on the frequencies of different types of atomic contacts.
recently, several databases have been released for further understanding of protein-ligand interactions, having the protein data bank as backend support.
the database was enriched in molecular properties.
docking simulations were run with the program dock.
as an example to demonstrate the value of the new database, we derived a new set of chemical matching rules to be used in the context of the program dock, based on contact frequencies between ligand atoms and points representing the protein surface, and proved their enhanced efficiency with respect to the default set of rules included in that program.
using a new definition of molecular contact, small ligands contained in the  <dig> pdb edition were identified and processed.
we compiled a large database of small ligand-protein complexes, enriched with different calculated properties, that currently contains more than  <dig> non-redundant structures.
the number of test cases used to validate these methods is usually small and problem dependent.
in this paper we report the development of a new database of protein-ligand complexes tailored for testing of docking algorithms.
the new database constitutes a valuable resource for the development of knowledge-based docking algorithms and for testing docking programs on large sets of protein-ligand complexes.
in particular, an automated typing of ligand atoms was performed.
