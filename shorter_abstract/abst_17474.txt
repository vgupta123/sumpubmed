using the example of the tumor cell invasion inhibitor dihydromotuporamine c, we show that a more complete picture of drug action can be obtained by combining different chemical genomics approaches – analysis of the sensitivity of ρ <dig> cells lacking mitochondrial dna, drug-induced haploinsufficiency, suppression of drug sensitivity by gene overexpression and chemical-genetic synthetic lethality screening using strains deleted of nonessential genes.
however, we find that it does not require genes associated with programmed cell death in yeast.
single genome-wide screens for the effect of altered gene dosage on drug sensitivity in the model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae provide only a partial picture of the mechanism of action of a drug.
despite their similar conceptual basis, namely altering drug sensitivity by modifying gene dosage, each of the screening approaches provided a distinct set of information that, when integrated, revealed a more complete picture of the mechanism of action of a drug on cells.
the chemical also inhibits endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking and interferes with vacuolar acidification in yeast and in human cancer cells.
