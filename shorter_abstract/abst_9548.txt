we have created an accurate predictor of glycosylation sites and used this to extract comprehensible rules about the glycosylation process.
our prediction program, gpp , predicts glycosylation sites with an accuracy of  <dig> % for ser sites,  <dig> % for thr sites and  <dig> % for asn sites.
we use the random forest algorithm and pairwise patterns to predict glycosylation sites.
we identify pairwise patterns surrounding glycosylation sites and use an odds ratio to weight their propensity of association with modified residues.
we use the trepan algorithm to extract a set of comprehensible rules from gpp, which provide biological insight into all three major glycosylation types.
