we then explored the length of haplotypes in chromosomes to confirm recent positive selection.
our results suggest that genetic variation in dhcr <dig> is the major adaptation affecting vitamin d metabolism in recent evolutionary history which helped early humans to avoid severe vitamin d deficiency and enabled them to inhabit areas further from the equator.
we used the fixation index  to measure differences in allele frequencies in  <dig> individuals from ten populations to identify the presence of evolutionary selection in genes in the vitamin d pathway.

we show that extended haplotypes related to vitamin d status are highly prevalent at northern latitudes .
recent investigations have identified candidate genes which are strongly linked to concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin d. since there is insufficient uvb radiation to induce year-round cutaneous synthesis of vitamin d at latitudes distant from the equator it is likely that these genes were subject to forces of natural selection.
vitamin d is essential for a wide range of physiological processes including immune function and calcium homeostasis.
we find evidence of positive selection for dhcr <dig>  which governs availability of 7-dehydrocholesterol for conversion to vitamin d <dig> by the action of sunlight on the skin.
in contrast, cyp2r <dig>  which 25-hydroxylates vitamin d, is under balancing selection and we found no evidence of recent selection pressure on gc, which is responsible for vitamin d transport.
the common dhcr <dig> haplotype underwent a recent selective sweep in northeast asia, with relative extended haplotype homozygosity of  <dig>  .
