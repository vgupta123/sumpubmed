the quantitative nature of qis-seq data make it amenable to statistical evaluation, and importantly, facilitates the standardization of experimental design, data collection, and data analysis.
a commonly used method for identifying protein interactions is the yeast two-hybrid system.
the qis-seq approach is scalable and can be used with any yeast two-hybrid screen and with any next-generation sequencing platform.
here we describe the application of next-generation sequencing to yeast two-hybrid interaction screens and develop quantitative interactor screen sequencing .
we demonstrate that qis-seq is a high-throughput quantitative interactor screen and validate mlo <dig> as an interactor and novel virulence target of the p. syringae type iii secreted effector hopz <dig>
qis-seq provides a quantitative measurement of enrichment for each interactor relative to its frequency in the library as well as its general stickiness .
