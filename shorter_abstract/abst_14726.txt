genes up-regulated by a high-fat diet were involved in biological processes such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; protein and amino acid metabolic processes were down regulated on a high-fat diet.
identifying the genetic factors regulating these processes could lead to a greater understanding of how liver function responds to a high-fat diet and how that response may influence susceptibilities to obesity and metabolic syndrome.
in this study we examine differences in hepatic gene expression between the lg/j and sm/j inbred mouse strains and how gene expression in these strains is affected by high-fat diet.
lg/j and sm/j are known to differ in their responses to a high-fat diet for a variety of obesity- and diabetes-related traits, with the sm/j strain exhibiting a stronger phenotypic response to diet.
for most of these genes, sm/j had a stronger response to the high-fat diet than lg/j.
this supports previous data showing that sm/j has a stronger phenotypic response to high-fat diet.
these genes tended to be associated with immune function.
in addition, genes involved in biochemical processes related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  manifested different responses to diet between the two strains.
dietary intake had a significant effect on gene expression in both inbred lines.
these data show that dietary fat impacts gene expression levels in sm/j relative to lg/j, with sm/j exhibiting a stronger response.

based upon these findings, we suggest that sm/j and its cross with the lg/j strain provide a good model for examining non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its role in metabolic syndrome.
