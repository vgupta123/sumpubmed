in chickens, three mutant alleles have been reported at the c locus, including the albino mutation, and the recessive white mutation, which is characterized by white plumage and pigmented eyes.
the albino mutation was found to be a  <dig> bp deletion in the tyrosinase  gene.
a major size difference of  <dig>  kb was found in intron  <dig> of the tyr gene by long-range pcr.
it shows that all homozygous carriers of this insertion had a white plumage in various chicken strains.
molecular analysis of the chicken tyr gene has revealed a major structural difference  in the genomic dna of the recessive white chicken.
several aberrant transcripts of the tyrosinase gene were found in  <dig> week old recessive white chickens but not in the homozygous wild type colored chicken.
we established a rapid genotyping diagnostic test based on the discovery of this retroviral insertion.
molecular cloning and sequencing results showed the insertion of a complete avian retroviral sequence of the avian leukosis virus  family.
in this study, we conclude that the insertion of a complete avian retroviral sequence in intron  <dig> of the tyrosinase gene is diagnostic of the recessive white mutation in chickens.
this insertion causes aberrant transcripts lacking exon  <dig>  and we propose that this insertion is the causal mutation for the recessive white allele in the chicken.
the present work describes an approach to identify the structural rearrangement in the tyr gene associated with the recessive white mutation.
