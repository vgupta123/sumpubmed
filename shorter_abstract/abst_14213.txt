based on high-throughput scans used to identify putative rna editing sites, adar appears to catalyze a substantial number of adenosine to inosine transitions within repetitive regions of the primate transcriptome, thereby dramatically enhancing genetic variation beyond what is encoded in the genome.
when we consider only mismatches within repetitive regions of the genome, the a-to-g percentage increases to 94%, with the majority of these located within the swine specific sine retrotransposon pre- <dig>  we also observe evidence of a-to-g editing within coding regions that were previously verified in primates.
rna editing by adar  proteins is a form of transcriptional regulation that is widespread among humans and other primates.
