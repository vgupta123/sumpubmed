we found that a small ratio of human genes including the argonaute -like gene family encode mrnas containing highly gc-rich non-hairpin duplex elements  of equal to or more than  <dig> base pairs in length and we provide experimental evidence for their biological significance.
double helices with consecutive watson-crick base-pairing may also be formed between distant rna segments thereby facilitating long-range interactions of long-chain rna that may be biologically functional.
this view is supported experimentally by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression of a fusion transcript containing 5â€²-sequences of human mrnaago <dig> harbouring gc-helices and down-stream coding sequences of renilla luciferase.
perfectly formed duplex elements in rna occur within folding units, often as a part of hairpin motifs which can be reliably predicted by various rna folding algorithms.
we generated a python-based software tool that identifies consecutive rna duplex elements at any given length and nucleotide content formed by distant sequences.
the software tool, dubbed rnaslider, is built on the theoretical rna structure prediction algorithm mfold.
