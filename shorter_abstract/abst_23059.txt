set ii includes the secondary  structures from rnase p and rnase mrp.
we present here a new method for the similarity analysis of rna secondary structures.
set iii includes the structures from 16s rrnas.
owing to the rapid expansion of rna structure databases in recent years, efficient methods for structure comparison are in demand for function prediction and evolutionary analysis.
this method will also be useful to researchers who are interested in evolutionary analysis.
three sets of real data have been used as input for the example applications.
usually, the similarity of rna secondary structures is evaluated based on tree models and dynamic programming algorithms.
the famous lempel-ziv algorithm can efficiently extract the information on repeated patterns encoded in rna secondary structures and makes our method an alternative to analyze the similarity of rna secondary structures.
set i includes the  structures from 5s rrnas.
