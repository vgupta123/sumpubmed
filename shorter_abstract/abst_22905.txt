these strains were identified morphologically and by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer  regions and the partial β-tubulin gene .
there is an imperative necessity for alternative sources of energy able to reduce the world dependence of fossil oil.
dr <dig>  annulohypoxylon stigyum dr <dig> and talaromyces wortmannii dr <dig> are excellent producers of hydrolytic enzymes to be used as part of blends to decompose sugarcane biomass at industrial level.
dr <dig>  annulohypoxylon stigyum dr <dig> and talaromyces wortmannii dr <dig>  these strains produced glycohydrolases with different profiles, and production was highly influenced by the carbon sources in the media.
two initial selections were performed, one employing the esculin gel diffusion assay, and the other by culturing on agar plate media with beechwood xylan and liquor from the hydrothermal pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse.
a total of  <dig> isolates were then grown at 29°c on steam-exploded delignified sugar cane bagasse  plus soybean bran  , with measurement of the xylanase, pectinase, β-glucosidase, cmcase, and fpase activities.
twelve strains were selected, and their enzyme extracts were assessed using different substrates.
