therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and genotype-phenotype correlation of hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in huashan hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in shanghai.
to control the spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  in hospitals, infection control measures such as hand hygiene practices were introduced into the teaching hospitals in shanghai, china, in  <dig>  currently, there is limited information characterizing the latest hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in this area.
there is still a high prevalence of mrsa infections in the teaching hospital in shanghai.
st <dig> was mainly recovered from respiratory specimens and sterile body fluids, st <dig> was associated with respiratory specimens and blood, and st <dig> was most prevalent in urine samples.
among  <dig> hospital-acquired s. aureus clinical isolates obtained from january to december of  <dig> in huashan hospital,  <dig> % were mrsa.
the high proportion of multiple antibiotic and chlorhexidine-based antiseptic-resistant clones in this hospital underscores the need for more effective infection control measures to help curtail dissemination of mrsa to hospitalized patients.
there were also differences in the major infection types caused by mrsa and mssa, and hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in the icu of huashan hospital pose a greater threat to patient safety than in other wards.
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed diversity within the same epidemic s. aureus clones originating from the same wards.
in huashan hospital, the infection rate in the intensive care unit  was  <dig>  per  <dig> hospitalized days, but only  <dig>  per  <dig> hospitalized days in the other wards.
each ward harbored its own dominant sts.
in this study,  <dig> dispersed sequence types  of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  were identified, most of which caused skin/soft tissue infection and bacteremia.
mupa was more frequently identified in st <dig> and st <dig>  and qaca/b was more prevalent in st <dig> and st <dig>  most of the pvl-positive isolates were mssa, whereas the majority of mupa- and qaca/b-positive isolates were mrsa.
