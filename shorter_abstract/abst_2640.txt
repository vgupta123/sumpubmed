the presence of snbps of the histone type  in some organisms  raises uncertainty about the need for a nucleoplasmin-mediated removal process in such cases and poses a very interesting question regarding the appearance and further differentiation of the sperm chromatin remodeling function of nucleoplasmin and the implicit relationship with snbp diversity the amphibians represent an unique opportunity to address this issue as they contain genera with snbps representative of each of the three main types: rana ; xenopus  and bufo .
phylogenetic analysis of nucleoplasmin family members from various metazoans suggests that amphibian nucleoplasmins group closely with mammalian npm <dig> proteins.
nucleoplasmin is a nuclear chaperone protein that has been shown to participate in the remodeling of sperm chromatin immediately after fertilization by displacing highly specialized sperm nuclear basic proteins , such as protamine  and protamine-like  proteins, from the sperm chromatin and by the transfer of histone h2a-h2b.
this result has important implications as it suggests that nucleoplasmin's role in chromatin assembly during early zygote development could have been complemented by the acquisition of a new function of non-specifically removing snbps in sperm chromatin remodeling.
