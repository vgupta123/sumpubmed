six polymorphisms distributed through the seps <dig> gene  were genotyped in more than two thousand patients suffering from type  <dig> diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel diseases and  <dig> healthy controls included in the case-control study.
we aimed at investigating the role of the seps <dig> variants previously associated with higher plasma levels of these cytokines and of the seps <dig> haplotypes in the susceptibility to develop immune-mediated diseases characterized by an inflammatory component.
selenoprotein s  protects the functional integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum against the deleterious effects of metabolic stress.
