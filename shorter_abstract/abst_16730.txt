this might reflect lower rates of dna damage or enhanced dna repair processes in regions of open chromatin.
exclusion of known exonic splice enhancer hexamers has little affect on the divergence observed at fourfold degenerate sites across chromatin categories; however, we show that closed chromatin is enriched with certain classes of ncrna genes whose rna secondary structure may be particularly important.
analysis of human-chimpanzee divergence across intron-exon boundaries indicates that although genes in relatively open chromatin generally display little selection at their synonymous sites, those in closed regions show markedly lower divergence at their fourfold degenerate sites than in neighbouring introns and intergenic regions.
our results also indicate that ds is a poor measure of mutation rates, particularly when used in closed regions of the genome, as genes in closed regions generally display relatively strong levels of selection at their synonymous sites.
using the results of a recent genome-wide analysis of open and closed human chromatin structures we have investigated the global association between divergence, selection and chromatin structure for the first time.
we conclude that, overall, non-cpg mutation rates are lowest in open regions of the genome and that regions of the genome with a closed chromatin structure have the highest background mutation rate.
evolutionary rates are not constant across the human genome but genes in close proximity have been shown to experience similar levels of divergence and selection.
in this study we have shown that, paradoxically, synonymous site divergence  at non-cpg sites is highest in regions of open chromatin, primarily as a result of an increased number of transitions, while the rates of other traditional measures of mutation  are highest in closed regions of the genome.
