these interaction rules are integrated into a factor graph model.
the resulting network can also be embedded in a factor graph model.
even if gene-gene interactions only partially describe real networks because of post-transcriptional modifications and protein regulation, using microarray technology it is possible to combine measurements for thousands of genes into a single analysis step that provides a picture of the cell's gene expression.
here we propose an algorithm, called inference of regulatory interaction schema , that uses an iterative approach to map gene expression profile values  into discrete states and a simple probabilistic method to infer the regulatory functions of the network.
we also apply iris to gene expression microarray data for the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle and for human b-cells and compare the results to literature findings.
a topological description of the network and a matrix of gene expression profiles are required as input to the algorithm.
however, network topology alone is not enough to perform simulations and predictions of how a molecular system will respond to perturbations.
iris maps gene expression data onto discrete values and then computes regulatory functions as conditional probability tables.
another interesting question is how to integrate information carried by the network topology, which can be derived from the literature, with large-scale experimental data.
several databases provide information about known molecular interactions and various methods have been developed to infer gene networks from expression data.
iris is a rapid and efficient tool for the inference of regulatory relations in gene networks.
we test iris on two synthetic networks to determine its accuracy and compare it to other methods.
rules for interactions among the single parts are needed for a complete definition of the network behaviour.
