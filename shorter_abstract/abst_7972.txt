as these methods continue to mature we will better understand the ecology of the major populations of bacteria the lower intestinal tract.
there is still a scarcity of information on the microbial diversity in the gut of livestock species such as cattle.
foodborne pathogenic bacteria were detected in several of the cattle, a total of  <dig> cows were found to be positive for salmonella spp  and  <dig> cows were positive for campylobacter spp.
this in turn will allow for a better understanding of ways in which the intestinal microbiome contributes to animal health, productivity and wellbeing.
the microbiota of an animal's intestinal tract plays important roles in the animal's overall health, productivity and well-being.
