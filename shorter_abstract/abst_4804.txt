so far only one draft genome  and one transcriptome assembly  have been published.
here, we present a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly for the blue-tailed damselfly ischnura elegans  built from short-read rna-seq data.
cegma software identified  <dig> out of  <dig> ultra-conserved core proteins as ‘complete’ in the transcriptome assembly, yielding a completeness of  <dig> %.

the transcriptomic resource can provide a foundation for future investigations into this diverse group, including the evolution of colour, vision, olfaction and thermal adaptation.
we also identified transcripts involved in temperature sensitivity, thermoregulation and olfaction.
there is growing interest in odonates  as model organisms in ecology and evolutionary biology but the development of genomic resources has been slow.
blastx and interproscan annotated 55% of the assembled transcripts and showed that the three tissue types differed both qualitatively and quantitatively in i. elegans.
odonates have some of the most advanced visual systems among insects and several species are colour polymorphic, and genomic and transcriptomic data would allow studying the genomic architecture of these interesting traits and make detailed comparative studies between related species possible.
a transcriptome was produced after filtering and quality checking yielding a final set of  <dig>  high quality transcripts for analysis.
targeted analyses of vision and colour functional pathways identified the presence of four different opsin types and three pigmentation pathways.
differential expression identified  <dig>  transcripts to be differentially expressed in head, thorax and abdomen.
