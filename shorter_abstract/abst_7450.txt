by employing site directed mutagenesis we provide evidence that single amino acid residues in the active site are also determining the catalytic activity of a 9-/13-aos â€“ a finding that previously has only been reported for substrate specific 13-aos.
this reaction is catalyzed by allene oxide synthase  belonging as hydroperoxide lyase  to the cytochrome p <dig> family cyp <dig>  in this study we characterized two aos from p. patens, ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig>
our results show that ppaos <dig> is highly active with both c <dig> and c20-hydroperoxy-fatty acid substrates, whereas ppaos <dig> is fully active only with c20-substrates, exhibiting trace activity  with c <dig> substrates.
analysis of the wound-induced cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid accumulation in ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> single knock-out mutants showed that disruption of ppaos <dig>  in contrast to ppaos <dig>  results in a significantly decreased cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid formation.
our study highlights five findings regarding the oxylipin metabolism in p. patens:  both aos isoforms are capable of metabolizing c18- and c20-derived substrates with different specificities suggesting that both enzymes might have different functions.
in contrast to ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid where oxylipin metabolism takes place.
site directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the catalytic trajectories of 9-/13-ppaos <dig> and pphpl are closely inter-connected and ppaos <dig> can be inter-converted by a single amino acid exchange into a hpl.
however, the knock-out mutants of neither ppaos <dig> nor ppaos <dig> showed reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology or interrupted sporogenesis.
knock-out mutants of neither aos showed a deviating morphological phenotype suggesting that there are overlapping functions with other cyp <dig> enzymes.
the moss physcomitrella patens contains c18- as well as c20-polyunsaturated fatty acids that can be metabolized by different enzymes to form oxylipins such as the cyclopentenone cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid.
mutants defective in the biosynthesis of cyclopentenones showed reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology and interrupted sporogenesis.
the initial step in this biosynthetic route is the conversion of a fatty acid hydroperoxide to an allene oxide.
