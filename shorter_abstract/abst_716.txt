v-bay provides a novel solution to the computational scaling constraints of most multiple locus methods and can complete a simultaneous analysis of a million genetic markers in a few hours, when using a desktop.
here, we describe the algorithm v-bay, a variational bayes algorithm for multiple locus gwa analysis, which is designed to identify weaker associations that may contribute to this missing heritability.
the success achieved by genome-wide association  studies in the identification of candidate loci for complex diseases has been accompanied by an inability to explain the bulk of heritability.
v-bay is a versatile, fast, and accurate multiple locus gwa analysis tool for the practitioner interested in identifying weaker associations without high false positive rates.
v-bay can also outperform a multiple locus analysis method based on the lasso, which has similar scaling properties for large numbers of genetic markers.
