the interaction of inla with the host cell ligand e-cadherin efficiently stimulates l. monocytogenes entry into human enterocytes, but has only a limited interaction with murine cells.
the strain was created using a procedure that minimizes the likelihood of secondary mutations and incorporates listeria-optimized codons encoding the altered amino acids.
competitive index experiments were conducted in mice using selected mutations introduced into l. monocytogenes egd-e background.
this murinized l. monocytogenes strain will provide a useful tool for the analysis of the gastrointestinal phase of listeriosis.
after sequential passage through a murine cell line , multiple clones with enhanced invasion characteristics were identified.
internalin a  is a critical virulence factor which mediates the initiation of listeria monocytogenes infection by the oral route in permissive hosts.
a novel single amino acid change was identified which enhanced virulence by the oral route in the murine model and will form the basis of further engineering approaches.
l. monocytogenes egd-e inlam* yielded consistently higher level murine infections by the oral route when compared to egd-e, but did not display the two-fold increased invasion into a human cell line that was previously described for the egd-inlam strain.
during the course of the study we engineered a murinized strain of l. monocytogenes egd-e which shows reproducibly higher infectivity in the intragastric murine infection model than the wild type, but does not display enhanced entry into human cells as previously observed.
as a control a previously described egd-inlam murinized strain was also re-created as part of this study with minor modifications and designated egd-e inlam*.
