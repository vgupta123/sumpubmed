single drugs adopt multiple bioactive conformations if they interact with different target proteins.
due to the structural diversity of binding sites they adopt conformations that are distributed over a broad conformational space and wide energy range.
this fraction rises to about 90% for smaller or average sized drugs.
the generation of  <dig> drug conformers using an atomic force field was carried out to obtain an optimal coverage of the conformational space.
bioactive conformations are best described by a conformational ensemble: half of all drugs exhibit multiple active states, distributed over the entire range of the reachable energy and conformational space.
since the majority of drugs is well represented by a predefined low number of conformers  this procedure is a valuable method to compare compounds by three-dimensional features or for fast similarity searches starting with pharmacophores.
the underlying  <dig> generated drug conformers are downloadable from the super drug web site  <cit> .
