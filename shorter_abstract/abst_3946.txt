algagem predicts increased hydrogen production when cyclic electron flow is disrupted as seen in a high producing mutant derived from mutational studies.
the model also predicted the physiological pathway for h <dig> production and identified new targets to further improve h <dig> yield.
flux balance analysis can be used to identify bottlenecks and new targets to metabolically engineer microalgae for production of biofuels.
using efficient resource utilisation as the optimality criterion, algagem predicted observed metabolic effects under autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions.

algagem is a comprehensive literature-based genome scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for the functions of  <dig> unique orfs,  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> gene-enzyme-reaction-association entries, and  <dig> unique reactions.
in order to realise the rates and titres necessary for commercial production, however, system-level metabolic engineering will be required.
algagem is a viable and comprehensive framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive new, non-trivial hypotheses for exploring this metabolically versatile organism.
while genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been developed for many prokaryotes and model eukaryotes, the application to less well characterized eukaryotes such as algae is challenging not at least due to a lack of compartmentalization data.
the reconstruction was compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid and microbody using available data for algae complemented with compartmentalisation data for arabidopsis thaliana.
genome scale metabolic reconstructions have revolutionized microbial metabolic engineering and are used routinely for in silico analysis and design.
