eukaryotes use rna interference and rna-based epigenetic regulation to control transposon activity.
next, we consider two variants lacking rdrp and instead employing antisense transcription of transposons.
hence two important questions are: is rdrp truly a necessary component for transposon control, and are the alternative rna-based strategies also capable of controlling transposable elements?
thus, although rdrp activity is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, it need not be a general requirement for transposon control.
we have studied the interplay between host rnai pathways and transposons using mathematical models.
however, alternative pathways that bypass rdrp have recently been described.
we show that transposon activity is also controlled by the alternative pathways, although cytoplasmic small rna amplification is absent.
concluding, our models show that the control of transposon activity can be achieved by alternative pathways that lack rdrp and act through different feedback mechanisms.
