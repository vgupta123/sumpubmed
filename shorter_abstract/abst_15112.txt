to extend the analysis to a whole genome level we performed an oligonucleotide pool assay  for interrogation of  <dig> loci, of which  <dig> loci had known genetic map positions.
flow cytometry facilitates sorting of single chromosomes and chromosome arms which can be used for targeted genome analysis.
to determine the purity of sorted fractions and potential amplification bias we used quantitative pcr for specific genes on each chromosome.
dna samples from amplified chromosome 1h and a fraction containing chromosomes 2h â€“ 7h were examined.
the results indicate a significant potential of using this approach for physical mapping.
yet, many genomic applications such as development of genetic maps or physical mapping do not require large dna fragments.
moreover, the study showed that multiple displacement amplification of flow-sorted chromosomes is highly efficient and representative which considerably expands the potential of chromosome flow sorting in plant genomics.
analysis of unamplified genomic dna of barley cv.
comparison with three replicates of amplified genomic dna revealed >99% concordance.
flow-sorted chromosomes were treated with proteinase k and amplified using phi <dig> multiple displacement amplification .
however, the recovery of microgram amounts of dna needed for some assays requires sorting of millions of chromosomes which is laborious and time consuming.
