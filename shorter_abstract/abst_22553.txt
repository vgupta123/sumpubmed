neither stem-loop structures nor detectable sequence motifs were associated with microinversions in the hotspots.
two specific loci were microinversion hotspots, with high numbers of inversions that included both the homoplastic as well as some overlapping microinversions.
we surveyed non-coding sequence data from a recent avian phylogenetic study and found substantially more microinversions than expected based upon prior information about vertebrate inversion rates, although this is likely due to underestimation of these rates in previous studies.
microinversions can provide valuable phylogenetic information, although power analysis indicates that large amounts of sequence data will be necessary to identify enough inversions  to resolve short branches in the tree of life.
moreover, microinversions are not perfect characters and should be interpreted with caution, just as with any other character type.
however, some homoplastic microinversions were evident among the informative characters.
like many other rare genomic changes , microinversions are thought to be virtually homoplasy-free evolutionary characters, suggesting that they may be very useful for difficult phylogenetic problems such as the avian tree of life.
hemiplasy, which reflects differences between gene trees and the species tree, did not explain the observed homoplasy.
however, few detailed surveys of these genomic rearrangements have been conducted, making it difficult to assess this hypothesis or understand the impact of microinversions upon genome evolution.
despite their low rate of accumulation, they have clearly contributed to genome evolution, suggesting that active identification of microinversions will prove useful in future phylogenomic studies.
