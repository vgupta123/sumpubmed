furthermore, microarrays were used to detect and compare quantitative differences in tcp target genes in transgenic arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing different tcp transcription factors.
about  <dig> gb of sequence data was generated, processed and re-assembled into  <dig>  likely iberis unigenes, from which  <dig>  showed high sequence homology to arabidopsis proteins.
in addition, it was used as a scaffold to detect genes differentially expressed between the small, adaxial and the large, abaxial petals in order to understand the molecular mechanisms driving unequal petal growth.
the increased occurrences of genes implicated in cell wall modification and signalling implies that unequal petal growth is achieved through an earlier stop of the cell proliferation phase in the small, adaxial petals, followed by the onset of cell expansion.
in the co-evolution between insects and plants, the establishment of floral monosymmetry was an important step in angiosperm development as it facilitated the interaction with insect pollinators and, by that, likely enhanced angiosperm diversification.
in antirrhinum majus, the tcp transcription factor cycloidea is the molecular key regulator driving the formation of floral monosymmetry.
the transcriptome gives detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms governing late petal development.
although most brassicaceae form a polysymmetric corolla, six genera develop monosymmetric flowers with two petal pairs of unequal size.
in the monosymmetric crucifer iberis amara, formation of the different petal pairs coincides with a stronger expression of the cyc-homolog iatcp <dig> in the small, adaxial petals.
amongst all genes upregulated in adaxial petals, a significantly enhanced proportion is associated with cell wall modification and cell-cell signalling processes.
this process, which forms the monosymmetric corolla of iberis amara, is likely driven by the enhanced activity of iatcp <dig> in adaxial petals.
in this study, rna-seq was employed to reconstruct the petal transcriptome of the non-model species iberis amara.
far more genes are expressed in adaxial compared to abaxial petals implying that iatcp <dig> activates more genes than it represses.
