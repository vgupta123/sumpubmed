the presence of coinfections, however, is thought to alter this trade-off, and hence alter the evolutionarily stable strategy  for the parasite.
unrelated coinfection may increase overall parasite virulence, but the result stems from adding more infections rather than to more aggressive growth by the individual infections.
transmission success was treated as being either a negative-linear or a negative-exponential function of the total number of propagules produced by all coinfections.
nonetheless, the total number of propagules produced within each host increased in both cases.
the evolution of within-host growth rates by parasites is expected to depend on a trade-off between propagule production and virulence.
