further detailed study on interactions between intestinal microbiomes and hosts under dynamic conditions will shed new light on how the hosts and microbes respond to the changing environment.
to address this shortcoming, we determined the microbial gene catalogue, and investigated changes in the microbial composition and host-microbe interactions in the intestine of asian seabass in response to starvation.
in addition, significant differences in clusters of orthologous groups  functional categories and orthologous groups were observed.
however, studies on gut microbiomes have been conducted predominantly in humans and land animals.
not much is known on gut microbiomes of aquatic animals and their changes under changing environmental conditions.
we found  <dig> phyla,  <dig> classes,  <dig> orders and  <dig> families in the intestinal microbiome.
this study provides the first insights into the fish intestinal microbiome and its changes under starvation.
genes related to antibiotic activity in the microbiome were significantly enriched in response to starvation, and host genes related to the immune response were generally up-regulated.
starvation not only affects the nutritional and health status of the animals, but also the microbial composition in the hostâ€™s intestine.
