this statistic is significantly predictive of recombination rate, shows additional regional and population-specific conservation, and allows us to identify outlier genes likely to have experienced unusual amounts of variation in recent human history.
many common inference problems in computational genetics depend on inferring aspects of the evolutionary history of a data set given a set of observed modern sequences.
we demonstrate the utility of this library for population genetic inferences by examining a tree statistic we call 'imperfection,' which measures the reuse of variant sites within a phylogeny.
in order to facilitate phylogeny-based predictions on a genomic scale, we develop a library of maximum parsimony phylogenies within local regions spanning all autosomal human chromosomes based on haplotype map variation data.
making phylogenetic predictions on the scale needed for whole-genome analysis is, however, extremely computationally demanding.
as results from the imperfection statistic demonstrate, phylogeny predictions encode substantial information useful for detecting genomic features and population history.
recent theoretical advances in algorithms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction have made it possible to perform large-scale inferences of local maximum parsimony phylogenies from single nucleotide polymorphism  data.
