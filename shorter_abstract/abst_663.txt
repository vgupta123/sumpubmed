a comparison of affymetrix array data from rna-amp™ cdna generated from single mcf <dig> and mcf10a cells to reference controls of unamplified cdna revealed a high degree of concordance.
to assess the flexibility of the amplification system single cell rna-amp™ cdna was also analysed using rna-seq and high-density qpcr, and showed strong cross-platform correlations.
initial experiments compared amplified cdna generated by three commercial rna-amplification protocols  applied to single cell equivalent levels of rna  using affymetrix arrays.
here we demonstrate that the epistem rna-amp™ methodology reproducibly generates microgram amounts of cdna suitable for rna-seq, rt-qpcr arrays and microarray analysis.
the combined results confirm the sensitivity and flexibility of the rna-amp™ method and demonstrate the suitability of the approach for identifying clinically relevant signatures in rare, biologically important cell populations.
pathway analysis revealed that the distinct transcriptional signatures demonstrated in the cic subpopulations were significantly correlated with published stem-cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signatures.
the epistem rna-amp™ kit exhibited the highest sensitivity and was therefore chosen for further testing.
rna-seq analysis was able to identify transcriptional differences in distinct subsets of cic, with one group potentially enriched for metastasis formation.
