here, we present a framework for studying a gene regulatory network and the large-scale regulation of transcription on the level of chromatin structure.
aroclor  <dig> is a well-known hepatotoxin and consists of a complex mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls , some of which have the ability to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  and other transcription factors .
altered transcription factor expression enables activation of promoters of many genes, thereby inducing a regulatory gene network.
in the past, computational approaches were not applied to understand the combinatorial interplay of tfs acting in concert after treatment of human hepatocyte cultures with aroclor  <dig>  we were particularly interested in interrogating promoters for transcription factor binding sites of regulated genes.
we identified regulatory elements proximal to ahr binding sites, and this included recognition sites for the transcription factors ets, sp <dig>  creb, egr, nf-kb, nkxh, and zbp.
upon further analyses many were targets for other transcription factors whose expression was regulated by aroclor  <dig> .
within these directly neighbored gene pairs, not all genes were bona fide targets for ahr .
we determined molecular rules for transcriptional regulation to explain, in part, the pleiotropic effect seen in animals and humans upon exposure to aroclor  <dig>
we further examined the chromosomal distribution of regulated genes and observed a statistically significant high number of gene pairs within a distance of  <dig> kb.
we observed coordinate events in transcript regulation upon treatment of human hepatocytes with aroclor  <dig> and identified a regulatory gene network of different tfs acting in concert.
<dig> regulated gene pairs are even found to be directly neighbored.
for that purpose, we employed cdna and oligomicroarrays to investigate transcript signatures in human hepatocyte cultures treated with aroclor  <dig> and found  <dig> genes to be regulated,  <dig> of which code for tfs and  <dig> of which are involved in cell cycle and apoptosis.
