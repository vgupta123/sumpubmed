data mining and manual curation of the daphnia pulex genome identified  <dig> functional cyp genes, and three cyp pseudogenes.
the cyp370s are similar to the cyp15s and cyp303s that occur as solo genes in insects, but the cyp370s constitute ~20% of all the cyp genes in daphnia pulex.
overall, the cladoceran, d. pulex has a wide range of cyps with the same clans as insects and nematodes, but with distinct changes in the size and composition of each clan.
comparison of the cyps from d. pulex to the cyps from insects, vertebrates and sea anemone  show that the cyp <dig> clan, and to a lesser degree, the cyp <dig> clan has expanded in daphnia pulex, whereas the cyp <dig> clan has expanded in insects.
mapping of cyp tandem repeat regions demonstrated the unusual expansion of the cyp <dig> family of the cyp <dig> clan.
the cyp  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and mitochondrial clans are the same four clans found in other sequenced protostome genomes.
cytochrome p450s  in animals fall into two categories: those that synthesize or metabolize endogenous molecules and those that interact with exogenous chemicals from the diet or the environment.
