for up to 86% of the evaluated complexes a near-native structure was within the top 5% of the ranked prediction output.
use of the optimised amino acid specific parameters yields a strong increase of near-native structures on the first ranks of the prediction.
we developed a postfilter where the grid-representation of proteins for docking is extended by an optimised weighting factor for each amino acid.
the weighting factors obtained by the optimisation procedure correlate to a certain extent with the flexibility of the amino acids, their hydrophobicity and with their propensity to be in the interface.
