the x-ray structure of the peptide – hla-dp <dig> protein complex was used as a starting template to model by homology the structure of the four dp proteins.
the predictive ability of these qms was tested using an external test set of  <dig> known dp binders.
the higher predictive ability of ds-qms derived at ph  <dig>  may be rationalised by the additional hydrogen bond formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to the peptide position before p <dig>  and the protonated ε-nitrogen of his79β.
additionally, protonated his residues are well accepted at most of the peptide binding core positions which is in a good agreement with the overall negatively charged peptide binding site of most mhc proteins.
we develop here a method to predict peptide binding to the four most frequent hla-dp proteins: dp <dig>  dp <dig>  dp <dig> and dp <dig>  using a molecular docking protocol.
the models derived at ph  <dig>  predict better than those derived at ph  <dig>  and showed significantly improved predictions for three of the four dp proteins, when compared to the existing servers.
hla-dps are class ii mhc proteins mediating immune responses to many diseases.
acidic ph markedly elevates association rate constants but dissociation rates are almost unchanged in the ph range  <dig>  –  <dig> .
dockings to virtual combinatorial peptide libraries were performed at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> .
the resulting models were used to produce virtual combinatorial peptide libraries constructed using the single amino acid substitution  principle.
the resulting scores were normalized and used to generate docking score-based quantitative matrices .
peptides bind mhc class ii proteins in the acidic environment within endosomes.
