we use silkworms to evaluate therapeutic effects of drug candidates.
in this report, we attempt to establish a method by using silkworms to identify chemicals from plant extracts which are absorbed from intestine and also stably exist in body fluids.
three compounds were detected in the silkworm hemolymph by hplc analysis after midgut injection of acetone extracts of seihi, an herbal medicine obtained from orange peel.
the half-life of each of these compounds in the silkworm hemolymph was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively.
our previous reports have revealed that there are common mechanisms of pharmacokinetics of chemicals in silkworms and mammals.
