of  <dig> identified binding regions,  <dig> are co-bound by lysm, another lrp-like transcription factor in s. solfataricus.
moreover, we have provided evidence that two lrp-like transcription factors in s. solfataricus, ss-lrpb and lysm, interact in vivo.
chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with dna microarray analysis  has revealed that ss-lrpb interacts with  <dig> additional loci besides the four previously identified local targets.
the genome-wide binding profile presented here implies that ss-lrpb is associated at additional genomic binding sites besides the local gene targets, but acts as a specific transcription regulator in the tested growth conditions.
here, we study genome-wide binding of the lrp-like transcription factor ss-lrpb from sulfolobus solfataricus.
gene regulatory processes are largely resulting from binding of transcription factors to specific genomic targets.
leucine-responsive regulatory protein  is a prevalent transcription factor family in prokaryotes, however, little information is available on biological functions of these proteins in archaea.
