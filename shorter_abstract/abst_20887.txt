the developmental stages of the hybrid eel embryos and larvae are described using high resolution images.
female a. australis with male a. dieffenbachii, and female a. japonica with male a. anguilla.
hybrid larvae from female a. australis x male a. anguilla survived for up to seven days post fertilization .
in this paper we describe the first production of hybrid larvae from male a. anguilla and female a. australis and their survival for up to  <dig> dpf.
the existence of these artificial hybrids was however not demonstrated by independent genetic methods.
two species - a. anguilla and a. australis - that are phylogenetically close but have different sexual maturation times , were expected to produce favourable hybrids for reproduction studies.
a species-specific nucleotide difference in the  <dig> s rdna gene confirmed that genes from both a. australis and a. anguilla were present in the hybrids.
the early development of the hybrid showed typical characteristics of a. anguilla tail pigmentation at  <dig> hours post fertilization , indicating expression of genes derived from the father.
