in this study, addition of sorbitol has been found to increase the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus at temperatures ranging from 65 °c to 80 °c.
our findings provide an effective approach for enhancing the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus, which makes it a good candidate for industrial processes of isoquercitrin preparation.
therefore, it is necessary to find a proper method to improve the thermal stability of α-l-rhamnosidase.
the analyses of the results of fluorescence spectroscopy and cd have indicated that sorbitol helped to protect the tertiary and secondary structure of α-l-rhamnosidase.
moreover, the isoquercitrin yield increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with the addition of  <dig>  m of sorbitol at 70 °c.
thermally stable α-l-rhamnosidase with cleaving terminal α-l-rhamnose activity has great potential in industrial application.
half-life and activation free energy with addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol at 70 °c were increased by  <dig> -fold,  <dig>  kj/mol, respectively.
