of the other different proteins between s <dig> and  <dig>  such as omp2b, periplasmic sugar-binding protein, and oligopeptide abc transporter, no definitive implications related to bacterial virulence were found, which await further investigation.
we further performed the comparative genomic analysis to find out the differences between s <dig> and the virulent brucella suis strain  <dig>  we found premature stops in outer membrane autotransporter omaa and eryd genes.
single mutations were found in phosphatidylcholine synthase, phosphorglucosamine mutase, pyruvate kinase and flif, which have been reported to be related to the virulence of brucella or other bacteria.
brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by brucella infection.
