most significantly, we find strong support for a close relationship between coleoptera  and strepsiptera, a previously proposed, but analytically controversial relationship.
these findings provide the most complete evolutionary framework for future comparative studies on holometabolous model organisms and contribute strong evidence for the resolution of the 'strepsiptera problem', a long-standing and hotly debated issue in insect phylogenetics.
exploratory analyses reveal that this relationship cannot be explained by long-branch attraction or other systematic biases.
our results strongly support hymenoptera as the earliest branching holometabolan lineage, the monophyly of the extant orders, including the fleas, and traditionally recognized groupings of neuropteroidea and mecopterida.
evolutionary relationships among the  <dig> extant orders of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, called holometabola, remain either unresolved or contentious, but are extremely important as a context for accurate comparative biology of insect model organisms.
