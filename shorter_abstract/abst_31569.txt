however, many essential genes required for craniofacial development remain to be identified.
through screening a collection of insertional zebrafish mutants containing approximately 25% of the genes essential for embryonic development, we present the identification of  <dig> essential genes that are required for craniofacial development.
this work represents a systematic identification of approximately 25% of the essential genes required for craniofacial development.
the identification of zebrafish models for two human disease syndromes indicates that homologs to the other genes are likely to also be relevant for human craniofacial development.
we show that a gfp-wdr <dig> fusion protein localizes to the nucleus with dyrk1a in contrast to an engineered loss of function mutation wdr68-t284f that no longer accumulated in the cell nucleus and failed to rescue wdr <dig> mutant animals.
the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is derived from cranial nc cells and the patterning of these cells occurs within the pharyngeal arches.
we also identified zebrafish models for campomelic dysplasia and ehlers-danlos syndrome.
notably, we found that the drosophila wdr <dig> homolog cg <dig> could substitute for the vertebrate wdr <dig> gene even though insects lack the nc cell lineage.
we show that wdr <dig> acts upstream of the edn <dig> pathway and is also required for formation of the upper jaw equivalent, the palatoquadrate.
the initial characterization of wdr <dig> suggests an important role in craniofacial development for the highly conserved wdr68-dyrk <dig> protein complexes.
