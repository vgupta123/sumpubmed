two different methods are used regarding rabies serology: virus neutralisation test and elisa.
according to this study, the biopro elisa is reliable tool for detection of rabies specific antibodies in the context of evaluation of oral vaccination of foxes from poor quality samples as a substitution for virus neutralisation tests.
also, the influence of heat treatment of samples on test results was investigated.
diagnostic validity of the elisa compared to the mfavn test when not-heat treated samples were used was  <dig>  %.
diagnostic validity of the biopro elisa compared to the mfavn test for heat treated samples was  <dig>  %.
in this study the reliability of biopro elisa was evaluated for testing haemolytic thoracic liquids and muscle extracts originated from  <dig> foxes in comparison to mfavn.
the main goal of oral vaccination of foxes is eradication of rabies in the red fox population as rabies reservoirs.
