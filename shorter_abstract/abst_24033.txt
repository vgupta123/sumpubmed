consistent individual differences in behaviours that are correlated across different functional contexts, are a challenge to evolutionary reasoning because individuals should adapt their behaviour to the requirements of each situation.
in case of adaptive behavioural syndromes we predicted a positive relationship between exploration and aggressive helping  and a negative relationship between these behaviours and non-aggressive helping .
contrary to our prediction, there was no negative relationship between exploration and territory maintenance.
our results suggest that the three behaviours we measured are part of behavioural syndromes.
behavioural syndromes are often interpreted as a result of constraints resulting in limited plasticity and inflexible behaviour.
as expected, helpers engaging more in territory defence were consistently more explorative and engaged less in territory maintenance, the latter only when dominant breeders were present.
these may be adaptive, in that they reflect strategic specialization of helpers into one of two different life history strategies, namely  to stay and help in the home territory in order to inherit the breeding position or  to disperse early in order to breed independently.
