we predict that  <dig> of these represent cytoplasmic proteins while  <dig> are secreted.
the reproductive biology of tsetse has been studied on a physiological level; however the molecular analysis of tsetse reproduction requires deeper investigation.
to build a foundation from which to base molecular studies of tsetse reproduction, a cdna library was generated from female tsetse  reproductive tissues and the intrauterine developmental stages.
tsetse flies, vectors of african trypanosomes, undergo viviparous reproduction .
this reproductive strategy results in a large maternal investment and the deposition of a small number of progeny during a female's lifespan.
comparison of these proteins with other tissue specific tsetse cdna libraries  identified  <dig> that are unique to the reproductive/immature cdna library.
<dig> unique proteins were homologus to uncharacterized putative proteins within the nr database suggesting the identification of novel genes associated with reproductive functions in other insects .
the analysis also yielded seven putative proteins without significant homology to sequences present in the public database .
this paper identifies  <dig> putative proteins specific to a tsetse reproductive/immature est library.
