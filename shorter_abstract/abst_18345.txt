in order to determine if antigen presenting cells  present in the lung are capable of capture the mrna, labeled mrna-hsp <dig> was administered by intranasal route and lung apcs were analyzed by flow cytometry.
the safety aspects of mrna-based treatments in gene therapy make this molecule one of the most promising active components of therapeutic or prophylactic methods.
taken together, our results showed a novel and efficient strategy to control experimental tuberculosis, besides opening novel perspectives for the use of mrna in vaccines against infectious diseases and clarifying the mechanisms involved in the disease protection we noticed as well.
we produce messenger rna of hsp <dig> protein from mycobacterium leprae and show that vaccination of mice with a single dose of  <dig> Î¼g of naked mrna-hsp <dig> through intranasal route was able to induce protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
