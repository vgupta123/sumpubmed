in a time-course microarray experiment, the expression level for each gene is observed across a number of time-points in order to characterize the temporal trajectories of the gene-expression profiles.
there is an extensive recent body of literature on statistical methodology for addressing this analytical problem.
for many of these experiments, the scientific aim is the identification of genes for which the trajectories depend on an experimental or phenotypic factor.
finally, we will report the results from applying our method to a case study and discussing potential extensions.
most of the existing methods are based on estimating the time-course trajectories using parametric or non-parametric mean regression methods.
the sensitivity of these regression methods to outliers, an issue that is well documented in the statistical literature, should be of concern when analyzing microarray data.
through an extensive simulation study, we will illustrate the performance of our method.
