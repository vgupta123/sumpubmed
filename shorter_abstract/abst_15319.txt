substitution of cys <dig> residue, essential for oligomer-monomer transition of arabidopsis npr <dig>  with ser and leu residues in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig>  respectively, suggested that there may be differences between the regulatory mechanisms of gmnpr <dig> and arabidopsis npr proteins.
of the five cysteine residues, cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  and cys <dig> involved in oligomer-monomer transition in npr <dig>  cys <dig> in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> proteins was substituted to ser and leu, respectively.
gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> are the only soybean homologues of npr1and are located in homoeologous regions.
in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> transformed arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant plants, sar markers:  pr- <dig> was induced following ina treatment and  bgl <dig> following infection with pseudomonas syringae pv.
arabidopsis non-expressor of pr <dig>  is a regulatory gene of the sa signal pathway  <cit> .
salicylic acid  is a signaling molecule of the sar pathway.
complementation analyses in arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutants revealed that homoeologous gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> genes are orthologous to arabidopsis npr <dig>  therefore, sar pathway in soybean is most likely regulated by gmnpr <dig> genes.
pathogenesis-related gene gmpr <dig> is induced following treatment of soybean plants with the sar inducer,  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid  or infection with the oomycete pathogen, phytophthora sojae.
systemic acquired resistance  is induced in non-inoculated leaves following infection with certain pathogenic strains.
sar in soybean was first reported following infection with colletotrichum trancatum that causes anthracnose disease.
