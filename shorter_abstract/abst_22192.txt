notably, carocin s <dig> could be expressed not only in the mutant tf1- <dig> but also in escherichia coli dh5Î± after entry of the plasmid pms2ki.
this new type of bacteriocin, carocin s <dig>  has the ribonuclease activity of caros2k and the immunity protein activity of caros2i.
furthermore, the c-terminal domain of caros2k was homologous to the nuclease domains of colicin d and klebicin d. moreover, sds-page analysis showed that the relative mass of caros2k was  <dig> kda and that of caros2i was  <dig> kda.
in this study, we have determined that pcc strain f-rif- <dig> has a chromosomal gene encoding the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin, carocin s <dig>  and that this bacteriocin inhibits the growth of a closely related strain.
most isolates of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.
two adjacent complete open reading frames within pms2ki were sequenced, characterized, and identified as caros2k and caros2i, which respectively encode the killing protein and immunity protein.
