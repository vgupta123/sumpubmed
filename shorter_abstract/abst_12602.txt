overexpression of proteolytically active adam <dig> affected several physiological pathways, such as cell communication, nervous system development, neuron projection as well as synaptic transmission.
these results suggest that upregulation of adam <dig> in the brain has beneficial effects on ad pathology.
these results are further supportive for the strategy to treat ad by increasing the α-secretase activity.
in a transgenic mouse model of alzheimer disease , cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein  by the α-secretase adam <dig> prevented amyloid plaque formation, and alleviated cognitive deficits.
to assess the influence of adam <dig> on the gene expression profile in the brain, we performed a microarray analysis using rna isolated from brains of five months old mice overexpressing either the α-secretase adam <dig>  or a dominant-negative mutant  of this enzyme.
although adam <dig> has been implicated in notch and β-catenin signaling, no significant changes in the respective target genes were observed in adult adam <dig> transgenic mice.
in general, there was only a moderate alteration of gene expression in adam <dig> overexpressing mice.
even a decrease of inflammation markers was observed.
real-time rt-pcr confirmed a downregulation of genes coding for the inflammation-associated proteins s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> induced by moderate adam <dig> overexpression.
genes coding for pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic proteins were not over-represented among differentially regulated genes.
furthermore, adam <dig> overexpression increased the cortical synaptogenesis.
