we argue that plasmid rearrangements are essentially non-revertable and are present at a frequency of only about  <dig> % that of single nucleotide changes, making rearrangement-derived novel junctions  ideal phylogenetic markers in the study of b. burgdorferi population structure and plasmid evolution and exchange.
because of past rearrangements, any given gene, even though it might be universally present in these isolates, is often found on different linear plasmid compatibility types in different isolates.
for example, the arp gene and the vls cassette region are present on plasmids of four and five different compatibility types, respectively, in different isolates.
although there have been many past recombination events, both homologous and nonhomologous, among the plasmids, particular organizational variants of these plasmids correlate with particular chromosomal genotypes, suggesting that there has not been rapid horizontal transfer of whole linear plasmids among b. burgdorferi lineages.
a majority of the plasmid types have more than one organizationally different subtype, and the number of such variants ranges from one to eight among the  <dig> linear plasmid types.
bacteria from the genus borrelia are known to harbor numerous linear and circular plasmids.
their chromosomes, the cp <dig> and cp <dig> circular plasmids, as well as the lp <dig> linear plasmid, are quite evolutionarily stable; however, the remaining plasmids have undergone numerous non-homologous and often duplicative recombination events.
