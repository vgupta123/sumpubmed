the f-box genes constitute one of the largest gene families in plants involved in degradation of cellular proteins.
however, little is known about the f-box genes in the important legume crop, chickpea.
a total of 285 f-box genes were identified in chickpea which were classified based on their c-terminal domain structures into  <dig> subfamilies.
the f-box genes were physically mapped on the  <dig> chickpea chromosomes and duplication events were investigated which revealed that the f-box gene family expanded largely due to tandem duplications.
phylogenetic analysis classified the chickpea f-box genes into  <dig> clusters.
digital expression analysis of f-box genes in various chickpea tissues as well as under abiotic stress conditions utilizing the available chickpea transcriptome data revealed differential expression patterns with several f-box genes specifically expressing in each tissue, few of which were validated by using quantitative real-time pcr.
the genome-wide analysis of chickpea f-box genes provides new opportunities for characterization of candidate f-box genes and elucidation of their function in growth, development and stress responses for utilization in chickpea improvement.

also, maximum syntenic relationship was observed with soybean followed by medicago truncatula, lotus japonicus and arabidopsis.
f-box proteins can recognize a wide array of substrates and regulate many important biological processes such as embryogenesis, floral development, plant growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress, hormonal responses and senescence, among others.
thirteen putative novel motifs were also identified in f-box proteins with no known functional domain at their c-termini.
the available draft genome sequence of chickpea allowed us to conduct a genome-wide survey of the f-box gene family in chickpea.
