when evaluating in parallel the ultrastructural data and transcriptome changes of maternal/zygotic and only zygotic manf mutants, the endoplasmic reticulum  stress and membrane traffic alterations were evident.
in drosophila manf mutants the expression of several genes involved in parkinson's disease  was altered as well.
the most dramatic change of expression was observed with genes coding membrane transport proteins and genes related to metabolism.
in the absence of manf, the expression of genes involved in membrane transport, particularly exocytosis and endosomal recycling pathway was altered.
in neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd, correct protein folding and proteasome function as well as neurotransmitter synthesis and uptake are crucial for the survival of neurons.
to enlighten the role of manf in multicellular organism development we carried out a microarray-based analysis of the transcriptional changes induced by the loss and overexpression of drosophila manf.
