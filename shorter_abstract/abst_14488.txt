rt-pcr and database analysis found two distinct lineages to be expressed nearly exclusively in reproductive tissues and to be closely related to arabidopsis bgals expressed most highly in flower and pollen.
on the other hand, osbgal <dig> is expressed primarily in young vegetative tissues, and alternative splicing in panicle prevents its production of full-length protein in this reproductive tissue.
all  <dig> proteins were predicted to contain secretory signal sequences, suggesting they have secretory pathway or external roles.
the presence of both classes of bgals in bryophytes, as well as vascular plants, suggests both gene lineages were present early in plant evolution.
many plant β-galactosidases  have been well characterized and their deduced biological functions mainly involve degradation of structural pectins, xyloglucans or arabinogalactoproteins in plant cell walls.
rice gh <dig> contains fifteen genes with a diversity of protein sequences, predicted locations and expression and splicing patterns that suggest that osbgals enzymes may play a variety of roles in metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids.
in this study, the gene multiplicity, apparent evolutionary relationships and transcript expression of rice bgal genes were examined, in order to predict their biological functions.
osbgal <dig> produced by recombinant expression in escherichia coli hydrolyzed α-l-arabinoside in addition to β-d-galactoside and β--, β-- and β-- linked galacto-oligosaccharides.
