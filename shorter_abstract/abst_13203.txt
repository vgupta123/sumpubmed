we report classification accuracy reasonably well for ranks down to order, observed on a study on real world data .
in this paper we address the problem of rapid taxonomic assignment with small and adaptive data models  and present the accelerated k-mer explorer .
the tool is presented to the public as a web application .
we show that the execution time of this approach is orders of magnitude shorter than competitive approaches and that accuracy is comparable.
