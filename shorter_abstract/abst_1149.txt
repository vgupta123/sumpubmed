lysosomes are the major catabolic compartment within eukaryotic cells, and their biogenesis requires the integration of the biosynthetic and endosomal pathways.
because ubpy/usp <dig> has been widely described for its function in the endosomal system, we hypothesized that disrupting the endosomal pathway itself may affect the biogenesis of the lysosomes.
in the present study, we blocked the progression of the endosomal pathway at different levels of maturation of the endosomes by expressing in fat body cells either dsrnas or dominant negative mutants targeting components of the endosomal machinery: shibire, rab <dig>  rab <dig>  chmp <dig> and rab <dig>  we observed that inhibition of endosomal trafficking at different steps in vivo is systematically associated with defects in lysosome biogenesis, resulting in autophagy flux blockade.
we previously identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubpy/usp <dig> as being necessary for lysosomal biogenesis and productive autophagy in drosophila.
our results show that the integrity of the endosomal system is required for lysosome biogenesis and productive autophagy in vivo.
