many neuromuscular blockers act as negative allosteric modulators of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by decreasing affinity and potency of acetylcholine.
these observations highlight the relevance and necessity of performing physiological tests under non-equilibrium conditions in evaluating the functional effects of allosteric modulators at muscarinic receptors.
the neuromuscular blocker rapacuronium has been shown to have facilitatory effects at muscarinic receptors leading to bronchospasm.
this results in potentiation of receptor activation at low concentrations of rapacuronium  but not at high concentrations .
at equilibrium rapacuronium bound to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors with micromolar affinity  and displayed negative cooperativity with both high- and low-affinity ach binding states.
rapacuronium accelerated ach association with and dissociation from odd-numbered receptor subtypes.
we examined the influence of rapacuronium on acetylcholine  binding to and activation of individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells to determine its receptor selectivity.
our data demonstrate a novel dichotomy in rapacuronium effects at odd-numbered muscarinic receptors.
in contrast,  <dig>  Î¼m rapacuronium significantly increased ach potency at m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptors.
