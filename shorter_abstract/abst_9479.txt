subgraphs are animated via a real-time force-based layout algorithm which is fully interactive: each time the user makes a change, e.g.
browsing to a new term, hiding, adding, or dragging terms, the algorithm performs smooth and only essential reorganisations of the graph.
more than one million terms from biomedical ontologies and controlled vocabularies are available through the ontology lookup service .
olsvis shows customisable subgraphs of the ols ontologies.
we created the olsvis web application, a visualiser for browsing all ontologies available in the ols database.
