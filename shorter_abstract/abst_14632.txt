genome-wide significant or suggestive qtl were found for clutch length, body weight and feed intake on cja <dig>  age at first egg and egg number on cja <dig>  and eggshell weight and residual feed intake on cja <dig>  with possible pleiotropy for the qtl affecting body weight and feed intake, and egg number and age at first egg.
the japanese quail  is both an animal model in biology and a commercial bird for egg and meat production.
a suggestive qtl was found for tonic immobility on cja <dig>  and chromosome-wide significant qtl for body temperature were detected on cja <dig> and cja <dig>  other chromosome-wide significant qtl were found on cja <dig>  cja <dig>  cja <dig> and cja <dig>  parent-of-origin effects were found for qtl for body weight and feed intake on cja <dig>
despite its limited length, the first quail microsatellite map was useful to detect new qtl for rarely reported traits, like residual feed intake, and to help establish some correspondence between the qtl for feed intake, body weight and tonic immobility detected in the present work and those reported on gga <dig> in the chicken.
modern research developments with this bird, however, have been slowed down by the limited information that is available on the genetics of the japanese quail.
