re-adjustment of balance in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism therefore plays a central role in stress adaptation.
to address these questions, changes in transcriptome, metabolome and ionome were analyzed in maize source leaves from plants suffering low temperature, low nitrogen  and low phosphorus  stress.
the largest group of commonly regulated transcripts followed the expression pattern: down under low temperature and low n, but up under low p. several members of this transcript cluster could be connected to p metabolism and correlated negatively to different phosphate concentration in the leaf tissue.
accumulation of starch under low temperature and low n stress, but decrease in starch levels under low p conditions indicated that only low p treated leaves suffered carbon starvation.
growth retardation was comparable under all tested stress conditions.
however, it is currently unknown which parts of the primary cell metabolism follow common patterns under different stress conditions and which represent specific responses.
abiotic stress causes disturbances in the cellular homeostasis.
carbon and energy metabolism of the c <dig> maize leaves were particularly sensitive to p starvation.
the only primary metabolic pathway responding similar to all stresses was nitrate assimilation, which was down-regulated.
while nitrate assimilation was regulated depending on demand by growth processes, phosphate concentrations changed depending on availability, thus building up reserves under excess conditions.
maize employs very different strategies to manage n and p metabolism under stress.
