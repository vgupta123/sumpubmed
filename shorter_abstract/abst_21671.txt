to further investigate the role of qc in pe3-aβ formation in vivo, etna mice were intercrossed with tg mice overexpressing human qc  to generate double tg etna-hqc mice.
double tg etna-hqc mice showed similar aβ levels and expression sites, while pe3-aβ were significantly increased, entailing increased astrocytosis and neuronal loss.
etna and etna-hqc mice represent novel mouse models for qc-mediated toxicity of truncated and pe-modified aβ.
the spatio-temporal correlation of pe3-aβ and neuropathology strongly argues for an important role of this aβ species in neurodegenerative processes in these models.
to directly investigate pe3-aβ formation and toxicity in vivo, transgenic  etna  mice expressing truncated human aβ were generated and comprehensively characterized.
this ultimately resulted in astrocytosis, loss of darpp- <dig> immunoreactivity, and neuronal loss at the sites of pe3-aβ formation.
expression of truncated aβ was detected mainly in the lateral striatum of etna mice, leading to progressive accumulation of pe3-aβ.
neuropathology in etna mice was associated with behavioral alterations.
in particular, hyperactivity and impaired acoustic sensorimotor gating were detected.
posttranslational modifications of beta amyloid  have been shown to affect its biophysical and neurophysiological properties.
in addition, it accelerates aggregation of other aβ species.
