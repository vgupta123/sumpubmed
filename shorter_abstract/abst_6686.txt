by contrast, eacmv-like cmg populations  were more diverse, more spatially structured, and displayed evidence of at least three independent introductions from mainland africa.
the genetic and spatial structure of cmg populations in madagascar was studied and bayesian phylogeographic modelling was applied to infer the origins of madagascan cmg populations within the epidemiological context of related populations situated on mainland africa and other south western indian ocean  islands.
although there were no statistically supported virus movement events between madagascar and the other swio islands, at least one mainland african acmv variant likely originated in madagascar.
evidence of an epidemiological link between madagascan and mainland african cmgs suggests that the consequences of such emergence events could reach far beyond the shores of this island.
cassava mosaic disease  in madagascar is caused by a complex of at least six african cassava mosaic geminivirus  species.
our study highlights both the complexity of cmd in madagascar, and the distinct evolutionary and spatial dynamics of the different viral species that collectively are associated with this disease.
this provides a rare opportunity for a comparative study of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of distinct pathogenic crop-infecting viral species that coexist within the same environment.
sacmv and acmv, the two most prevalent viruses, displayed low degrees of genetic diversity and have most likely been introduced to the island only once.
