oscillatory activity, which can be separated in background and oscillatory burst pattern activities, is supposed to be representative of local synchronies of neural assemblies.
in this work we propose a user-friendly stand-alone toolbox, which models in a reasonable time a bump time-frequency model from the wavelet representations of a set of signals.
the software is provided with a matlab toolbox which can compute wavelet representations before calling automatically the stand-alone application.
oscillatory burst events should consequently play a specific functional role, distinct from background eeg activity â€“ especially for cognitive tasks , binding mechanisms and perceptual dynamics , or in clinical contexts .
