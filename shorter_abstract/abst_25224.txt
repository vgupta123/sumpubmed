transthyretin  amyloidosis is a hereditary disease with a complex genotype-phenotype correlation.
this might contribute to the genotype-phenotype correlation of ttr amyloidosis.

polygenic scores for genetically determined ttr expression in  <dig> clinically relevant tissues were constructed using data from the gtex  project and tested in the samples from the  <dig>  genomes project.
we conducted a literature survey to define the clinical landscape of ttr amyloidosis across populations worldwide.
familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy  presents clinical variability among human populations, a finding that agrees with the among-ancestry diversity of genetically determined ttr expression in heart tissues .
we observed differences among the ancestral groups and, to a lesser extent, among the investigated populations within the ancestry groups.
this is in line with epidemiological data related to swedish and portuguese ttr val30met endemic areas.
then, we investigated whether the genetically determined ttr expression differs among human populations, contributing to the differences observed in patients.
scandinavian populations differed in their genetically determined ttr expression of skeletal muscle tissue with respect to southern europeans .
genetically determined ttr expression varied across human populations.
