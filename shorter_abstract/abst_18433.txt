the orthorhombic crystals were obtained at ph  <dig>  and contained three insulin hexamers in r <dig> conformation in the asymmetric unit whilst the monoclinic c <dig> crystals were obtained at ph  <dig>  and contained one r <dig> hexamer in the asymmetric unit.
the short distance suggests a low barrier hydrogen bond.
however, in both cases the low barrier hydrogen bond and the tyrosine-tyrosine interaction should contribute to the stability of the crystals which is crucial when used in pharmaceutical formulations.
insulin is a therapeutic protein that is widely used for the treatment of diabetes.
the crystals were obtained when the two chaotropic agents, urea and thiocyanate were present in the crystallization experiments, and their structures were determined by x-ray crystallography.
its biological function was discovered more than  <dig> years ago and it has since then been characterized extensively.
the crystals belong to the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystal systems, with space groups c <dig> and c <dig> respectively.
the change in space group from c <dig> to c <dig> was primarily caused by an increase in ph.
the fewer number of hexamer-hexamer interactions comprising the short hydrogen bond in the c <dig> space group suggest that ph is the driving force.
crystallization of the insulin molecule has always been a key activity since the protein is often administered by subcutaneous injections of crystalline insulin formulations.
interestingly, we have now discovered two new crystal forms of human insulin.
in addition, two tyrosine-tyrosine interactions occupying a known phenol binding pocket contribute to the stabilization of the contacts.
