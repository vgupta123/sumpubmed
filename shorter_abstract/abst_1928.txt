several hypotheses have arisen regarding the molecular background of smoke and kar <dig> action.
it is highly possible that the smoke/kar <dig> 'signal' is perceived by a receptor that is shared with the signal transduction system implied in perceiving environmental cues , or some kind of specialized receptor exists in fire-prone plant species which diverged from a more general one present in a common ancestor, and also found in non fire-prone plants allowing for a somewhat weaker but still significant response.
it not only promotes the germination of species from fire-prone habitats, but several species from non-fire-prone areas also respond, including some crops.
in this paper we demonstrate that although smoke-water and kar <dig> treatment of maize kernels result in a similar physiological response, the gene expression and the protein ubiquitination patterns are quite different.
