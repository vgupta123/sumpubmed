thus, it significantly outperforms the available methods regarding sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall with cross-validation evaluation and reaches ~80% and ~90% accuracy in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae respectively.
therefore predicting protein-protein interactions from the sequences is of great demand.
the reason lies in the fact that identifying protein-protein interactions is becoming a bottleneck for eventually understanding the functions of proteins, especially for those organisms barely characterized.
the results show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of protein-protein interaction predictions.
with the development of genome-sequencing technologies, protein sequences are readily obtained by translating the measured mrnas.
although a few methods have been proposed, the converse problem, if the features used extract sufficient and unbiased information from protein sequences, is almost untouched.
motivated by the theoretical investigation, we find novel encoding methods for both protein sequences and protein pairs.
our new methods exploit sufficiently the information of protein sequences and reduce artificial bias and computational cost.
by considering the converse problem, we propose new representation methods for both protein sequences and protein pairs.
