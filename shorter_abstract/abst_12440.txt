second generation lignocellulosic feedstocks are being considered as an alternative to first generation biofuels that are derived from grain starches and sugars.
amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were downregulated in termites feeding on sr relative to paper and cs.
these results suggest that the effect of cs and sr feeding on termite gut lignocellulase composition is minimal and thus, the most abundantly expressed enzymes appear to encode the best candidate catalysts for use in saccharification of these and related second-generation feedstocks.
further, based on these findings we hypothesize that the most abundantly expressed lignocellulases, rather than those that are differentially expressed have the best potential as pretreatment enzymes for cs and sr feedstocks.
functional profiles after cs feeding were similar to paper and sr; whereas paper and sr showed different profiles.
metatranscriptomic profiling was performed on worker termite guts after feeding on corn stover , soybean residue , or 98% pure cellulose  to identify  microbial community,  pathway level and  gene-level responses.
