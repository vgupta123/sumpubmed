modern web browsers can now be used as high-performance workstations for querying, processing, and visualizing genomics’ “big data” from sources like the cancer genome atlas  and the international cancer genome consortium  without local software installation or configuration.
any modern web browser can submit those tasks and/or volunteer to execute them without installing any extra plugins or programs.
ongoing advancements in cloud computing provide novel opportunities in scientific computing, especially for distributed workflows.
paradoxically, the sandboxed execution of code by web browsers was also found to enable them, as compute nodes, to address critical privacy concerns that characterize biomedical environments.
qm is an open-sourced, publicly available web service that acts as a messaging system for posting tasks and retrieving results over http.
