when the number of objects was retained but they were spaced further apart, rat routes converged at 1– <dig> of the objects and at the corner at which the rats had been introduced into the arena .
in contrast, in the presence of many objects, the routes passed between the objects as if using them as directional cues.
rats treated chronically with the d2– <dig> dopamine agonist quinpirole were previously proposed as an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder  since their behavior is based on repeated, compulsive-like persistent traveling between a few places in the open field.
for this, quinpirole-treated rats were first exposed to an arena with an array of objects  and after the development of compulsive-like behavior, the arena was manipulated by multiplying the number of objects, changing their spacing, relocating object array, or removing the objects.
finally, when object array was relocated to different places within the arena, the rats extended their routes from the start corner to the object array, regardless of array location.
when object spacing was retained but their number was increased, the rats traveled between the objects with the routes converging only at the start corner.
the aim of the present study was to determine properties of the physical environment that shape such behavior.
