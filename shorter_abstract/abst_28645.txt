bacillus anthracis has two major virulence factors: a tripartite toxin that produces lethal and edema toxins and a polyglutamic acid capsule.
balb/c mice immunized with ralo and boosted after two weeks, produce sera with strong ab responses with a predominance of igg <dig> and igg2a.
our results suggest that alo contributes to the virulence of b. anthracis sterne strain in this infection model and that ab response to alo may contribute to protection in certain circumstances.
a recent report suggested that a toxin belonging to the cholesterol dependant cytolysin  family, anthrolysin o  was a new virulence factor for b. anthracis but subsequent studies have questioned its relevance in pathogenesis.
passive administration of  <dig> of the five monoclonal antibodies  to ralo prior to infection with lethal intravenous  b. anthracis sterne strain infection in mice was associated with enhanced average survival and a greater likelihood of surviving infection.
