tauschii accessions were collected from a broad area ranging from armenia to the southwestern coastal part of the caspian sea.
a dominant non-glaucous allele, iw <dig>  resides on the short arm of chromosome 2d, which was inherited from ae.
cuticular wax production on plant surfaces confers a glaucous appearance and plays important roles in plant stress tolerance.
allelic differences at the iw <dig> locus were the main contributors to the phenotypic difference between the glaucous and non-glaucous accessions of ae.
our results supported the previous assumption that the d-genome donor of common wheat could have been any ae.
most common wheat cultivars, which are hexaploid, and most tetraploid wheat cultivars are glaucous; in contrast, a wild wheat progenitor, aegilops tauschii, can be glaucous or non-glaucous.
tauschii may provide important information and lead to a better understanding of the evolution of common wheat.
detailed genetic and phylogeographic knowledge of the iw <dig> locus in ae.
tauschii indicated that at least two non-glaucous accessions might carry other glaucousness-determining loci outside of the iw <dig> locus.
tauschii variant that carried the recessive iw <dig> allele.
iw <dig> is one of the major causal genes related to variation in glaucousness among hexaploid wheat.
tauschii was then used to develop molecular markers tightly linked with ae.
genetic associations between specific iw2-linked markers and respective glaucous phenotypes in ae.
