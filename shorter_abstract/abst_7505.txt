the tests using both simulated and experimentally derived images show that it is possible for our proposed method to estimate the loop length along the skeleton if the secondary structure elements, such as α-helices, can be detected accurately, and there is a continuous skeleton linking the α-helices.
the method was tested using fifty simulated density images of helix-loop-helix segments of atomic structures and eighteen experimentally derived density data from electron microscopy data bank .
we have developed a novel computational geometric approach to derive a simplified curve in order to estimate the loop length along the skeleton.
the skeleton connecting two secondary structures such as α-helices represent the loop in the 3d image.
