the amount of dna available in these samples is however rarely sufficient for reliable genome-wide scans, and whole-genome amplification may thus be necessary.
archived residual dried blood spot samples from national newborn screening programs may provide dna from entire populations and medical registries the corresponding clinical information.
this study assess the quality of dna obtained from different amplification protocols by evaluating fidelity and robustness of the genotyping of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms, using the illumina infinium hd human610-quad beadchip.
whole-genome amplified dna from archived neonatal dried blood spot samples can be used for reliable genome-wide scans and is a cost-efficient alternative to collecting new samples.
