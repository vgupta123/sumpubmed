different trajectories of brain and behaviour changes suggest that the preceding effect of a p2m increase relates to brain processes, which are necessary precursors of perceptual learning.
the amplitude of the earlier n1m wave, which is related to processing of sensory information, did not change over the time course of the study.
by this latency, the integration of stimulus features into an auditory object for further conscious perception is considered to be complete.
the p2m gain likely reflects enhanced object representation after stimulus experience and training, which enables listeners to improve their ability for scrutinizing fine differences in pre-voicing time.
underlying cortical sources were localized, and the temporal dynamics of auditory evoked responses were analyzed.
moreover, p2m sources were localized in anterior auditory association cortex, which is part of the antero-ventral pathway for object identification.
therefore the p2m changes were discussed in the light of auditory object representation.

based on latencies and source locations of auditory evoked responses, we investigated which stage of central processing undergoes neuroplastic changes when gaining auditory experience during passive listening and active perceptual training.
