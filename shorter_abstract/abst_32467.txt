here we present an economical, high-throughput library preparation method for the illumina platform, comprising a 96-well based method for dna isolation for yeast cells, a low-cost dna shearing alternative, and adapter ligation using heat inactivation of enzymes instead of bead cleanups.

we have used this workflow to obtain recombination and aneuploidy data from hundreds of segregants, which can serve as a foundation for future studies of linkage, recombination, and chromosomal aberrations in yeast and higher eukaryotes.
comparisons to other datasets indicate a high conservation of recombination at a chromosome-wide scale, but differences at the local scale.
up to  <dig> whole-genome libraries can be prepared from yeast cells in one week using this method, for less than  <dig> euros per sample.
the throughput of next-generation sequencing machines has increased dramatically over the last few years; yet the cost and time for library preparation have not changed proportionally, thus representing the main bottleneck for sequencing large numbers of samples.
additionally, we detected a high degree of aneuploidy  by examining the sequencing coverage in these segregants.
here we present a high throughput workflow to sequence genomes of large number of yeast strains at a low price.
the sequence information from  <dig> yeast segregants derived from two divergent s. cerevisiae strains was used to generate a meiotic recombination map at unprecedented resolution.
