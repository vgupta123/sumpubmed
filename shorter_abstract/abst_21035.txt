many non-autonomous families generated by internal deletions were also identified.
using both library-based and de novo methods of transposon detection, we found less than 6Â % of transposable elements in the r. prolixus genome, a relatively low percentage compared to other insect genomes with a similar genome size.
dna transposons are surprisingly abundant and elements belonging to the mariner family are by far the most preponderant components of the mobile part of this genome with  <dig>  mariner transposons that could be clustered in  <dig> groups .
r. prolixus can also transfer transposable elements horizontally across a wide range of species.
we have taken advantage of the availability of the  <dig> mbp complete genome sequence of r. prolixus to study the dynamics of invasion and persistence of transposable elements in this species.
at least  <dig> cases of horizontal transfers were found, supporting the idea that host/vector relationships played a pivotal role in the transmission and subsequent persistence of transposable elements in this genome.
the triatomine bug rhodnius prolixus is a vector of trypanosoma cruzi, which causes the chagas disease in latin america.
we demonstrated that a large diversity of mariner elements invaded the genome and expanded successfully over time via three main processes.
our analysis allowed the detection of a new mariner clade in the r. prolixus genome, that we called nosferatis.
these recent expansion events explain the unusual prevalence of mariner transposons in the r. prolixus genome.
other families expanded via older bursts of transposition demonstrating the long lasting permissibility of mariner transposons in the r. prolixus genome.
these data provide a new insight into the evolution of transposons in the genomes of hematophagous insects and bring additional evidences that lateral exchanges of mobile genetics elements occur frequently in the r. prolixus genome.
