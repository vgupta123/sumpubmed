in addition, we tested the effect of variability in individual growth rates and noise in septum positioning and found that size control is robust to this phenotypic noise.
in contrast, a sizer model is robust and fits the data well.
bacterial division is often assumed to be controlled in this way, but experimental evidence to support this assumption is still lacking.
theoretical arguments show that size control is required to maintain size homeostasis in the case of exponential growth of individual cells.
here we test these models with recent data on single-cell growth of escherichia coli.
many organisms coordinate cell growth and division through size control mechanisms: cells must reach a critical size to trigger a cell cycle event.
nevertheless, if the growth law deviates slightly from exponential for very small cells, homeostasis can be maintained with a simple ‘timer’ triggering division.
we demonstrate that a size-independent timer mechanism for division control, though theoretically possible, is quantitatively incompatible with the data and extremely sensitive to slight variations in the growth law.
here we overcome these limitations by using high precision measurements of tens of thousands of single bacterial cells combined with recent statistical inference methods to estimate the division rate within the models.
therefore, deciding whether division control in bacteria relies on a ‘timer’ or ‘sizer’ mechanism requires quantitative comparisons between models and data.
