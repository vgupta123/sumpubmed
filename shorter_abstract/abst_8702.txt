in this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the entire maize genome and identified  <dig> cdpk genes.
most maize cdpk genes exhibited different expression levels in different tissues and developmental stages.
twelve cdpk genes were selected to respond to various stimuli, including salt, drought and cold, as well as aba and h2o <dig>  expression analyses suggested that maize cdpk genes are important components of maize development and multiple transduction pathways.
here, we present a genome-wide analysis of the cdpk gene family in maize for the first time, and this genomic analysis of maize cdpk genes provides the first step towards a functional study of this gene family in maize.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that  <dig> zmcpks can be divided into four groups.
calcium-dependent protein kinases  have been shown to play important roles in various physiological processes, including plant growth and development, abiotic and biotic stress responses and plant hormone signaling in plants.
