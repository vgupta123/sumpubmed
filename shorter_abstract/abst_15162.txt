we found that positive selection in deep-sea adapted bacteria targets a wide range of functions, for example solute transport, protein translocation, dna synthesis and motility.
from these data clearly emerges an involvement of the transport and metabolism processes in the deep-sea adaptation strategy of both bathytypes considered, whereas the adaptation of other biological processes seems to be specific to either one or the other.
the prevalence of transporters led us to analyze variable amino acids  by mapping them according to their membrane topology, the results showed a higher frequency of substitutions in the extra-cellular compartment.
the statistical method takes into account differences in the ratio between non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, thus allowing the detection of the genes that underwent positive selection.
a similar analysis was performed on soluble proteins, mapping the ps sites on the 3d structure, revealing a prevalence of substitutions on the protein surface.
strikingly, structural mapping of ps sites performed independently on membrane and soluble proteins revealed that residues under positive selection tend to occur in specific protein regions.
finally, the presence of some flagellar proteins in the vibrionaceae ps list confirms the importance of bacterial motility as a ss <dig> specific adaptation strategy.
an important role is hypothesized for five ps genes belonging to the transport category that had been previously identified as differentially expressed in microarray experiments.
genes belonging to specific functional categories are known to be particularly susceptible to high-pressure; therefore, they should show some evidence of positive selection.
we were able to establish "motility" and "transport" as two classes significantly enriched with ps genes.
