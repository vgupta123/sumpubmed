cell extract of l. coryniformis crl  <dig>  isolated from silage, is able to correct the coenzyme b <dig> requirement of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ar  <dig> in minimal medium.
it has been reported that certain strains belonging to lactic acid bacteria group are capable of synthesized water-soluble vitamins such as those included in the b-group, as vitamin b <dig>  in this context, the goal of the present paper was to evaluate and characterize the production of vitamin b <dig> in lactobacillus coryniformis crl  <dig>  a heterofermentative strain isolated from silage.
the chemical characterization of the corrinoid-like molecule isolated from crl  <dig> cell extract using hplc and mass spectrometry is reported.
the results here described show for the first time that l. coryniformis subsp.
genomic analysis allowed the identification and characterization of the complete de novo biosynthetic pathway of the corrinoid produced by the crl  <dig> strain.
genomic studies revealed the presence of the complete machinery of the anaerobic biosynthesis pathway of coenzyme b <dig>  the detected genes encode all proteins for the corrin ring biosynthesis and for the binding of upper  and lower  ligands in one continuous stretch of the chromosome.
