the synovial fluid sp and pge <dig> concentration was compared between osteoarthritic and control joints.
there was no significant change from baseline in sp or pge <dig> after ia bont a. synovial fluid pge <dig> was significantly higher in osteoarthritic compared to control joints.
similar results have been reported in human patients with arthritis.
the results suggest that the antinociceptive effect of ia bont a in the joint might not be related to the inhibition of sp nor pge <dig>  synovial fluid pge <dig>  but not sp, could be a marker for chronic osteoarthritis and pain in dogs.
recently, intra-articular botulinum toxin a  has been shown to reduce joint pain in osteoarthritic dogs.
the aim of this study was to explore this mechanism of action by investigating the effect of ia bont a on synovial fluid  and serum substance p , prostaglandin e <dig> , and tumor necrosis factor alpha  in osteoarthritic dogs.

synovial fluid samples were obtained from control dogs after euthanasia.
the concentration of tnf-α remained under the detection limit of the assay in all samples.
the change from baseline in sp and pge <dig> concentration was compared between the ia bont a and placebo groups.
however, the mechanism of the antinociceptive action of ia bont a is currently not known.
serum and sf samples were collected and osteoarthritic pain was evaluated before  and  <dig> and 8 weeks after treatment.
osteoarthritic dogs received either ia bont a  or ia placebo .
thirty-five dogs with chronic naturally occurring osteoarthritis and  <dig> non-osteoarthritic control dogs were included in the study.
osteoarthritic pain was assessed with force platform, helsinki chronic pain index, and joint palpation.
synovial fluid pge <dig> correlated with osteoarthritic pain.
additionally, the aim was to compare sf sp and pge <dig> between osteoarthritic and non-osteoarthritic joints, and investigate associations between sp, pge <dig>  osteoarthritic pain, and the signalment of dogs.
associations between sp, pge <dig>  osteoarthritic pain, and the signalment of dogs were evaluated.
