the vector pmaa-red allows for fast and easy production of transgenic arabidopsis plants with a strong expression level of the gene of interest.
transgenic seeds show red fluorescence which can be used for selection and the fluorescence level is indicative of the expression level of the transgene.
vector pmaa-red contains a pdf <dig> : dsred marker and a camv:: gus cassette within the t-dna and is useful for the production of promoter: gus lines and overexpression lines.
vector ppzp <dig>  is devoid of noti sites and vector ppzp <dig>  contains a bacterial kanamycin resistance gene.
