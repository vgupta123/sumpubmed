whole cell recordings were done using gramicidin perforated patch techniques to maintain endogenous cl- levels.
to assess the impact of these and other chloride-dependent mechanisms on release from cones, the chloride equilibrium potential  was determined in red-sensitive, large single cones from the tiger salamander retinal slice.
to measure ecl, we applied long depolarizing steps to activate the calcium-activated chloride current ) and then determined the reversal potential for the current component that was inhibited by the cl- channel blocker, niflumic acid.
this will minimize the impact of chloride-dependent presynaptic mechanisms in cone terminals involving gabaa receptors, glutamate transporters and icl.
membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials.
the membrane potentials produced by the various high k+ solutions were measured in separate current clamp experiments.
the results of this study indicate that ecl is close to the dark resting potential.
in a complementary approach, we used a cl-sensitive dye, meq, to measure the cl- flux produced by depolarization with elevated concentrations of k+.
consistent with electrophysiological experiments, meq fluorescence measurements indicated that ecl was below - <dig> mv.
