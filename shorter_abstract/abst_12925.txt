for a genome-wide assessment of the role of copy number divergence  in lineage-specific environmental adaptation, we conducted cross-species array comparative genome hybridizations of three plant species and developed a global signal scaling procedure to adjust for sequence divergence.
gene copy number divergence between species is a form of genetic polymorphism that contributes significantly to both genome size and phenotypic variation.
in a. halleri, transition metal homeostasis functions are enriched twofold among the genes detected as copy number expanded.
our results provide genome-wide support for a link between evolutionary adaptation and cnd in a. halleri as shown previously for heavy metal atpase <dig>  moreover our results support the hypothesis that elemental defences, which result from the hyperaccumulation of toxic metals, allow the reduction of classical defences against biotic stress as a trade-off.
in plants, copy number expansions of single genes were implicated in cultivar- or species-specific tolerance of high levels of soil boron, aluminium or calamine-type heavy metals, respectively.
moreover, biotic stress functions including mostly disease resistance  gene-related genes are enriched twofold among genes detected as copy number reduced, when compared to the abundance of these functions among all genes.
