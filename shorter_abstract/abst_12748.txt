here we show it can be applied to identify the interactions of small molecules within the nf-κb signalling pathway.
the technique successfully predicted the points of interactions of compounds that are known to interact with the nf-κb pathway.
clusters that contain compounds with a predominant interaction within the pathway were created, which were then used to predict the interaction of compounds not included in the clustering analysis.
