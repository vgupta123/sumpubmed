with respect to feature selection our method provides a fast and intuitive alternative to global optimization strategies with comparable performance.
we present a comprehensive work-flow tailored for analyzing complex data including data from multi-factorial studies.
the developed approach aims at revealing effects caused by a distinct combination of experimental factors, in our case genotype and diet.
classification based on the features selected using our approach performs similar to classifications based on more complex feature selection methods.
the combination of anova and redundancy exploitation allows for identification of biomarker candidates in multi-dimensional maldi-tof ms profiling studies with complex experimental design.
exploitation of redundancy enables the visualization of peptide correlation and provides a natural way of feature selection for classification and prediction.
