the chloroplast stromal ridge complex consisting of psac-psad-psae plays an important role in plant photosynthesis, which has been a subject of many studies.
secondly, this study compared the stromal ridge complex in rice with that in other organisms.
electrostatic potentials surfaces and x-ray structural analysis strongly suggested the stromal ridge complex in other organisms adopted a similar and general recognition mechanism.
these results together provided structure basis and dynamics behavior to understand recognition and assembly of the stromal ridge complex in rice.

rice  is one of the most important cereal crops in the world and its yield is closely related to the photosynthesis efficiency.
supportively, electrostatic potentials surfaces of ospsad exhibited electrostatic attraction helped to stabilize the residue pairs r19-e <dig> and d47-k <dig>  in particular, the importance of r <dig> was further verified by two 500 ns cg-md simulations.
here, we present the interaction features of ospsac and ospsad by molecular dynamics simulations and bioinformatics.
till now, the recognition mechanism between psac and psad in rice is still not fully understood.
significantly, important hydrogen bonds were observed in residue pairs r19-e <dig>  d47-k <dig>  r53-e <dig>  y81-r <dig>  y81-r <dig> and l26-v <dig>  free energy calculations suggested two salt bridges r19-e <dig> and d47-k <dig> were essential to maintain the ospsac-ospsad interaction.
