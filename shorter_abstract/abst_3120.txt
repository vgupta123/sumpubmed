to examine whether egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in caenorhabditis elegans , we generated egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp that are targeted against ngfp-lacz and mtgfp mrna, respectively.
egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in c. elegans.
a subset of egss was randomly chosen for screening in the c. elegans strain n <dig>  about 6% of these egss induced abnormal phenotypes such as p <dig> slow postembryonic growth, p <dig> larval arrest, p <dig> larval lethality and p <dig> sterility.
we further generated an egs library that contains a randomized antisense domain of trna-derived egs .
these observations are potentially of great importance to further our understanding and use of c. elegans genomics.
of these, egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> caused the greatest phenotype changes, and their target mrnas were identified as zk <dig>  mrna and lin- <dig> mrna, respectively.
examination of the composition of the egs library showed that there was no obvious bias in the cloning of certain egss.
the egs library is a research tool for reverse genetic screening in c. elegans.
consequently, the expression levels of ngfp-lacz and mtgfp were affected by egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, respectively.
these egss were introduced, both separately and together, into the c. elegans strain pd <dig>  which contains ngfp-lacz and mtgfp.
