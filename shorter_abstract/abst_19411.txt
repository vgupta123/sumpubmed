the development of software tools capable of integrating data from different sources and to provide flexible methods to reconstruct, represent and analyze topological networks is an active field of research in bioinformatics.
in the data tier, an in-house database stores genomics information, protein-protein interactions, protein-dna interactions, gene ontology and metabolic pathways.
in the middle tier, a global network is created at server startup, representing the whole data on bioentities and their relationships retrieved from the database.
the client tier is a cytoscape plugin, which manages user input, communication with the web service, visualization and analysis of the resulting network.
graph-based biological networks models capture the topology of the functional relationships between molecular entities such as gene, protein and small compounds and provide a suitable framework for integrating and analyzing omics-data.
the client application includes network analysis tools and interactive network expansion capabilities.
