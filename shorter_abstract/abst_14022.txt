sequence analysis aims to identify biologically relevant signals against a backdrop of functionally meaningless variation.
using a specific case of studying biased regions as an example, we have demonstrated that the construction of application-specific background models is both necessary and feasible in a challenging sequence analysis situation.
traditional markov-chains and application-specific regression models are compared using the example of predicting runs of single amino acids, a particularly simple class of biased regions.
increasingly, it is recognized that the quality of the background model directly affects the performance of analyses.
considering different reference sets, we show how the question examined actually defines what constitutes the 'background'.
although performing well in the analysis of globular protein domains, these models break down in regions of stronger compositional bias or low complexity.
while these regions are typically filtered, there is increasing anecdotal evidence of functional roles.
this motivates an exploration of more complex sequence models and application-specific approaches for the investigation of biased regions.
results can thus be highly sensitive to the choice of appropriate model training sets.
we show how the significance of unusual observations can be computed for such empirical models.
the power of a dedicated model in the detection of biologically interesting signals is then demonstrated in an analysis identifying the unexpected enrichment of contiguous leucine-repeats in signal-peptides.
