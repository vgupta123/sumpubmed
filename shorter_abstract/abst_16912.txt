bacteria within the genus photorhabdus maintain mutualistic symbioses with nematodes in complicated lifecycles that also involves insect pathogenic phases.
these clusters produce a range of bioactive small molecules that support the pathogenic phase of the integral relationship that photorhabdus maintain with nematodes.
intriguingly, these bacteria are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters that produce compounds with diverse biological activities.
by then conducting genomic comparisons across the genus, we show that there are several highly conserved biosynthetic gene clusters.
