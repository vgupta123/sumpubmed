crosshybdetector is a software package aimed at the identification of cross-hybridization events occurred during individual array hybridization, by using the probe sequences and the array intensity values.
this problem can dramatically affect the data quality and cause false positive/false negative results.
as output, the software provides the user with a list of array spots potentially 'corrupted' and their associated p-values calculated by monte carlo simulations.
graphical plots are also generated, which provide a visual and global overview of the quality of the microarray experiment with respect to cross-hybridization issues.
