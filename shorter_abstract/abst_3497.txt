an xml schema was designed to extract clinical information from eprs.
the aim of this study was to establish and validate a method for the extraction of small animal patient records from a veterinary pms that could potentially be used across multiple systems.
the schema was tested and validated in a test system, and was then tested in a real small animal practice where data was extracted for  <dig> weeks.
all  <dig> fields encoded by the xml schema, from all of the records in the test system, were extracted with 100Â % accuracy.
this is the first time a method for data extraction from eprs in veterinary practice using an xml schema has been reported in the united kingdom.
the use of real patient data gives the potential to generate research that can readily be applied to clinical practice.
