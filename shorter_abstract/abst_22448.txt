in both cases, hallucigeniids and luolishaniids are found to be extinct radiative stem group panarthropods, in contrast to previous analyses supporting a position of hallucigeniids as part of total-group onychophora.
disparity analyses suggest that luolishaniids, hallucigeniids and total-group onychophora each occupy a distinct region of morphospace.
based on a critical reappraisal of character coding in lobopodians and using bayesian and parsimony-based tree searches, two alternative scenarios for early panarthropod evolution are retrieved.
although the morphological diversity that this group encompasses likely illustrates the importance of niche diversification in the early radiation of panarthropods, the ecology of lobopodians remains poorly characterized.
this species possesses two long pairs and four shorter pairs of elongate spinose lobopods at the front, each bearing two slender claws, and three pairs of stout lobopods bearing single, strong, hook-like anterior-facing claws at the back.
the trunk is remarkably bare, widening rearwards, and, at the front, extends beyond the first pair of lobopods into a small “head” bearing a pair of visual organs and a short proboscis with numerous teeth.
a bayesian approach to cladistics supports the view that a semi-sessile, suspension-feeding lifestyle characterized the origin and rise of panarthropoda from cycloneuralian body plans.
our bayesian topology finds luolishaniids and hallucigeniids to form two successive clades at the base of panarthropoda.
