borealin, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, shows increased expression during g2/m phases and is involved in targeting the complex to the centromere and the spindle midzone, where it ensures proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.
incenp-containing complexes from cells in s phase are enriched in the phosphorylated form suggesting that phosphorylation may encourage entry of borealin into the chromosomal passenger complex.
dephosphorylation of borealin occurs as cells exit mitosis.
here, we show that borealin is phosphorylated during mitosis in human cells.
the main role of the chromosomal passenger complex is to ensure that aurora b kinase is properly localized and activated before and during mitosis.
suppression of phosphorylation during interphase is ensured by a labile protein, possibly a cell cycle regulated phosphatase.
although aurora b kinase is found in complexes that contain borealin, it is not required for the mitotic phosphorylation of borealin.
borealin has a consensus cdk <dig> phosphorylation site, threonine  <dig> and can be phosphorylated by aurora b kinase at serine  <dig> in vitro.
neither residue s <dig>  t <dig> nor phosphorylation of borealin by aurora b kinase is required to generate the mitotic, shifted form of borealin.
mutation of t <dig> or s <dig> of borealin to alanine does not alter the electrophoretic mobility shift of borealin.
