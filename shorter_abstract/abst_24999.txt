potential novel yellow pigments accumulated constantly at the late stage of the fed-batch culture, which resulted in a shift in pigment characteristics so that yellow pigments became the dominant pigments.

the high yield of monascus mycelia up to  <dig>  g/l dry cell weight , which was achieved by fed-batch fermentation with the feeding medium containing c, n, p and trace elements, was four times higher than that of conventional batch culture.
using high cell density fermentation of monascus spp.
but the total pigment production decreased by  <dig>  %, which suggested non-coupled growth.
citrinin production was extremely low and independent of feeding ingredients.
for the first time, it reported the pigment productivity and characteristics shifting in high cell density culture of monascus.
this study provided a suitable fermentation strategy to produce functional monascus mycelia with a high proportion of yellow pigments in high cell density culture.
monascus mycelia and pigments are promising sources of food and medicine with their potential pharmaceutical values and health-improving functions.
in this study, the characteristics and productivity shifting of pigments in high cell density culture of monascus anka gim  <dig>  were investigated.
