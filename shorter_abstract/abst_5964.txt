we describe novel features of parcels , a set of widely distributed repeat protein domains and coding sequences that were likely acquired through hgt by diverse unicellular microbes, further mobilized and diversified within genomes, and co-opted for expression in the membrane proteome of some taxa.
it appears sporadically in unicellular microbes from disparate bacterial and eucaryotic clades, representing diverse lifestyles and ecological niches that include host parasitic, marine and extreme environments.
tracts of the repeats predict a malleable configuration of recurring domains, with conserved hydrophobic residues forming an amphipathic secondary structure in which hydrophilic residues endow extensive sequence variation.
dna sequences encoding the tandem domains display dyad symmetry.
we demonstrate expressed variants among surface lipoproteins that distinguish closely related animal pathogens belonging to a subgroup of the mollicutes.
repeat proteins confer distinctive surface phenotypes to many unicellular organisms, including those with minimal genomes such as the wall-less bacterial monoderms, mollicutes.
