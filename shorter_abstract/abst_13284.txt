high throughput methodologies such as microarrays, mass spectrometry and plate-based small molecule screens are increasingly used to facilitate discoveries from gene function to drug candidate identification.
this approach includes a quality control step and facilitates cross-experiment comparisons that decrease the false non-discovery rates, while maintaining the high accuracy needed to limit false positives in first-pass screening.
results from simulation show an improvement in both accuracy and false non-discovery rate over a range of population parameters  and a modest but significant  improvement in area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of  <dig>  for mipheno vs  <dig>  for a group-based statistic .
results demonstrate mipheno offers substantial benefit in improving the ability to detect putative mutant phenotypes from post-hoc analysis of large data sets.
