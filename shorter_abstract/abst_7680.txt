px domains have specialized protein structures involved in binding of phosphoinositides .
through binding to the various pis px domains provide site-specific membrane signals to modulate the intracellular localisation and biological activity of effector proteins.
all px domains contain a canonical core structure with main differences exhibited within the loop regions forming the phosphoinositide binding pockets.
we now report two new structures of pi3k-c2α px domain that crystallised in a p <dig> space group.
the two structures, refined to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, exhibit significantly different conformations of the phosphoinositide-binding loops.
several crystal structures of these domains are now available from a variety of proteins.
