a comparative genomic approach was used to identify large sequence polymorphisms among m. avium subspecies obtained from a variety of host animals.
genome diversity in m. avium subspecies appears to be mediated by large sequence polymorphisms that are commonly associated with mobile genetic elements.
dna microarrays were used as a platform for comparing mycobacterial isolates with the sequenced bovine isolate m. avium subsp.
silvaticum isolates were observed to have a hybridization profile very similar to yet distinguishable from m. avium subsp.
subspecies and host adapted isolates of m. avium were distinguishable by the presence or absence of specific polymorphisms.
multiple large polymorphic regions were found in the genomes of map isolates obtained from sheep.
mycobacterium avium  subspecies vary widely in both pathogenicity and host specificity, but the genetic features contributing to this diversity remain unclear.
