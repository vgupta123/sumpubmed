in this paper, we demonstrate that in the 1d domain, highly nonlinear reaction dynamics given by hill function may also have dramatic change when discretization size is smaller than a critical value.
the three proposed methods could correctly  simulate hill function dynamics in the microscopic rdme system.

previous studies have discovered that for the rdme, when discretization size approaches zero, reaction time for bimolecular reactions in high dimensional domains tends to infinity.
our analysis reveals that the switch-like hill dynamics reduces to a linear function of discretization size when the discretization size is small enough.
moreover, we discuss methods to avoid this problem: smoothing over space, fixed length smoothing over space and a hybrid method.
stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems presents great challenges for spatiotemporal biological modeling and simulation.
one widely used framework for stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems is reaction diffusion master equation .
