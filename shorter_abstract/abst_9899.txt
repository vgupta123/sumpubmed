the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in all streptococci.
to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected to csrna-specific northern blot analysis.
genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator.
all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six.
ciarh pleiotropically affects Î²-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms.
post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas  in bacteria is now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence.
five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas.
comparing these genes among each other revealed  <dig> different csrna types.
in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst <dig> introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested.
since ciarh is highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species.
in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system.
