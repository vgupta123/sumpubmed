none of ars <dig> genes were detected in the other type strains of genus ochrobactrum, but sequences homologous with ars <dig> operon were identified in some strains.
although arsh was not required for arsenate resistance, this gene seems to be important to confer high levels of arsenite resistance.
the ars <dig> operon conferred resistance to arsenite and antimonite on e. coli cells, whereas the ars <dig> operon was also responsible for resistance to arsenite and arsenate.
throughout the world, there are several environments contaminated with high amounts of arsenic where many organisms can survive.
the involvement of ars operons in arsenic resistance was confirmed by cloning both of them in an escherichia coli ars-mutant.
a new strategy for bacterial arsenic resistance is described in this work.
two operons involved in arsenic resistance, one giving resistance to arsenite and antimonite and the other giving resistance to arsenate were found in the same bacterial strain.
