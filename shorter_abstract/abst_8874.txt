contrary to the highly conserved domains, several sites with relaxed selective constraints flanking the domains in the mammalian pl <dig> homologs may play roles in enhancing the gene function in a lineage-specific manner.
the eutherian ddx3x/ddx3y in the x/y-added region originated from the translocation of the ancient pl <dig> ortholog on the ancestral autosome, whereas the eutherian pl <dig> was retroposed from ddx3x.
the evolution of pl <dig> homologs was under positive selection and the elevated ka/ks ratios were observed in the eutherian lineages for ddx3y but not pl <dig> and ddx3x, suggesting relaxed selective constraints on ddx3y.
the autosomal homologs were also derived from ddx3x, whereas the additional x-homologs were derived from ddx3y.
in addition to the functional pl10/ddx3x/ddx3y, conserved homologous regions on the autosomes and x chromosome are present.
the lineage-specific expression patterns and various genomic structures and locations of pl <dig> homologs indicate these homologs have an interesting evolutionary history.
in rodents, besides ddx3x and ddx3y, we found not only pl <dig> but another autosomal homologous region, both of which also originated from the ddx3x retroposition.
pl <dig> homologs exist in a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast, plants to animals.
they share a dead motif and belong to the dead-box polypeptide  <dig>  subfamily with a major role in rna metabolism.
