the diversity of sporulation and competence genes across the bacilli was unexpected based on previous studies of the b. subtilis model alone.
the aquatic bacilli are defined here for the first time as a group through the phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> genes that comprise the core genome.
using the pan-genome from the sequenced bacillus, we identified functional differences, such as carbohydrate utilization and genes involved in signal transduction, which distinguished the taxonomic groups.
we also assessed the genetic architecture of the defining traits of bacillus, such as sporulation and competence, and showed that less than one third of the b. subtilis genes are conserved across other bacilli.
the challenge of uncovering the novelties and variations among genes of the non-subtilis groups still remains.
by distinguishing between core and pan-genome, we determined the evolutionary and functional relationships of known bacillus.
using a core genome, we were able to determine the phylogeny of known bacilli, including aquatic strains whose position in the phylogenetic tree could not be unambiguously determined in the past.
