the lack of viability of tpk <dig> tpk <dig> tpk <dig> triple mutants may be suppressed by mutations such as yak <dig> or msn2/msn <dig>  to investigate the requirement for pka in glucose control of gene expression, we have compared the effects of glucose on global transcription in a wild-type strain and in two strains devoid of pka activity, tpk <dig> tpk <dig> tpk <dig> yak <dig> and tpk <dig> tpk <dig> tpk <dig> msn <dig> msn <dig>
we found that, in cells grown in gluconeogenic conditions, expression of a small number of genes, mainly connected with the response to stress, is reduced in the strains lacking pka.
we show also that, for a number of genes controlled by glucose through a pka-dependent pathway, the changes in mrna levels are transient.
in s. cerevisiae three genes, tpk <dig>  tpk <dig>  and tpk <dig>  encode catalytic subunits of pka.
in s. cerevisiae, the transcriptional responses to glucose are triggered by a variety of pathways, alone or in combination, in which pka is often involved.
redundant signalling pathways confer a greater robustness to the response to glucose, while cooperative pathways provide a greater flexibility.
on the other hand, among genes that do not respond to glucose in the absence of pka, some give a full response to increased camp levels, even in the absence of glucose, while others appear to require the cooperation of different signalling pathways.
