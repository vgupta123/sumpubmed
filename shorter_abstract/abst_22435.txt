we tested one salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and three salmonella typhi vaccine strains and found that all strains survived equally well when incubated in either ensure® or bicarbonate.
because ingestion of protein can rapidly buffer stomach ph, we examined the possibility that the protein-rich ensure® nutrition shakes would be effective alternatives to bicarbonate.
our data show that a protein-rich drink such as ensure® nutrition shakes can serve as an alternative to bicarbonate for reducing gastric ph prior to administration of a live salmonella vaccine.
in a low gastric ph mouse model, ensure® worked as well or better than bicarbonate to enhance survival through the intestinal tract, although neither agent enhanced the survival of the s. typhi test strain possessing a rpos mutation.

one drawback of this approach, from the perspective of the clinical trial volunteer, is that the taste of a bicarbonate-based acid neutralization system can be unpleasant.
