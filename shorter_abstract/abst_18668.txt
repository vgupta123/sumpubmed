this novel temporal analysis is more informative and powerful than the classical static pathway analysis in that:  it captures the interconnections between signaling pathways or functional modules and demonstrates the even higher level organization of molecular biological systems;  it describes the temporal perturbation patterns of each pathway or module and their dynamic roles in osteoblast differentiation.
bmp <dig> mediated osteoblast differentiation plays a key role in skeletal development and bone disease.
to better characterize the signaling pathways responsive to bmp <dig>  we conducted a time series microarray study to track bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.
in this work, we carried out a microarray-based temporal regulatory pathway analysis of bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization using gage method.
these temporal data were analyzed using a customized gene set analysis approach to identify temporally coherent sets of genes that act downstream of bmp <dig>  our analysis identified bmp <dig> regulation of previously reported pathways, such as the tgf-beta pathway.
