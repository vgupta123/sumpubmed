the only other microsporidian est project is from a. locustae, and serves as a basis for comparison with e. aedis.
the spore transcriptomes of a. locustae and e. aedis were compared and the numbers of unique transcripts that belong to each cog  category differ by at most 5%.
however, e. aedis seems to lack the multi-gene transcripts present in a. locustae and e. cuniculi.
although e. aedis and a. locustae are distantly related, have very disparate life cycles and contain genomes estimated to be vastly different sizes, their patterns of transcription are similar.
the architecture of the ancestral microsporidian genome is unknown, but the presence of genes in e. aedis that have not been found in other microsporidia suggests that extreme genome reduction and compaction is lineage specific and not typical of all microsporidia.
microsporidian genomes range in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp, but almost all of our knowledge comes from species that have small genomes .
we have conducted an est survey of the mosquito parasite edhazardia aedis, which has an estimated genome size several times that of more well-studied species.
