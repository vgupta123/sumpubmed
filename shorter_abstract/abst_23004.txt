we evaluated core&peel on five ppi networks of large size and one of medium size from both yeast and homo sapiens, comparing its performance against those of ten state-of-the-art methods.
we concentrate here on the specific task of predicting protein complexes  in large protein-protein interaction networks .
we demonstrate that core&peel consistently outperforms the ten competitors in its ability to identify known protein complexes and in the functional coherence of its predictions.
we present a new fast algorithm for clustering large sparse networks: core&peel, which runs essentially in time and storage om+n) for a network g of n nodes and m arcs, where a is the arboricity of g .
