we knocked out selected new genes and assayed for the presence of nodulation phenotypes and/or nodule-specific expression.
using this approach, we identified many genes known to be involved in nodulation or nitrogen fixation, as well as several new candidate genes.
we have used the genomic data in the integrated microbial genomes system of the department of energyâ€™s joint genome institute to make predictions about rhizobial open reading frames that play a role in nodulation of host plants.
a strain carrying an insertion mutation in smc <dig> is not defective in the symbiosis with host plants, but in contrast to expectations, this mutant strain is able to out-compete the s. meliloti  <dig> wild type strain for nodule occupancy in co-inoculation experiments.
based on the analysis of orfs identified in this study, we conclude that this comparative genomics approach can identify rhizobial genes involved in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with host plants, although none of the newly identified genes were found to be essential for this process.
one of these genes, smc <dig>  is strongly expressed by bacterial cells within host plant nodules, but is expressed minimally by free-living bacterial cells.
