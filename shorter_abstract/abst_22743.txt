in this paper we explore a number of factors which can contribute to poor rna secondary structure prediction quality.
however, current approaches to rna secondary structure modelling produce predictions with a high variance in predictive accuracy, and we have little quantifiable knowledge about the reasons for these variances.
our predictive accuracy improves on the ppfold reliability score.
these results often rely on rna secondary structure predictions.
however, there is still variability unaccounted for, which we therefore suggest comes from the rna secondary structure predictive model itself.
furthermore, we define two new measures to quantify uncertainty in alignment-based structure predictions.
the other measure considers the information entropy for scfgs over a space of input alignments.
we establish a quantified relationship between alignment quality and loss of accuracy.
