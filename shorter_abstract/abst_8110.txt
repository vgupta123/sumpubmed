reduced production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> was detected in mog-stimulated spleen cultures in the tox- and tsst-1+ infected groups, respectively.
three days later, the animals were subjected to eae induction by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein .
these results indicated that both strains attenuated clinical eae manifestations, but only tsst- <dig> clearly decreased cns inflammation.
the infections also modulated cytokine production in the spleen and cns.
cytokines and foxp3+ regulatory t cells in the brain were evaluated during the acute disease phase.
cytokines and foxp3+ regulatory t cells in the spleen and histopathological analysis of the cns were assessed during the chronic stage.
previous infection with both strains similarly decreased the clinical score; however, only the tsst-1+ strain clearly diminished inflammation in the cns.
bacterial superantigens are potent t cell activators that can activate t cells with specificity for antigens of the central nervous system .
the weight variation, disease incidence and clinical score were recorded daily.
cns infiltrating cell cultures from previously infected mice produced less il- <dig> in response to mog and more ifn-γ in response to s. aureus stimulation.
in this study, we compared the effect of two s. aureus strains on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  development.
c57bl/ <dig> female mice were infected with s. aureus atcc  <dig>  which produces toxic shock syndrome toxin  <dig>  or s. aureus atcc  <dig>  which does not produce toxins .
in s. aureus stimulated cultures, there was an increased production of ifn-γ and il- <dig> in both infected groups and an increased level of il- <dig> in the tsst-1+ group.
