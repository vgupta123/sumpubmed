by limiting the interaction search space firstly to cis-trans and then cis-cis snp pairs where both snps had an independent effect on the expression of the most variable transcripts in the liver and brain, we greatly reduced the size of the search space.
within the cis-trans search space we discovered three transcripts with significant epistasis.
accordingly, we redefined the search space to detect cis-cis interactions, where a cis-snp was located within 10Â mb of the target transcript.
the results of this show evidence for the epistatic regulation of  <dig> transcripts across the tissues studied.
surprisingly, all interacting snp pairs were located nearby each other on the chromosome .
this pattern of epistasis is consistent with mediation via long-range chromatin structures rather than the binding of transcription factors in trans.
despite their proximity, the interacting snps were outside the range of linkage disequilibrium , which was absent between the pairs .
epistasis  among snps governing gene expression is likely to arise within transcriptional networks.
in the context of gene expression and its regulation, our analysis indicates that the study of cis-cis or local epistatic interactions may have a more important role than interchromosomal interactions.
three transcripts, namely, hla-g, psors1c <dig> and hla-drb <dig> share common regulatory snps in the pre-frontal cortex and their expression is significantly correlated.
