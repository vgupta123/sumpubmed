due to computational complexity and limited knowledge of the structure-function interplay, heuristic methods have to be used.
additional tests demonstrated that each module contributes to the overall performance in a statistically significant manner.
we have developed transcent, a computational enzyme design method supporting the transfer of active sites from one enzyme to an alternative scaffold.
these are 1) protein stability, 2) ligand binding, 3) pka values of active site residues, and 4) structural features of the active site.
as a first application, we present and discuss models for the transfer of active sites in enzymes sharing the frequently encountered triosephosphate isomerase fold.
a recapitulation test on native enzymes showed that transcent proposes active sites that resemble the native enzyme more than those generated by rosettadesign alone.
the contribution of modules to the performance of transcent was evaluated by means of a recapitulation test.
computational enzyme design is far from being applicable for the general case.
in an optimization process, it balances requirements originating from four constraints.
