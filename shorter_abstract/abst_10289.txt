using our methodology we successfully identified 100% of our positive controls and showed that there is a strong correlation between the data from our alternative splicing mip  assay and quantitative pcr.
a sensitive, high-throughput method for monitoring pre-mrna splicing on a genomic scale is needed to understand the spectrum of alternatively spliced mrna in human cells.
we adapted molecular inversion probes , a padlock-probe based technology, for the multiplexed capture and quantitation of individual splice events in human tissues.
the asmip assay provides a sensitive, accurate and multiplexed means for measuring pre-mrna splicing.
individual mip capture probes can be quantified using either dna microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, which permits independent assessment of each spliced junction.
