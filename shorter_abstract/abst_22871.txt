after assessing the quality of the corpus for two language pairs  we use the moses package to train a statistical machine translation model that outperforms previous models for automatic translation of biomedical text.
these sets can successfully be applied to train statistical machine translation models.
we show how a large-sized parallel corpus can automatically be obtained for the biomedical domain, using the medline database.
most of the institutional and research information in the biomedical domain is available in the form of english text.
however, the lack of adequate specialized corpora needed to train statistical models currently limits the quality of automatic translations in the biomedical domain.
while further progress should be made by incorporating out-of-domain corpora and domain-specific lexicons, we believe that this work improves the automatic translation of biomedical texts.
recent progress in machine translation suggests that this technique could help make english texts accessible to speakers of other languages.
the corpus generated in this work comprises article titles obtained from medline and abstract text automatically retrieved from journal websites, which substantially extends the corpora used in previous work.
we have built translation data sets in the biomedical domain that can easily be extended to other languages available in medline.

even in countries where english is an official language, such as the united states, language can be a barrier for accessing biomedical information for non-native speakers.
