we propose testing groups of go terms rather than individual terms, to increase statistical power, reduce dependence between tests and improve the interpretation of results.
gene ontology  terms are often used to assess the results of microarray experiments.
the most common way to do this is to perform fisher's exact tests to find go terms which are over-represented amongst the genes declared to be differentially expressed in the analysis of the microarray experiment.
