the corpus is unique in the domain in combining these annotation types for a single set of sentences, and in the level of detail of the relationship annotation.
we introduce a corpus targeted at protein, gene, and rna relationships which serves as a resource for the development of information extraction systems and their components such as parsers and domain analyzers.
we describe an annotation scheme capturing named entities and their relationships along with a dependency analysis of sentence syntax.
lately, there has been a great interest in the application of information extraction methods to the biomedical domain, in particular, to the extraction of relationships of genes, proteins, and rna from scientific publications.
the corpus will be maintained and further developed with a current version being available at .
