sporadic cases differed from outbreak cases by a small number of snps, although their close relationship to outbreak cases may represent an unidentified common food source that may warrant further public health follow up.
we performed wgs on  <dig> stm isolates of a single, endemic mlva type associated with two epidemiologically independent, food-borne outbreaks along with sporadic cases in new south wales, australia, during  <dig>  genomes of case and environmental isolates were sequenced using hiseq  and the genetic distance between them was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis.
the wgs analysis supported epidemiological evidence and genomes of within-outbreak isolates were nearly identical.
our findings support the translation of wgs into public health laboratory surveillance of salmonellosis.
subtyping of stm remains critical to outbreak investigation, yet current techniques  may provide insufficient discrimination.
whole genome sequencing  offers potentially greater discriminatory power to support infectious disease surveillance.
