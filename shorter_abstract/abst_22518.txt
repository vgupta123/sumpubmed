induction of the endogenous pi3k-akt pathway in cho cells , in t-cells  or in neurons  potentiates notch-dependent responses.
since physiological levels of intracellular notch are often low, coincidence with pi3k-activation may be crucial for induction of notch-dependent responses.
we show that cellular responsiveness to notch signals depends on the activity of the pi3k-akt pathway in cells as diverse as cho cells, primary t-cells and hippocampal neurons.
we propose that the pi3k-akt pathway exerts its influence on notch primarily via inhibition of gsk3-beta, a kinase known to phosphorylate and regulate notch signals.
the pi3k-akt pathway is a similarly conserved signalling pathway which regulates processes such as differentiation, proliferation and survival.
the pi3k-akt pathway acts as a "gain control" for notch signal responses.
