brucella contains two separate urease gene clusters, ure <dig> and ure <dig>  although only ure <dig> codes for an active urease, ure <dig> is also transcribed, but its contribution to brucella biology is unknown.
uret and niko mutants were constructed and analyzed for urease activity and acid resistance.
the niko mutant had decreased urease activity and acid resistance at all urea concentrations tested, and this phenotype could be reverted by the addition of nickel to the growth medium.
based on these results, we concluded that the operon ure <dig> codes for an acid-activated urea transporter and a nickel transporter necessary for the maximal activity of the urease whose structural subunits are encoded exclusively by the genes in the ure <dig> operon.
a non-polar uret mutant was unaffected in urease activity at neutral ph but showed a significantly decreased activity at acidic ph.
it also showed a decreased survival rate to ph  <dig> at low concentration of urea when compared to the wild type.
