chip-seq analysis revealed that active centromeres containing cenh <dig> consist of the satellite pbv and the ty3-gypsy retrotransposon beetle <dig>  while heterochromatin marked by h3k9me <dig> exhibits heterogeneity in repeat composition.
in members of the section beta within the genus beta, immunostaining using the cenh <dig> antibody was successful, indicating that orthologous cenh <dig> proteins are present in closely related species within this section.
the identification of repetitive genome portions by chip-seq experiments complemented the sugar beet reference sequence by providing insights into the repeat composition of poorly characterized cenh3-chromatin and h3k9me2-heterochromatin.
therefore, to fill these gaps and to gain information about the repeat composition of centromeres and heterochromatic regions, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  using antibodies against the centromere-specific histone h <dig> variant of sugar beet  and the heterochromatic mark of dimethylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> .
h3k9me <dig> was mainly associated with the satellite family pev, the ty1-copia retrotransposon family cotzilla and the dna transposon superfamily of the en/spm type.
therefore, our work provides the basis for future research and application concerning the sugar beet centromere and repeat-rich heterochromatic regions characterized by the presence of h3k9me <dig>
from the total genome size of 758 mb, only 567 mb were incorporated in the recently published genome sequence, due to the fact that regions with high repetitive dna contents  are only partially included.
sugar beet  is an important crop of temperate climate zones, which provides nearly 30 % of the world’s annual sugar needs.
