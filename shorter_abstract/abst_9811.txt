compared with three other dipteran species, gene expansion in culex mainly occurred in the cce and p <dig> families, where the genes of Î±-esterases, juvenile hormone esterases, and cyp <dig> of the cyp <dig> subfamily showed the most pronounced expansion on the genome.
a total of  <dig> genes showed different expression levels between a parathion-resistant and a susceptible strain.
knowledge of complete gene expression information is very important for the exploration of the functions of genes involved in specific biological processes.
c. p. quinquefasciatus has the largest number of predicted protein-coding genes, which partially results from the expansion of three detoxification gene families: cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , glutathione s-transferases , and carboxyl/cholinesterases .
the results of the present study provide new insights into the functions and evolution of three detoxification gene families in mosquitoes and comprehensive transcriptomic resources for c. p. quinquefasciatus, which will facilitate the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying the different biological characteristics of the three major mosquito vectors.
the genomes of three major mosquito vectors of human diseases, anopheles gambiae, aedes aegypti, and culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, have been previously sequenced.
in the present study, the three detoxification gene families of c. p. quinquefasciatus were analyzed for phylogenetic classification and compared with those of three other dipteran insects.
gene expression during various developmental stages and the differential expression responsible for parathion resistance were profiled using the digital gene expression  technique.
for the five dge libraries,  <dig> - <dig>  million raw tags were generated and mapped to  <dig> reference genes.
a total of  <dig> detoxification genes were found in c. p. quinquefasciatus, including  <dig> cce,  <dig> p <dig>  and  <dig> cytosolic gst genes.
among  <dig> detoxification genes,  <dig>  were detected for expression in at least one dge library.
fifteen detoxification genes, including  <dig> cces,  <dig> gsts, and  <dig> p450s, were expressed at higher levels in the resistant strain.
aegypti, which have large amounts of gene expression data, c. p. quinquefasciatus has limited transcriptomic resources.
