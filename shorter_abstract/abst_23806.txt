bipartite graphs can be useful for representing relationships across pairs of disparate data types, with the interpretation of these relationships accomplished through an enumeration of maximal bicliques.
in this paper, a powerful new algorithm is described that produces all maximal bicliques in a bipartite graph.
an iterative selection of vertices for consideration based on non-decreasing common neighborhood sizes boosts efficiency and leads to more balanced recursion trees.
this practical computational resource is adaptable to almost any applications environment in which bipartite graphs can be used to model relationships between pairs of heterogeneous entities.
experiments are performed on both random graphs and graphs constructed from functional genomics data.
a robust implementation has been incorporated into geneweaver, an online tool for integrating and analyzing functional genomics experiments, available at
unlike most previous approaches, the new method neither places undue restrictions on its input nor inflates the problem size.
efficiency is achieved through an innovative exploitation of bipartite graph structure, and through computational reductions that rapidly eliminate non-maximal candidates from the search space.
the enormous increase in scalability it provides empowers users to study complex and previously unassailable gene-set associations between genes and their biological functions in a hierarchical fashion and on a genome-wide scale.
