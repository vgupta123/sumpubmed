poly i:c also increased il- <dig> and bfgf production, and anti-il- <dig> antibodies significantly inhibited the migration caused by poly i:c. human recombinant il- <dig> also accelerated collective hacat cell migration.
an immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  also revealed that poly i:c decreased e-cadherin protein levels and increased vimentin protein levels, and anti-il- <dig> antibody reversed this effect.
the present study showed that poly i:c significantly accelerated collective hacat cell migration in a scratch assay.
our findings demonstrated that poly i:c accelerated collective hacat cell migration via autocrine/paracrine secretions of il- <dig> and the subsequent incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition .
however, the role of innate immunity in wound healing is thus far unknown.
the aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the link between innate immunity and human wound healing, particularly in re-epithelialization.
