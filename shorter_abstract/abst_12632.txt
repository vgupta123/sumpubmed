bioimage classification is a fundamental problem for many important biological studies that require accurate cell phenotype recognition, subcellular localization, and histopathological classification.
in this paper, we present a new bioimage classification method that can be generally applicable to a wide variety of classification problems.
we evaluate our method on eight different bioimage classification tasks using the publicly available iicbu  <dig> database.
we present a general bioimage classification method, which comprises a highly descriptive visual feature representation and a learning-based discriminative feature transformation algorithm.
we also find that sdt outperforms the well-known dimension reduction techniques, with for example  <dig>  to 13% improvement over linear discriminant analysis.
we also design a novel subcategory discriminant transform  algorithm to further enhance the discriminative power of descriptors by learning convolution kernels to reduce the within-class variation and increase the between-class difference.
our method demonstrates improved classification accuracy  on six tasks when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
