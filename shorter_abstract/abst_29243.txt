the csrbh approach outperformed all other methods and attained  <dig>  carp to human functional homolog relationships for  <dig>  contiguous sequences.
finally, re-analyses of cold carp microarray data identified carp genes up-regulated in response to low temperatures in heart and muscle.
we show that csrbh functional homologs relationships and re-analyses of gene expression data can be combined in a non-model species to predict genes of biological interest before a genome sequence is fully available.
for example, some species increase their vascular network to minimise the effects of reduced oxygen diffusion and increased blood viscosity associated with low temperatures.
the total number of up-regulated differentially expressed genes was  <dig> and  <dig> of them were putatively angiogenic.
in this work, carp sequences were collected and built into contigs.
