we have found  <dig> different annotated young domains, totalling  <dig> domain occurrences, which represent about  <dig> % of all human domains.
to gain insights into the impact of recently emerged domains in protein evolution we have identified all human young protein domains that have emerged in approximately the past  <dig> million years.
the emergence of novel domains is related to protein functional diversification and adaptation.
but currently little is known about how novel domains arise and how they subsequently evolve.
proteins are composed of a combination of discrete, well-defined, sequence domains, associated with specific functions that have arisen at different times during evolutionary history.
young domains are preferentially located at the n-terminus of the protein, indicating that, at least in vertebrates, novel functional sequences often emerge there.
furthermore, young domains show significantly higher non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates than older domains using human and mouse orthologous sequence comparisons.
we show that many proteins are made of domains of different age, and that the fastest evolving parts correspond to the domains that have been acquired more recently.
this is also true when we compare young and old domains located in the same protein, suggesting that recently arisen domains tend to evolve in a less constrained manner than older domains.
