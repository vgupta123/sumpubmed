recombinant individuals from the wxby f <dig> population allowed the localisation of maturity date locus to a  <dig> kb region of the peach genome.
a sequence variant in the nac gene ppa008301m was shown to co-segregate with the maturity date locus, suggesting this gene as a candidate controlling ripening time in peach.
aims of this work were the fine mapping and identification of candidate genes for the major maturity date locus previously identified on peach linkage group  <dig>  to improve genetic resolution of the target locus two f <dig> populations derived from the crosses contender x ambra  and pi <dig>  x bounty  were genotyped with the sequenom and 9k illumina peach chip snp platforms, respectively.
maturity date  is a crucial factor for marketing of fresh fruit, especially those with limited shelf-life such as peach : selection of several cultivars with differing md would be advantageous to cover and extend the marketing season.
the second gene was thus examined as a candidate for maturity date.
re-sequencing of ppa008301m, showed an in-frame insertion of  <dig> bp in the last exon that co-segregated with the maturity date locus in both cxa and wxby f <dig> populations.
using two different segregating populations, the map position of the maturity date locus was refined from  <dig>  mb to  <dig> kb.
if confirmed on other genetic materials, this variant may be used for marker-assisted breeding of new cultivars with differing maturity date.
however, this variation did not segregate in the cxa f <dig> population being the cxa f <dig> parent homozygous for the reference allele.
