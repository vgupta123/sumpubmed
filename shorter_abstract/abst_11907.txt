to do so, we collected expression data from tissue samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time prior to rna extraction.
the use of low quality rna samples in whole-genome gene expression profiling remains controversial.
it is unclear if transcript degradation in low quality rna samples occurs uniformly, in which case the effects of degradation can be corrected via data normalization, or whether different transcripts are degraded at different rates, potentially biasing measurements of expression levels.
this concern has rendered the use of low quality rna samples in whole-genome expression profiling problematic.
the rna samples we collected spanned the entire range of rna integrity number  values .
we conclude that in instances in which rin and the effect of interest are not associated, this approach can help recover biologically meaningful signals in data from degraded rna samples.
we sought to quantify the impact of variation in rna quality on estimates of gene expression levels based on rna-seq data.
we observed widespread effects of rna quality on measurements of gene expression levels, as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples.
