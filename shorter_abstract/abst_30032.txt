comparing between platforms, rank analysis of the log ratios of the two reference pools also revealed high correlation .
these data indicate that mirna microarray platforms generated highly reproducible data and can be recommended for the study of changes in mirna expression.
we examined within and between platform reproducibility of four mirna array technologies alongside taqman pcr arrays.
using this probeset as well as all probes that were present on an individual platform, within-platform analyses revealed spearman correlations of > <dig>  for most platforms.
spearman rank correlation and concordance correlation coefficients for mirna arrays against taqman qrt-pcr arrays were similar for all of the technologies.
two distinct pools of reference materials were selected in order to maximize differences in mirna content.
although analysis of micrornas  by dna microarrays is gaining in popularity, these new technologies have not been adequately validated.
filtering for mirna that yielded signal above background revealed  <dig> mirna probes  across all platforms.
