this information is useful in the selection of model organisms for pharmacological experiments.
we found that  <dig> dog gpcr genes are missing in humans while  <dig> human gpcr genes are not part of the dog gpcr repertoire.
we searched the dog genome for non-olfactory gpcrs and obtained  <dig> full-length gpcr gene sequences,  <dig> incomplete sequences and  <dig> pseudogenes.
the repertoire of dog non-olfactory gpcrs is more similar to the repertoire in humans as compared with the one in rodents.
we established relationships between human, dog, rat and mouse gpcrs resolving orthologous pairs and species-specific duplicates.
there is a higher number of orthologous pairs between dog and human that are conserved as compared with either mouse or rat.
an accurate comparison of the gpcr repertoires in dog and human is valuable for the prediction of functional similarities and differences between the species.
the comparison of the dog, human and rodent repertoires revealed several examples of species-specific gene duplications and deletions.
