the type iii secretion system  is an important virulence determinant of gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
our results confirm and extend the previously reported regulation of ttss <dig> and ttss <dig> effectors by invf-sica and ssrb respectively.
it enables the injection of effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells.
we have tested the ability of seven regulatory genes to regulate ten effector genes.
the set of strains constructed for this study can be used to quickly and systematically study the regulation of newly identified effector genes of salmonella enterica.
