we analyzed time-course phosphoproteome data obtained previously by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with the stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture  method.
the construction of a phosphorylation dynamics-based network provides a useful overview of condition-specific intracellular signal transduction using quantitative time-course phosphoproteome data under specific experimental conditions.
however, since the phosphorylation profiles of kinase-substrate pairs on the specific pathway were localized in the dynamics-based network, our method will be a complementary strategy to explore new components of protein signaling pathways in combination with previous methods  of predicting direct kinase-substrate relationships.
this provides the relative phosphorylation activities of digested peptides at each of five time points after stimulating hela cells with epidermal growth factor .
although the phosphorylation patterns of many proteins were drastically changed by the egf stimulation, our results suggest that only egfr signaling transduction was both strongly activated and precisely controlled.
the dynamics-based network was correlated with known signaling pathways in the netpath and phospho.elm databases, and especially with the egf receptor  signaling pathway.
the network was then analyzed using graph theory and compared with five known signal-transduction pathways.
we initially calculated the correlations between the phosphorylation dynamics patterns of every pair of peptides and connected the strongly correlated pairs to construct a network.
