upon recognition of specific avirulence factors the pto kinase activates multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in induction of pathogen defense.
maize plants in which zmpti1a expression was silenced by rna interference  produced pollen with decreased competitive ability.
in contrast, zmpti1a was specifically expressed in pollen and sequestered to the plasma membrane, evidently owing to n-terminal modification by myristoylation and/or s-acylation.
the zmpti1a:gfp fusion protein was not evenly distributed at the pollen plasma membrane but accumulated as an annulus-like structure which co-localized with callose  deposition.
hence, it is hypothesized that pti <dig> kinases from maize act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes associated with callose, however during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.
pollen-sporophyte interactions and pathogen induced hr show certain similarities.
in addition, co-localization of zmpti1a and callose was observed during stages of pollen mitosis i and pollen tube germination.
sequence similarity, expression pattern and cellular localization of zmpti1b suggested that this gene is a putative orthologue of pti <dig> from tomato.
so far, no pti <dig> homologues from monocotyledonous species have been studied.
however, a clear role of pti <dig> in plant pathogen resistance is uncertain.
here we report the identification and molecular analysis of four pti1-like kinases from maize .
zmpti1a from maize is involved in pollen-specific processes during the progamic phase of reproduction, probably in crucial signalling processes associated with regions of callose deposition.
for example, hr has been shown to be associated with cell wall reinforcement through callose deposition.
