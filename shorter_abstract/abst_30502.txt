mirnas-enriched 21-nt srnas were significantly over-expressed in pallas vs. gp only on chromosome 4h.
our study indicates that 23−24-nt srnas may be linked to repressive chromatin modifications and function in genome stability while 20−21-nt srnas may be important for the cultivar specificity.
on chromosome 5h this size of srnas was significantly under-expressed in pallas, so were 22-nt srnas mainly comprising mirnas and repeat-derived srnas.
abundant srnas were mostly generated from 3’ terminal regions of chromosome 1h and 5’ terminal regions of chromosome 5h.
this study provides a novel insight into the mechanism of srna expression and function in barley.
by comparing srnas generated from two barley cultivars, golden promise  and pallas, we identified that the generation of different sizes and types of srnas in barley was locus-, chromosome- and/or cultivar-dependent.
24-nt srnas mostly derived from repeats were evenly distributed in all chromosomes and expressed similarly between gp and pallas.
unlike other sizes of srnas, 24-nt srnas were little conserved in other plant species.
20-nt srnas mainly comprising mirnas and chloroplast-derived srnas were significantly over-expressed in pallas vs. gp on chromosomes 3h and 6h.
