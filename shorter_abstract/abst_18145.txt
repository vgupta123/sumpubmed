two paralogous genes for actb were analyzed in each of both flatfish species.
rpl13a represented non-orthologous genes between both flatfish species.
the congruent results between both species in spite of the drastic differences in larval development suggest that selected housekeeping genes  could be useful in other flatfish species.
the stability of  <dig> potential reference genes was examined during larval development in senegalese sole  and atlantic halibut  to determine the most suitable genes for qrt-pcr analysis.
in addition, two paralogous genes for gapdh were studied in senegalese sole.
genorm and normfinder analyses for expression stability revealed rps <dig>  ubq and eef1a <dig> as the most stable genes in senegalese sole, atlantic halibut and in a combined analysis.
this work suggests rps <dig>  ubq, and eef1a <dig> genes as useful reference genes for accurate normalization in qrt-pcr studies in senegalese sole and atlantic halibut larvae.
due to its importance in aquaculture and as a model for developmental studies, some gene expression studies have focused on the understanding of this process using quantitative real-time pcr  technique.
in all cases, paralogous genes exhibited differences in expression stability.
transcription levels of genes encoding Î²-actin , glyceraldehyde-3p-dehydrogenase , annexin a <dig> , glutathione s-transferase , ornithine decarboxylase , hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase , ubiquitin , elongation factor  <dig> alpha , 18s ribosomal rna, and the ribosomal proteins s <dig>  and l13a  were quantitated.
therefore, adequate reference genes for accurate normalization are required.
however, the finding of paralogous gene copies differentially expressed during development in some hkgs underscores the necessity to identify orthologous genes.
