gene ontology  analysis confirmed that ltβr-nf-κb target genes are predominantly involved in the regulation of immune responses.
the majority of ltβr-regulated genes required the presence of both rela and relb, revealing significant crosstalk between the two nf-κb activation pathways.
lymphotoxin signaling via the lymphotoxin-β receptor  has been implicated in biological processes ranging from development of secondary lymphoid organs, maintenance of spleen architecture, host defense against pathogens, autoimmunity, and lipid homeostasis.
however, other biological processes, such as apoptosis/cell death, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and taxis were also regulated by ltβr signaling.
we describe novel ltβr-responsive genes that were regulated by rela and/or relb.
using microarray analysis, we investigated the transcriptional response downstream of the ltβr in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and its regulation by the rela and relb subunits of nf-κb.
microarray analysis of ltβr-stimulated fibroblasts provided comprehensive insight into the transcriptional response of ltβr signaling and its regulation by the nf-κb family members rela and relb.
moreover, ltβr activation inhibited expression of a key adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ , suggesting that ltβr signaling may interfere with adipogenic differentiation.
