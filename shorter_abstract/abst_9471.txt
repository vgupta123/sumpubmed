heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are diverse components of certain proteoglycans and are known to interact with growth factors as a co-receptor necessary to induce signalling and growth factor activity.
rhpln.d <dig> demonstrated binding to rhfgf- <dig> with an apparent kd of  <dig> Â±  <dig>  nm with almost complete susceptibility to digestion by heparinase iii in ligand blot analysis but not to chondroitinase digestion.
immunoblot analysis of enzyme-digested high mr rhpln.d <dig> demonstrated that the rhpln.d <dig> was synthesized as either a chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in an approximately 2: <dig> ratio, with negligible hybrids.
by sds-page analysis following anion exchange chromatography, the recombinant proteoglycans appeared to possess glycosaminoglycan chains ranging, in total, from  <dig> kda to > <dig> kda per recombinant.
secondary structure analysis suggested helices and sheets in both recombinant species.
finally, we corroborate the augmentation of fgf-mediated cell activation by rhpln.d <dig> and demonstrate mitogenic signalling through the fgfr1c receptor.
