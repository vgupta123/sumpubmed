recently, amino acids and their metabolites have been reported to affect the plant immune system.
however, how amino acids act in plant defense responses has yet to be clarified.
here, we report that treatment of rice roots with amino acids such as glutamate  induced systemic disease resistance against rice blast in leaves.
the glu-induced blast resistance was partially impaired in rice plants deficient in sa signaling such as nahg plants expressing an sa hydroxylase, wrky45-knockdown, and osnpr1-knockdown plants.
our results indicate that the amino acid-induced blast resistance partly depends on the sa pathway but an unknown sa-independent signaling pathway is also involved.
the ja-deficient mutant cpm <dig> exhibited full glu-induced blast resistance.
in leaves, salicylic acid -responsive genes, rather than jasmonic acid  or ethylene -responsive genes, were induced by this treatment.
