expression analysis enabled elucidation of the molecular and genetic level expression patterns of cold tolerance  and susceptible lines  of cabbage and indicated that all bocbf genes responded to abiotic stresses.

however, no detailed expression profile of ap2/erf-like genes is available for b. oleracea.
the identification, classification, phylogenetic construction, conserved motifs, chromosome distribution, functional annotation, expression patterns and interaction network were then predicted and analyzed.
ap2/erf transcription factor expression levels exhibited differences in response to varying abiotic stresses based on expressed sequence tags .
however a high degree of sequence similarity and conserved genome structure remain between cabbage and arabidopsis; therefore, arabidopsis is a viable reference species for comparative genomics studies.
in the present study,  <dig> ap2/erf tfs were identified from b. oleracea based on the available genome sequence.
comprehensive analysis of the physiological functions and biological roles of ap2/erf superfamily genes and bocbf family genes in b. oleracea is required to fully elucidate ap2/erf, which will provide rich resources and opportunities to understand abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
based on sequence similarity, the ap2/erf superfamily was classified into five groups  and  <dig> subgroups.
transcription factors  are important regulators involved in plant development and physiological processes and the ap2/erf protein family contains transcriptional factors that play a crucial role in plant growth and development, as well as response to biotic and abiotic stress conditions in plants.
the entire cabbage genome sequence and more than fifty thousand proteins have been obtained to date.
