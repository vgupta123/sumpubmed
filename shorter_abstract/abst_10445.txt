minor alleles of the human dopamine receptor polymorphisms, drd2/taqi a and drd4/ <dig> bp, are related to decreased functioning and/or numbers of their respective receptors and have been shown to be correlated with body mass, height and food craving.
post-hoc analysis suggests that the drd <dig> differences in bmi were due primarily to differences in fat free body mass.
bmi was higher in those with one or two drd4/7r alleles in the nomadic population, but lower among the settled.
in addition, the 7r minor allele of the drd <dig> gene is at a higher frequency in nomadic compared to sedentary populations.
our results indicate that the drd4/7r allele may be more advantageous among nomadic than settled ariaal men.
our results support the idea that human phenotypic expression of genotypes should be rigorously evaluated in diverse environments and genetic backgrounds.
the ariaal live in northern kenya, are chronically undernourished and are divided socially among age-sets.
this result suggests that a selective advantage mediated through behaviour may be responsible for the higher frequency of the 7r alleles in nomadic relative to sedentary populations around the world.
here we examine polymorphisms in the drd <dig> and drd <dig> genes with respect to body mass index  and height among men in two populations of ariaal pastoralists, one recently settled  and the other still nomadic .
