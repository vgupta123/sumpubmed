<dig> , <dig> reads were mapped to the available m. truncatula genome corresponding to  <dig>  distinct sequences.
deep sequencing of short rnas from m. truncatula leaves identified eight new mirnas indicating that specific mirnas exist in legume species.
<dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from two separate short rna libraries generated from total rna extracted from m. truncatula leaves, representing  <dig> , <dig> distinct sequences.
nine of these loci produced eight distinct sequences, for which the mirna* sequences were also sequenced.
these sequences were not described in other plant species and accumulation of these eight novel mirnas was confirmed by northern blot analysis.
high-throughput sequencing technology is capable to identify novel short rnas in plant species.
potential target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel mirnas.
<dig>  reads representing  <dig> conserved mirna families showed perfect matches to known mirnas.
