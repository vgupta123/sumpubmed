differential expression of many of the validated genes was associated with mfs samples when an additional group of unaffected and mfs affected subjects were analyzed .
marfan syndrome  is a heritable connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin- <dig> gene.
subsequently,  <dig> genes were chosen for validation by quantitative rt-pcr.
we used spotted membrane dna macroarrays to identify genes whose altered expression levels may contribute to the phenotype of the disease.
in unaffected control subjects, expression ranges exceeding  <dig> fold were seen in many of the genes selected for qrt-pcr validation.
our analysis of  <dig> genes identified a subset with significant expression differences between skin fibroblast cultures from unaffected controls versus cultures from affected individuals with known fibrillin- <dig> mutations.
