the input of the pipeline is paired-end illumina sequence reads, and the output is a high quality complete genome sequence.
the existence of gaps compromises our ability to take full advantage of the genome data.
it combines the strengths of de novo assembly, reference-based assembly, customized programming, public databases utilization, and wet lab experimentation.
despite the large volume of genome sequencing data produced by next-generation sequencing technologies and the highly sophisticated software dedicated to handling these types of data, gaps are commonly found in draft genome assemblies.
a pipeline was developed to assemble complete genomes primarily from the next generation sequencing  data.
the constituting principles and methods are applicable to similar studies on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes.
this study aims to identify a practical approach for biologists to complete their own genome assemblies using commonly available tools and resources.
