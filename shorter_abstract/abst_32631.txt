how this coding neuronal assembly is configured is debated.
even though neurons belonged to their respective pools, some cells synchronized for all presented stimuli while others were rather selective and only a few stimulating conditions produced a significant synchronization.
synchronization of action potentials between neurons is considered to be an encoding process that allows the grouping of various and multiple features of an image leading to a coherent perception.
these results prompt the hypothesis that random or spontaneous synchronization becomes progressively less important, whereas coincident spikes related to encoding properties of targets gain significance because a particular configuration of an image biases the excitatory inputs in favor of connections driven by the applied features of the stimulus.
