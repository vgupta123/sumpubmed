we report the crystal structure and biophysical characterization of the ndk from leishmania braziliensis .
our results support that lbndk remains hexameric in ph conditions akin to that faced by this enzyme when secreted by leishmania amastigotes in the parasitophorous vacuoles .
saxs data showed that lbndk forms hexamers in solution in the ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , a hydrodynamic behavior conserved in most eukaryotic ndks.
however, dsf assays show that acidification and alkalization decrease the hexamer stability.
the unusual unfolded conformation of lbndk c-terminus decreases the surface buried in the trimer interface exposing new regions that might be explored for the development of compounds designed to disturb enzyme oligomerization, which may impair the important nucleotide salvage pathway in these parasites.
these functions make ndk an attractive target for drug design and for studies aiming at a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating host-pathogen interactions.
