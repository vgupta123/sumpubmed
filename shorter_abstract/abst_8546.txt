in contrast, the only gene which showed a similar pattern to anthocyanin concentration was udp-glucose-flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase , which was high at the beginning and end of fruit growth, remaining low during the other developmental stages.
the expression of a potential proanthocyanidin-regulating transcription factor, mybpa <dig>  corresponded with proanthocyanidin levels.
this suggests exclusive roles of anthocyanin regulation by myb <dig> and proanthocyanidin regulation by mybpa <dig>  further, these transcription factors appeared to be responsive to both developmental and environmental stimuli.
expression of flavonol synthase  correlated with flavonol levels, both temporally and in a tissue specific manner.
we have isolated nectarine flavonoid regulating genes and examined their expression patterns, which suggests a critical role in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis.
the pattern of ufgt gene expression may be explained by the involvement of different transcription factors, which up-regulate flavonoid biosynthesis , or repress  the transcription of the biosynthetic genes.
in nectarine, expression of the genes encoding enzymes of the flavonoid pathway correlated with the concentration of proanthocyanidins, which strongly increases at mid-development.
in peach and nectarine  these compounds vary during fruit growth and ripening.
flavonoids such as anthocyanins, flavonols and proanthocyanidins, play a central role in fruit colour, flavour and health attributes.
functional assays of these transcription factors were used to test the specificity for flavonoid regulation.
