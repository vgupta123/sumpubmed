higher eukaryotic genomes are typically large, complex and filled with both genes and multiple classes of repetitive dna.
these results now indicate that hundreds of higher eukaryotic genomes can be efficiently characterized for the nature, abundance and evolution of their major repetitive dna components.
the repetitive dnas, primarily transposable elements, are a rapidly evolving genome component that can provide the raw material for novel selected functions and also indicate the mechanisms and history of genome evolution in any ancestral lineage.
