furthermore, our genome-wide analysis identifies thousands of novel creb target genes in liver, and suggests a previously unknown role for creb in regulating er stress genes in response to nutrient influx.
previous genome-wide analysis has shown that only a small percentage of creb target genes are induced in response to fasting-associated signaling pathways.
we found that creb remains constitutively bound to its target genes in the liver regardless of the metabolic state.
our results support a model in which creb is constitutively bound to thousands of target genes, and combinatorial interactions between dna-binding factors are necessary to achieve the specific transcriptional response of the liver to fasting.
we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing of creb in livers from both fasted and re-fed mice.
integration of the creb cistrome with expression microarrays of fasted and re-fed mouse livers and chip-seq data for additional transcription factors revealed that the gene expression switches between the two metabolic states are associated with co-localization of additional transcription factors at creb sites.
in order to quantitatively compare the extent of creb-dna interactions genome-wide between these two physiological conditions we developed a novel, robust analysis method, termed the ‘single sample independence’  test that greatly reduced the number of false-positive peaks.
the precise molecular mechanisms by which creb specifically targets these genes in response to alternating hormonal cues remain to be elucidated.
