this study used change mediated antigen technology â„¢ and 2d-page, in combination with rt-qpcr, to identify stx phage genes that are expressed in e. coli during the lysogenic cycle.
propagation of a lysogen culture in which no cells at all are undergoing spontaneous lysis is impossible.
conservation of these genes in this phage genome, and other stx phages where they have been identified as present, indicates their importance in the phage/lysogen life cycle, with possible implications for the biology and pathogenicity of the bacterial host.
genes essential for phage maintenance and replication are encoded on approximately 50% of the genome, while most of the remaining genes are of unknown function nor is it known if these annotated hypothetical genes are even expressed.
shiga toxin, stx, is encoded on the genome of temperate, lambdoid stx phages.
to overcome this, rt-qpcr was used to determine gene expression profiles associated with the growth phase of lysogens.
lysogen cultures propagated for 5- <dig> hours produced a high cell density with a low proportion of spontaneous prophage induction events.
shigatoxigenic e. coli are a global and emerging health concern.
the expression of  <dig> phage genes was detected in these cultures by differential 2d-page of expressed proteins and cmat.
