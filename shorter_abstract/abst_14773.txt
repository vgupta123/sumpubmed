gabapentin, pregablin and gaba can all modulate voltage-activated ca2+ channels.
the aims of this study were to determine whether pregabalin and gabapentin had additive inhibitory effects on high voltage-activated ca2+ channels, evaluate whether the actions of pregabalin were dependent on gaba receptors and characterise the actions of pregabalin on voltage-activated potassium currents.
the residual ca2+ current recorded in the presence of pregabalin was sensitive to the l-type ca2+ channel modulator, bay k <dig>  saturating concentrations of gabapentin failed to have additive effects when applied with pregabalin, indicating that these two compounds act on the same type of voltage-activated ca2+ channels but the majority of ca2+ current was resistant to both drugs.
pregabalin produced biphasic effects on voltage-activated k+ currents, the inhibitory effect of pregabalin was prevented with apamin.
the delayed enhancement of k+ currents was attenuated by pertussis toxin and by intracellular application of a -analogue of camp.
the actions of pregabalin may involve both extracellular and intracellular drug target sites and modulation of a variety of neuronal conductances, by direct interactions, and through intracellular signalling involving protein kinase a.
the enhanced ca2+ influx evoked by pregabalin was mimicked by partial block of k+ conductances with tetraethylammonium.
pregabalin reduces excitatory properties of cultured drg neurones by modulating voltage-activated ca2+ and k+ channels.
pregabalin  inhibited 20–30% of the high voltage-activated ca2+ current in cultured drg neurones.
in this study we have used whole cell patch clamp recording and fura- <dig> ca2+ imaging to characterise the actions of pregabalin on the electrophysiological properties of cultured dorsal root ganglion  neurones from neonatal rats.
the continual application of gaba, the gabab receptor antagonist cgp <dig>  or intracellular photorelease of gtp-γ-s had no effect on pregabalin-induced inhibition of ca2+ currents.
