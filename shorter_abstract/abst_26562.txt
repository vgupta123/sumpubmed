oligospawn is a suite of software tools that offers two complementary services, namely  the selection of "unique" oligos each of which appears in one unigene but does not occur  in any other and  the selection of "popular" oligos each of which occurs  in as many unigenes as possible.
the algorithms we designed are highly efficient and capable of processing unigene datasets of sizes on the order of several tens of mb in a few hours on a regular pc.
in this paper, we describe the functionalities of oligospawn and the computational methods it employs, and we report on experimental results for the overgo probes designed with it.
the software has been used to design overgo probes employed to screen a barley bac library .
