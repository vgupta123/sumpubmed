to examine the utility of conserved microsatellite loci as genetic markers we collated a database of charadriiformes microsatellites, searched for homologues in the chicken genome and tested conserved markers for amplification and polymorphism in a range of charadriiform species.
fifty-five primers designed from conserved microsatellite loci with an e-value of e- <dig> or lower amplified across a wider range of charadriiform species than a control group of primers from ten anonymous microsatellite loci.
sixty-eight  of  <dig> charadriiform microsatellite loci were assigned to a single location in the chicken genome based on their e-value.
despite their popularity, the characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci and development of suitable markers takes considerable effort.
by maximising primer sequence similarity between source species and database species, markers can be further improved and provide additional markers to study the molecular ecology of populations of non-model organisms.
microsatellite markers are popular genetic markers frequently used in forensic biology.
newly-available genomic databases make it feasible to identify conserved genetic markers.
however, research has been largely restrained by the limited availability of genetic markers.
genomic sequence databases are useful tools to identify conserved genetic markers including those located in non-coding regions.
we examined the utility and characteristics of conserved microsatellite markers in charadriiformes .
