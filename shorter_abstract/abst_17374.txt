the life-science community faces a major challenge in handling “big data”, highlighting the need for high quality infrastructures capable of sharing and publishing research data.
e!dal is a lightweight software framework for publishing and sharing research data.
e!dal was developed based on experiences coming from decades of research data management at the leibniz institute of plant genetics and crop plant research .

its main features are version tracking, metadata management, information retrieval, registration of persistent identifiers , an embedded http server for public data access, access as a network file system, and a scalable storage backend.
the infrastructures currently available for managing and publishing data are often designed to meet domain-specific or project-specific requirements, resulting in the repeated development of proprietary solutions and lower quality data publication and preservation overall.
initially developed as a data publication and documentation infrastructure for the ipk’s role as a data center in the datacite consortium, e!dal has grown towards being a general data archiving and publication infrastructure.
e!dal is available as an api for local non-shared storage and as a remote api featuring distributed applications.
