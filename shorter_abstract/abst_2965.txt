using seeds sampled from trees at different elevations, we consistently detected sharp decreases in seed germination rates of trees in the hybrid zone, which might be due largely to the hybrid incompatibility.
a genetic map was established using  <dig> megagametophytes from a single tree in the hybrid zone of the two species.
the natural introgression between p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis and their distribution ranges lead to the emergence of the two species as desirable organisms to study the genetic mechanisms for speciation.
in this study, we display the potential chromosomal introgression barriers between p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis.
distortion of marker transmission ratio is frequently ascribed to selection against alleles that cause hybrid incompatibility.
our study provides a valuable platform for conducting genome-wide association of hybrid incompatible qtls and/or candidate genes with marker transmission ratio distortion in the hybrid.
the extension range, the distortion direction, and the distortion intensity of ssd markers also varied dramatically on different linkage groups.
exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying speciation is a hot topic in modern genetics and evolutionary studies.
