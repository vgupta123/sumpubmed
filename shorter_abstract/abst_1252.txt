we identified a total of  <dig> non-coding small rnas  from the intergenic regions, of which  <dig> had no predicted function.
in summary, the pneumococcal operon structures and novel srnas identified in this study enhance our understanding of the complexity and extent of the pneumococcal 'expressed' genome.
we identified eight overrepresented sequence motifs among srna sequences that correspond to srnas in different functional categories.
our results indicate that approximately 66% of the genome is expressed under our experimental conditions.
furthermore, the results of this study open up new avenues of research for understanding the complex rna regulatory network governing s. pneumoniae physiology and virulence.
in prokaryotes, studies have shown that non-coding transcripts participate in a broad range of cellular functions like gene regulation, stress and virulence.
here, we describe a high-resolution transcription map of the s. pneumoniae clinical isolate tigr <dig> using genomic tiling arrays.
however, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in streptococcus pneumoniae , an obligate human respiratory pathogen responsible for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality.
half of the identified srna sequences were found to be unique to s. pneumoniae genome.
