the experimental confirmation of the binding sites using qpcr, emsa, dnase i footprinting and in vitro transcription experiments validated the in vivo identified trmbl <dig> binding sites.
the chip-seq analysis revealed under gluconeogenic growth conditions  <dig> trmbl <dig> binding sites where the tgm is located upstream of coding regions and no binding sites under glycolytic conditions.
furthermore, this study provides evidence that trmbl <dig> is also involved in transcriptional regulation of additional cellular processes e.g.
the aim of this study was to complement the in vitro data with an in vivo analysis using chip-seq to explore the genome-wide binding profile of trmbl <dig> under glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth conditions.
in the initial setup we were interested to include the binding analysis of trmb, an additional member of the trmb family, but western blot experiments and the chip-seq data indicated that the corresponding gene is deleted in our pyrococcus strain.
furthermore, the high resolution of the mapped binding positions enabled reliable predictions, if trmbl <dig> activates  or represses transcription  of the corresponding genes.
a detailed analysis of a new type strain demonstrated that a 16Â kb fragment containing the trmb gene is almost completely deleted after the first re-cultivation.
the identified binding sites in the p. furiosus genome classified trmbl <dig> as a more global regulator as hitherto known.
these data indicate that the protein can act as repressor or activator and is mainly involved in transcriptional control of sugar uptake and in the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.
