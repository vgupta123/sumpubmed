the results indicate that a multicellular morphotype evolved early in the cyanobacterial lineage and was regained at least once after a previous loss.
most of the morphological diversity exhibited in cyanobacteria today —including the majority of single-celled species— arose from ancient multicellular lineages.
we conducted and compared phylogenetic analyses of 16s rdna sequences from a large sample of taxa representing the morphological and genetic diversity of cyanobacteria.
comparison to the fossil record supports an early origin of multicellularity, possibly as early as the "great oxygenation event" that occurred  <dig>  -  <dig>  billion years ago.
the results suggest that the majority of extant cyanobacteria descend from multicellular ancestors.
understanding when and how multicellularity evolved in these ancient organisms would provide fundamental information on the early history of life and further our knowledge of complex life forms.
