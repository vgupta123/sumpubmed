the endothelium of small arterioles expressed ass and nos <dig>  while their smooth-muscle layer expressed oat and arg <dig>
carbamoylphosphate synthetase , ornithine aminotransferase , argininosuccinate synthetase , arginase- <dig> , arginase- <dig> , and nitric-oxide synthase  were visualized by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry in  <dig> small-intestinal specimens.
neurons in the enteric plexus strongly expressed ass, oat, nos <dig> and arg <dig>  while varicose nerve fibers in the circular layer of the muscularis propria stained for ass and nos <dig> only.
the perinatal human intestine therefore resembles that of rodents and pigs.
milk contains too little arginine for normal growth, but its precursors proline and glutamine are abundant; the small intestine of rodents and piglets produces arginine from proline during the suckling period; and parenterally fed premature human neonates frequently suffer from hypoargininemia.
these findings raise the question whether the neonatal human small intestine also expresses the enzymes that enable the synthesis of arginine from proline and/or glutamine.
the human small intestine acquires the potential to produce arginine well before fetuses become viable outside the uterus.
between  <dig> weeks of gestation and  <dig> years after birth, cps- and ass-protein content in enterocytes was high and then declined to reach adult levels at  <dig> years.
arg- <dig> expression increased neonatally to adult levels.
