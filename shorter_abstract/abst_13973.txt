in order to identify novel host genetic variants as predictive risk factors or as potential targets for prophylaxis, we have looked for quantitative trait loci in a mouse model of invasive pneumococcal disease.
the two quantitative trait loci we have identified  are linked significantly to both bacteraemia and survival time.

host susceptibility to pneumococcal infection and disease is controlled by a combination of genetic and environmental influences, but current knowledge remains limited.
