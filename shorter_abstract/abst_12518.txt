we show that septin <dig> can form dynamic structures with differing morphologies in living cells, and that these morphologies are dependent on the functional state of the actin cytoskeleton.
our data provide a link between the different morphological states of septin <dig> and functions of septin <dig> in actin-dynamics, and are consistent with the model proposed by kinoshita and colleagues, that septin <dig> filaments play a role in stabilisation of actin stress fibres thus preventing actin turnover.
frap experiments showed that all assemblies formed by septin <dig> are highly dynamic with a constant exchange of septin <dig> in and out of these structures, and that this property is independent of actin.
septin <dig> partially co-localises with actin bundles in mammalian interphase cells and septin2-filamentmorphology depends upon an intact actin cytoskeleton.
septin <dig> filaments are associated with actin fibres, but septin <dig> is not associated with actin at the leading edge of moving cells or in ruffles where actin is highly dynamic.
moreover, evidence that septin <dig> is remodelled or redistributed in response to other changes in actin organisation is lacking.
a combination of rnai experiments and expression of truncated forms of septin <dig> showed that septin <dig> plays a significant role in stabilising or maintaining actin bundles.
rather, septin <dig> is spatially segregated from these active areas and forms o- and c-shaped structures, similar to those previously observed after latrunculin treatment.
