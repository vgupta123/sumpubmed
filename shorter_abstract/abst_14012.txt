this study evaluated the influence of repeated anaesthesia using isoflurane , ketamine-xylazine  or a combination of medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl  on heart rate , arterial blood pressure , body temperature , duration of anaesthetic intervals and body weight  in wistar rats.
neither mmf nor iso showed significant differences in the duration of anaesthetic intervals and bw.
hr, bp values, bt, duration of anaesthetic intervals and bw were affected differently by repeated anaesthesia performed with iso, kx or mmf.
hr and bp were not affected by repeated kx anaesthesia, but we noted a reduction of sleeping time and bw.
with kx we observed tissue necrosis at the injection site and surgical tolerance was not achieved in 25% of the anaesthesias performed.
the inability to produce a surgical tolerance, the reduction of sleeping time and bw, as well as the tissue necrosis are significant contraindications for a repeated use of kx.

kx was not antagonized, but iso delivery was terminated 40 minutes after induction and mmf was reversed with atipamezole-flumazenil-naloxone .
only mild changes of bp were found with repeated mmf anaesthesia, so it seems suitable for serial use, unless the high bp and the low hr during the surgical plane of anaesthesia are undesirable for a special procedure.
