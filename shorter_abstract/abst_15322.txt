host susceptibility to kp is a complex trait, controlled by multiple genetic factors that act sequentially during the course of infection.
we challenged  <dig> mice from  <dig> cc lines intraperitoneally with  <dig> colony forming units of kp strain k <dig>  survival and body weight were monitored for 15 days post challenge.
cc lines differed significantly  in mean survival time, between  <dig> to 15 days post infection, and broad sense heritability was  <dig> .
we performed the first quantitative trait locus  mapping study of host susceptibility to kp infection in immunocompetent collaborative cross mice .
<dig> of the cc lines were genotyped with  <dig>  snps, with which we mapped qtls.
a qtl on chromosome  <dig> was found only on day  <dig> post infection, and qtl on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  only on day  <dig>  by using the sequence variations of the eight inbred strain founders of the cc to refine qtl localization we identify several candidate genes.
klebsiella pneumoniae  is a bacterium causing severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts and is often associated with sepsis.

with the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria, there is a need for new effective and affordable control methods; understanding the genetic architecture of susceptibility to kp will help in their development.
