hsp <dig> copy number in four strains is positively associated with hsp <dig> expression and inducible thermotolerance of severe heat shock.
in addition, complete hsp <dig> loss causes upregulation of the inducible hsps and six constitutive stress-response genes following severe heat shocks.
severe heat shocks induce both novel gene expression patterns and almost total mortality in the hsp <dig> null strain: alteration of gene expression in this strain does not compensate for hsp <dig> loss but suggests candidates for overexpression studies.
in contrast to expectations, increasing hsp <dig> expression levels induced by thermal pretreatment are associated with increasing levels of seven other inducible hsps across strains.
a positive association between absolute expression levels of hsp <dig> and other hsps after thermal pretreatment suggests novel regulatory mechanisms.
here we examine the effect of hsp <dig> gene copy number modification on thermotolerance and the expression of multiple stress-response genes in drosophila melanogaster, to determine which genes may represent mechanisms of stress tolerance independent of hsp <dig>
the heat shock protein hsp <dig> promotes inducible thermotolerance in nearly every organism examined to date.
