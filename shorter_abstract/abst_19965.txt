in plant organelles, specific messenger rnas  are subjected to conversion editing, a process that often converts the first or second nucleotide of a codon and hence the encoded amino acid.
here we study the relationship between amino acid residues encoded by edited codons and the structural characteristics of these residues within proteins, e.g., in protein-protein interfaces, elements of secondary structure, or protein structural cores.
rna editing can convert codons for hydrophilic to hydrophobic amino acids.
we find that the residues encoded by edited codons are significantly biased toward involvement in helices and protein structural cores.
no systematic patterns in converted sites were found on mrnas, and the converted sites rarely encoded residues located at the active sites of proteins.
the role and origin of rna editing in plant organelles remain to be elucidated.
we have performed a novel analysis of the location of residues affected by rna editing in proteins in plant organelles.
