ethyl -4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate -chbe) is a versatile chiral precursor for many pharmaceuticals.
a robust enzyme designed as bgadh <dig> from burkholderia gladioli cctcc m  <dig> exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity, and was further characterized and investigated in the asymmetric synthesis of -chbe.
in an aqueous/octanol biphasic system, as much as 1200 mmol cobe was completely converted by using substrate fed-batch strategy to afford -chbe with  <dig>  % ee at a space-time yield per gram of biomass of  <dig>  mmol∙l−1∙h−1∙g dcw− <dig>
this study allows for the further application of bgadh <dig> in the biosynthesis of chiral alcohols, and establishes a preparative scale process for producing -chbe with excellent enantiopurity.
a stereoselective carbonyl reductase toolbox was constructed and employed into the asymmetric reduction of cobe to -chbe.
although several biosynthesis strategies have been documented to convert ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate  to -chbe, the catalytic efficiency and stereoselectivity are still too low to be scaled up for industrial applications.
