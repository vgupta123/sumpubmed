the prescribed methods for subspecies identification of the cff and cfv isolates are: tolerance to 1 % glycine and h2s production.

c. fetus has been divided into three subspecies: c. fetus subsp.
this suggests the need for a closer evaluation of the current c. fetus subspecies differentiation, considering that the phenotypic differentiation is still applied in bgc control programs.
subspecies identification of mammal-associated c. fetus strains is crucial in the control of bovine genital campylobacteriosis , a syndrome associated with cfv.
multiple c. fetus clades were observed, which were not consistent with the biochemical differentiation of the strains.
in this study, we observed the deletion of a putative cysteine transporter in the cfv strains, which are not able to produce h2s from l-cysteine.
phylogenetic reconstruction of the core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms  within cff and cfv strains divided these strains into five different clades and showed that the cfv clade and a cff clade evolved from a single cff ancestor.
