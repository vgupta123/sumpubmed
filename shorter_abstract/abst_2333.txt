vst of mice intragastrically inoculated with v. vulnificus was measured every 2-h for 24 h and data for minimal vst analyzed for prediction of lethal outcome.
to study food-borne v. vulnificus disease in the laboratory, mouse virulence studies predominantly use death as the primary experimental endpoint because behaviorally based moribund status does not consistently predict lethality.
use of vst ≤  <dig>  °c as an experimental endpoint during v. vulnificus infection has potential to reduce suffering of nearly 70% of mice for a mean of 10 h per mouse, without compromising experimental efficacy.
this study assessed ventral surface temperature  and its association with mouse survival during v. vulnificus virulence studies as an efficacious, humane alternative.
for future v. vulnificus virulence studies requiring only binary comparison , we find that vst can be applied as a humane endpoint.

temperature cutoff of  <dig>  °c exhibited 93% positive and 77% negative predictive value.
vst ≤  <dig>  °c was predictive of subsequent death with a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 95%.
in contrast to the relatively stable vst of mock-infected control animals, mice infected with v. vulnificus exhibited hypothermia with minima occurring  <dig> to 12 h post-inoculation.
