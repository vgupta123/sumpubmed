formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples taken before and after treatment were used to analyse total progesterone receptor and both isoforms by rt-qpcr and ki <dig> antigen labelling.
these findings suggest that the antiproliferative effects of aglepristone in canine mammary carcinomas are mediated by progesterone receptor isoform a.
this study examined the effects of the antiprogestin aglepristone on cell proliferation and mrna expression of progesterone receptor isoforms a and b in mammary carcinomas in dogs treated with 20Â mg/kg of aglepristone  or vehicle  twice before surgery.
progesterone receptors play a key role in the development of canine mammary tumours, and recent research has focussed on their possible value as therapeutic targets using antiprogestins.
furthermore, a significant decrease in the proliferation index  was observed in progesterone-receptor positive and isoform-a positive tumours in aglepristone-treated dogs.
experimental studies in human breast cancer suggest that the differential expression of progesterone receptor isoforms has implications for hormone therapy responsiveness.
both total progesterone receptor and isoform a mrna expression levels decreased after treatment with aglepristone.
