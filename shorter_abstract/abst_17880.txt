to evaluate the intermittent excretion of the pathogen in milk, we sampled  <dig> additional farms from  <dig> to  <dig> times, resulting that in  <dig> % of the cases a previously positive farm tested negative in a later sampling.
m. agalactiae was the only mycoplasma species detected in the study area showing a high frequency of presence and wide distribution.
have been associated with this syndrome: m. agalactiae, m. mycoides subsp.
interestingly, all  <dig> milk samples assessed for the presence of m. mycoides subsp.
however, previous spanish studies have been focused on caprine ca, and there is a knowledge gap regarding which mycoplasma species are present in sheep flocks from spain, which has the second highest number of sheep amongst the  <dig> european union member states.
capricolum and m. putrefaciens tested negative.
contagious agalactia  is one of the major animal health problems in small ruminants because of its economic significance.
three hundred thirty nine out of  <dig> sheep flocks were positive for m. agalactiae by real time pcr  and  <dig> by microbiological identification .
therefore, the establishment of a permanent surveillance network is advantageous, as well as the implementation of control and prevention measures to hinder the dissemination of m. agalactiae and to prevent the entrance of other mycoplasma species.
consequently, we investigated the presence and geographic distribution of the four ca-causing mycoplasmas in spanish dairy sheep farms.
