the selection of strong phage-binders was achieved already after the first panning cycle due to the efficient separation of phage-binders from phage-non-binders in chromatographic mode rather than in batch mode as in traditional biopanning procedures.
phage display technology is a well established technique for high throughput screening of affinity ligands.
both phages and e. coli cells pass non-hindered through the interconnected pores of macroporous gel, so called cryogel.
e. coli cells were applied on the column for infection with the specifically bound phages.
chromato-panning allows combining several steps of the panning procedure resulting in 4â€“ <dig> fold decrease of total time needed for phage selection.
after coupling a ligand to a monolithic cryogel column, the phage library was applied on the column and non-bound phages were washed out.
