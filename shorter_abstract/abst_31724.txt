immunohistochemistry of cardiac cryosections demonstrate kir <dig>  protein to be expressed in ventricular myocytes, as well as in the smooth muscle and endothelial cells of coronary resistance vessels.
sur <dig> subunits are strongly expressed at the sarcolemmal surface of ventricular myocytes , whereas sur <dig> protein was found to be localized predominantly in cardiac myocytes and coronary vessels .
the role of these subunits in cardiomyocytes remain to be defined and may require a reassessment of the molecular nature of ventricular katp channels.
kir <dig>  protein expression was found predominantly in ventricular myocytes and also in endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells.
immunocytochemistry of isolated ventricular myocytes shows co-localization of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> proteins in a striated sarcomeric pattern, suggesting t-tubular expression of these proteins.
we examined the localization of each of the katp channel subunits in the mouse and rat heart.
these results suggest distinct roles for katp channel subunits in diverse cardiac structures.
electrophysiological data suggest that cardiac katp channels consist of kir <dig>  and sur2a subunits, but the distribution of these  is poorly defined.
