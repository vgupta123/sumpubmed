a supervised machine learning approach for automatic prediction of drug resistance was developed to handle genotype-phenotype datasets of hiv protease  and reverse transcriptase .
the prediction accuracies were examined by five-fold cross-validation on the genotype-phenotype datasets.
the accuracy of the classification was higher than  <dig>  for eight pr inhibitors and  <dig>  for ten rt inhibitors, respectively.
the overall cross-validated regression r2-values for the severity of drug resistance were  <dig> – <dig>  for  <dig> pr inhibitors and  <dig> – <dig>  for  <dig> rt inhibitors.
machine learning using a unified encoding of sequence and protein structure as a feature vector provides an accurate prediction of drug resistance from genotype data.
a unified encoding of protein sequence and structure was used as the feature vector for predicting phenotypic resistance from genotype data.
two machine learning algorithms, random forest and k-nearest neighbor, were used.
the emergence of drug resistance mutations diminishes the effectiveness of drug therapy for hiv/aids.
developing a computational prediction of drug resistance phenotype will enable efficient and timely selection of the best treatment regimens.
it predicts the drug resistance phenotype and its relative severity from a query sequence.
