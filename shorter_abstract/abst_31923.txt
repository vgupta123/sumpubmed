solexa technology was used to sequence small rna libraries constructed from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> and the control.
deep sequencing of short rnas from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> and the control identified  <dig> ga3-responsive mirnas, among which  <dig> exhibited different expression profiles of response to ga <dig> in the diverse developmental stages of grapevine berries.
there existed some consistency in expression levels of ga3-responsive vvi-mirnas between high throughput sequencing and qrt-pcr essays.
subsequently, we found that  <dig> of them were differentially regulated by ga <dig>  with  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel vvi-mirnas, based on the analysis of qrt-pcr essays.
these identified vvi-mirnas might be involved in the grapevine berry development and response to environmental stresses.
in addition,  <dig> target genes for  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted.
however, there have been few reports about grapevine mirnas in response to gibberelline .
a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel grapevine mirnas  were identified.
