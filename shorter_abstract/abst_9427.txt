a fusion protein comprised of murine gm-csf as the n-terminal domain and the encephalitogenic mog35- <dig> peptide as the c-terminal domain was tested as a tolerogenic, therapeutic vaccine  in the c57bl/ <dig> model of eae.
covalent linkage of the gm-csf and mog35- <dig> domains was required for tolerogenic activity.
this study focused on whether cytokine-neuroantigen  fusion proteins could inhibit disease in chronic murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  and thus serve as potential therapeutic modalities for multiple sclerosis.
these data indicated that fusion proteins containing gm-csf coupled to myelin auto-antigens elicit tolerance rather than immunity.
likewise, a ttv comprised of gm-csf and plp139- <dig> was a tolerogen in the sjl model of eae.
vaccination strategies that elicit antigen-specific tolerance are needed as therapies for autoimmune disease.
