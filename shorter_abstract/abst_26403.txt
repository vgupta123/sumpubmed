ago  protein participates in plant developmental processes and virus defense as a core element of transcriptional regulator or/and post-transcriptional regulator in rna induced silencing complex , which is guided by small rnas to repress target genes expression.
our results contribute to demonstration of potential roles of these newly isolated ago family in tomato developmental processes and proved the conserved relationships between ago genes and mirnas in tomato, which might play important roles in tomato development and virus defense.
previously, it was revealed that  <dig> putative ago genes in tomato genome.
in addition, subcellular localization of slago proteins was detected.
slago <dig> could be detected in early stage of fruit , but it was significantly down-regulated in fruit collected on the  <dig> days post anthesis.
our results showed that most slago proteins localized to nucleus and cytoplasm.
furthermore, mutated mir <dig> complementary site of slago1a resulted in expanded localization of slago1a, indicating that mir <dig> regulated localization of slago1a.
in present study, out of  <dig> detected slago genes, only slago4c and slago <dig> couldn’t be detected in roots, stems, leaves, buds, flowers and fruit of tomato by  <dig> cycles of pcr.
according to blast result with mirna database, three slago genes harbored complementary sequences to mir <dig>  or mir <dig> .
5′ race  mapping was used to detect the 3′ cleavage products of slago mrnas.
