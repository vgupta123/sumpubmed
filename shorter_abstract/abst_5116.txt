caf- <dig> is required for cell differentiation and regulates trichome development together with stichel in an endoreduplication-independent pathway.
mutations in all three caf- <dig> subunits affect arabidopsis trichome morphology and lack of caf- <dig> function results in formation of trichomes with supernumerary branches.
chromatin dynamics and stability are both required to control normal development of multicellular organisms.
in plants and animals caf- <dig> is essential for normal development, but it is poorly understood which developmental pathways require caf- <dig> function.
in contrast, other aspects of the caf- <dig> mutant phenotype, such as defective meristem function and organ formation, are aggravated by external sucrose.
