a flexible domain of the rna polymerase active centre, the trigger loop, was shown to play an important role in this process, but the mechanisms of this participation remained elusive.
during transcription, the rna polymerase active centre discriminates against not just non-complementary ribo ntp substrates but also against complementary 2'- and 3'-deoxy ntps.
during the second step, non-complementary and 2'-deoxy ntps are discriminated against based on differences in reaction transition state stabilization and partly in general base catalysis, for correct versus non-correct substrates.
we demonstrate that fidelity of transcription by multi-subunit rna polymerases is achieved through a stepwise process.
the initial binding in the active centre is the major discrimination step for some non-complementary substrates, although for the rest of misincorporation events discrimination at this step is very poor.
in the following step, non-complementary and 2'-deoxy ntps are actively removed from the active centre through a rearrangement of the trigger loop.
we show that individual steps contribute differently to discrimination against various erroneous substrates.
here we show that transcription fidelity is achieved through a multi-step process.
this step is determined by two residues of the trigger loop that participate in catalysis.
the only step of discrimination against 3'-deoxy substrates, distinct from the ones above, is based on failure to orient the trigger loop catalytic residues in the absence of 3'oh.
transcription is the first step of gene expression and is characterized by a high fidelity of rna synthesis.
we define the mechanisms and contributions of each of these steps to the overall fidelity of transcription.
