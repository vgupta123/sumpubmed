increased values of cardiorespiratory parameters and body temperature were observed in all groups after initiation of opioid administration, and these increases were sustained throughout the cri period.
continuous-rate infusion  of drugs results in more stable plasma drug concentrations than administration of intermittent boluses, thus providing greater stability of physiological parameters.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the physiologic and analgesic effects of the administration of morphine, butorphanol, tramadol or methadone by cri in horses with induced synovitis of the radiocarpal joint.
morphine, butorphanol and methadone each caused a reduction in gut sounds, and this effect was greatest in animals that received morphine.
all of these opioids increased cardiovascular and respiratory parameters and reduced gut sounds during cri.
cri of morphine or methadone, but not butorphanol or tramadol, provided analgesia in horses with carpal synovitis.
