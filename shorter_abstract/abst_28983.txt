examination of the caprine omasum via ultrasonography requires a good understanding of the normal appearance of the organ.
primary diseases of the omasum are uncommon in goats, although the omasum may be involved in various gastrointestinal disorders.
ultrasonography is an ideal diagnostic tool for evaluation of the omasum, which is not accessible to conventional examination techniques, such as inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation.
active omasal motility was recorded in  <dig> goats with  <dig>  to  <dig>  contractions per minute.
the location and size of the omasum, thickness of the omasal wall and visualisation of the abomasal laminae, contents and contractions were assessed.
the omasum was seen medial to the liver, but only the omasal wall closest to the transducer was visible.
thus, the goal of the present study was to describe the results of ultrasonography of the omasum in  <dig> healthy saanen goats.
the dorsal omasal limit formed a dorsally convex curve running from cranioventral to caudodorsal and was furthest from the dorsal midline in the 6th ics.
the ventral omasal limit formed a ventrally convex curve.
the findings of this study provide reference ranges for the interpretation of the location and size of the omasum in goats with suspected omasal abnormalities.
