we identified, in both neuroreceptor genes, signatures of balancing selection in the cis-regulative acting sequences such as transcription factor binding and enhancer sequences, as well as in a transcriptional repressor sequence motif.
for rs <dig>  only one phenotypical association is known so far, but it is in high ld’  with loci of known association; i.e., variants associated with key pro-social behaviours and mental disorders in humans.
for rs <dig>  however, only one phenotypical association is known, but rs <dig> is in high ld’ , with variants associated with important pro-social behaviours and mental disorders in humans.
only for one snp on the oxtr gene  was a sign of positive directional selection detected with all three methods of selection detection.
the evolutionary highly conserved neurohypophyseal hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin play key roles in regulating social cognition and behaviours.
we also detected various signatures of balancing selection on both neuroreceptor genes.
additionally, in the intron  <dig> of the oxtr gene, the snp rs <dig> appears to be under positive directional selection.
little, however, is known about whether positive selection acts on sequence variants in genes influencing variation in human behaviours.
