three putative autonomous elements were identified, which encoded an intact rep motif and a dna helicase domain, suggesting that autonomous helitrons may exist in modern maize.
the results indicate that gene fragments captured during the transposition of many helitrons happen in a stepwise way, with multiple gene fragments within one helitron resulting from several sequential transpositions.
the putative autonomous zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> contain an extra replication factor-a protein <dig>  transposase  including three single strand dna-binding domains -a/-b/-c in the orf.
as a newly identified category of dna transposon, helitrons have been found in a large number of eukaryotes genomes.
helas and helbs carry  <dig>  and  <dig> gene fragments, which yield  <dig>  and  <dig> different genes respectively.
although many characteristics of helitrons in the maize genome have been well documented, the sequence of an intact autonomous helitrons has not been identified in maize.
zmhela <dig>  zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> all encode an open reading frame  with intact replication initiator  motif and a dna helicase  domain, which are similar to previously reported autonomous helitrons in other organisms.
over ninety percent of maize helitrons identified have captured gene fragments.
in addition, we have proposed a potential mechanism regarding how helitrons with multiple termini are generated.
in addition, the process of gene fragment capturing during the transposition of helitrons has not been characterized.
