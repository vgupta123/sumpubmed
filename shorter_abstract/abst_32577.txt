random forest analyses revealed that the three best predictors of the presence of ph1n <dig> in swine were contact rates between free-ranging swine and domestic ducks, contact rates between free-ranging swine and wild columbiformes, and contact rates between humans and ducks.
we sampled swine, domestic poultry and wild birds for influenza a virus at twelve sites in cameroon from december  <dig> while the pandemic was ongoing, to august  <dig>  at the same time we conducted point-count surveys to assess the abundance of domestic livestock and wild birds and assess interspecific contact rates.
results suggest that the practice of allowing swine to roam freely is a significant risk factor for spillover of influenza from humans into swine populations.
we assessed risk factors that may have led to spillover of ph1n <dig> from humans to swine in cameroon, central africa.
