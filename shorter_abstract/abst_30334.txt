the results suggest that inhibition of p <dig> mapk by sb <dig> results in increased jnk activity, which leads to stabilisation of inos mrna, to enhanced inos expression and to increased no production.
previous studies have shown that p <dig> mapk pathway regulates no production induced by inflammatory stimuli.
nitric oxide  is an inflammatory mediator, which acts as a cytotoxic agent and modulates immune responses and inflammation.
increased inos mrna expression was associated with reduced degradation of inos mrna.
interestingly, jnk inhibitor sp <dig> reversed the effect of sb <dig> on lps-induced inos mrna expression and no production.
p <dig> mapk inhibitors sb <dig> and sb <dig> stimulated lipopolysaccharide -induced inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression and no production in j <dig>  murine macrophages.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of inducible no synthesis by p <dig> mapk pathway.
p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathway is    activated by chemical and physical stress and regulates immune responses.
