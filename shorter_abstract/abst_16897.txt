the concordant genealogical pattern of these unlinked markers strongly supports the existence of four cryptic species.
here, we attempt to clarify the taxonomy of soil-feeding colonies collected throughout the naturally fragmented lop√© reserve area  and morphologically affiliated to cubitermes sp.
bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses, which were applied to the coii and its <dig> sequences, and neighbor-joining reconstructions, applied to the microsatellite data, reveal four major lineages in the cubitermes sp.
soil-feeding termites are particularly interesting models for studying the effects of fragmentation, a natural or anthropic phenomenon described as promoting genetic differentiation.
three are sympatric in the reserve and are probably able to disperse within a mosaic of forests of variable ages and savannahs.
our survey highlights the value of combined mitochondrial and nuclear markers for exploring unknown groups such as soil-feeding termites, and their relevance for resolving the taxonomy of organisms with ambiguous morphological diagnostic characters.
