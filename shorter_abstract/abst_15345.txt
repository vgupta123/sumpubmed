in the present work, two small rna libraries from durum wheat ciccio and svevo cultivars were generated from different tissues at the late milk  developmental stage.
our results suggest that, in durum wheat, these genes may play important roles in root/leaf development and are subjected to mirna regulation.
putative target genes were predicted for conserved and novel mirnas, the majority of which interact with nucleic acids, according to go terms relative to molecular function.
the allotetraploid durum wheat  is a highly economically important species especially in the mediterranean basin.
a total of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> potential novel mirnas were identified in the two libraries and interestingly, three novel mirnas were found to be derived from ribosomal rna.
the prediction of novel mirnas putatively derived from ribosomal rna opens new perspectives on the study of plant mirnas.
moreover, target gene expression analysis suggested that in roots, the putative genes encoding for the squamosa spl <dig> and tga <dig> proteins are regulated by ttu-mir156n, while myb <dig> transcription factor by ttu-mir319f.
additionally, the photosystem ii p <dig> chlorophyll a apoprotein gene showed an expression level negatively correlated to that of ttu-novel- <dig> in leaves.
