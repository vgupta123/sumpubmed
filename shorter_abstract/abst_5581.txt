the simulation model was parameterized using mappings of  <dig>  cdna sequence reads to the arabidopsis genome .
of the total  <dig>  reads ,  <dig>   mapped exactly to known exons, while  <dig>   mapped to introns,  <dig>   spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and  <dig>   extended beyond the end of annotated utrs.
as expected, ng sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length cdna sequences.
sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data.
we compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with "next generation"  ultra high-throughput technologies.
we have developed a simulation approach to help determine the optimal mixture of sequencing methods for most complete and cost effective transcriptome sequencing.
we have also developed estcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/ng_sims/ngsim.pl, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics.
in terms of sequence coverage alone, the ng sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but ng sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones.
sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding ng transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.
the arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of ng and traditional est sequencing, and various combinations of each.
the arabidopsis reads tagged more than  <dig>  genes, including new splice variants and extended utr regions.
