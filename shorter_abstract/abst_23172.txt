differences in resilience of marine organisms against the environmental stressors associated with climate change will have significant implications for the sustainability of coastal ecosystems worldwide.
here, we used proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of gill tissue to evaluate whether the differential response of b <dig> oysters to elevated co <dig> also extends to increased temperature.
substantial and distinctive effects on protein concentrations and gene expression were evident among b <dig> oysters responding to elevated co <dig> or elevated temperature.
b <dig> oysters represent a unique genetic resource because of their capacity to better withstand the impacts of elevated co <dig> at the physiological level, compared to non-selected oysters from the same species .
the differential response of b <dig> oysters to the combined stressors also indicates that the addition of thermal stress may impair the resilience of these oysters to decreased ph.

the data suggest that the simultaneous exposure of co2-resilient oysters to near-future projected ocean ph and temperature results in complex changes in molecular processes in order to prevent stress-induced cellular damage.
this study characterises the molecular processes altered by both elevated co <dig> and increasing temperature in oysters.

the combination of both stressors also altered oyster gill proteomes and gene expression.
