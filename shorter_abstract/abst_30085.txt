the importance of these events resides not only in the study about relatedness among different species, but also to determine the mechanisms behind evolution.
sbs with more diversity in annotations and bps short and richer in dna replication and stress response, which are strongly linked with rearrangements.
using the concept of identity vectors for synteny blocks  and repetitions, a finite state machine is designed to detect transition points in the difference between such vectors.
