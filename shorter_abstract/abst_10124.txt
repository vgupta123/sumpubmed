thus, the similar cave phenotypes found in these caves are the result of repeated convergences.
these phenotypic convergences have occurred in spite of gene flow from surface populations suggesting either strong natural or sexual selection for alleles responsible for the cave phenotype in the cave environment.
cave populations receiving migrants from the surface contain small numbers of individuals that are intermediate in both phenotype and genotype, affirming at least limited gene flow from the surface.
cave populations had lower genetic diversity than surface populations, correlated with their smaller effective population sizes, probably the result of food and space limitations.
this admixture results in significant heterozygote deficiencies at numerous loci due to wahlund effects.
the cave populations we studied span the full range of the cave forms in three separate geographic regions and have at least five separate evolutionary origins.
we found that surface populations are similar to one another, despite their relatively large geographic separation, whereas the cave populations are better differentiated.
some of the cave populations receive migrants from the surface and exchange migrants with one another, especially when geographically close.
cave populations of this species are derived from two different surface stocks denoted "old" and "new."
we studied  <dig> cave and  <dig> surface populations of astyanax mexicanus in order to better understand the evolutionary origins of the cave forms, the basic genetic structuring of both cave and surface populations, and the degree to which present day migration among them affects their genetic divergence.
the old stock colonized caves at least three times independently while the new stock colonized caves at least twice independently.
