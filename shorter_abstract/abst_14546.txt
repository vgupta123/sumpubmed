we demonstrate our approach using expression data from a study of type  <dig> diabetes and another of the influence of cigarette smoke on gene expression in airway epithelia.
a comparison with results from the related approach, 'gene-set enrichment analysis', is also provided.
such an analysis can reveal features that are not easily visible from the variations in the individual genes and can lead to a picture of expression that is more biologically transparent and accessible to interpretation.
the results of a pathway-based analysis can be complementary to those obtained from one more focused on individual genes.
a number of interesting pathways are identified in comparisons between smokers and non-smokers including ones related to nicotine metabolism, mucus production, and glutathione metabolism.
the activity levels, which are derived from singular value decompositions, form the basis for statistical comparisons and other applications.
our method offers a flexible basis for identifying differentially expressed pathways from gene expression data.
in this article, we present a new method of this kind that operates by quantifying the level of 'activity' of each pathway in different samples.
a promising direction in the analysis of gene expression focuses on the changes in expression of specific predefined sets of genes that are known in advance to be related .
