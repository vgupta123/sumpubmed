taking advantage of the fluorescence characteristics of sanguinarine to follow its uptake and distribution suggests that these effects arise from a window of activity of a few hours immediately after drug addition, when sanguinarine is concentrated in the nucleus.
dna synthesis is transiently inhibited by sanguinarine, but cells recover their ability to synthesize dna within  <dig> hours.
sanguinarine transiently inhibits dna synthesis, but a novel mechanism of action appears to involve disrupting the trafficking of a number of molecules involved in cell cycle regulation and progression.
this growth inhibition is accompanied by a striking relocalization of cyclin d <dig> and topoisomerase ii from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this effect persists for at least three days after drug addition.
to more closely examine the responses of some of these cell cycle regulatory molecules to sanguinarine, we used immunocytochemical methods to visualize cyclin d <dig> and topoisomerase ii behavior in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.
it appears that sub-apoptotic concentrations of sanguinarine can suppress breast cancer cell proliferation for extended lengths of time, and that this effect results from a relatively brief period of activity when the drug is concentrated in the nucleus.
the ability of sub-apoptotic concentrations of sanguinarine to inhibit cell growth may be a useful feature for potential chemotherapeutic applications; however, a narrow effective range for these effects may exist.
