the c. parvum isolate was sequenced to a mean depth of  <dig> x with reads covering 100 % of the bases of the c. parvum iowa ii reference genome , while the c. hominis isolate was sequenced to a mean depth of  <dig> x with reads covering 98 % of the bases of the c. hominis tu <dig> v <dig> reference genome .
the method was then applied to a further  <dig> stools, successfully generating another eight new whole genome sequences, of which two were c. hominis  and six c. parvum , demonstrating the utility of this method to sequence cryptosporidium genomes directly from clinical samples.
whole genome sequencing  of cryptosporidium spp.
the ims-based method was used initially to sequence whole genomes of cryptosporidium hominis gp <dig> subtype iba10g <dig> and cryptosporidium parvum gp <dig> subtype iiaa19g1r <dig> from small amounts of stool left over from diagnostic testing of clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis.
ims was found to be superior to caesium chloride density centrifugation for purification of oocysts from small volume stool samples and for reducing levels of contaminant dna.
our method uses a combination of salt flotation, immunomagnetic separation , and surface sterilisation of oocysts prior to dna extraction, with subsequent use of the transposome-based nextera xt kit to generate libraries for sequencing on illumina platforms.
we have developed and validated a method for preparation of genomic cryptosporidium dna suitable for wgs directly from human stool samples and used it to generate  <dig> high-quality whole cryptosporidium genome assemblies.
this represents the first report of high-quality whole genome sequencing of cryptosporidium isolates prepared directly from human stool samples.
