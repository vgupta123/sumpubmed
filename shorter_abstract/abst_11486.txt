monoamines regulate animal physiology and behavior, including the post-mating behavior of females of the adzuki bean beetle, callosobruchus chinensis .
female mate choice after mating is a strong force in sexual selection and could lead to coevolution of mating traits between the sexes.

this study examined differences in females’ response to four monoamines  between strains from different populations of c. chinensis.
these differences in female response to monoamines, especially tyramine and serotonin, correspond with results of previous studies.
injection with either octopamine or tyramine, two kinds of monoamines significantly reduced female receptivity in two strains with low remating frequencies.
none of the four monoamines reduced female receptivity in one strain with high remating frequencies.
they indicate differences in female response to male substances that reduce receptivity and activate oviposition.
these findings suggest relationships between the differences in female response to male substances among populations and mutations in the pathways of monoamine biosynthesis or transmission, which in turn determine female mate choice in response to male substances.
how females of different genotypes respond to substances in the male ejaculate should be mediated by females’ mate choices.
