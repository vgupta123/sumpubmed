using a technique derived from the fields of statistical physics and information theory we designed a message-passing algorithm to estimate the size of the affine space containing all possible steady-state flux distributions of metabolic networks.
in this work we propose a novel algorithmic strategy that provides an efficient characterization of the whole set of stable fluxes compatible with the metabolic constraints.
we also verify that the predictions of the algorithm match closely those of monte carlo based methods in the case of the red blood cell metabolic network.
the algorithm we propose can be considered as an alternative to monte carlo sampling methods.
we propose a novel efficient distributed algorithmic strategy to estimate the size and shape of the affine space of a non full-dimensional convex polytope in high dimensions.
we first compare the accuracy of the predictions with an exact algorithm on small random metabolic networks.
cellular metabolism is one of the most investigated system of biological interactions.
the method is shown to obtain, quantitatively and qualitatively compatible results with the ones of standard algorithms  being still efficient on the analysis of large biological systems, where exact deterministic methods experience an explosion in algorithmic time.
then we test the effect of gene knock-outs on the size of the solution space in the case of e. coli central metabolism.
finally we analyze the statistical properties of the average fluxes of the reactions in the e. coli metabolic network.
the algorithm, based on the well known bethe approximation, can be used to approximately compute the volume of a non full-dimensional convex polytope in high dimensions.
