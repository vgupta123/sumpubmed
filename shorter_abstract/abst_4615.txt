benchmarking studies of our algorithm versus those reported in the literature shows that our algorithm provides clustering results with lower false positive and false negative rates.
the distance metric is the probability that a pair of protein sequences are of the same interpro family/domain, which facilitates the modelling of transitive homology closure to detect remote homologues.
here we report a novel clustering algorithm  that has been used to cluster sequences of experimentally verified and predicted proteins from all sequenced genomes using a novel distance metric which is a neural network score between a pair of protein sequences.
