in separate trials, homologous vsnjv strains , and heterologous strains  were inoculated into cattle via infected black fly bite.
clinical scores among viruses infecting cattle were significantly different and indicated that infection with a homologous virus resulted in more severe clinical presentation and greater extent and duration of viral shedding.
differences in clinical presentation and extent and duration of viral shedding may have direct impacts on viral spread during epidemics.
laboratory challenge of livestock with heterologous vsnjv strains to investigate potential viral predilections for these hosts has not been thoroughly investigated.
epidemiologic data collected during epidemics in the western united states combined with limited experimental studies involving swine and cattle suggest that host predilection of epidemic vesicular stomatitis new jersey virus  strains results in variations in clinical response, extent and duration of virus shedding and transmissibility following infection in different hosts.
no differences in clinical severity or extent and duration of viral shedding were detected in swine.
more virulent viral strains resulting in more severe disease in livestock hosts are expected to spread more rapidly and greater distances during epidemics than those causing mild or inapparent signs.
viral transmission via animal-to-animal contact and insect vectored transmission are likely to occur at higher rates when affected animals are presenting severe clinical signs and shedding high concentrations of virus.
