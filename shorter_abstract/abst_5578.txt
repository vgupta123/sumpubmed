pacs requires minimal sample processing, uses readily available taqman assays and can isolate cell subtypes with high sensitivity.
using a random priming rna-seq strategy, we obtained high-fidelity transcriptome measurements following pacsÂ sorting of prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population.
pcr-activated cell sorting  is a novel cytometry method that uses single-cell taqman pcr reactions performed in microfluidic droplets to identify and isolate cell subtypes with high-throughput.
rare cell subtypes can profoundly impact the course of human health and disease, yet their presence within a sample is often missed with bulk molecular analysis.
single-cell analysis tools such as facs, fish-fc and single-cell barcode-based sequencing can investigate cellular heterogeneity; however, they have significant limitations that impede their ability to identify and transcriptionally characterize many rare cell subpopulations.
this capability makes pacs well suited for transcriptional profiling of rare cells from complex populations to obtain maximal biological insight into cell states and behaviors.
