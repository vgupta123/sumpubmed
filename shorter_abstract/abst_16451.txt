reston ebolavirus  has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus monkeys  but is not associated with any human disease.
the high prevalence of rebov infection in swine in the affected farms in  <dig> suggests that swine is susceptible for rebov infection.
a total of  <dig> swine sera collected at two rebov-affected farms in  <dig>  in pangasinan and bulacan, were tested for the presence of rebov-specific antibodies using multiple serodiagnosis systems.
a total of  <dig> swine sera collected in a non-epizootic region, tarlac, were also tested to clarify the prevalence of rebov infection in the general swine population in the philippines.
some 70â€‰% of swine sera at the affected farms were positive for rebov antibodies in the multiple serodiagnosis systems.
on the other hand, none of the swine sera collected in tarlac showed positive reactions in any of the diagnosis systems.
the multiple serological assays used in the study are thought to be useful for future surveillance of reobv infection in swine in the philippines.
in late  <dig>  rebov infections were identified in swine for the first time in the philippines.
ebola viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates and are endemic in africa.
