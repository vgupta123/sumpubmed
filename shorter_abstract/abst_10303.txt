whereas replacements with xylan-specific cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> were more effective in enzymatic release of acetic acid from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw, and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan compared to axe <dig>  moreover, replacement with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> also resulted in higher degree releases of reducing sugar and acetic acid from different substrates when simultaneous hydrolysis with xylanase.
a good linear relationship exists between the acetic acid and reducing sugar release.
three recombinant axe1s fused with different xylan-specific cbms, together with wild-type axe <dig> with cbm <dig> and cbm1-deleted mutant axe1dc, were constructed in this study.
the optimal temperature and ph of recombinant axe1s was 50 °c and  <dig>  , respectively.
acetylation of the xylan backbone was a major obstacle to enzymatic decomposition.
removal of acetyl groups by acetyl xylan esterases  is essential for completely enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan.
fungal acetyl xylan esterases are strictly appended to cellulose-specific cbm <dig>  it is still unclear whether xylan-specific cbms have a greater advantage than cbm <dig> in potentiating the activity of fungal deacetylating enzymes and its synergistic hydrolysis of different substrates with xylanase.
our findings suggested that the replacement with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> not only significantly improved the catalysis efficiency of axe <dig>  but also increased its synergistic hydrolysis of different substrates with xylanase, indicating the significance of targeting effect in axe <dig> catalysis mediated by xylan-specific cbms.
however, replacement of cbm <dig> with xylan-specific cbm4- <dig> significantly enhanced axe <dig> thermostability and catalytic activity against soluble substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate.
cellulose-specific cbm <dig> in axe <dig> obviously contributed to its catalytic action against substrates compared with axe1dc.
