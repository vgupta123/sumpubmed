it exhibited very high thermostability, retaining 50% activity at 70°c after 9 days.
enzyme exhibited high tolerance to xylose, retained approximately 70% of relative activity at 210 mm xylose concentration.
thermostable β-xylosidases have been a focus of attention as industrially important enzymes due to their long shelf life and role in the relief of end-product inhibition of xylanases caused by xylo-oligosaccharides.
therefore, a highly thermostable β-xylosidase with high specific activity has significant potential in lignocellulose bioconversion.
specific activity was  <dig> u/mg when incubated with p-nitrophenyl xylopyranoside, with km and vmax values of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> u/mg, respectively.
high tolerance to elevated temperatures, high specific activity, conversion of xylo-oligomers to xylose, and resistance to inhibition from xylose, make this enzyme potentially suitable for various biotechnological applications.
sds-page analysis indicated that the recombinant enzyme had a mass of 58 kda, but omitting heating prior to electrophoresis increased the apparent mass to 230 kda, suggesting the enzyme exists as a tetramer.
thin layer chromatography showed that the enzyme had potential to convert xylo-oligomers  into fermentable xylose.
recombinant β-xylosidase was active over a wide range of temperatures and ph with optimum temperature of 70°c and ph  <dig> .
a gene encoding a highly thermostable gh <dig> β-xylosidase was cloned from geobacillus sp.
