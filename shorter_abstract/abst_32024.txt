behavioral experiments often indicate an important role for visual cues in fish, but their molecular basis remains almost entirely unknown.
animals utilize a wide variety of tactics to attract reproductive partners.
through mate-choice experiences using several laboratory strains of various body colors, we successfully identified one medaka mutant  that is distinctly unattractive to reproductive partners.
in addition, these results are the first demonstration of a single gene that can pleiotropically and harmoniously change both secondary sexual characters and mating preferences.
although theoretical models have long suggested joint evolution of linked genes on a chromosome, a mutation on a gene-regulatory region  might be sufficient to trigger two 'runaway' processes in different directions to promote  speciation.
studies on model species  allow investigations into this fundamental question in behavioral and evolutionary biology.
