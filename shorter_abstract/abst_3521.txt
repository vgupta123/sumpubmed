there was extensive differential ap gene transcription between the tick  and the human  cell lines, with far fewer differentially transcribed genes between the human cell lines, and all disproportionately represented by membrane or surface proteins.
ap alternately infects ticks and mammals and a variety of cell types within each.
anaplasma phagocytophilum  is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, an emerging tick-borne disease.
understanding the biology behind such versatile cellular parasitism may be derived through the use of tiling microarrays to establish high resolution, genome-wide transcription profiles of the organism as it infects cell lines representative of its life cycle  and pathogenesis .
there were ap genes exclusively transcribed in each cell line, apparent human- and tick-specific operons and paralogs, and anti-sense transcripts that suggest novel expression regulation processes.
seven virb <dig> paralogs  showed human or tick cell dependent transcription.
detailed, host cell specific transcriptional behavior was revealed.
using these methods, whole genome transcription profiles can likely be generated for ap, as well as other obligate intracellular organisms, in any host cells and for all stages of the cell infection process.
