wolbachia titer in adults was correlated with their ploidy and sex: diploids carried much higher wolbachia titers than haploids, and diploid females carried more wolbachia than diploid males.
seven to 39 % of these males are diploid, indicating that diploidization and female development can be uncoupled in a. japonica.
our data therefore support a two-step mechanism by which endosymbionts induce thelytoky in a. japonica: diploidization of the unfertilized egg is followed by feminization, whereby each step correlates with a threshold of endosymbiont titer during wasp development.
it is generally assumed that in thelytokous wasps, endosymbionts merely diploidize the unfertilized eggs, which would then trigger female development.
some species in these lineages reproduce by thelytoky that is caused by infection with endosymbionts: infected females lay haploid eggs that undergo diploidization and develop into females, while males are very rare or absent.

data from introgression lines indicated that the development of diploid individuals into males instead of females is not caused by malfunction-mutations in the host genome but that diploid males are most likely produced when the endosymbiont fails to activate the female sex determination pathway.
importantly, it also provides a novel window to study the yet-poorly known haplodiploid sex determination mechanisms in haplodiploid insects.
