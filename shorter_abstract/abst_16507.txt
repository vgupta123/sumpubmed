in a functional analysis of gene expression data, biclustering method can give crucial information by showing correlated gene expression patterns under a subset of conditions.
we propose a novel biclustering approach called “biclustering by correlated and large number of individual clustered seeds ” to find comprehensive sets of correlated expression patterns in biclusters using clustered seeds and their expansion with correlation of gene expression.
furthermore, in a real yeast microarray dataset and a lung cancer microarray dataset, biclic found more comprehensive sets of biclusters that are significantly enriched to more diverse sets of biological terms than those of other competing biclustering algorithms.
biclic provides significant benefits in finding comprehensive sets of correlated patterns and their functional implications from a gene expression dataset.
