the large number of map strains within a relatively small area of the country implies that the epidemiology of paratuberculosis in uganda may be complicated and needs further investigation.
phylogenetic analysis of ssr locus  <dig> sequences based on their single nucleotide polymorphisms separated the isolates into  <dig> genotypes.
the combination of the seven loci used in this study results into a very precise discrimination of isolates.
the occurrence of paratuberculosis in ugandan cattle has recently been reported but there is no information on the strains of mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  responsible for the disease.

we found that the use of ethylene glycol as a pcr additive improved the efficiency of the pcr reactions for mirus , vntr  <dig> and ssr .
finally, the use of ethylene glycol as a pcr additive increases the efficiency of pcr amplification of difficult templates.
there is a high strain diversity of map in uganda since  <dig> isolates could be classified into  <dig> genotypes.
