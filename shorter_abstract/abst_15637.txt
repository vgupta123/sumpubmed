further we identified novel target promoters of c-protein in m. gallisepticum.
we found that c-protein of m. gallisepticum binds predicted conserved direct repeats of the  <dig> motif.
in this work, we describe a novel group of transcriptional regulators that are distributed within different mollicutes and control the expression of restriction-modification systems .
apart from its own operon promoter, hsdc can bind to the promoters of the clpb chaperone gene and a trna cluster.
