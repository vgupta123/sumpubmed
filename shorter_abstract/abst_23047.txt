we conclude that the lack of crp <dig> is associated with alterations in cardiomyocyte thickness and hypertrophy.
the cysteine and glycine rich protein  <dig>  encoded by the csrp <dig> gene is a lim domain protein expressed in the vascular system, particularly in smooth muscle cells.
in these mice, the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level.
however, detailed histological and electron microscopic studies reveal that crp2-deficient mice have subtle alterations in their cardiac ultrastructure.
using this construct we confirmed the recently determined chromosomal localization .
