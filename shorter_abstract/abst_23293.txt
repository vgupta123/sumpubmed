attempting to understand these multifactorial associations for mastitis within larger management groups continues to play an important role in mastitis control programs.
the results differed substantially by housing system and outcome.
the proportion of high scc was mainly associated with dry cow udder controls , clean bedding material at calving , using total merit values to select bulls  and body condition scoring .
in tie-stall systems, clinical mastitis incidence was mainly affected by region  =  <dig> ), the dairy herd replacement system  and farmers age .
the median incidence of farmer-reported clinical mastitis  was  <dig>   cases per  <dig> cows per year.
in free-stall systems, the irr for clinical mastitis was mainly associated with stall climate/temperature , comfort mats as resting surface  and when no feed analysis was carried out .

there were substantial differences in identified risk factors in the four models.
this highlights the multifactorial nature of the disease and the differences in the risks for both mastitis manifestations.
to assess the association between management practices and mastitis incidence, data collected in  <dig> by a survey among  <dig> randomly selected swiss dairy farms, and information from the regular test day recordings from  <dig> of these farms was analyzed.
a multivariable negative binomial regression model was fitted for each of the mastitis indicators for farms with tie-stall and free-stall housing systems separately to study the effect of other  management practices on the icm and pscc events .
