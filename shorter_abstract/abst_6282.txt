analysis of the experimental validation of pythia-design peptides indicates that binding of ivig is favored by epitopes that contain trypthophan and cysteine.
understanding the interactions between antibodies and the linear epitopes that they recognize is an important task in the study of immunological diseases.
we present a novel computational method for the design of linear epitopes of specified binding affinity to intravenous immunoglobulin .
