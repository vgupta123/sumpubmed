n-h exchange reactions of the flavin reduced form and its ph dependence were studied using the 15n-nmr-signals of 15n-enriched, reduced flavin in the ph range from  <dig> to  <dig>  the chemical shifts of the n and n resonances are not affected to a relevant extent in this ph range.
it is a doublet between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  that coalesces into a singlet at lower and higher ph values.
the present work addresses properties of reduced flavin relevant in this context.
the multiplicity of the 15n signal and the proton exchange rates are little dependent on the buffer system used.
the exchange rates allow an estimation of the pka value of n-h deprotonation in reduced flavin to be â‰¥  <dig>  this value imposes specific constraints for mechanisms of flavoprotein catalysis based on this process.
from the line width of the 15n signal the ph-dependent rate of hydrogen exchange was deduced.
