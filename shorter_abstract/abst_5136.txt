the rapid growth of biomedical literature presents challenges for automatic text processing, and one of the challenges is abbreviation identification.
an automatic way to estimate the accuracy of abbreviation-definition pairs extracted from text is needed.
on the medstract corpus our algorithm produced 97% precision and 85% recall which is higher than previously reported results.
on this set we achieved  <dig> % precision and  <dig> % recall.
we also annotated  <dig> randomly selected medline records as a gold standard.
we developed an algorithm for abbreviation identification that uses a variety of strategies to identify the most probable definition for an abbreviation and also produces an estimated accuracy of the result.
this compares favourably with the well known schwartz and hearst algorithm.
