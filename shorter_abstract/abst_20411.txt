analysis of these genes and their biological functions suggests the involvement of at least six biological processes in light-induced delay phase shifts of rhythmic activities.
for example, while continuous light normally causes arrhythmicity in wild-type flies, the knockdown of kr-h <dig>  nipped-a, thor, nrv <dig>  nf <dig>  cg <dig> , and fmr <dig> resulted in flies that were rhythmic, suggesting a disruption in the light input pathway to the clock.
we then analysed changes in gene expression 1 h after the light stimulus.
we identified  <dig> genes whose transcripts were significantly altered in response to the light pulse at a false discovery rate cut-off of 10 %.
flies were subjected to a 30-min light pulse during the early night , a stimulus which causes a substantial phase delay of the circadian rhythm.
using rnai, the expression of  <dig> genes was downregulated in the clock neurons, leading to significant effects on circadian output.
in drosophila, light entrainment is mediated by the photosensitive protein cryptochrome, but the role and extent of transcription regulation in light resetting of the dipteran clock is yet unknown.
