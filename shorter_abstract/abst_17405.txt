the space generated from pairwise similarities is capable of classifying neuronal arbor types as well as, or better than, traditional topological metrics.
unsupervised cluster analysis produces groups that significantly correspond with known cell classes for axons, dendrites, and pyramidal apical dendrites.
moreover, comparison of multiple alignment with motif analysis shows that the two techniques provide complementary information respectively revealing global and local features.
we implemented a modified global alignment algorithm representing axonal and dendritic bifurcations as strings of characters.
interestingly, the axons of dendritic-targeting interneurons in the rodent cortex associates with pyramidal axons but apart from the  axons of perisomatic-targeting interneurons.
furthermore, the distinguishing consensus topology generated by multiple sequence alignment of a group of neurons reveals their shared branching blueprint.
global pairwise and multiple sequence alignment of neurite topologies enables detailed comparison of neurites and identification of conserved topological features in alignment-defined clusters.
