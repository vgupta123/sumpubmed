mf <dig> likely encodes an enzyme involved in ip synthesis, dh <dig> encodes a transporter responsible for ip transport across organs and cb <dig> encodes a transporter involved in ip co-transport into vesicles.
differentially expressed gene analyses showed that the expression of mips and itpk was related to differences in ip metabolism in qi <dig> and b <dig>  moreover, wrky and ethylene-responsive transcription factors  were common among the differentially expressed tfs, and are likely to be involved in the regulation of ip metabolism.
by integrating the metabolite data with the rna-seq data at three different kernel developmental stages , co-regulatory networks were constructed to explore ip metabolism and its interactions with other pathways.
some mutant or rnai lines exhibited seeds with a low-phytic-acid phenotype, indicating perturbation of ip metabolism.
this study provides new insights into ip metabolism and regulation, and facilitates our development of a better understanding of the functions of ips and how they interact with other pathways involved in plant development and stress responses.
three new genes were discovered and preliminarily validated, thereby increasing our knowledge of ip metabolism.
in this study, the b <dig>  and qi <dig>  lines were selected for rna-seq analysis from  <dig> inbred lines based on a screening of ip levels.
however, the metabolic pathways and possible regulatory mechanisms of ips in maize are unclear.
ips play important roles in plant development, stress responses, and signal transduction.
d-myo-inositol phosphates  are a series of phosphate esters.
finally, three candidate genes  were identified and validated using arabidopsis lines with mutations in orthologous genes or rna interference -transgenic maize lines.
