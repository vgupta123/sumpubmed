this technology incorporates an accurate, automated and cost effective ligation independent cloning step to directly integrate the synthetic genes into an effective escherichia coli expression vector.
large scale recombinant expression of synthetic genes encoding eukaryotic toxins will allow exploring the extraordinary potency and pharmacological diversity of animal venoms, an increasingly valuable but unexplored source of lead molecules for drug discovery.
de novo gene synthesis is quickly replacing the classical cloning and mutagenesis procedures and allows generating nucleic acids for which no template is available.
the robustness of this technology to generate large libraries of dozens to thousands of synthetic nucleic acids was demonstrated through the parallel and simultaneous synthesis of  <dig> genes encoding animal toxins.
here, we describe the development of an optimized gene synthesis platform that was applied to the large scale production of small genes encoding venom peptides.

gene synthesis is becoming an important tool in many fields of recombinant dna technology, including recombinant protein production.
this improved gene synthesis method uses a pcr-based protocol to assemble synthetic dna from pools of overlapping oligonucleotides and was developed to synthesise multiples genes simultaneously.
an automated platform was developed for the large-scale synthesis of small genes encoding eukaryotic toxins.
in addition, when coupled with efficient gene design algorithms that optimize codon usage, it leads to high levels of recombinant protein expression.
