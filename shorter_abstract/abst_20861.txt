almost all multiple myeloma patients develop osteolytic bone lesions associated with severe and debilitating bone pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression, as well as increased mortality.
a number of proteins were identified which were statistically significantly correlated with bone disease, including enzymes, extracellular matrix glycoproteins, and components of the complement system.
bone destruction is a feature of multiple myeloma, characterised by osteolytic bone destruction due to increased osteoclast activity and suppressed or absent osteoblast activity.
a label-free mass spectrometry-based strategy was employed for discovery phase analysis of fractionated patient serum samples associated with no or high bone disease.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of complement c <dig> and serum paraoxonase/arylesterase  <dig> indicated that these proteins were associated with high bone disease in a larger independent cohort of patient samples.
however, more accurate biomarkers are needed to effectively mirror the dynamics of bone disease activity.
these biomolecules may therefore be clinically useful in assessing the extent of bone disease.
