according to our results, spl <dig> would be initially located to endomembranes and activated during er stress as a result of cu deficiency.
previously, it was reported that the spl <dig> sbp domain does not bind to dna in vitro in the presence of cu ions and that spl <dig> interacts with a kin <dig> domain protein to raise spl7-target gene expression upon cu deprivation.
furthermore, we added the spl <dig> dimerization in the presence of cu ions as an additional regulatory mechanism to modulate the cu deficiency response.
plant cells require cu to maintain essential processes, such as photosynthesis, scavenging reactive oxygen species, cell wall lignification and hormone sensing.
cytological and biochemical approaches confirmed an operative transmembrane domain  and uncovered a dual localisation of spl <dig> between the nucleus and an endomembrane system, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum .
these observations, in combination with the constitutive activation of spl <dig> targets, when ectopically expressing the n-terminal part of spl <dig> including the sbp domain, shed some light on the mechanisms governing spl <dig> function.
as spl <dig> transcript levels are largely non-responsive to cu availability, post-translational modification seems an obvious possibility.
moreover, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays revealed that spl <dig> is able to homodimerize, probably mediated by the irpgc domain.
here we report how additional conserved spl <dig> protein domains may contribute to the cu deficiency response in arabidopsis.
this new perspective unveiled a possible link between cu deficit and er stress, a metabolic dysfunction found capable of inducing spl <dig> targets in an spl7-dependent manner.
