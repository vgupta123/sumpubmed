in a previous study, functional evidence for a neuroblastoma suppressor gene on chromosome  <dig> was obtained through microcell mediated chromosome transfer, indicated by differentiation of neuroblastoma cells with loss of distal 11q upon introduction of chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, some of these microcell hybrid clones were shown to harbour deletions in the transferred chromosome  <dig>  we decided to further exploit this model system as a means to identify candidate tumour suppressor or differentiation genes located on chromosome  <dig>
deletions are typically large and mapping efforts have thus far not lead to a well defined consensus region, which hampers the identification of positional candidate tumour suppressor genes.
loss of chromosome 11q defines a subset of high-stage aggressive neuroblastomas.
subsequent correlation of these deletion events with the observed morphological changes lead to the delineation of three putative regions on chromosome 11: 11q <dig>  11p13->11p <dig>  and 11p <dig> , that may harbour the responsible differentiation gene.
additional studies will be required to clarify the putative role of the genes located in these chromosomal segments in the observed differentiation phenotype specifically or in neuroblastoma pathogenesis in general.
using an available model system, we were able to put forward some candidate regions that may be involved in neuroblastoma.
several deletions in both parental and transferred chromosomes in the investigated microcell hybrids were observed.
