to address this resource shortfall we produced a c. maenas transcriptome, enabled by the progress in next-generation sequencing technologies, and applied this to assemble information on the innate immune system in this species.
we isolated and pooled rna for twelve different tissues and organs from c. maenas individuals and sequenced the rna using next generation sequencing on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform.
we have produced an assembled transcriptome for c. maenas that provides a significant molecular resource for wide ranging studies in this species.
however, the genomic resources for this organism are still sparse, limiting research progress in these fields.
the european shore crab, carcinus maenas, is used widely in biomonitoring, ecotoxicology and for studies into host-pathogen interactions.
analysis of the transcriptome has revealed the presence of a series of known targets and functional pathways that form part of their innate immune system and illustrate tissue specific differences in their expression patterns.
based on sequence homology to immune system components in other organisms, we show both the presence of transcripts for a series of known pathogen recognition receptors and response proteins that form part of the innate immune system, and transcripts representing the rnai, toll-like receptor signalling, imd and jak/stat pathways.
there were differential patterns of expression for between  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts across tissues and organs with over-represented gene ontology terms relating to their specific function.
