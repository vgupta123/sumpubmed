prv is also prevalent in wild and farmed salmon without overt disease manifestations, suggesting multifactorial triggers or prv variant-specific factors are required to initiate disease.
prv does not substantially alter the head kidney transcriptome of sockeye salmon during early  infection and dissemination in a period of significant increasing viral load, nor does the presence of prv change the host transcriptional response to an ihnv superinfection.
prior infection with prv had no significant effect on host responses to superinfecting ihnv, nor did host responses initiated by ihnv exposure influence increasing prv loads.
in this study, we explore the head kidney transcriptome of sockeye salmon oncorhynchus nerka during early prv infection to identify host responses in the absence of disease in hopes of elucidating mechanisms by which prv may directly alter host functions and contribute to the development of a disease state.
de novo transcriptome assembly of over  <dig>  billion paired rna-seq reads from the head kidneys of  <dig> fish identified more than  <dig>  putative unigenes, of which less than  <dig> were suggested to be differentially expressed in response to prv at either  <dig> or 3 weeks post challenge by deseq <dig> and edger analysis.
challenge of sockeye salmon with prv resulted in high quantities of viral transcripts to become present in the blood and kidney of infected fish without manifestations of disease.

further, concurrent infections of prv and ihnv do not appear to significantly influence the infectivity or severity of ihnv associated disease, or conversely, prv load.
