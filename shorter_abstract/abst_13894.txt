an initial investigation of the e. crypticus transcriptome including an associated microarray platform for future studies proves to be a valuable resource to investigate functional genomics mechanisms of toxicity in soil environments and to annotate a potentially large number of lineage specific genes that are responsive to environmental stress conditions.
concerning assembly quality, 84% of the contig sequences contain an open reading frame with a start codon while e. crypticus homologs were identified for 92% of the core eukaryotic genes.
unexpectedly, the microarray data suggest that zinc exposure alters retro transposon activity in the e. crypticus genome.
in total,  <dig> significantly differentially regulated transcripts were identified upon zinc exposure.
several significantly regulated genes exerted predicted functions  associated with zinc stress.
overall, 70% of all probes signaled expression above background levels .
an agilent 180 k microarray platform was designed and validated by hybridizing cdna from 4 day zinc- exposed e. crypticus to the concentration corresponding to 50% reduction in reproduction after three weeks .
the soil worm enchytraeus crypticus  is an ecotoxicology model species that, until now, was without genome or transcriptome sequence information.
the present research aims at studying the transcriptome of enchytraeus crypticus, sampled from multiple test conditions, and the construction of a high-density microarray for functional genomic studies.
