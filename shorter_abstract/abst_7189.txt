the down-regulated wnt target mrnas were able to bind to thoc <dig>  furthermore, pathological alterations in the gastrointestinal tract induced translocation of intestinal bacteria and caused sepsis in mice.

these data imply that thoc <dig> may be a useful tool for studying intestinal stem cells, for modifying the differentiation processes and for cancer therapy.
to examine whether thoc <dig> plays a role in general differentiation processes, we generated tamoxifen inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice.
furthermore, thoc <dig> is dispensable for general mrna export in terminally differentiated organs, indicating that multiple mrna export pathways exist.
we further show that thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of mrnas induced by wnt  signaling which play key roles in epithelial cell differentiation/proliferation.
thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of only a subset of mrnas, but plays a key role in processing of mrnas inducible by wnt signals.
a subset of wnt target mrnas, sry-box containing gene  <dig> , and achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig> , but not fibronectin  <dig> , were down-regulated in thoc <dig> knockout intestinal cells.
depletion of the thoc <dig> gene did not cause pathological alterations in liver or kidney.
using an interferon inducible knockout mouse system, we have previously shown that thoc <dig> is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and cytokine-mediated hematopoiesis in adult mice.
