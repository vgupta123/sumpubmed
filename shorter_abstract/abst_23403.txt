study streams differed by group according to morphology, land use, and water chemistry but not in biofilm community structure.
we evaluated benthic biofilm community composition as a proxy for stream chemistry so as to segregate anthropogenic signatures in eight arkansas river catchments.
instead, alterations in biofilm community composition, as induced by fracking, may be less specific than initially predicted, and thus more easily confounded by agriculture and urbanization effects .
study streams must be carefully categorized with regard to the magnitude and extent of anthropogenic impacts.

biofilm communities at picz-sites were significantly less variable than those at micz-sites.
