nkx <dig>  and arx represent key transcription factors implicated in the specification of islet cell subtypes during pancreas development.
the combined loss of nkx <dig>  and arx likewise results in the formation of a hyperplastic ghrelin+ cell population at the expense of mature alpha- and beta-cells.
hence in order to precise the functional link between both factors we performed a comparative analysis of nkx <dig> /arx single- and double-mutants but also of pax6-deficient animals.
in nkx <dig>  mutant animals, alpha- and beta-cell development is severely impaired whereas a ghrelin-expressing cell population is found augmented.
surprisingly, such nkx <dig> -/-arx- ghrelin+ cells also express the somatostatin hormone.
we show that most of the ghrelin+ cells emerging in pancreata of nkx <dig> - and pax6-deficient mice, express the alpha-cell specifier arx, but also additional beta-cell related genes.
