both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase require nadph as the electron donor to reduce oxidized thioredoxin or glutathione .
the crystal structure of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  from saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined at  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement.
as the third enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  is the main generator of cellular nadph.
since thioredoxin and gsh are important antioxidants, it is not surprising that 6pgdh plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress.
in addition, two citrate molecules occupied the 6pg binding pocket of each monomer.
moreover, the co-crystallized citrate molecules, which mimic the binding mode of the substrate 6-phosphogluconate, provided us a novel strategy to design the 6pdgh inhibitors.
the overall structure of gnd <dig> is a homodimer with three domains for each monomer, a rossmann fold nadp+ binding domain, an all-α helical domain contributing the majority to hydrophobic interaction between the two subunits and a small c-terminal domain penetrating the other subunit.
the c-terminal domain of gnd <dig> functions as a hook to further tighten the dimer, but it is not necessary for the dimerization.
enzymatic activity assays suggest a sequential mechanism of catalysis, which is in agreement with previous studies.
