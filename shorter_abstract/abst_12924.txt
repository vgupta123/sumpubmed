ahrr, nqo <dig> and members of the cyp family were significantly induced following exposure to tcdd across the studies as expected while aldh3a <dig> was induced specifically in rat liver.
exposure to tcdd causes a wide range of toxic outcomes, ranging from chloracne to acute lethality.
specifically, we have created a datasets package – tcdd.transcriptomics – for the r statistical environment, consisting of  <dig> unique experiments comprising  <dig> samples, including various combinations of  <dig> species ,  <dig> tissue types  and a wide range of tcdd exposure times and doses.
to demonstrate the utility of this r package, a subset of “ahr-core” genes were evaluated across the included datasets.
the severity of toxicity is highly dependent on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor .
<dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is the most potent congener of the dioxin class of environmental contaminants.
we therefore compiled a collection of transcriptomic datasets that can be used to aid the scientific community in better understanding the transcriptional effects of ligand-activated ahr.
we believe that this package, which is freely available for download  will prove to be a highly beneficial resource to the scientific community evaluating the effects of tcdd exposure as well as the variety of functions of the ahr.
studies evaluating the transcriptional changes brought on by tcdd may provide valuable insight into the role of the ahr in human health and disease.
