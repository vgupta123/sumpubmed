marine mammal isolates represent a distinct, though rather weakly supported, cluster within which individual sts display one of three clear host preferences.
concatenated sequence data were used to construct an unrooted neighbour-joining tree representing the relationships between sts.
the sequence database provides a powerful dataset for addressing ongoing controversies in brucella taxonomy and a tool for unambiguously placing atypical, phenotypically discordant or newly emerging brucella isolates.
this shows that four previously characterized classical brucella species, b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. ovis and b. neotomae correspond to well-separated clusters.
brucella species include economically important zoonotic pathogens that can infect a wide range of animals.
with the exception of biovar  <dig>  b. suis isolates cluster together, although they form a more diverse group than other classical species with a number of distinct sts corresponding to the remaining four biovars.
b. canis isolates are located on the same branch very closely related to, but distinguishable from, b. suis biovar  <dig> and  <dig> isolates.
in order to investigate genetic relationships within the group and identify potential diagnostic markers we have sequenced multiple genetic loci from a large sample of brucella isolates representing the known diversity of the genus.
nine discrete genomic loci corresponding to  <dig>  bp of sequence were examined from  <dig> brucella isolates.
most loci examined represent housekeeping gene loci and, in all but one case, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous change was substantially < <dig>  analysis of linkage equilibrium between loci indicated a strongly clonal overall population structure.
by assigning each distinct allele at a locus an arbitrary numerical designation the population was found to represent  <dig> distinct sequence types .
