we resequenced a permanent population consisting of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines and constructed a genetic map to improve the sesame genome assembly.
the new genome assembly  included  <dig>  % of the scaffolds greater than 150 kb in size present in assembly version  <dig>  and increased the total pseudomolecule length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb with  <dig>  % of the genome assembled and  <dig>  % of the predicted gene models anchored.
based on the new genome assembly, a bin map including  <dig>  bins spanning  <dig>  cm was generated and used to identified  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for sesame plant height and  <dig> for seed coat color.
the map and updated genome assembly are expected to serve as a platform for future comparative genomics and genetic studies.
the sesame genome was de novo sequenced and assembled in  <dig> ; however, the number of anchored pseudomolecules was higher than the chromosome number  due to the lack of a high-density genetic map with  <dig> linkage groups.
this study offers a high-density genetic map and an improved assembly of the sesame genome.
the plant height-related qtls explained 3–24 % the phenotypic variation , and  <dig> of them were detected in at least two field trials.
for the sesame seed coat color, the qtls of the color spaces l*, a*, and b* were detected with contribution rates of 3–46 %.
this is the first report of a sesame semi-dwarf locus and provides an interesting opportunity for a plant architecture study of the sesame.
qph- <dig> , is predicted to be responsible for the semi-dwarf sesame plant phenotype and contains  <dig> candidate genes.
two major loci  that contributed  <dig> and 18 % of the plant height were located in  <dig> and 928-kb spaces on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  respectively.
the number of linkage groups and pseudomolecules in this assembly equals the number of sesame chromosomes for the first time.
