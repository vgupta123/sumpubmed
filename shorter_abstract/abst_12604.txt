asian rust  is a common disease in brazilian soybean fields and it is difficult to control.
its role on inhibiting germination of fungal spores makes it an eligible candidate gene for the control of asian rust.
to identify a biochemical candidate with potential to combat this disease, a new chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  from coffee   leaves was cloned into the pgapzÎ±-b vector for expression in pichia pastoris.
a cdna encoding a chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  from coffee  , was isolated from leaves.
however, it inhibited xylanases from acrophialophora nainiana by approx.
our data suggests that caclxip belongs to a class of naturally inactive chitinases that have evolved to act in plant cell defence as xylanase inhibitors.
60% when present at 12: <dig>  enzyme:inhibitor ratio.
caclxip was expressed as a recombinant protein in pichia pastoris.
the amino acid sequence predicts a  <dig> topology common to class iii chitinases , and shares similarity with other gh <dig> members, although it lacks the glutamic acid residue essential for catalysis, which is replaced by glutamine.
enzymatic assay showed that purified recombinant caclxip had only residual chitinolytic activity.
