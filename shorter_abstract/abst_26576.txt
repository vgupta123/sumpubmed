here we describe the construction and characterization of a null allele of the gene that encodes the rna chaperone hfq in shewanella oneidensis strain mr- <dig>  a dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium.
loss of hfq in s. oneidensis results in a variety of mutant phenotypes, all of which are fully complemented by addition of a plasmid-borne copy of the wild type hfq gene.
our results also suggest that hfq mutant phenotypes in s. oneidensis may be at least partially due to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.
hfq is an rna chaperone protein that has been broadly implicated in srna function in bacteria.
we have observed a similar growth phenotype when the hfq∆  mutant is cultured under anaerobic conditions with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor, and we have found that the hfq∆  mutant is defective in cr reduction.
aerobic cultures of the hfq∆  mutant grow more slowly through exponential phase than wild type cultures, and hfq∆  cultures reach a terminal cell density in stationary phase that is ~2/ <dig> of that observed in wild type cultures.
the hfq mutant in s. oneidensis exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including a defect in metal reduction.

finally, the hfq∆  mutant exhibits a striking loss of colony forming units in extended stationary phase and is highly sensitive to oxidative stress induced by h2o <dig> or methyl viologen .
