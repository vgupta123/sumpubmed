synaptic burst activation feeds back as a short-term depression of release probability at hippocampal ca3-ca <dig> synapses.
the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the components contributing to the depression of release probability in these two different scenarios.
our results suggest that activated astrocytes depress the release probability via two different mechanisms; by depression of vesicular release probability only at inactive synapses and by imposing a delay in the recovery of the primed pool of vesicles following depletion.
this selective depression of only the first response in a high-frequency burst was shared by the homosynaptic post-burst depression, but it was partially counteracted by augmentation at these recently active synapses.
this short-term synaptic plasticity requires functional astrocytes and it affects both the recently active  synapses  as well as inactive neighboring synapses .
these mechanisms restrict the expression of the astrocyte-mediated depression to temporal windows that are typical for synaptic burst activity.
