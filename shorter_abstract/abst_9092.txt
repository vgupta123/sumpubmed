for example, pathogen-produced exotoxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b  and anthrax lethal factor  have been shown to disrupt the fas-mediated apoptotic pathway  <cit> .
these levels were used to impute relative rate constants and build a quantitative model consisting of a series of ordinary differential equations  that simulate the network under both normal and pathogen-influenced conditions.
we stimulated human jurkat cells with an anti-fas antibody in the presence and absence of seb and determined the relative levels of seven proteins involved in the core pathway at five time points following exposure.
our model accurately reflects these results and reveals intervention points that can be altered to restore seb-influenced system dynamics back to levels within the range of normal conditions.
experimental results show that cells exposed to seb exhibit an increase in the rate of executioner caspase expression  of  <dig> hour  <dig> minutes , as compared to cells undergoing normal cell death.
such comparisons can expose both the proteins most susceptible to alteration by the agent as well as the most critical reaction rates to better instill control on a biological network.
