to address this, we studied the relation between environmental variability and modularity in a natural and well-studied system, the metabolic networks of bacteria.
we find that metabolic networks of organisms in variable environments are significantly more modular than networks of organisms that evolved under more constant conditions.
this study supports the view that variability in the natural habitat of an organism promotes modularity in its metabolic network and perhaps in other biological systems.
recent theory suggests that modularity can be enhanced when the environment changes over time.
biological systems are often modular: they can be decomposed into nearly-independent structural units that perform specific functions.
