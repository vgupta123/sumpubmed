a nearly identical ice was found in a. mediterranea med <dig> and vibrio cholera ahv <dig> isolated from a human pathogen, indicating the potential exchange of these genes across phylogenetic distances exceeding the family threshold.
the cargo genes found in these plasmids included cassettes found before in chromosome flexible genomic islands of alteromonas strains.
integrative and conjugative elements  were more common than plasmids and showed similar patterns of variation with cargo genes coding for components of additive flexible genomic islands.
we have seen evidence of how ces can be vectors to transfer gene cassettes acquired in the chromosomal flexible genomic islands, both of the additive and replacement kind.
they could represent the transport vectors for the previously described replacement flexible genomic islands.

however, the main genetic exchange drivers in these microbes, conjugative elements , have not been considered in detail thus far.
to develop evolutionary models for the free living bacterium alteromonas the genome sequences of isolates of the genus have been extensively analyzed.
