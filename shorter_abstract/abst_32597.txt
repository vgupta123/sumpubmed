the results showed that specific chromatin modifications occurring at il- <dig> gene, including histone h <dig> acetylation and methylation, mark lps-mediated il- <dig> activation in intestinal epithelial cells while it is unlikely that dna methylation of il- <dig> promoter is directly involved in il- <dig> gene regulation in these cells.
inhibitors of histone deacetylases could induce il- <dig> mrna expression also in the absence of lps, suggesting that chromatin modifications could be involved in il- <dig> gene regulation.
chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that, concurrently with il- <dig> activation, transient specific changes in h <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation occurred at il- <dig> gene promoter during lps stimulation.
the release of lps by bacteria stimulates both immune and specific epithelial cell types to release inflammatory mediators.
because it is now emerging that bacteria may induce alteration of epigenetic patterns in host cells, we have investigated whether lps-induced il- <dig> activation in human intestinal epithelial cells involves changes of histone modifications and/or dna methylation at il- <dig> gene regulatory region.
dna demethylating agents had no effects on il- <dig> expression, suggesting that dna methylation was not involved in il- <dig> gene regulation.
