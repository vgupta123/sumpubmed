atoc is the response regulator of the atos-atoc two-component system and it functions as the positive transcriptional regulator of the atodaeb operon genes, encoding enzymes involved in short chain fatty acid metabolism.
in addition, a selection of synthetic polyamine analogues have been synthesized and tested for their effectiveness in inducing the expression of atoc/az, the product of which plays a pivotal role in the feedback inhibition of putrescine biosynthesis and the transcriptional regulation of the ato operon.
the roles of polyamines on the transcription of atos and atoc genes as well as that of atodaeb operon were studied.
the polyamine analogues were also tested for their effect on the activity of ornithine decarboxylase , the key enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis and on the growth of polyamine-deficient e. coli.
in addition, a series of polyamine analogues were studied on the transcription of atoc gene and odc activity.
polyamines, which have been reported to induce the protein levels of atoc/az in e. coli, act at the transcriptional level, since they cause activation of the atoc transcription.
the antizyme is referred to as atoc/az, to indicate its dual function as both a transcriptional and post-translational regulator.
antizyme  has long been identified as a non-competitive protein inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis in e. coli.
polyamine-mediated induction was tested both in atosc positive and negative e. coli backgrounds by using Î²-galactosidase reporter constructs carrying the appropriate promoters patodaeb, patos, patoc.
az was also revealed to be the product of the atoc gene.
the effects of these compounds were also determined on the ato operon expression.
