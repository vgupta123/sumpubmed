these results provide a necessary resource for the canine genome mapping community to undertake positional cloning experiments and provide new insights into the comparative canine-human genome maps.
for  <dig> markers, the orthologous human genes have been established, allowing the identification of  <dig> conserved segments  between the dog and human genomes, dramatically extending the length of most previously described cs.
to facilitate both genetic mapping and cloning efforts, we have constructed an integrated canine genome map that is both dense and accurate.
the radiation hybrid  map features a density of one marker every  <dig> kb and contains  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome clones  localized to  <dig> unique positions,  <dig> of which have also been mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
excluding the y chromosome, the map features an rh/fish mapped bac every  <dig>  mb and an rh mapped bac-end, on average, every  <dig> mb.
