aggregation inhibitors are expected to reduce α-synuclein cytotoxicity, and an aggregation accelerator has recently been reported to reduce α-synuclein cytotoxicity.
in this study, we selected as the target a very hydrophobic region known as the amyloid-core-forming region.
we screened peptide ligands against α-synuclein by in silico panning, a method which we have proposed previously.
since this region cannot be dissolved in water, it is difficult to carry out the in vitro screening of its peptide ligand.
therefore, amyloid aggregation modulating ligands are expected to serve as therapeutic medicines.
we carried out  <dig> rounds of in silico panning using a genetic algorithm and a docking simulation.
after the in silico panning, we evaluated the top peptides screened in silico by in vitro assay.
