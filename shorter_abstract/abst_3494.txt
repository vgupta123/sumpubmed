teak defoliator outbreaks are a regular annual feature in most teak plantations in india and it is extremely difficult to predict the exact time and place of occurrence of these outbreaks.
evidence from the study of the population dynamics of h. puera indicated habitual, short range movements of emerging moth populations, suggesting that these populations have spread to larger areas, generation after generation, affecting the entire teak plantations.
we were therefore interested in investigating the temporal and spatial relationship among various population groups in nilambur, kerala  and address the cause of outbreak at the landscape level.
this pest is of major concern as it is involved in complete defoliation of trees during the early part of the growing season.
defoliation does not kill teak trees, but it results in huge amount of timber loss.
this method also allowed us to comment with some certainty that the endemic teak defoliator, h. puera do not play a major role in contributing to large-scale infestations.
the teak defoliator  is a pest moth of teak woodlands in india and other tropical regions  and is of major economic significance.
we have used this method extensively to evaluate the species specificity, reproducibility and to discriminate among the three different characterised populations of teak defoliator.
