we applied long-range pcr to amplify hla-b for  <dig> samples followed by transposase-based library construction and multiplex sequencing with the miseq sequencer.
here we report a simple, high-throughput, and cost-effective sequencing method that includes normalized library preparation and adjustment of dna molar concentration.
our hla sequencing method optimized for  <dig> multiplexing samples is highly time effective and cost effective and is especially suitable for automated multi-sample library preparation and sequencing.
