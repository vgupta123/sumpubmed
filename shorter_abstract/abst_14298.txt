this study provides an example of extension of genomic resources from a well supported species to an orphan crop.
using a 15% outlying score cut-off,  <dig> potential sfps were enumerated between two parents of a recombinant inbred line  population segregating for several important traits including drought tolerance, fusarium and brown blotch resistance, grain size and photoperiod sensitivity.
sequencing of  <dig> putative polymorphism-containing amplicons yielded a sfp probe set validation rate of 68%.
high density genetic linkage maps are needed for marker assisted breeding but are not available for cowpea.
a single feature polymorphism  is a microarray-based marker which can be used for high throughput genotyping and high density mapping.
we conclude that the affymetrix soybean genome array is a satisfactory platform for identification of some 1000's of sfps for cowpea.
