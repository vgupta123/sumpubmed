homeostasis of ions and water is important for the maintenance of cellular functions.
this is the first study to provide transcriptomic analysis of pvcs and mrcs in gills of eels adapted to fw or sw environments.
in this study, transcriptome analyses were conducted using pvcs and mrcs isolated from japanese eels adapted to fw or sw environments to provide a genome-wide molecular study to unravel the fundamental processes at work.
the study identified more than  <dig>  transcripts in the gill cells.
discovering the robust mechanisms underlying the two cell types’ response to osmotic stress would benefit our understanding of the fundamental mechanism allowing pvcs and mrcs to handle osmotic stress.
the fish gill, the major tissue that forms an interface separating the extracellular fluids and external water environment, has an effective transport system to maintain and regulate a constant body osmolality.
the results suggest that the osmoregulatory responses in pvcs and mrcs are cell-type specific, which supports the complementary functions of the cells in osmoregulation.
interestingly, remarkable differential expressed genes  were identified in pvcs  instead of mrcs  in gills of fish adapted to fw or sw. since pvcs cover more than 90 % of the gill epithelial surface, the greater change in gene expression patterns in pvcs in response to external osmolality is anticipated.
in fish gills, the two major epithelial cells, pavement cells  and mitochondria-rich cells , are known to play key and complementary roles in ion transport at the interface.

the regulation of the homeostasis is particularly important in euryhaline fish that migrate between freshwater  and seawater  environments.
