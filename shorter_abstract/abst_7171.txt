here we demonstrated for the first time that plasma melatonin concentration were higher in pregnant  than in non-pregnant sheep .
melatonin regulates several physiological processes and its powerful action as antioxidant has been widely reported.
melatonin acts modulating the immune system, showing a protective effect on the cardiovascular system and improving vaccine administration as an adjuvant-like agent.
administration of melatonin as an adjuvant provides a significant improvement in the immune response to vaccine administration prepartum against c. perfringens.
administration of melatonin prepartum did not significantly modify platelet function but significantly improved the immune response to vaccination against c. perfringens.
