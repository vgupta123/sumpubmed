in the present study, we identified and characterized  <dig> mrna transcripts from the spermatozoa of water buffalo bubalus bubalis employing minisatellite associated sequence amplification  and a consensus sequence of  <dig>  repeat loci.
all these uncharacterized and known transcripts showed highest expression in testis and spermatozoa compared to that in somatic tissues and ovary.
our results show masa as an important tool to capture mrna transcript diversity tagged with minisatellites in the spermatozoa.
minisatellites tagged with mrna transcripts have been implicated with gene organization, regulation and function.
of these  <dig> mrna transcripts,  <dig> showed differential expression in the forebrain and hindbrain of buffalo.
comprehensive characterization of these transcripts is envisaged to augment our understanding on the genes involved in testicular functions and sustenance of a viable paternal genome during pre- and post- fertilization events and early stages of development.
moreover, genes corresponding to all the  <dig>  tagged spermatozoal transcripts were found to be conserved across  <dig> other species analyzed.
