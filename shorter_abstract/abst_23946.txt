multivariate unsupervised analysis: principal components analysis .
raw 1-dimensional spectra processing: phase, baseline correction and normalization.
multivariate supervised analysis: partial least squares , linear discriminant analysis , k-nearest neighbor classification.
sorting of metabolites based on their ability to discriminate, metabolite selection, and outlier identification.
analysis of the plethora of metabolites found in the nmr spectra of biological fluids or tissues requires data complexity to be simplified.
we made complex multivariate analysis user-friendly for both experienced and novice users, which could help to expand the use of nmr-based metabonomics.
furthermore, the "metabonomic" gui includes a console to enable other kinds of analyses and to take advantage of all r statistical tools.
we present a graphical user interface  for nmr-based metabonomic analysis.
