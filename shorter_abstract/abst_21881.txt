we characterized the component links and functional output  of the 4-bar mechanism in the oral jaws of lake malawi cichlids.
simulations of hybrid offspring among lake malawi cichlids exhibiting mtom produce transgressive function in the majority of cases, and at appreciable frequency.
we used a simple but realistic genetic model to show that transgressive function is a likely outcome of hybridization among malawi species exhibiting mtom.
our genetic model can be tested by breeding malawi cichlid hybrids in the laboratory and examining the resulting range of forms and functions.
two recent but separate lines of research address this question.
based on these data, we predicted scenarios in which species with different morphologies but similar kt  would produce transgressive function in hybrids.
under this scenario, functional novelty may be a product of the number of ways to elicit a functional outcome .
we have described a general and likely pervasive mechanism that generates functional novelty.
we demonstrated that the input and output links, the length of the lower jaw and the length of the maxilla respectively, have consistent but opposing relationships with kt.
the first describes one possible outcome of hybridization, called transgressive segregation, where hybrid offspring exhibit trait distributions outside of the parental range.
evolutionary biologists want to explain the origin of novel features and functions.
functional transgression  is a product of recombination and assortment between alleles controlling the lengths of the lower jaw and the maxilla,  occurs in the absence of transgressive morphology, and  can be predicted from the morphology of parents.
