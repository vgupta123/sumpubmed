intestinal weight declined to 50% of control, but this loss of tissue mass was distributed proportionally among the gut's structural components, so that the microarrays' tissue base remained unaffected.
the gut is a major energy consumer, but a comprehensive overview of the adaptive response to fasting is lacking.
major changes upon continued fasting implied the production of glucose rather than lactate from carbohydrate backbones, a downregulation of fatty-acid oxidation and a very strong downregulation of the electron-transport chain.
pathway analysis depicted a pronounced, but transient early response that peaked at  <dig> hours, and a late response that became progressively more pronounced with continued fasting.
early changes in gene expression were compatible with a cellular deficiency in glutamine, and metabolic adaptations directed at glutamine conservation, inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, stimulation of glutamate catabolism via aspartate and phosphoenolpyruvate to lactate, and enhanced fatty-acid oxidation and ketone-body synthesis.
meanwhile, intestinal architecture is maintained by downregulation of cell turnover.
the changes in gene expression indicate that the small intestine rapidly looses mass during fasting to generate lactate or glucose and ketone bodies.
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the microarrays revealed that the successive time points separated into distinct branches.
gene-expression profiling, pathway analysis, and immunohistochemistry were therefore carried out on mouse small intestine after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours of fasting.
