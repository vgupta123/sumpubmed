the svm classifier produces high performance with a biologically relevant data set obtained from the literature, compared with previous tools.
mitarget is a reliable mirna target gene prediction tool and is a successful application of an svm classifier.
compared with previous tools, its predictions are meaningful by go analysis and its performance can be improved given more training examples.
it uses a radial basis function kernel as a similarity measure for svm features, categorized by structural, thermodynamic, and position-based features.
micrornas  are small noncoding rnas, which play significant roles as posttranscriptional regulators.
we predicted significant functions for human mir- <dig>  mir-124a, and mir- <dig> using gene ontology  analysis and revealed the importance of pairing at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the 5' region of a mirna from a feature selection experiment.
