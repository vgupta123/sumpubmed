dpra interacts with proteins essential for nm dna recombination in transformation, pilus biogenesis, and other functions associated with the inner membrane.
the analysis revealed reduced amounts of pilg in the dpra null mutant and reduced amounts of dpra in the nm pilg null mutant.
proteins involved in homologous recombination , pilus biogenesis , cell division, including core energy metabolism, and response to oxidative stress were downregulated in the nm dpra null mutant.
inverse downregulation of nm dpra and pilg expression in the corresponding mutants indicates a link between dna processing and pilus biogenesis.
moreover, a number of pilus biogenesis proteins were shown to interact with dpra and /or pilg.

dna processing chain a  is a dna binding protein which is ubiquitous in bacteria, and is required for dna transformation to various extents among bacterial species.
such a comparative proteomic analysis increases our understanding of the interactions of dpra with other nm components and may elucidate its potential role beyond dna processing in transformation.
using label-free quantitative proteomics, a total of  <dig> unique nm proteins were identified, out of which  <dig> were quantified as differentially abundant  in the dpra null mutant.
