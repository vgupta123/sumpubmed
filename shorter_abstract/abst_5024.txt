molecular phylogenetic studies of pteropodids have provided considerable insight into intrafamilial relationships, but these studies have included only a fraction of the extant diversity  and have failed to resolve deep relationships among internal clades.
the sowh test confirmed that basal branches' lengths were not different from zero, which points to closely-spaced cladogenesis as the most likely explanation for the poor resolution of the deep pteropodid relationships.
the phylogenetic hypothesis generated here provides a robust framework for a revised cladistic classification of pteropodidae into subfamilies and tribes and will greatly contribute to the understanding of character evolution and biogeography of pteropodids.
here we readdress the systematics of pteropodids by applying a strategy to try to resolve ancient relationships within pteropodidae, while providing further insight into subgroup membership, by 1) increasing the taxonomic sample to  <dig> genera; 2) increasing the number of characters  and nuclear genomic representation; 3) minimizing missing data; 4) controlling for sequence bias; and 5) using appropriate data partitioning and models of sequence evolution.
simulations suggest that an increase in the amount of sequence data is likely to solve this problem.
our analyses recovered six principal clades and one additional independent lineage  within pteropodidae.
likewise, most relationships within these principal clades were well resolved and statistically supported.
the inability of our data to resolve the deepest relationships of the major pteropodid lineages suggests an explosive diversification soon after origin of the crown pteropodids.
the family pteropodidae comprises bats commonly known as megabats or old world fruit bats.
