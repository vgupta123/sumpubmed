we find that two out of three smith-waterman implementations with e-value are better at predicting structural similarities between proteins than the smith-waterman implementation with z-score.
the smith-waterman implementations give generally better results than their heuristic counterparts.
the clustr database and the protein world database have been created using an alternative statistical significance test: a z-score based on monte-carlo statistics.
however, the quality and sensitivity of a database search is not only determined by the algorithm but also by the statistical significance testing for an alignment.
the smith-waterman sequence comparison algorithm with both e-value and z-score statistics is evaluated, using roc, cve and ap measures.
we recommend using the ssearch algorithm combined with e-values for pairwise sequence comparisons.
