the hold-out validation strategy leads to biased conclusions, since it can lead to different validation and selection decisions when different partitioning schemes are used.
most ordinary differential equation  based modeling studies in systems biology involve a hold-out validation step for model validation.

furthermore, finding sensible partitioning schemes that would lead to reliable decisions are heavily dependent on the biology and unknown model parameters which turns the problem into a paradox.
the model is assumed to be validated if the model predictions on the validation dataset show good agreement with the data.
model selection between alternative model structures can also be performed in the same setting, based on the predictive power of the model structures on the validation dataset.
furthermore, it is less dependent on the specific noise realization in the data.
therefore, it proves to be a promising alternative to the standard hold-out validation strategy.
in this framework a pre-determined part of the data is used as validation data and, therefore it is not used for estimating the parameters of the model.
