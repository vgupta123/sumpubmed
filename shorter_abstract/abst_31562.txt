furthermore, we demonstrate that ncaco-score can effectively guide fragment assembly for protein structure prediction, which has achieved a good performance in building the structure models for hard targets from casp <dig> in terms of both accuracy and speed.
development of effective scoring functions is a critical component to the success of protein structure modeling.
based on a coarse-grained representation of a protein structure by using only four main-chain atoms: n, cÎ±, c and o, we develop a knowledge-based scoring function, called ncaco-score, that integrates different structural information to rapidly model protein structure from sequence.
although ncaco-score is developed based on a coarse-grained model, it is able to discriminate native conformers from decoy conformers with high accuracy.
despite these efforts, development of an effective scoring function that can achieve both good accuracy and fast speed still presents a grand challenge.
