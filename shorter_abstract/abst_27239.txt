phenofam utilizes ensembl databases to link a list of user-provided identifiers with protein features from the interpro database, and assesses whether results associated with individual domains differ significantly from the overall population.
a powerful method of inspecting large-scale data sets is gene set enrichment analysis  and investigation of protein structural features can guide determining the function of individual genes.
phenofam performs gene set enrichment analysis by employing structural and functional information on families of protein domains as annotation terms.
to demonstrate the utility of phenofam we analysed a genome-wide rna interference screen and discovered a novel function of plexins containing the cytoplasmic rasgap domain.
our tool is designed to analyse complete sets of results from quantitative high-throughput studies  without prior pre-filtering or hits-selection steps.
furthermore, a phenofam analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles revealed a link between breast carcinoma and altered expression of px domain containing proteins.
