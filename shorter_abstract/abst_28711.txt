the study provides new information about molecular events during the parasitic plant - host interaction.
inhibition of cuscutain cysteine proteinase could provide means for antagonizing parasitic plants.
plant infestation with parasitic weeds like cuscuta reflexa induces morphological as well as biochemical changes in the host and the parasite.
the role of cuscutain and its inhibitor during the host parasite interaction was studied by external application of an inhibitor suspension, which induced a significant reduction of successful infection events.
