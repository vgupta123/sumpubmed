protein-protein interaction networks are commonly sampled using yeast two hybrid approaches.
however, whether topological information reaped from these experimentally-measured sub-networks can be extrapolated to complete protein-protein interaction networks is unclear.
based on the experimental bait-prey behaviors, our computer simulations show that these non-random sampling features may affect the topological information.
the topological information from experimental measured networks network as is may not be the correct source for topological information about the parent protein-protein interaction network.
by analyzing various experimental protein-protein interaction datasets, we found that they are not random samples of the parent networks.
we developed a method to filter the experimentally sampled network to result in a core sub-network that more accurately reflects the topology of the parent network.
we define a core sub-network that more accurately reflects the topology of the parent network.
we tested the hypothesis that a core sub-network exists within the experimentally sampled network that better maintains the topological characteristics of the parent protein-protein interaction network.
