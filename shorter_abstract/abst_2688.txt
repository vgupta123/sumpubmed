medaka  is a useful model organism among vertebrate animals.
first of all, many medaka candidate pre-mirnas position close to each other, forming many mirna clusters, some of which are also conserved across other vertebrate animals.
as result, we identified  <dig> novel medaka pre-mirnas, many of which were found to encode more than one isomirs.
in this study, we adopted abi solid platform to generate small rna sequence reads from medaka tissues, followed by mapping these sequence reads back to medaka genome.
medaka is a widely used model animal and usually involved in many biomedical studies, including the ones on development biology.
these quantifiable isomirs and minor mirnas enable us to further characterize medaka mirna genes in many aspects.
finally, we also investigated the relationship between conservation status and expression level of mirna genes.
identifying and characterizing medaka mirna genes would benefit the studies using medaka as a model organism.
the mapped genomic loci were considered as candidate mirnas and further processed by a support vector machine  classifier.
secondly, during mirna maturation, there is an arm selection preference of mature mirnas within precursors.
we observed the differences on arm selection preference between our candidate pre-mirnas and their orthologous ones.
micrornas  are endogenous non-protein-coding rna genes which exist in a wide variety of organisms, including animals, plants, virus and even unicellular organisms.

however, no medaka mirnas have been investigated systematically.
