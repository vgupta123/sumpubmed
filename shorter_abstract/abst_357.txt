due to their ability to infect the majority of the common serotypes in denmark we suggest the phages can become an effective agent in the effort to reduce the incidence of campylobacteriosis in denmark.
in this study, campylobacter phages were isolated from the intestines of broilers and ducks and from abattoir sewage.
we have characterized and identified the host range of  <dig> danish campylobacter phages.
this study provides the basis for future experiments in campylobacter phages and knowledge for the selection of campylobacter phages for biocontrol in broilers.
i: a genome size of ~ <dig> kb and refractory to digestion with hhai; ii: a genome size of ~ <dig> kb and digestible by hhai; and iii: a genome size undeterminable in pfge.
the majority of the phages infected the most common serotypes in danish broilers , but showed limited ability to infect  <dig> of the less frequent campylobacter serotypes.
one concern in relation to phage biocontrol is the narrow host range often displayed by phages.
the categorization of the phages correlated with the host range patterns displayed by the phages.
twelve phages were investigated to determine their ability to infect the campylobacter penner serotypes commonly present in danish poultry and patients with campylobacteriosis.
the predominant food borne pathogen in the western world today is campylobacter.
to identify the potential of phages as a campylobacter reducing agent we needed to determine their infectivity on a panel of isolates representing the campylobacter strains found in broilers as well as humans.
six phages were subjected to transmission electron microscopy .
