we find an enrichment of mirna targeted oc genes in the highly relevant pathways cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
in the present study we focus on computationally deciphering the underlying network of mirnas, their targets, and their control mechanisms that have an influence on oc development.
unfortunately, the specific machinery of mirna regulation, involving transcription factors  and transcription co-factors , is not well understood.
from these analyses, we derived a network that describes the influence of mirnas and their regulation in human oc.
we combined several sources of interaction and association data to analyse and place mirnas within regulatory pathways that influence human oc.
these results represent the first comprehensive mirna regulatory network analysis for human oc.
these functions of mirnas allow them to control key cellular processes such as development, differentiation and apoptosis, and they have also been implicated in several cancers such as leukaemia, lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer .
this suggests that mirnas and their regulation may play a major role in oc and that further directed research in this area is of utmost importance to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human cancer development and oc in particular.
micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules that repress the translation of messenger rnas  or degrade mrnas.
