by scanning the same spotted oligonucleotide microarray at different photomultiplier tube  gains, we have identified a channel-specific bias present in two-channel microarray data.
when comparing estimates based on data from the same array, but from different scanners, we have found that different scanners introduce different amounts of bias.
the average scan, which has a larger dynamical range and greater signal-to-noise ratio than individual scans, can then be obtained.
the proposed scanning protocol and calibration method is simple to use and is useful for evaluating scanner biases or for obtaining calibrated measurements with extended dynamical range and better precision.
we propose a scanning protocol and a constrained affine model that allows us to identify and estimate the bias in each channel.
any step in a microarray process may introduce such offsets and in this article we study the biases introduced by the microarray scanner and the image analysis software.
the observed bias was very stable between subsequent scans of the same array although the pmt gain was greatly adjusted.
