many of the structure related properties were derived from the delaunay tessellation of protein structures.
there is a considerable literature on the source of the thermostability of proteins from thermophilic organisms.
understanding the mechanisms for this thermostability would provide insights into proteins generally and permit the design of synthetic hyperstable biocatalysts.
based on our analysis, the strongest contributors to thermostability are an increase in ion pairs on the protein surface and a more strongly hydrophobic interior.
