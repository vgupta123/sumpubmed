these changes were strongly dependent on light intensity, with high light amplifying the difference between pdx <dig>  and the wild type.
these results raise the important question as to whether plants employ vitamin b <dig> as an antioxidant to protect themselves against reactive oxygen species.
when leaf discs were exposed to exogenous 1o <dig>  lipid peroxidation in pdx <dig>  was increased relative to the wild type; this effect was not observed with superoxide or hydrogen peroxide.
although leaves of the pdx <dig>  arabidopsis mutant contained less chlorophyll than wild-type leaves, we found that vitamin b <dig> deficiency did not significantly impact photosynthetic performance or shoot and root growth.
thus, the antioxidant activity of vitamin b <dig> inferred from in vitro studies is confirmed in planta.
when leaf discs or whole plants were exposed to excess light energy, 1o2-mediated lipid peroxidation was enhanced in leaves of the pdx <dig>  mutant relative to the wild type.
high light also caused an increased level of 1o <dig> in vitamin b6-deficient leaves.
together with the finding that chloroplasts contain vitamin b <dig> compounds, the data show that vitamin b <dig> functions as a photoprotector that limits 1o <dig> accumulation in high light and prevents 1o2-mediated oxidative damage.
vitamin b <dig> is a collective term for a group of six interconvertible compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and their phosphorylated derivatives.
combining the pdx <dig>  mutation with mutations affecting the level of 'classical' quenchers of 1o <dig>  resulted in a highly photosensitive phenotype.
vitamin b <dig> plays essential roles as a cofactor in a range of biochemical reactions.
the pdx <dig>  mutation affects the vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis enzyme, pyridoxal synthase , and leads to a reduction of the vitamin b <dig> concentration in arabidopsis thaliana leaves.
in addition, vitamin b <dig> is able to quench reactive oxygen species in vitro, and exogenously applied vitamin b <dig> protects plant cells against cell death induced by singlet oxygen .
