vascular branching morphogenesis is responsible for the extension of blood vessels into growing tissues, a process crucial for organogenesis.
zebrafish reg <dig> is a temperature-sensitive mutation exhibiting defects in blood vessel branching which results in the formation of swollen vessel lumina during capillary plexus formation.
interestingly, when reg <dig> adults that had already developed swollen vessel lumina in regenerating fins were treated with histamine or skf <dig>  either treatment significantly reduced the number of swollen vessels within  <dig> h, suggesting a rapid and constant influence of histamine on blood vessel branching.
taken together, our results suggest that blood vessel branching is influenced by histamine metabolism, possibly through regulating the expression of the egr- <dig> transcription factor.
conversely, lowering histamine by administering urocanic acid, a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, enhanced the reg <dig> phenotypes.
we performed a screening for chemical suppressors of reg <dig> and identified skf <dig>  an inhibitor of histamine methyltransferase , that can rescue the reg <dig> vessel branching defects in a dose-dependent manner.
however, the genetic mechanism for vessel branching is largely unknown.
consistent with this idea, we found that a high level of histamine also showed significant suppression of reg <dig> vessel phenotypes.
