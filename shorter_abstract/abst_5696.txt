the recent structure determination of these two proteins lead us to analyse these interactions in the light of our thermodynamic data.
they are found in various organisms including fungi.
isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed a dissociation constant kd of  <dig>  Î¼m for the xcl:n-acetylgalactosamine interaction at 27degreesc.
the xcl antiproliferative effect and the tf antigen specificity presented in this work suggest that xcl and abl may have similar binding mechanisms.
