the expression patterns of dax <dig> early in salmon embryogenesis implicate its role as a lineage determination factor.
other roles for these factors during embryogenesis and outside the hpag axis are discussed.
although the function of these factors in sexual differentiation have been defined, their roles in early development before sexual fate decisions and in tissues beyond the brain or gonad are essentially unknown.
transposon integrations are implicated in the shaping of the dax and foxl <dig> loci.
we found that cyp19b <dig> transcripts are generated that contain 5'-untranslated regions of different lengths due to cryptic splicing of the 3'-end of intron  <dig>  we also demonstrate that salmon mis transcripts can encode prodomain products that present different c-termini and terminate before translation of the mis hormone.
spliced cyp19b <dig> and mis transcripts are generated that may provide regulatory controls for tissue- or development-specific activities.
we report the embryonic and extragonadal expression of dax, foxl <dig>  mis and other differentiation factors that indicate that they have functions that are more general and not restricted to steroidogenesis and gonadogenesis.
bacterial artificial chromosomes containing salmon dax <dig> and dax <dig>  foxl2b and mis were isolated and the regulatory regions that control their expression were characterized.
splice variants for cyp19b <dig> and mis in both embryonic and adult tissues were detected and characterized.
regulatory differences in the expression of two distinct aromatases cyp19a and cyp19b <dig> are exerted, despite transcription of their transactivators  occurring much earlier during embryonic development.
we provide evidence for expression of these regulators very early in salmonid development and in tissues outside of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/gonadal  axis.
