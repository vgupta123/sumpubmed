we report the highly unusual genomic structure of a novel msyq locus, orly, and a diverse set of spermatid-specific transcripts arising from copies of this locus.
deletions on msyq lead to teratozoospermia and subfertility or infertility, with a sex ratio skew in the offspring of subfertile msyqdel males
we find that orly is the most recent gene to arise on yq, and that subsequently there was massive expansion in copy number of all yq-linked genes.
the region of overlap of known orly and orlyos transcripts is homologous to sly intron  <dig>  we propose that orly may be involved in an intragenomic conflict between mouse x and y chromosomes, and that this process underlies the massive expansion in copy number of the genes on msyq and their x homologues.
genome search and phylogenetic tree analysis is used to determine the order of events in mouse yq evolution.
the male-specific region of the mouse y chromosome long arm  contains three known highly multi-copy x-y homologous gene families, ssty1/ <dig>  sly and asty.
the ssty1- and sly-derived segments are in antisense orientation relative to each other, leading to bi-directional transcription of orly.
orly is composed of partial copies of ssty <dig>  asty and sly arranged in sequence.
