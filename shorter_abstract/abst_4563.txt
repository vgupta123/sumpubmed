no differences in estimated growth parameters  were found between donor, recipient and transconjugant, and plasmid loss was not observed.
extrapolation of the results was compared to a 3-months experiment in which a mixed culture of recipient and transconjugant was regularly diluted in new medium.
in the 3-months experiment, the proportion of transconjugants did not decrease, indicating no or very small fitness costs.
in the netherlands, bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases  are found on chicken-meat and in the gut of broilers at a high prevalence and the predominant esbl-gene is the blactx-m- <dig> located on inci <dig> plasmids.
the intrinsic growth rate , maximum density  and lag-phase  of the populations were estimated as well as the conjugation coefficient.
the conjugation coefficient of transconjugants was  <dig> times larger than that of the donor.
we investigated the conjugation dynamics of inci <dig> plasmids carrying the blactx-m- <dig> gene in a batch culture and its impact on the population dynamics of three e. coli populations: donors, recipients and transconjugants.
in vitro the inci <dig> plasmid carrying the blactx-m- <dig> gene imposes no or negligible fitness costs on its e. coli host, and persists without antimicrobial usage.
we aim to determine the fitness costs of this plasmid for the bacterium.
