a second class member whose expression is vegetative-associated appeared in gymnosperms and all three modern classes had fully evolved by the appearance of the first known basal angiosperm.
although such changes suggest functional specialization, the size of the family and its sequence divergence have complicated an understanding of which gene family members may be foundational and which may represent more recent expansions of the family to meet the specific needs of speciation.
pabp is encoded by a single gene in yeast and marine algae but during plant evolution the pabp gene family expanded substantially, underwent sequence divergence into three subclasses, and acquired tissue-specificity in gene family member expression.
here, we examine the evolution of the plant pabp gene family to provide insight into these aspects of the family that may yield clues into the function of individual family members.
the pabp gene family had expanded to two members by the appearance of fresh water algae and four members in non-vascular plants.
expansion of the plant pabp gene family began prior to the colonization of land.
the earliest members of the gene family share greatest similarity to those modern members whose expression is confined to reproductive tissues, suggesting that supporting reproductive-associated gene expression is the most conserved function of this family.
by the evolution of lycophytes, the first class member whose expression is confined to reproductive tissues in higher plants had appeared.
the size of each pabp class underwent further expansion during subsequent evolution, especially in the brassicaceae, suggesting that the family is undergoing dynamic evolution.
