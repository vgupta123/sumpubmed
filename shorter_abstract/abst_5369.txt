elucidation of this modulon provides a means to identify genes with unrecognized roles in iron/heme acquisition or homeostasis, unanticipated responsiveness to environmental levels of the micronutrients or potential roles in virulence.
haemophilus influenzae requires heme for aerobic growth and possesses multiple mechanisms to obtain this essential nutrient.
although an understanding of the heme acquisition mechanisms of h. influenzae is emerging, significant gaps in our knowledge remain.
previously we utilized h. influenzae strain rd kw <dig> to demonstrate the utility of transcriptional profiling in defining the genes exhibiting altered transcription in response to environmental iron and heme levels.
this study provides evidence for a conserved core of h. influenzae genes the transcription of which is altered by the availability of iron and/or heme in the growth environment.
unresolved issues include the identities of all genes exhibiting altered transcription in response to iron and heme availability, the fraction of such genes functioning in iron/heme acquisition, and the heterogeneity of this gene set among clinical isolates.
the current study expands upon those observations by determining the iron/heme modulons of two clinical isolates, the type b isolate  <dig> and the nontypeable isolate r <dig>  these data are used to begin to define the core iron/heme modulon of the species.
microarray studies were performed to compare gene expression on transition from iron/heme-restricted to iron/heme-replete conditions for each isolate.
