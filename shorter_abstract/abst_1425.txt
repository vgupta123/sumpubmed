a ‘core collection’ containing  <dig> accessions was selected using the maximum length sub tree method.
depiction of the genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium  and population structure is essential for the efficient organization and exploitation of genetic resources.
the objectives of this study were to  to evaluate the genetic diversity and to detect the patterns of ld,  to estimate the levels of population structure and  to identify a ‘core collection’ suitable for association genetic studies in sweet cherry.

linkage disequilibrium was evaluated showing lower values than in peach, the reference prunus species.
we provided estimations of linkage disequilibrium, genetic structure and the definition of a first inra’s sweet cherry core collection useful for breeding programs, germplasm management and association genetics studies.
further analyses identified nine subgroups using structure and discriminant analysis of principal components .
a total of  <dig> genotypes including modern cultivars and landraces from  <dig> countries were genotyped using the rosbreed cherry 6 k snp array v <dig>  two groups, mainly bred cultivars and landraces, respectively, were first detected using structure software and confirmed by principal coordinate analysis .
the present study constitutes the first population genetics analysis in cultivated sweet cherry using a medium-density snp  marker array.
