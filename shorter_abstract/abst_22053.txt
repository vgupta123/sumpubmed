the task of recognizing and identifying species names in biomedical literature has recently been regarded as critical for a number of applications in text and data mining, including gene name recognition, species-specific document retrieval, and semantic enrichment of biomedical articles.
linnaeus uses a dictionary-based approach  to identify species names and a set of heuristics to resolve ambiguous mentions.
in this paper we describe an open-source species name recognition and normalization software system, linnaeus, and evaluate its performance relative to several automatically generated biomedical corpora, as well as a novel corpus of full-text documents manually annotated for species mentions.
our system successfully solves the problem of disambiguating uncertain species mentions, with 97% of all mentions in pubmed central full-text documents resolved to unambiguous ncbi taxonomy identifiers.
when compared against our manually annotated corpus, linnaeus performs with 94% recall and 97% precision at the mention level, and 98% recall and 90% precision at the document level.
