in the penp-e166cf-cefatoxime complex structure the binding and subsequent acylation of cefotaxime to penp displaces fluorescein from its original location to avoid steric clash.
here we report the crystal structure of a class a β-lactamase penp from bacillus licheniformis 749/c with fluorescein conjugated at residue  <dig> after e166c mutation, both in apo form  and in covalent complex form with cefotaxime , to illustrate its biosensing mechanism.
β-lactamase conjugated with environment-sensitive fluorescein molecule to residue  <dig> on the Ω-loop near its catalytic site is a highly effective biosensor for β-lactam antibiotics.
such findings confirm our previous proposal based on molecular modelling and provide useful information for the rational design of β-lactamase-based biosensor to detect the wide spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics.
in the apo structure the fluorescein molecule partially occupies the antibiotic binding site and is highly dynamic.
such displacement causes the well-folded Ω-loop to become fully flexible and the conjugated fluorescein molecule to relocate to a more solvent exposed environment, hence enhancing its fluorescence emission.
yet the molecular mechanism of such fluorescence-based biosensing is not well understood.
our structural studies indicate the biosensing mechanism of a fluorescein-labelled β-lactamase.
the observation of increased Ω-loop flexibility upon conjugation of fluorophore may have the potential to serve as a screening tool for novel β-lactamase inhibitors that target the Ω-loop and not the active site.
