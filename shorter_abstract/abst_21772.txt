yet there is a significant need for new computation tools for processing and analysing merip-seq data to gain a further insight into the function and m6a mrna methylation.
we developed a novel algorithm and an open source r package  for uncovering the potential types of m6a methylation by clustering the degree of m6a methylation peaks in merip-seq data.
metcluster is evaluated on both simulated and real merip-seq datasets and the results demonstrate its high accuracy in characterizing the clusters of methylation peaks.
our algorithm was applied to two different sets of real merip-seq datasets and reveals a novel pattern that methylation peaks with less peak enrichment tend to clustered in the 5′ end of both in both mrnas and lncrnas, whereas those with higher peak enrichment are more likely to be distributed in cds and towards the 3′end of mrnas and lncrnas.
in this paper, a novel hierarchical graphical model based algorithm was developed for clustering the enrichment of methylation peaks in merip-seq data.
this algorithm utilizes a hierarchical graphical model to model the reads account variance and the underlying clusters of the methylation peaks.
