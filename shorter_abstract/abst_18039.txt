the increase in net photosynthetic rate was associated with an increase in: 1) maximum and effective quantum yield of psii; 2) activities of calvin cycle enzymes; and 3) levels of mrna relative expression of several genes involved in calvin cycle.
− by increasing leaf area, canopy spread, biomass accumulation, and net photosynthetic rate.
the results of this study would provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for mini chinese cabbage production.
− ratio that improved the tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings to ll was found in our current study.
−  increased rbcl, rbcs, fba, fbpase and tk expression and/or activities, enhanced photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and improved the tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings to ll.
− should be adjusted with respect to light fluence for successful growing of mini chinese cabbage.

−  alleviated the negative effect of ll on c: n ratio mainly by increasing total carbohydrate contents.
in northwest of china, mini chinese cabbage  is highly valued by consumers, and is widely cultivated during winter in solar-greenhouses where low light  fluence  is a major abiotic stress factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity.
− ratios affected growth and photosynthesis of mini chinese cabbage under normal  and low  light conditions was investigated.
in addition, glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch and total carbohydrate, which are the products of co <dig> assimilation, accumulated most in the cabbage leaves that were supplied with nh4
under low light, the application of nh4
low light reduced the carbohydrate: nitrogen  ratio while the application of nh4
