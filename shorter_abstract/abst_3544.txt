these factors should play a role in the naming to increase specificity about which exon type are in question.
poem is applied to two congruent untranslated exon datasets resulting in the following statistical properties.
it will also facilitate unambiguous communication due to its fine granularity
no previous taxonomy provides such fine grained information and yet still includes all valid information dimensions.
it integrates three dimensions of information , thus its exon categories are based on known statistical exon features.
exon taxonomies used by researchers tend to be selected ad hoc or based on an information poor de-facto standard.
finally, three exon patterns are determined which account for 70% of untranslated exon genes.
using the poem taxonomy previous wide ranging estimates of initial 5' untranslated region exons are resolved.
