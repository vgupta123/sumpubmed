on the basis of preliminary bioinformatic analysis, additional rtks, including receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  <dig>  were predicted to have the potential for nuclear subcellular localization.
several receptor tyrosine kinases  such as egfr, fgfr, trk, and vegfr are capable of localizing in the cell nucleus in addition to their usual plasma membrane localization.
because the nuclear localization capability of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic domain has not been reported, we examined the cellular expression distribution of this region.
serial deletion constructs were then used to map the juxtamembrane domain of ror <dig>  for this nuclear translocation activity.
this is the first report to suggest that the juxtamembrane domain of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region mediates the translocation event.
recent reports also demonstrate that nuclear-localized rtks have important cellular functions such as transcriptional activation.
following transfection, the nuclear distribution patterns of transiently expressed fusion proteins were observed.
