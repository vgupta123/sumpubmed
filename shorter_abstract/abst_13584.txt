only  <dig> peaks of acetylated h <dig> histone were found in the entire genome, with substantially higher intensity in rapidly-dividing cells than stationary-phase.
the transcription initiation sites are assumed to lie within the 'divergent strand-switch' regions at the junction between opposing polycistronic gene clusters.
however, the mechanism by which kinetoplastidae initiate transcription is unclear, and promoter sequences are undefined.
the chromosomal location of tata-binding protein , small nuclear activating protein complex , and h <dig> histones were assessed in leishmania major using microarrays hybridized with dna obtained through chromatin immunoprecipitation .
the majority of the acetylated h <dig> peaks were found at divergent strand-switch regions, but some occurred at chromosome ends and within polycistronic gene clusters.
the first genome-wide maps of dna-binding protein occupancy in a kinetoplastid organism suggest that h <dig> histones at the origins of polycistronic transcription of protein-coding genes are acetylated.
almost all these peaks were associated with lower intensity peaks of tbp/snap <dig> binding a few kilobases upstream, evidence that they represent transcription initiation sites.
global regulation of transcription initiation may be achieved by modifying the acetylation state of these origins.
