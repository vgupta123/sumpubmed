we performed transcriptional profiling on these stromal fibroblasts to investigate if they were affected by the presence of drug-treated all cells.
our results show that the transcription of at least one member of these sequences is regulated, suggesting that this has a function in normal and transformed immune cells.
moreover, cassini rna was induced in human all cells treated with vincristine.
analysis of rnas from different normal mouse tissues showed that cassini expression is highest in spleen and thymus, and can be further enhanced in these organs by exposure of mice to bacterial endotoxin.
transient overexpression of cassini in human  <dig> embryonic kidney cells did not increase the cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs but provided some protection.
heat shock, but not other types of stress, significantly induced the transcription of this locus in all cells.
database searches revealed that sequences highly homologous to cassini are present in rodents, apicomplexans, flatworms and primates, indicating that they are conserved in evolution.
these mitotically inactivated mefs showed few changes in gene expression, but a family of sequences of which transcription is significantly increased was identified.
expression of these sequences may protect cells when they are exposed to specific stress stimuli.
