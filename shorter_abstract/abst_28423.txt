we expressed stc <dig> in both e. coli and insect cells using the baculo virus system with a c-terminal  <dig> Ã— his fusion tag.
mass spectroscopy analysis of the recombinant protein allowed to assign the five intramolecular disulfide bridges as well as the dimerization cys <dig>  thereby confirming the conservation of the disulfide pattern previously described for fish stc <dig>  saxs data also clearly demonstrated that stc <dig> adopts a dimeric, slightly elongated structure in solution.
the dimerization was confirmed by mass spectrometry as was the highly conserved disulfide pattern, which is identical to that found in fish stc <dig>
the latter in conjunction with alternative splicing and/or post-translational modification gives rise to forms described as stc <dig> and "big stc", which molecular weights range from  <dig> to  <dig> kda.
our data reveal the first low resolution, structural information for human stc <dig>  theoretical predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy both suggested that stc <dig> has a high content of alpha-helices and saxs experiments revealed that stc <dig> is a dimer of slightly elongated shape in solution.
human stc <dig> is a  <dig> amino acids protein with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kda, but preliminary data suggested its di- or multimerization.
