these findings imply that dov  <dig>  could contribute to the action of ocinaplon in vivo, but that the anxioselective properties of ocinaplon cannot be readily explained by a subtype selective effect/action of dov  <dig> .
we report that dov  <dig>  possesses modulatory activity at gabaa-rs, but that its selectivity profile is similar to that of ocinaplon.
we hypothesized that the pharmacological properties of ocinaplon in vivo might be influenced by an active biotransformation product with greater selectivity for the α <dig> subunit relative to α <dig>  one hour after administration of ocinaplon, the plasma concentration of its primary biotransformation product, dov  <dig> , is 38% of the parent compound.
the pyrazolo-pyrimidine ocinaplon is anxioselective in both preclinical studies and in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, but does not exhibit the selectivity between α1/α2-containing receptors for an anxioselective that is predicted by studies using transgenic mice.
the pharmacological properties of dov  <dig>  were assessed using radioligand binding studies and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology.
it has been hypothesized that these various pharmacological effects are mediated by different gabaa-r subtypes.
