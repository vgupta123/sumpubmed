btai and usda <dig> and nitrobacter hamburgiensis x <dig>  analysis of the o. carboxidovorans genome reveals potential links between plasmid-encoded chemolithoautotrophy and chromosomally-encoded lipid metabolism.
comparative analysis of o. carboxidovorans with closely related species revealed differences in metabolic pathways, particularly in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as transport pathways.
although there is significant conservation of genome organization between the species, there are major differences in many metabolic pathways that reflect the adaptive strategies unique to each species.
to our knowledge, this strain is the first one to be sequenced in the genus oligotropha, the closest fully sequenced relatives being bradyrhizobium sp.
oligotropha, bradyrhizobium sp and nitrobacter hamburgiensis x <dig> are phylogenetically proximal.
