we have developed a rapid method of scanning genome sequences for multiple polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and mixed combination natural products with output in a text format that can be readily converted to two and three dimensional structures using conventional software.
using this approach we have predicted the structures of natural products from a diverse range of bacteria based on a limited number of signature sequences.
our open-source and web-based program can assemble various small molecules composed of twenty standard amino acids and twenty two other chain-elongation intermediates used in nonribosomal peptide systems, and four acyl-coa extender units incorporated into polyketides by reading a hidden markov model of dna.
