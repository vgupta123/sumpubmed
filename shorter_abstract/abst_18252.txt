computational methods provide powerful analytical capabilities in addition to traditional analysis methods for studying microtubule dynamic behavior.
traditionally, microtubule behavior is quantified by manually tracking individual microtubules in time-lapse images under various experimental conditions.
using actual microtubule data, we estimate statistical models of microtubule behavior that are highly effective in identifying common and distinct characteristics of microtubule dynamic behavior.
manual analysis is laborious, approximate, and often offers limited analytical capability in extracting potentially valuable information from the data.
novel capabilities, such as building and querying microtubule image databases, are introduced to quantify and analyze microtubule dynamic behavior.
in this work, we present computer vision and machine-learning based methods for extracting novel dynamics information from time-lapse images.
