the amphinomid polychaete hermodice carunculata is a cosmopolitan and ecologically important omnivore in coral reef ecosystems, preying on a diverse suite of reef organisms and potentially acting as a vector for coral disease.
this underscores the utility of illumina sequencing for de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model organisms as a cost-effective and efficient tool for gene discovery and downstream applications, such as phylogenetic analysis and gene expression profiling.
we performed deep transcriptome sequencing  and profiling on hermodice carunculata collected in the western atlantic ocean.
we provide a comprehensive catalogue of annotated genes for hermodice carunculata and expand the knowledge of reproduction and immune response genes in annelids, in general.

we focused this study on  <dig>  predicted open reading frames  of genes longer than  <dig> amino acids for our homology search, and gene ontology  terms and interpro ids were assigned to  <dig>  of these orfs.
we also identify a suite of h. carunculata genes related to reproduction and immune response.
overall, this study vastly expands the available genomic data for h. carunculata, of which previously consisted of only  <dig> nucleotide sequences in ncbi.
