the dose dependence for ethylene induction varies among the argos family members, suggesting that they could modulate responses across a range of ethylene concentrations.
these results support a model in which the argos gene family functions as part of a negative feedback circuit to desensitize the plant to ethylene, thereby expanding the range of ethylene concentrations to which the plant can respond.
expression of all four members of the argos family is induced by ethylene, but this induction is blocked in ethylene-insensitive mutants.
seedlings with increased expression of argos family members exhibit reduced ethylene sensitivity based on physiological and molecular responses.
ethylene plays critical roles in plant growth and development, including the regulation of cell expansion, senescence, and the response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
we report here that members of the argos gene family of arabidopsis, previously implicated in the regulation of plant growth and biomass, function as negative feedback regulators of ethylene signaling.
these results also indicate that the effects of the argos gene family on plant growth and biomass are mediated through effects on ethylene signal transduction.
gfp-fusions of argos and arl localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, the same subcellular location as the ethylene receptors and other initial components of the ethylene signaling pathway.
