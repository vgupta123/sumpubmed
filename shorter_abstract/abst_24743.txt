moreover, expression of viral silencing suppressors, either via transgenesis or viral infection, was unable to prevent mir <dig> repression of myb33/ <dig>  highlighting the robustness of mir159-mediated silencing.
inducible inhibition of mir <dig> resulted in myb33/ <dig> de-repression and associated phenotypic defects, indicating that a potential role in vegetative development is only possible through myb <dig> and myb <dig> if mir <dig> levels decrease.
hence, we have investigated the functional role of this pathway in vegetative tissues.
despite being ubiquitously present, molecular, genetic and physiological analysis failed to find a major functional role for the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway in arabidopsis rosette development or stress response.
however, we cannot rule out a role for mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway in arabidopsis vegetative tissues; a loss-of-function mir <dig> arabidopsis mutant displays strong pleiotropic defects and numerous reports have documented changes in mir <dig> abundance during stress and hormone treatments.
it was found that the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway was ubiquitously present throughout rosette development.
however, mir <dig> appears to continuously repress myb33/myb <dig> expression to levels that have no major impact on rosette development.
however, mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig> appeared extremely robust; no tested abiotic stress resulted in strong mir <dig> repression.
in cereals, restriction of gamyb expression to seeds and anthers is mainly achieved transcriptionally, whereas in arabidopsis this is achieved post-transcriptionally, as mir <dig> silences gamyb  in vegetative tissues, but not in seeds and anthers.
the micror <dig>  â€“ gamyb pathway is conserved in higher plants, where gamyb, expression promotes programmed cell death in seeds  and anthers .
