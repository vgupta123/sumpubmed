the elements at the 5'-flanking region that drive ehrabb gene expression were detected and characterized using transitory transfected trophozoites with a plasmid carrying the cat reporter gene.
primer extension experiments revealed that ehrabb has at least four transcription initiation sites.
ehrabb transcription is negatively regulated by a sequence located between positions - <dig> to - <dig> with respect to the first transcription initiation site.
in silico searches of the ehrabb 5'-flanking region revealed that it contains a motif similar to the upstream regulatory element  <dig>  of the e. histolytica hgl <dig> gene.
the entamoeba histolytica ehrabb gene encodes for a rab gtpase involved in phagocytosis.
it also has sequences with homology to c/ebp and gata <dig> binding sites, and heat shock elements .
in addition, heat shock activated the ehrabb promoter in episomal constructs and lead to an increase in de novo ehrabb transcription.
we also showed that the ure1-like motif activates ehrabb transcription.
the data suggest that ehrabb transcription is controlled negatively by an unidentified sequence, but it is activated by an ure1-like motif.
to initiate the knowledge of ehrabb gene expression regulation, here we studied the structural characteristics of its gene promoter and its control transcription elements.
