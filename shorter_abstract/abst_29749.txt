here we present quantprime, an intuitive and user-friendly, fully automated tool for primer pair design in small- to large-scale qpcr analyses.
quantprime constitutes a flexible, fully automated web application for reliable primer design for use in larger qpcr experiments, as proven by experimental data.
experimental results with the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, the crop hordeum vulgare and the model green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii show success rates of designed primer pairs exceeding 96%.
the flexible framework is also open for simple use in other quantification applications, such as hydrolyzation probe design for qpcr and oligonucleotide probe design for quantitative in situ hybridization.
a major bottleneck in experiment preparation is the design of specific primer pairs, where researchers have to make several informed choices, often outside their area of expertise.
