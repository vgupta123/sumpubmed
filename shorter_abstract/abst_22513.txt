genetic variation in six microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i sequence was used to assess the population structure of the a. mormo species complex across  <dig> localities, and to evaluate a. m. langei’s qualifications as an evolutionarily significant unit.
furthermore, these results illustrate the utility of molecular markers to aid in demarcation of biological units below the species level.
we discovered substantial genetic divergence within the species complex, especially across the continental divide, with population genetic structure corresponding more closely with geographic proximity and local isolation than with taxonomic divisions originally based on wing color and pattern characters.
lange’s metalmark, a. m. langei, one of the  <dig> subspecies taxonomically recognized in the complex, is federally listed under the u.s. endangered species act of  <dig>  metalmark taxa have traditionally been described based on phenotypic and ecological characteristics, and it is unknown how well this nomenclature reflects their genetic and evolutionary distinctiveness.
this study is the first genetic treatment of the a. mormo complex across western north america and potentially provides a foundation for reassessing the taxonomy of the group.
lange’s metalmark was as genetically divergent as several other locally isolated populations in california, and even the unique phenotype that warranted subspecific and conservation status is reminiscent of the morphological variation found in some other populations.
from a conservation point of view, apodemia mormo langei’s diagnostic taxonomic characteristics may, by themselves, not support its evolutionary significance, which has implications for its formal listing as an endangered species.
