its large size of  <dig> amino acids hampers the production of x-ray diffraction quality crystals and hinders in-solution nmr analysis, and thus necessitates a domain-based approach for the structural characterization of the multi-domain full-length apo b.
the content of secondary structural elements in this model structure correlates well with the reported data from other biophysical probes.
the model structure was first induced to accommodate the six disulfide bonds found in that region, and then optimized using simulated annealing.
the structure of apo b- <dig>  was predicted by homology modeling based on the structure of the n-terminal domain of lipovitellin , a protein that shares not only sequence similarity with b <dig>  but also a functional aspect of lipid binding and transport.
