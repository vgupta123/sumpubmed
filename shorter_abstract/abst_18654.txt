the exonic, protein coding regions of the genes encoding: april, bcma, il <dig>  il10rα, il10rβ, il <dig>  il21r, and ccl <dig>  were analyzed primarily in familial cvid cases, who showed evidence of genetic linkage to the respective candidate gene loci and cvid families with a recessive pattern of inheritance.
two novel snps were identified in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the il21r gene, which segregated with the disease phenotype in one cvid family.
