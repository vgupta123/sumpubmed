furthermore, results from co-sedimentation, solid phase assays and electron microscopy showed that the proline-rich domain is also capable of binding to f-actin and inducing f-actin bundles.
moreover, we observed that the proline-rich domain was able to associate with and bundle f-actin at physiological ionic strength.
several tau truncation and deletion mutants were constructed, namely n-terminal region , proline-rich domain , microtubule binding domain  and c-terminal region  truncation mutants, and microtubule binding domain  and proline-rich domain/microtubule binding domain  deletion mutants.
using solid phase assays to analyze apparent dissociation constants for the binding of tau and its mutants to f-actin resulted in a sequence of affinity for f-actin: tau >> microtubule binding domain > proline-rich domain.
these results indicate that the proline-rich domain is involved in the association of tau with g-actin.
the proline-rich domain truncation mutant  and the microtubule binding domain deletion mutant  promoted the formation of actin filaments.
the proline-rich domain is a functional structure playing a role in the association of tau with actin.
this suggests that the proline-rich domain and the microtubule-binding domain of tau are both involved in binding to and bundling f-actin.
