coalescent theory plays an increasingly important role in analysing molecular population genetic data.
object oriented designs, though has upfront costs, are practical now and can provide such an integrated approach.
currently, there is no open-source, cross-platform and scalable framework for coalescent analysis in population genetics.

the framework provides an api with the concepts of model, data, statistic, phylogeny, gene tree and recursion.
it can visualize a gene tree, trace and visualize the internals of the recursion algorithm for further improvement and attach dynamically a number of output processors.
as a first attempt, we built a framework and user application for the domain of exact calculations in coalescent analysis.
there is no scalable gui based user application either.
the user application defines jobs in a plug-in like manner so that they can be activated, deactivated, installed or uninstalled on demand.
it defines pluggable computations such as counting and listing all the ancestral configurations and genealogies and computing the exact probability of data.
