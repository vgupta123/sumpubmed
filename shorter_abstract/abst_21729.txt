we present secondary structures, modeled using comparative sequence analysis of the discontinuous mitochondrial large subunit rrna genes of the cupped oysters c. virginica, c. gigas, and c. hongkongensis.
comparative structure models for the large subunit rrna in each of the three oyster species are generally similar to those for other bilateral metazoans.
although many examples of discontinuous ribosomal genes have been documented in bacteria and archaea, as well as the nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria of eukaryotes, oysters are some of the first characterized examples of fragmented bilateral animal mitochondrial rrna genes.
the secondary structures of the oyster lsu rrna fragments have been predicted on the basis of previous comparative metazoan mitochondrial lsu rrna structure models.
the two segments are transcribed separately, and not spliced together although they still form functional rrnas and ribosomes.
in this study, we have characterized this fragmentation with comparative analysis and experimentation.
we also used rt-pcr and analyzed ests to determine if the two fragmented lsu rrnas are spliced together.
