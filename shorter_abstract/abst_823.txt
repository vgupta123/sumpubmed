chlamydia sanzinia forms a clade with c. pneumoniae and c. pecorum, distinct from former “chlamydophila” species.
we identified two chlamydial genomic contigs: a  <dig> , <dig> bp contig, and a  <dig>  bp contig, representing the chromosome and plasmid of ca.
the  <dig> predicted coding regions include an expanded repertoire of outer membrane proteins , some of which exhibited frameshift mutations, as well as several chlamydial virulence factors such as the translocating actin-recruitment phosphoprotein  and macrophage inhibition potentiator .
in doing so, we propose a new candidate species in the genus chlamydia  and reveal new information about the biological diversity of this important group of pathogens.
evidence is growing that many of these novel chlamydiae may be important pathogens in humans and animals.
a significant barrier to characterising these novel chlamydiae is the requirement for culturing.
it is anticipated that this method will be suitable for characterisation of other novel chlamydiae.
recent molecular studies have revealed considerably more diversity in the phylum chlamydiae than was previously thought.
genomic characterisation of a novel uncultured chlamydiae from the first reptilian host has expanded our understanding of the diversity and biology of a genus that was thought to be the most well-characterised in this unique phylum.
