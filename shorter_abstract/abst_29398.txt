rabs direct the organelle-specific recruitment of vesicle tethering factors, motor proteins, and regulators of membrane traffic.
the rab g proteins are the single largest family of proteins that participate in the traffic between organelles, with  <dig> rabs encoded in the human genome.
a strikingly large repertoire of at least  <dig> rabs appears to have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor , consistent with the 'complexity early' view of eukaryotic evolution.
we found that other rabs have expanded and diversified, including a large expansion at the dawn of metazoans, which could be followed to provide an account of the evolutionary history of all human rabs.
tracing the fate of the leca rabs revealed extensive losses with many extant eukaryotes having fewer rabs, and none having the full complement.
through iterative use of hidden markov models and tree building, we classified rabs across the eukaryotic kingdom to provide the most comprehensive view of rab evolution obtained to date.
membrane-bound organelles are a defining feature of eukaryotic cells, and play a central role in most of their fundamental processes.
some rab changes could be correlated with differences in cellular organization, and the relative lack of variation in other families of membrane-traffic proteins suggests that it is the changes in rabs that primarily underlies the variation in organelles between species and cell types.
