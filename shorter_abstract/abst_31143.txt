because these host-pathogen interactions are extensive and interactions between human proteins are found within many different databases, it is difficult to generate integrated hiv-human interaction networks.
we have developed a web-based platform, termed gps-prot http://www.gpsprot.org, that allows for facile integration of different hiv interaction data types as well as inclusion of interactions between human proteins derived from publicly-available databases, including mint, biogrid and hprd.
the software has the ability to group proteins into functional modules or protein complexes, generating more intuitive network representations and also allows for the uploading of user-generated data.
