this study aimed to determine the enhanced immune responses of mice inoculated with a dna vaccine coexpressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> of a genotype-i prrsv.
the results showed that orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins of genotype-i prrsv induced gp <dig> and gp5-specific antibodies that could neutralize the virus.
using quil a as adjuvant, genotype-i prrsv gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins produced good immunogenicity and reactivity.
the results of this study demonstrated that co-immunization with gp <dig> and gp <dig> produced a better immune response in mice.
the levels of cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn–γ of the experimental groups were significantly higher than those of control groups after booster vaccination .
t lymphocyte proliferation assays showed that the prrsv lv strain virus could stimulate the proliferation of t lymphocytes in mice in the experimental group.
the european  genotype of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  has recently emerged in china.
balb/c mice were immunized with the dna vaccines; delivered in the form of chitosan-dna nanoparticles.
more importantly, better prrsv-specific neutralizing antibody titers and cell-mediated immune responses were observed in mice immunized with the dna vaccine co-expressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins than in mice immunized with a dna vaccine expressing either protein singly.
current vaccines are not able to protect against prrsv infection completely and have inherent drawbacks.
the coexistence of genotype-i and -ii prrsv strains could cause seriously affect prrsv diagnosis and management.
to evaluate the immunogenicity of gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins from european-type prrsv, three dna vaccines, pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig>  pvax1-eu-orf <dig> and pvax1-eu-orf <dig>  were constructed, which were based on a genotype-i lv strain .
thus, genetically engineered vaccines, including dna vaccine and live vector engineered vaccines, have been developed.
