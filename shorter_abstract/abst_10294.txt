together our findings indicate that the rice sa and aba signaling pathways cross-communicate with the xoo df and dsf qs systems and underscore the importance of bidirectional interkingdom signaling in molding plant-microbe interactions.
despite repressing swimming motility, sodium salicylate  induced production of the diffusible signal factor  and diffusible factor  qs signals, with resultant accumulation of xanthomonadin and extracellular polysaccharides.
in contrast, little is known about whether phytohormones also directly influence microbial virulence, similar to what has been reported in animal systems.
moreover, we found both df and dsf to influence sa- and aba-responsive gene expression in planta.
small-molecule hormones are well known to play key roles in the plant immune signaling network that is activated upon pathogen perception.
in contrast, abscisic acid , which favors infection by xoo, had little impact on df- and dsf-mediated qs, but promoted bacterial swimming via the luxr solo protein oryr.
