here we verified the role of an extracellular carboxylesterase, esterase- <dig> , in the sensory physiological and behavioral dynamics of drosophila melanogaster response to its pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate .
est-6Â° mutant males had a lower threshold of behavioral response to cva, as revealed by the analysis of two cva-induced behaviors.
our results also expand the role of est- <dig> in drosophila biology, from reproduction to olfaction, and highlight the role of odes in insect olfaction.
these enzymes putatively play a role in signal dynamics by a rapid inactivation of odorants in the vicinity of the sensory receptors, although direct in vivo experimental evidences are lacking.
our study presents evidence that est- <dig> plays a role in the physiological and behavioral dynamics of sex pheromone response in drosophila males and supports a role of est- <dig> as an odorant-degrading enzyme  in male antennae.
insects respond to the spatial and temporal dynamics of a pheromone plume, which implies not only a strong response to 'odor on', but also to 'odor off'.
est- <dig> was previously linked to post-mating effects in the reproductive system of females.
we first confirm that est- <dig> is highly expressed in olfactory sensilla, including cva-sensitive sensilla, and we show that expression is likely associated with non-neuronal cells.
in particular, mutant males exhibited a strong decrease of male-male courtship, in association with a delay in courtship initiation.
this requires mechanisms geared toward a fast signal termination.
several mechanisms may contribute to signal termination, among which odorant-degrading enzymes.
