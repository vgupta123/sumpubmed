the genetic network shows that the latin american and mediterranean family constitutes the backbone of the genetic tb population-structure in venezuela, responsible of >60% of total tb cases studied.
this is the first genetic biodiversity study of m. tuberculosis in venezuela.
this study gives a first overview of the m. tuberculosis strains circulating in venezuela during the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance.
thus, we investigated the genetic patterns of strains isolated in the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance realised as part of the global project of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance .
mutations in rpob gene and katg genes were detected in 64% and 43% of the mdr strains, respectively.
the results were compared with the international spoligotyping database .
two clusters were found to be identical by the four different analysis methods, presumably representing cases of recent transmission of mdr tuberculosis.
eight new inter-regional clusters were created.
clinical isolates  were genotyped by spoligotyping.
