within treated habitats, early instar anopheline mosquitoes were recovered more from habitats provided with neem and fish compared to bti treated habitats.
six main mosquito habitat types namely artificial ponds, abandoned fish ponds, active fish ponds, open drains, temporary pools and swamps were found in nyabondo.
early anopheline instars were mainly recovered from temporary pools, artificial ponds and abandoned fish ponds.
neem chippings are a good tool for mosquito larval source management under field conditions.
this paper presents results from a survey of mosquito breeding habitats and the efficacy of neem chippings as a potential larvicide that can be integrated in mosquito control on nyabondo plateau in western kenya.
all treated habitats recorded higher numbers of early instar larvae than late instars or pupae, indicating that gravid female mosquitoes still oviposited within treated habitats.
however, more research needs to be done to quantify the contribution of this tool to the overall mosquito borne disease transmission.
both early and late instar larvae of anopheline and culicine mosquitoes were more abundant in the controls than in the bti and neem treated habitats.
