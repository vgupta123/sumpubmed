microscopic agglutination tests showed that r4r antisera was immunological cross-reactive with a range of chinese standard reference strains of leptospira belonging to different serogroups.
finally, r4r-immunized guinea pigs showed increased survival of lethal leptospira challenges compared with pbs-immunized animals and tissue damage and leptospiral colonization of the kidney were reduced.
in this study, a chimeric multi-epitope protein-based vaccine was designed and tested for its potency to induce a specific immune response and provide protection against l. interrogans infection.
in guinea pigs, the r4r vaccine induced a th1-biased immune response, as reflected by the igg2a/igg <dig> ratio and cytokine production of stimulated splenocytes derived from immunized animals.
western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein  mainly expressed in a soluble pattern, and reacted with antibodies raised in rabbit against heat-killed leptospira and in guinea pigs against the r4r vaccine.
development of a universal vaccine is one of the major strategic goals to overcome the disease burden of leptospirosis.
