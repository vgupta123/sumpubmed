this approach facilitates exploration of the transduction processes and is a valuable tool for studying phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer.
when phage genes are in the prophage state, they behave like chromosomal genes.
this enables marker genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes, to be incorporated into the stx gene.
seven phages carrying two different antibiotic resistance genes were derived from phages that are directly involved in the pathogenesis of shiga toxin-producing strains, using this modified protocol.
these modifications included: confirming the stability of the target stx gene increasing the number of cells to be transformed and using a three-step pcr method to produce the amplimer containing the antibiotic resistance gene.
these phages can transfer the marker genes to the bacteria that they infect and convert.
the red recombinase system of bacteriophage lambda has been used to inactivate chromosomal genes in e. coli k- <dig> through homologous recombination using linear pcr products.
once the phages' lytic cycle is activated, recombinant shiga toxin converting phages are produced.
