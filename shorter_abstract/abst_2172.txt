the failure of a leading species-specific molecular assay to detect these genotypes indicates a risk of false negative eimeria diagnosis when using molecular tools and suggests that the spatial occurrence of each otu may be far wider than has been recognised.
one such threat are eimeria species parasites, protozoa which can cause the disease coccidiosis.
seven eimeria species that infect chickens are recognised with a global enzootic distribution.
comparison with a widely used, established eimeria species-specific pcr assay revealed failure to detect the otu genotypes.
all three of the eimeria otu genotypes appear to be common in north-western nigeria.
after amplification by in vivo propagation all three cryptic otu genotypes were detected using polymerase chain reaction , including otuy for the first time outside of australia.
two of the three otus have also been detected in sub-saharan africa, but their occurrence, pathology and the risk they pose is largely unknown.
