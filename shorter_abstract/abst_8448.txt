we also identified the most-n-terminal peptide of  <dig> polypeptides, of which sixty-four had originally been wrongly annotated.
a large dataset of peptides from r. pomeroyi was obtained after searching over  <dig>  million ms/ms spectra against a six-frame translated genome database.
in this work we applied high-throughput proteogenomics to ruegeria pomeroyi, a member of the roseobacter clade, an abundant group of marine bacteria, as a seed for the annotation of the whole clade.
those orfs specified by only one peptide detected by tandem mass spectrometry, we could confirm the probable existence of five additional new genes after proving that the corresponding rnas were transcribed.
their discoveries point to a possible theory for protein evolution that will rely on high expression of orphans in bacteria: their putative poor efficiency could be counterbalanced by a higher level of expression.
in addition, we also report the presence of novel genes within operons encoding determinants of the important tricarboxylic acid cycle, a feature that seems to be characteristic of some roseobacter genomes.
