we have used a bioinformatics approach to identify these genes, followed by qpcr validation, immunohistochemical localization, and in situ hybridization to visualize expression in normal ovaries and tumors from animals fed a control diet or a diet containing 10% flaxseed.
the laying hen model of spontaneous epithelial ovarian cancer  is unique in that it is the only model that enables observations of early events in disease progression and is therefore also uniquely suited for chemoprevention trials.
previous studies on the effect of dietary flaxseed in laying hens have revealed the potential for both amelioration and prevention of ovarian cancer.
we suggest that nutritional intervention with flaxseed targets the pathways regulating branching morphogenesis and thereby alters the progression of ovarian cancer.

expression of these genes coincides with expression of e-cadherin in the tumor epithelium.
bioinformatic analysis of ovarian tumors in hens led to the identification of a group of highly up-regulated genes that are involved in the embryonic process of branching morphogenesis.
this does not appear to be due to an increase in zeb <dig> as mrna levels are increased five-fold in tumors, with no significant difference between control-fed and flax-fed hens.
