in the present studies we show that recombinant alo  or native alo, secreted by viable b. anthracis, is lethal to human primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes , monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages , lymphocytes, thp- <dig> monocytic human cell line and me- <dig>  detroit  <dig>  and a <dig> epithelial cells by trypan blue exclusion or lactate dehydrogenase  release viability assays.
the lethality of ralo and native alo on human monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes supports the idea that alo may represent a previously unidentified virulence factor of b. anthracis.
alo cytotoxicity is dose and time dependent and susceptibility to alo-mediated lysis differs between cell types.
the study of other factors produced by b. anthracis, along with the major anthrax toxins, will lead to a better understanding of this bacterium's pathogenesis, as well as provide information for the development of antitoxin vaccines for treating and preventing anthrax.
in addition to these well characterized toxins, b. anthracis secretes several proteases and phospholipases, and a newly described toxin of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  family, anthrolysin o .
bacillus anthracis is an animal and human pathogen whose virulence is characterized by lethal and edema toxin, as well as a poly-glutamic acid capsule.
