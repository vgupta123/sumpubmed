further analyses of mobile genetic elements  revealed genomic diversity owed to:  a modularly structured pathogenicity island;  a site-specifically integrated and previously unknown genomic island of  <dig> kb in two strains putatively involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis; and  isolate-specific plasmid and phage patterns.
molecular, genomic and phenotypic analysis of representative isolates of a major clone of e. faecalis mlst st <dig> revealed new insights into the microbiology of a commensal bacterium which can turn into a conditional pathogen.
moreover, we used different cell-biological and animal experiments to compare the isolate d <dig> with a closely related st <dig> endocarditis isolate whose draft genome sequence was also generated.
isolates of a distinct mlst type st <dig> represent the most frequent strain type of this species, distributed worldwide and originating from various sources  and different conditions .
we generated the first circular closed reference genome of an e. faecalis isolate d <dig> of animal origin and compared it with the genomes of other reference strains.

since enterococci are known to be highly recombinogenic we determined to analyse the microevolution and niche adaptation of this highly distributed clonal type.
we compared a set of  <dig> st <dig> isolates by assessing key molecular determinants, performing whole genome sequencing  and a number of phenotypic assays including resistance profiling, formation of biofilm and utilisation of carbon sources.
genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest a high level of similarity regarding the core genome, also demonstrated by similar carbon utilisation patterns.
enterococcus faecalis is a multifaceted microorganism known to act as a beneficial intestinal commensal bacterium.
distribution of known and putative virulence-associated genes did not differentiate between st <dig> strains from a commensal and clinical background or an animal or human source.
d <dig> generally showed a greater capacity of adherence to human cell lines and an increased pathogenic potential in various animal models in combination with an even faster growth in vivo .
