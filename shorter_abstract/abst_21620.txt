however, in concordance with previous genome-wide studies, we also detected a substantial number of signatures without any yet known gene content.
the purpose of this study was to map genome-wide selection signatures in ten cattle breeds and thus improve the understanding of the genome response to strong artificial selection and support the identification of the underlying genetic variants of favoured phenotypes.
we set the significance thresholds using the maximum xp-ehh values of two essentially artificially unselected breeds and found up to  <dig> selection signatures per breed.
moreover, we detected six genes strongly associated with known qtl for beef or dairy traits  within selection signatures of at least one breed.
relatively recent history, including breed formation and the still enduring enormous improvement of economically important traits, is expected to have left distinctive footprints of selection within the genome.
these results show the power of xp-ehh analyses in cattle to discover promising candidate genes and raise the hope of identifying phenotypically important variants in the near future.
we analysed  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  using cross population extended haplotype homozygosity .
a literature search for genes lying in outstanding signatures revealed further promising candidate genes.
through a confirmation process we verified selection for three distinct phenotypes typical for one breed .
