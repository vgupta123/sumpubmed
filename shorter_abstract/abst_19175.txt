in particular, categorical analyses of the dysregulated genes demonstrated significant enrichment of molecules associated with the components of muscle cell contractile unit, ion channels, metabolic pathways and kinases.
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is a fatal muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene.
transcriptomic studies so far conducted on dystrophic cells and tissues suffer from non-specific changes and background noise due to heterogeneous comparisons and secondary pathologies.
a study design in which a perfectly matched control cell population is used as reference for transcriptomic studies will give a much more specific insight into the effects of dystrophin deficiency and dmd pathophysiology.
our results suggest that in striated muscles, dystrophin is involved in orchestrating proper development and organization of myofibers as contractile units, depicting a novel pathophysiology for dmd where the absence of dystrophin results in maldeveloped myofibers prone to physical stress and damage.
using rna interference  to knock down dystrophin in myotubes from c57bl <dig> mice, we created a homogenous model to study the transcriptome of dystrophin-deficient myotubes.
additionally, some of the dysregulated genes could potentially explain conditions and endophenotypes associated with dystrophin deficiency, such as dysregulation of calcium homeostasis , or cardiomyopathy .
with a clear and specific definition of the transcriptome of dystrophin deficiency, manipulation of identified dysregulated molecules downstream of dystrophin may lead to novel ameliorative approaches for dmd.
