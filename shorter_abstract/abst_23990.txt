here we investigated whether ca2+ sparks regulate smc global i and diameter in the spiral modiolar artery  by activating bk channels.

the results suggest that ca2+ sparks, while present, do not regulate vascular diameter in the sma by activating bk channels and that the regulation of vascular diameter in the sma is determined by the ca2+-sensitivity of constriction.
inhibition of ca2+ sparks with ryanodine increased global ca2+ and constricted sma at  <dig> cmh2o but inhibition of ca2+ sparks with tetracaine or inhibition of bk channels with iberiotoxin at  <dig> cmh2o did not produce a similar effect.
when the ca2+-sensitivity of the sma was increased by prior application of  <dig> nm endothelin- <dig>  ryanodine induced a robust vasoconstriction at  <dig> cmh2o.
in many vascular smooth muscle cells , ryanodine receptor-mediated ca2+ sparks activate large-conductance ca2+-activated k+  channels leading to lowered smc i and vasodilation.
ca2+ signals and vascular diameter changes were recorded using a laser-scanning confocal imaging system.
effects of various pharmacological agents on ca2+ signals and vascular diameter were analyzed.
