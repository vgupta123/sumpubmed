a significant reduction in the total and several single parameters of the clinical score were found after 10 days of inhalative therapy and edr.
gelatin zymography was performed for qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> in balf supernatant, while fluorimetry was used to evaluate mmp- <dig> activity.
clinical and cytological scoring was performed before and after inhalative therapy using budesonide  and edr .
metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, in particular mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  are valuable markers for clinical improvement in rao.
overexpression of matrix-metalloproteinases  has been shown to lead to tissue damage in equine recurrent airway obstruction , as a misbalance with their natural inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , occurs.

we hypothesized that levels of mmps, timps and their ratios correlate with improvement in clinical findings and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  cytology after 10 days of inhalative glucocorticoid therapy and environmental dust reduction  and may be used to monitor treatment success.
