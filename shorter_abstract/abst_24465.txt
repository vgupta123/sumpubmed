to protect themselves from exogenous insults, mammalian cells tend to manifest poor transfection efficiency.
a protocol consists of  <dig> experiments was performed according to the principle of uniform design.
compared to traditional method, the integrated application of uniform design and least-squares support vector machine greatly reduced the number of required experiments.
the integrated application of uniform design and least-squares support vector machine is a simple technique for obtaining high transfection efficiency.
in this protocol, amount of liposome, amount of plasmid, and the number of seeded cells  <dig> h before transfection were set as independent variables and transfection efficiency was set as dependent variable.
a model was deduced from independent variables and their respective dependent variable.
this study investigates the possibility of optimizing transfection efficiency by using a method referred to as least-squares support vector machine, which requires only a few experiments and maintains fairly high accuracy.
what's more, higher transfection efficiency was achieved.
fortunately, several mathematical methods, developed in the past decades, may facilitate the resolution of this issue.
transfection in mammalian cells based on liposome presents great challenge for biological professionals.
