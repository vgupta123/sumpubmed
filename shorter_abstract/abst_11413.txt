the results of the present study do not support the addition of trimethoprim-sulphadimidine to therapeutic protocols for equine glandular ulceration.
however, given the potential deleterious consequences associated with the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials, the inclusion of antimicrobials in treatment regimes for egus is not justified until their efficacy is further validated.
healing of the glandular mucosa was observed in 7/ <dig>  and 3/ <dig>  of horses in the tmps and omep groups, respectively .
improvement of the glandular mucosa was observed in 12/ <dig>  and 9/ <dig>  of horses in the tmps and omep groups, respectively .
the pathophysiology and epidemiology of squamous and glandular disease are different and recently it has been shown that the response of glandular gastric ulceration to monotherapy with omeprazole is poor.
the objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of trimethoprim-sulphadimidine to omeprazole therapy would result in superior healing of naturally occurring equine glandular ulceration compared with omeprazole monotherapy.
combination therapy of omeprazole plus trimethoprim-sulphadimidine could not be demonstrated to be superior to omeprazole monotherapy.
