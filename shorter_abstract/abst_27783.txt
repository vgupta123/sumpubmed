we particularly aimed to clarify whether the alpine taxa represent a monophyletic group and if the local species diversity is rather the result of isolation in geographically separated pleistocene glacial refuges or earlier tertiary and quaternary palaeogeographic events.
in order to test if patterns of molecular genetic and morphological differentiation were congruent and/or if hybridization had occurred, shell morphometric investigations were performed on the orcula species endemic to the alps.
the phylogenetic trees resulting from the analyses of both the mitochondrial  and the nuclear  data sets revealed three main groups, which correspond to the three subgenera orcula, illyriobanatica and hausdorfia.
the present study confirms the importance of the alps as biodiversity hotspot and origin center of land snail diversity.
the central and southern european mountain ranges represent important biodiversity hotspots and show high levels of endemism.
in some cases, speciation events could be linked to the divergence of populations in glacial refuges during the pleistocene.

the reconstruction of the historic geographic ranges suggested that the genus originated in the dinarides during the middle miocene and first colonized the alps during the late miocene, giving rise to the most diverse subgenus orcula.
the species diversity in the subgenus orcula was likely promoted by miocene to pliocene palaeogeographic events and the insular distribution of preferred limestone areas.
within the latter subgenus  almost all species were differentiated by both molecular genetic markers and by shell morphometrics, except o. gularis and o. pseudodolium.
in the land snail genus orcula held,  <dig> nine species are distributed in the alps and a few taxa inhabit the carpathians, the dinarids and the western black sea region.
