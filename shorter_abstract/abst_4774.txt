visual inspection of the discarded mutation sites exposed low coverages at the sites flanked by high amplitudes of coverage depth.
as we suspected the sequenced insert length to be crucial in the uneven coverage of exome captured samples, we sheared  <dig> genomic dna samples to two different dna insert size lengths, namely  <dig> and  <dig> bp.
interestingly, although mean coverages of target regions were clearly higher in samples of  <dig> bp insert length, the level of evenness was more pronounced in  <dig> bp samples.
in addition, mutation analysis on a subset of the samples was performed.
whole exome sequencing  has been proven to serve as a valuable basis for various applications such as variant calling and copy number variation  analyses.

in these isogenic subclones, the false negative rate in the  <dig> bp samples was almost double to that in the  <dig> bp samples.
producing longer insert reads could be a good strategy to achieve better uniform read coverage in coding regions and hereby enhancing the effective sequencing yield to provide an improved basis for further variant calling and cnv analyses.
