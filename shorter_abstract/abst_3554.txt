a list of degs included up-regulated coral genes like cytochrome c oxidase and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and up-regulated photosynthetic genes of algal origin, whereas coral gfp-like fluorescent chromoprotein and sodium/potassium-transporting atpase showed reduced transcript levels.
although there were no signs of coral bleaching after exposure to short-term thermal and nutrient stress conditions, we managed to detect oxidative stress and apoptotic changes on a molecular level and provide a list of prospective stress biomarkers for both partners in symbiosis.
here, we investigated the expression of genes in colonies of the reef-building coral acropora aspera exposed to short-term sub-lethal levels of thermal  and nutrient stress .
the rna-seq data provided hundreds of differentially expressed genes  corresponding to various stress regimes, with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes common to all stress regimes.
in corals with preserved symbiont physiological performance , transcriptomic changes and degs provided important insight into early stages of the stress response in the coral holobiont.
gene ontology analyses revealed enriched pathways, which led to changes in the dynamics of protein networks affecting growth, cellular processes, and energy requirement.
taxonomic analyses of the coral holobiont disclosed the dominant presence of transcripts from coral  and symbiodinium , as well as ~15-20% of unknown sequences which lacked sequence identity to known genes.
consequently, our findings are important for understanding and anticipating impacts of anthropogenic global climate change on coral reefs.
understanding how elevated temperatures and nutrient concentration affect early transcriptional changes in corals and their algal endosymbionts is critically important for evaluating the responses of coral reefs to global changes happening in the environment.
