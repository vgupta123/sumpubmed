the human microplasminogen gene was cloned into the ppic9k vector, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into pichia pastoris strain gs <dig>  the concentration of plasmin reached  <dig>  mg/l of culture medium.
the specific activity of rhμplg reached  <dig>  u/mg.
the km of substrate hydrolysis by recombinant human microplasmin was comparable to that of human plasmin, while rhμplm had higher kcat/km values than plasmin.
the successful expression of rhμplg in p. pastoris lays a solid foundation for its downstream application.
developing an industrial production method that provides high yields of this protein with high purity, quality, and potency is critical for preclinical research.
the high purity and activity of the rhμplg obtained here will likely prove to be a valuable tool for studies of its application in thrombotic diseases and vitreoretinopathies.
recombinant human microplasminogen  is a derivative of plasmin that solely consists of the catalytic domain of human plasmin and lacks the five kringle domains found in the native protein.
reliable rhμplg production  is feasible using genetically modified p. pastoris as a host strain.
