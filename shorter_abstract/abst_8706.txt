currently, software applications capable of generating limited color-grid representations can be found only in advanced statistical packages or custom programs , often associated with steep learning curves and requiring expert knowledge.
data, titles, and data labels are input as tab-delimited text files or microsoft excel spreadsheets and the color-grid settings are specified through the graphical interface or a text configuration file.
such "color-grid" representations have found increasing use in the biological sciences  as they are particularly suited to complex data sets and offer an alternative to the graphical representations included in traditional statistical software packages.
