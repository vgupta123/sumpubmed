different systems contributing to copper homeostasis in bacteria have been described in recent years involving periplasmic and transport proteins that provide resistance via metal efflux to the extracellular media .
these observations suggest complex evolutionary dynamics and still unexplored interactions to achieve copper homeostasis, challenging some of the molecular transport mechanism proposed for these systems.
surprisingly, copper homeostatic pathways did not behave as evolutionary units with particular species assembling different combinations of basic functions.
the integration and interrelation of these systems and their apparent redundancies are less clear since they have been studied in alternative systems.
based on the idea that cellular copper is not free but rather it is transferred via protein-protein interactions, we hypothesized that systems would coevolve and be constituted by set numbers of essential components.
