the sequences of the 16s rrna genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora.
eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the streptococcus bovis group and three streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery.
we studied  <dig> children with diarrhea who were admitted to the childrenâ€™s hospital in shanxi province during  <dig>
eleven of  <dig> children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission.
we sequenced the genome of s. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands.
the identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylz of streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci.
we isolated strains that were possibly from the s. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp.
