tolerability and efficacy of the intestinal phosphate binder lantharenol®  were tested in two prospective, randomized and negative controlled laboratory studies with healthy adult cats fed commercial maintenance diets non-restricted in phosphorus.
lantharenol® was found to be safe and well tolerated up to the dose of  <dig> g/kg bodyweight, corresponding to a concentration of  <dig> g lantharenol®/kg complete feed, defined as dry matter with a standard moisture content of 12%.
apparent phosphorus digestibility was dose-dependently reduced compared to the control group fed with diet only .
