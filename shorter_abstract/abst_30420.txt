our approach for searching particular biological patterns could be valuable for systematically understanding functional relationships between genes and other biological components at a genome-wide level.
we propose a probabilistic coevolutionary biclustering algorithm  that can cluster the rows and columns in a matrix simultaneously by utilizing a dynamic adaptation of multiple species and adopting probabilistic learning.
furthermore, acquiring statistical information on two populations using probabilistic learning can improve the ability of search towards the optimum value.
the results demonstrated that pcoba outperformed previous evolutionary computation methods as well as other biclustering methods.

in biclustering problems, a coevolutionary search is suitable since it can optimize interdependent subcomponents formed of rows and columns.
we evaluated the performance of pcoba on synthetic dataset and yeast expression profiles.
