after the cells were exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation  for  <dig> h and reperfusion for  <dig> h, the results of 3-  <dig>  5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide  assay, lactate dehydrogenase  release assay, flow cytometric analysis and western blot analysis showed that physiological doses of e <dig> enhanced cell viability, reduced cell apoptosis and decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein caspase- <dig>  in contrast, pharmacological doses of e <dig> decreased cell viability and induced cell apoptosis.

the results of 5-bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation and flow cytometric analysis showed that physiological doses of e <dig> enhanced cell proliferation and pharmacological doses of e <dig> inhibited cell proliferation.
the results of garcia test,  <dig>   <dig>  5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride  staining showed that  <dig> μg/kg and  <dig> μg/kg e <dig> replacement induced an increase in neurological deficit scores, a decrease in the infarct volume and a reduction in the expression of caspase- <dig> when compared to animals in the ovx group without e <dig> treatment.
however,  <dig> μg/kg e <dig> replacement treatment decreased neurological deficit scores, increased the infarct volume and the expression of caspase- <dig> when compared to animals in the control group and  <dig> up/kg or  <dig> μg/kg e <dig> replacement group.
we conclude that physiological levels of e <dig> exhibit neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia; whereas, pharmacological or supraphysiological doses of e <dig> have damaging effects on neurons after cerebral ischemia.
because neuroprotective effects of estrogen remain controversial, we aimed to investigate the effect of different doses of estradiol  on cerebral ischemia using both in vivo and in vitro experiments.
transient cerebral ischemia was induced for  <dig> h using the middle cerebral artery occlusion  technique, followed by  <dig> h of reperfusion.
in vivo, adult ovariectomized  female rats received continuous subcutaneous injection of different doses of e <dig> for  <dig> weeks.
