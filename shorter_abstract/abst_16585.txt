the availability of datasets based on high-throughput biological screens or assays in public domain makes computational methods a plausible proposition for building predictive models.
in the present study, we have used the data from in-vitro screens for anti-tubercular activity from a high-throughput screen available in public domain to build highly accurate classifiers based on molecular descriptors of the molecules.
we show that by using four supervised state-of-the-art classifiers  we are able to generate in-silico predictive models on an extremely imbalanced  large dataset of anti-tubercular molecules with reasonable aroc  and bcr  values.
we show that machine learning tools can be used to build highly effective predictive models for virtual high-throughput screens to prioritize molecules from large molecular libraries.
computational methods including machine learning have been widely employed to build classifiers for high-throughput virtual screens to prioritize molecules for further analysis.
the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in pandemic proportions throughout the world and the paucity of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis have re-iterated the need to accelerate the discovery of novel molecules with anti-tubercular activity.
though high-throughput screens for anti-tubercular activity are available, they are expensive, tedious and time-consuming to be performed on large scales.
thus, there remains an unmet need to prioritize the molecules that are taken up for biological screens to save on cost and time.
