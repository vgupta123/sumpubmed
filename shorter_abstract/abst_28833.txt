the laos sample exhibited ample mtdna diversity, reflecting the huge number of ethnic groups listed.
the laos population was characteristic in terms of haplotype composition and genetic structure, however, genetic comparisons with other southeast asian populations revealed limited, but significant genetic differentiation.
to better characterize the genetic variation of this region, we analyzed the entire mtdna control region of  <dig> unrelated donors from laos according to highest forensic quality standards.
vast migrations and subsequent assimilation processes have shaped the genetic composition of southeast asia, an area of close contact between several major ethnic groups.
in order to describe the mtdna setup of laos more thoroughly, the data were subjected to population genetic comparisons with  <dig> east asian groups.
for a posteriori data quality control, quasi-median network constructions and autosomal str typing were performed.
