to deal with the imbalanced data distribution inherent in image annotation tasks, the undersampling method is applied together with majority vote.
the undersampling with majority vote is shown to be effective in tackling the problem of imbalanced data.
based on the constructed features, we develop both an image-level scheme and a group-level scheme to tackle the key challenges in annotating drosophila gene expression pattern images automatically.
we present a computational framework to perform anatomical keywords annotation for drosophila gene expression images.
results on drosophila embryonic expression pattern images verify the efficacy of our approach.
the spatial sparse coding approach is used to represent local patches of images in comparison with the well-known bag-of-words  method.
moreover, combining sparse coding and image-level scheme leads to consistent performance improvement in keywords annotation.
drosophila melanogaster has been established as a model organism for investigating the developmental gene interactions.
the spatio-temporal gene expression patterns of drosophila melanogaster can be visualized by in situ hybridization and documented as digital images.
