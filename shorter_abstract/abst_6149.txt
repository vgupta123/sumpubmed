the support of rbm creation, debugging, and interactive visualization expedites the rbm learning process and reduces model construction time; while built-in model simulation and results with multiple linked views streamline the execution and analysis of newly created models and generated networks.
however, novel visual tools are needed in order to make rbm accessible to a broad range of users, to make specification of models less error prone, and to improve workflows.
a development cycle that includes close interaction with expert users allows rulebender to better serve the needs of the systems biology community.
we present the user requirements, visual paradigms, algorithms and design decisions behind rulebender, with emphasis on visual global/local model exploration and integrated execution of simulations.
rulebender has been adopted as both an educational and a research tool and is available as a free open source tool at http://www.rulebender.org.
