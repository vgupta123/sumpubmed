western blots showed that cells stably transfected with constructs expressing either pax <dig> or pax <dig> contained raised levels of both pax <dig> and pax <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr confirmed an increase in levels of pax <dig> mrna in cells containing pax6-expressing constructs and an increase in levels of pax <dig> mrna in cells containing pax6-expressing constructs.
furthermore, our results suggest that an important function of positive feedback might be to stabilise the relative levels of pax <dig> and pax <dig>
our results demonstrate that pax <dig> can up-regulate production of pax <dig> protein from an entire intact endogenous pax <dig> locus in its genomic environment.
it has two major isoforms, pax <dig> and pax <dig>  and the ratios between their expression levels vary within narrow limits.
pax <dig> is a transcription factor essential for normal development of the eyes and nervous system.
