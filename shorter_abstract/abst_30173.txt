singular value decomposition is used as a preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality and noise.
furthermore, singular value decomposition provided a consistent increase in precision and recall, which makes it an important preprocessing step when dealing with noisy data.
in this paper, we present a novel structure-based protein function prediction and structural classification method: cutoff scanning matrix .
the aspect of protein function considered in the present work is enzyme activity.
we showed that the patterns derived from csms could effectively be used to predict protein function and thus help with automatic function annotation.
the unforgiving pace of growth of available biological data has increased the demand for efficient and scalable paradigms, models and methodologies for automatic annotation.
moreover, we conducted experiments to verify our ability to assign scop class, superfamily, family and fold to protein domains.
csm was able to achieve a precision of up to 99% after svd preprocessing for a database derived from manually curated protein superfamilies and up to 95% for a dataset of the  <dig> most-populated ec numbers.
these facts reinforce the idea that the pattern of inter-residue distances is an important component of family structural signatures.
our method was capable of significantly improving the recall of a previous study while preserving a compatible precision level.
finally, we compared our structural classification results with those in the literature to place this work into context.
