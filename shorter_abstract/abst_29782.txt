microarray technology is limited to monitoring the expression of previously annotated genes that have corresponding probes on the array.
of these unannotated transcripts,  <dig>  and  <dig>   had orfs similar to those encoding the amino acid sequences of functional proteins in a blastx search against uniprot and refseq databases.
thirty-six-base-pair reads from whole mrnas were mapped to the rice genomic sequence:  <dig> % to  <dig> % were mapped uniquely to the genome, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % bridged exons.
computationally annotated genes have not fully been validated, because ests and full-length cdnas cannot cover entire transcribed regions.
some of these unannotated transcripts encoding putative functional proteins were expressed differentially in response to salinity stress.
here, mrna-seq  was used to monitor whole mrnas of salinity stress-treated rice tissues.
among the unannotated genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were differentially expressed in response to salinity stress.
