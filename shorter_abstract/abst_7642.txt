farauti s.s.  and its range overlaps in three of the seven sampling sites.
farauti s.s. on guadalcanal within  <dig>  years before present .
farauti s.s. expanded much earlier on malaita  than the populations on guadalcanal .
farauti s.s. are monophyletic sister species living in sympatry, and their populations on guadalcanal have recently expanded.
the mosquito anopheles irenicus, a member of the anopheles punctulatus group, is geographically restricted to guadalcanal in the solomon islands.
to infer the genetic variations between these two species, we have analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit ii  and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  <dig>  sequences from guadalcanal and from one of its nearest neighbours, malaita, in the solomon islands.
irenicus was only collected from fresh water bodies on guadalcanal island.
farauti sensu stricto , but is dissimilar in host and habitat preferences.
