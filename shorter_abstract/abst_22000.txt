instead, the phylogenetic incongruence may have been caused by recombination of two divergent alleles following ancient interspecific hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.
slx <dig> and sly <dig> are sex-linked genes on the sex chromosomes of dioecious members of silene sect.
to determine whether gene duplication followed by recombination  may explain the phylogenetic conflict in the silene slx1/y <dig> gene, we use a novel probabilistic, multiple primer-pair pcr approach.
we did not find any evidence supporting gene duplication/loss as explanation to the phylogenetic conflict.
the phylogenetic conflict in the silene slx1/y <dig> gene cannot be explained by paralogy or artefacts, such as in vitro recombination during pcr.
this example clearly demonstrates that different parts of the genome may have different evolutionary histories and stresses the importance of using multiple genes in reconstruction of taxonomic relationships.
increasing evidence from dna sequence data has revealed that phylogenies based on different genes may drastically differ from each other.
the major discrepancy is that silene vulgaris and s. sect.
this may be due to either inter- or intralineage processes, or to methodological or stochastic errors.
the support for the conflict is strong enough to exclude methodological or stochastic errors as likely sources.
we demonstrate that different parts of the slx1/y <dig> region give different phylogenetic signals.
