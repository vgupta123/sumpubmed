we determined the molecular and functional expression of candidate cation channels with gene array , rt-pcr, and whole-cell patch clamp.
the most commonly-observed target of these drugs is the epithelial sodium channel , which is composed of the three subunits α-,β- and γ-enac.
the aim of this study was to determine whether reissner's membrane epithelial cells could support parasensory k+ absorption via amiloride- and benzamil-sensitive electrogenic pathways.
these results are consistent with the amiloride/benzamil-sensitive absorptive flux of reissner's membrane mediated by a highly na+-selective channel that has several key characteristics in common with αβγ-enac.
the amiloride-sensitive pathway therefore absorbs only na+ in this epithelium and does not provide a parasensory k+ efflux route from scala media.
sodium absorption by reissner's membrane is thought to contribute to the homeostasis of the volume of cochlear endolymph.
the selectivity of the benzamil-sensitive cation currents was observed in whole-cell patch clamp recordings under cl--free conditions where cations were the only permeant species.
