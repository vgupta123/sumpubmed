in this study, we have assembled and analyzed amino acid sequences of nox regulatory subunit orthologs from vertebrates, a urochordate, an echinoderm, a mollusc, a cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, fungi and a slime mold amoeba to investigate the evolutionary history of these subunits.
nox <dig> forms a heterodimer with the integral membrane protein, p22phox, and this heterodimer binds to the regulatory subunits p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and the small gtpase rac, triggering superoxide generation.
ancestral p47phox, p67phox, and p22phox genes are broadly seen in the metazoa, except for the ecdysozoans.
p67phox- and p47phox-like genes are seen in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the limpet lottia gigantea that also possess nox2-like co-orthologs of vertebrate nox1- <dig>  duplication of primordial p47phox and p67phox genes occurred in vertebrates, with the duplicated branches evolving into noxo <dig> and noxa <dig>  analysis of characteristic domains of regulatory subunits suggests a novel view of the evolution of nox: in fish, p40phox participated in regulating both nox <dig> and nox <dig>  but after the appearance of mammals, nox <dig>  became independent of p40phox.
this is the first report to provide the comprehensive view of the molecular evolution of regulatory subunits for nox enzymes.
detailed amino acid sequence comparisons identified both putative key residues conserved in characteristic domains and previously unidentified conserved regions.
the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis, the unicellular organism that is the closest relatives of multicellular animals, encodes early prototypes of p22phox, p47phox as well as the earliest known nox2-like ancestor of the nox1- <dig> subfamily.
this approach provides clues for understanding the evolution of biochemical and physiological functions for regulatory-subunit-dependent nox enzymes.
