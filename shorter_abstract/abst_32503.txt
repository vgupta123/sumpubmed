the software is written in java  <dig>  and installers are provided for linux/unix, macos x and windows xp.
to support the inspection of large trees, dendroscope offers a magnification tool.
research in evolution requires software for visualizing and editing phylogenetic trees, for increasingly very large datasets, such as arise in expression analysis or metagenomics, for example.
dendroscope is a user-friendly program for visualizing and navigating phylogenetic trees, for both small and large datasets.
we have developed a new program, dendroscope, for the interactive visualization and navigation of phylogenetic trees.
they either lack some of the standard tree visualization techniques or basic graphics and editing features, or they are restricted to small trees containing only tens of thousands of taxa.
