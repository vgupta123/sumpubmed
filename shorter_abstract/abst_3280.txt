the aggregation phenomenon in lactococci is directly associated with the sex factor and lactose plasmid co-integration event or duplication of the cell wall spanning  domain of prtp proteinase.
lactis bgkp <dig> was isolated from artisanal semi-hard homemade cheese and selected due to its strong auto-aggregation phenotype.
aggregation may play a main role in the adhesion of bacteria to the gastrointestinal epithelium and their colonization ability, as well as in probiotic effects through co-aggregation with intestinal pathogens and their subsequent removal.
this novel lactococcal aggregation protein was shown to be sufficient for cell aggregation in all tested hosts.
aggl is a new protein belonging to the collagen-binding superfamily of proteins and is sufficient for cell aggregation in lactococci.
comparative analysis of cell surface proteins of bgkp <dig> and derivative bgkp1- <dig> revealed a protein of approximately  <dig> kda only in the parental strain bgkp <dig>  the gene involved in aggregation  was mapped on plasmid pkp <dig> , cloned and expressed in homologous and heterologous lactococci and enterococci.
in addition to the aggl gene, six more orfs involved in replication , restriction and modification , transposition  and possible interaction with mucin  were also located on plasmid pkp <dig>
