interestingly, a high proportion of ssrs  were present in compound formation.
go annotation analysis predicted that cdss with ssrs performed various functions associated with cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes.
the results of our large-scale ssr marker development using tree peony are valuable for investigating plant genomic structural evolution and elucidating phenotypic variation in this species during its evolution and artificial selection.
di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant.
ssrs with repeat motifs of 1–4 bp  accounted for  <dig> % of ssrs.
of  <dig> validated primer pairs,  <dig> were selected for polymorphism analysis among  <dig> genotypes; cluster analysis of the resulting data grouped genotypes according to known relationships, confirming the usefulness of the developed ssr markers.
in this study, enriched dna libraries of tree peony, a well-known ornamental woody shrub, were used for high-throughput microsatellite development by  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing.
as in most plants, the predominant motif in tree peony was n, with n less common.
in addition, the genome-wide marker resources generated in this study should aid genomic studies of tree peony and related species.
the shortest ssrs  represented 1% of the total number, whereas ssrs 21– <dig> and 101–110 bp long accounted for 26% and 29%, respectively, of all ssrs.
