the combination of results points to a molecular architecture formed by a rhombus-shaped heterotetramer, which is bound to two different interacting heterotrimeric g proteins .
these novel results constitute an important advance in understanding the molecular intricacies involved in gpcr function.
using computer modeling, aided by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays to monitor receptor homomerization and heteromerization and g-protein coupling, we predict the interacting interfaces and propose a quaternary structure of the gpcr tetramer in complex with two g proteins.
g-protein-coupled receptors , in the form of monomers or homodimers that bind heterotrimeric g proteins, are fundamental in the transfer of extracellular stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways.

we used single-particle tracking experiments in cells expressing functional adenosine a1-a2a receptors fused to fluorescent proteins to show the loss of brownian movement of the a <dig> receptor in the presence of the a2a receptor, and a preponderance of cell surface 2: <dig> receptor heteromers .
