intranasal infection with  <dig> Ã—  <dig> cfus of b. mallei resulted in 90% death in non-treated control mice.
the efficacy of ceftazidime and levofloxacin were studied in balb/c mice as post-exposure treatment following intranasal b. mallei infection.
determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations  in vitro was done by the agar diffusion method and the dilution method.
macrophages treated with antibiotics demonstrated uptake of the drugs and reduced bacterial loads in vitro.
both antibiotics demonstrated utility for the treatment of glanders, including the ability for intracellular penetration and clearance of organisms in vitro.
the effect of two antibiotics with different modes of action on burkholderia mallei strain atcc <dig> was investigated by using in vitro and in vivo studies.
burkholderia mallei is a zoonotic gram negative bacterium which primarily infects solipeds but can cause lethal disease in humans if left untreated.
the antibiotics did not result in complete clearance of the bacterial infection and presence of the bacteria was found in lungs and spleens of the survivors, although bacterial burden recovered from levofloxacin treated animals appeared reduced compared to ceftazidime.
