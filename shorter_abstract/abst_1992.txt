the application offers three main tools: a tool for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a tool for the analysis of seed shape.
results are then reported in the extensible markup language  and comma separated values  file formats.
manual low-throughput phenotyping methods are time consuming, and the results are unreliable.
compared to data obtained by manual processing, p-trap produced reliable results in a much shorter time.
in short, p-trap offers both efficient results and a user-friendly environment for experiments.
the experimental results showed very good accuracy compared to field operator, expert verification and well-known academic methods.
the software processes and quantifies several traits related to panicle structure, detects and counts the grains, and measures their shape parameters.
this paper presents p-trap software , a free open source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture and seed-related traits.
