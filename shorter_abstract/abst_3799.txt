comparison of the vancomycin resistance-conferring tn <dig> transposon between aus <dig> and aus <dig> revealed differences in transposon length and insertion site, and van locus sequence variation that correlated with a higher vancomycin mic in aus <dig>  additional phenotype comparisons between st <dig> and st <dig> isolates showed that while there were no differences in biofilm-formation and killing of galleria mellonella, st <dig> isolates grew significantly faster and out-competed st <dig> isolates in growth assays.
the  <dig> cds have predicted functions that include ion transport, riboflavin metabolism and two phosphotransferase systems.
aus <dig> has a  <dig>  mb genome, comprising a  <dig>  mb circular chromosome and six circular plasmids .
in this report we have explored the genomic and microbiological basis for a sustained increase in bloodstream infections at a major australian hospital caused by enterococcus faecium multi-locus sequence type   <dig>  an outbreak strain that has largely replaced a predecessor st <dig> sequence type.
