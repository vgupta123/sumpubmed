there is increasing evidence that bacterial infection of the intestinal mucosa may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases .
in pigs, an obligate intracellular bacterium, lawsonia intracellularis , was shown to cause proliferative enteropathy  of which some forms display histological and clinical similarities to human ibd.
may infect human cells, we hypothesized that li might be associated with the development of human ibd.
whether an immunologic response to commensal bacteria such as streptococci may contribute to the chronic inflammatory condition in ibd, remained to be determined.
