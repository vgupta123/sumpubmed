we found the potential origin of many tags that did not match the human genome sequence.
sage data is appropriate to map new transcripts to the genome, as demonstrated by the high rate of cross-validation of the corresponding tags using other methods.
some of these correspond to parts of human mrnas, such as polya tails, junctions between two exons and polymorphic regions of transcripts.
we performed a comprehensive study of all publicly available human longsage tags, and carefully verified the reliability of these data.
here we used this property to study the position of human longsage tags obtained from all public libraries.
the others map to known transcribed regions, but many of them  are located either in antisense or in new variants of these known transcripts.
longsage produces tags that are sufficiently long to be reliably mapped to a whole-genome sequence.
we then observed that an unexpectedly large number of the remaining tags still did not match the genome sequence.
the frequency of tags matching once the genome sequence but not in an annotated exon suggests that the human transcriptome is much more complex than shown by the current human genome annotations, with many new splicing variants and antisense transcripts.
another non-negligible proportion can be attributed to contamination by murine transcripts and to residual sequencing errors.
31% of these tags correspond to unannotated transcripts.
using a published error rate in sage libraries, we first removed the tags likely to result from sequencing errors.
