choosing among these seed types, particularly those that use information besides the presence or absence of matching residue pairs, requires practical guidance based on a rigorous comparison, including assessment of sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency.
these results depend on properties of our test set that are not shared by est-based test sets with a strong bias toward coding dna.
for noncoding dna sequences, seeds that use transition information, especially blastz-style seeds, are particularly useful.
our results show that, on a test set biased toward alignments of noncoding dna, transition information significantly improves seed performance, while finer distinctions between different types of mismatches do not.
recently, many types of seed have been proposed to improve on the performance of traditional contiguous seeds as used in, e.g., ncbi blastn.
we compare seeds of several types, including those allowing transition mutations rather than matches at fixed positions, those allowing transitions at arbitrary positions , and those using a more general scoring matrix.
for each seed type, we use an extended version of our mandala seed design software to choose seeds with optimized sensitivity for various levels of specificity.
the mandala seed design software can be found at .
a good seed matching heuristic can reduce the execution time of genomic-scale sequence comparison without degrading sensitivity.
