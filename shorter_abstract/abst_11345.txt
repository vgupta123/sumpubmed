here, we present a web-based toolbox that provides rich functionality for all steps of the evaluation pipeline.
our tool genetrailexpress offers besides standard normalization procedures powerful statistical analysis methods for studying a large variety of biological categories and pathways.
furthermore, an integrated graph visualization tool, bina, enables the user to draw the relevant biological pathways applying cutting-edge graph-layout algorithms.
for these reasons, the evaluation and interpretation of expression data is a complex, labor-intensive multi-step process.
our gene expression toolbox with its interactive visualization of the pathways and the expression values projected onto the nodes will simplify the analysis and interpretation of biochemical pathways considerably.
while a variety of tools for normalizing, analysing, or visualizing expression profiles has been developed in the last years, most of these tools offer only functionality for accomplishing certain steps of the evaluation pipeline.
