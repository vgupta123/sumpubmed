a <dig> cells  were incubated with tgf-β <dig>  il- <dig>  or both tgf-β <dig> and il- <dig>  and changes in e-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin and a-sma levels were measured using real-time pcr, western blotting and fluorescence microscopy.
we assessed the effects of il- <dig> on tgf-β1-induced emt in alveolar epithelial cells.
our results suggest that il- <dig> attenuates epithelial–mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells in the absence or presence of tgf-β <dig> through the jak/stat and tgf-β/smad signalling pathways.

the related proteins in the jak/stat and tgf-β/smad signalling pathways were examined by western blot.
epithelial–mesenchymal transition  is one of the key mechanisms involved in pulmonary fibrosis.
