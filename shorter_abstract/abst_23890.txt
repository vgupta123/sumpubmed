in the ext <dig> mutants, fgf signaling is shown to be affected during nervous system development and reduction of fgf ligands in the mutants affects tail development.
we conclude that ext <dig> is involved in fgf and wnt signaling but not in hh signaling, revealing an unexpected specificity for ext <dig> in signaling pathways during embryonic development.
thus, our results support the hypothesis that regulation of heparan sulfate biosynthesis has distinct instructive functions for different signaling factors.
in addition, no genetic interaction between ext <dig> and shha during development could be detected.
however, potential roles for hs biosynthesis in regulating the function of paracrine signaling molecules that bind to hs are incompletely understood.
in contrast, hh dependent signaling is apparently unaffected in the ext <dig> mutants; hh targeted gene expression is not reduced, the hh inhibitor cyclopamine is not more affective in the mutants and hh dependent cell differentiation in the retina and in the myotome are normal in ext <dig> mutants.
