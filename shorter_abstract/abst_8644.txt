cardiac cell proliferation was significant in the fetal heart.
we discovered a profile of lncrnas differentially expressed between the human fetal and adult heart.
human lncrna microarrays were applied to define gene expression signatures of the fetal  and adult hearts .
long non-coding rnas  have been identified to play important roles in epigenetic processes that underpin organogenesis.
immunofiuorescent staining was used to determine the extent of cardiac cell proliferation.
dem related to cell proliferation were selected to construct a lncrna-mrna co-expression network.
eight lncrnas  were predicted to play a central role in cardiac cell proliferation.
several meaningful lncrnas involved in cardiac cell proliferation were disclosed.

however, the role of lncrnas in the regulation of transition from fetal to adult life of human heart has not been evaluated.
cell cycle was the most enriched pathway in down-regulated genes in the adult heart.
pathway analysis was performed to predict the function of differentially expressed mrnas .
