another highlight of these data revealed that the antimicrobial peptides gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig> and gal <dig> were highly expressed in the spleen compared to other tissues tested.
novel data on the expression of putative tissue specific genes and antimicrobial peptides is highlighted as part of this comprehensive microarray validation study.
there were a number of tissue-selective genes for cecal tonsil, ileum, liver, and spleen identified .
the results of these tissue expression analyses have demonstrated that this microarray has high specificity and sensitivity, and will be a useful tool for chicken functional genomics.
a long oligonucleotide microarray has been manually curated and designed by our group and manufactured using agilent inkjet technology.
in an important validation study, total rna isolated from four major chicken tissues: cecal tonsil , ileum , liver , and spleen  were used for comparative hybridizations.
there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between liver and spleen, spleen and cecal tonsil, cecal tonsil and ileum, liver and cecal tonsil, liver and ileum, spleen and ileum , respectively.
this provides a flexible and powerful platform with high sensitivity and specificity for gene expression studies.
the development of microarray technology has greatly enhanced our ability to evaluate gene expression.
a chicken 60-mer oligonucleotide 44k microarray was designed and validated in a comprehensive survey of gene expression in diverse tissues.
