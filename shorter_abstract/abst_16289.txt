validation studies were performed using rt-pcr on glioma cell lines, patient tumor and nontumor brain samples.
our data indicate that large changes  in alternative splicing are infrequent in gliomagenesis .
the lack of splicing changes may derive from the small number of splicing factors observed to be aberrantly expressed.
we used an exon expression array to perform an objective, genome-wide survey of glioma-specific splicing in  <dig> gbm and  <dig> nontumor brain samples.
