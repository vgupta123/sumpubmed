this work reports on the development of  <dig> carrot ssr markers and their characterization at various levels.
thus, with the purpose of isolating carrot microsatellites, two different strategies were used; a hybridization-based library enrichment for ssrs, and bioinformatic mining of ssrs in bac-end sequence and est sequence databases.
the addition of  <dig> ssrs to the carrot map, together with marker characterizations in six other mapping populations, will facilitate future comparative mapping studies and integration of carrot maps.
the availability of informative, polymorphic, and robust pcr-based markers, such as microsatellites , will facilitate genetics and breeding of carrot and other apiaceae, including integration of linkage maps, tagging of phenotypic traits and assisting positional gene cloning.
despite its importance, molecular resources in this species are relatively underdeveloped.
ssr diversity evaluated in a collection of  <dig> d. carota accessions revealed a high level of polymorphism for these selected loci, with an average of  <dig> alleles/locus and  <dig>  expected heterozygosity.
evaluation of microsatellites isolated from both dna sources in subsets of  <dig> carrot f <dig> mapping populations revealed that ssrs from the hybridization-based method were longer, had more repeat units and were more polymorphic than ssrs isolated by sequence search.
polymorphic markers in one family were evaluated in the entire f <dig>  allowing the genetic mapping of  <dig> ssrs  onto the carrot reference map.
in addition, ssr evaluations in carrot-related taxa indicated that a significant fraction of the carrot ssrs transfer successfully across apiaceae, with heterologous amplification success rate decreasing with the target-species evolutionary distance from carrot.
the apiaceae family includes several vegetable and spice crop species among which carrot is the most economically important member, with ~ <dig> million tons produced yearly worldwide.
the ssr loci were distributed throughout all  <dig> carrot linkage groups , with  <dig> to  <dig> ssrs/lg.
