identification of gene regulatory networks is useful in understanding gene regulation in any organism.
some regulatory network information has already been determined experimentally for model organisms, but much less has been identified for non-model organisms, and the limited amount of gene expression data available for non-model organisms makes inference of regulatory networks difficult.
mapping a regulatory network involves mapping the transcription factors and target genes from one genome to another.
in the proposed method, basic local alignment search tool  and interproscan are used to map the transcription factors, whereas blast along with transcription factor binding site motifs and the galf-p tool are used to map the target genes.
combining transcription factors mapped using blast and subfamily classification, together with target genes mapped using blast and binding site motifs, produced the best regulatory link predictions.
since limited information is available about gene regulatory network links, gene expression data is used to analyze results.
more than two-thirds of these predicted regulatory links that were analyzed using gene expression data have been verified as correctly mapped regulatory links in the target genome.
experiments are performed to map the regulatory network data of s. cerevisiae to a. thaliana and analyze the results.
a set of rules are defined on the gene expression experiments to identify the predicted regulatory links that are well supported.
this paper proposes a method to determine the regulatory links that can be mapped from a model to a non-model organism.
