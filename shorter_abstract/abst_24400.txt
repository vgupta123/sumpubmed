the inclusion of the second alternative exon 1b, which harbours three short upstream open reading frames , is downregulated upon stimulation with tnf-Î± or under pro-inflammatory conditions in the inflamed intestinal mucosa in vivo.
we have identified two novel exons of the nod <dig> gene , which are spliced to the canonical exon  <dig> and constitute the 5' untranslated region of two alternative transcript isoforms .
the differential usage of two alternative promoters in the nod <dig> gene leads to tissue-specific and context-dependent nod <dig> transcript isoform patterns.
the results suggest complex parallel control mechanisms that independently regulate nod <dig> expression in the context of inflammatory signaling.
we demonstrate for the first time that context-dependent alternative splicing is linked to uorf-mediated translational repression.
mutations in the leucine-rich repeat region of nod <dig>  which lead to an impaired recognition of muramyl-dipeptide, have been associated with crohn disease, a human chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
