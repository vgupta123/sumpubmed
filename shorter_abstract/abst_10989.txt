we carried out an est -based transcriptomic study, aiming at gaining molecular insights into embryonic development of a rice hybrid triad–an elite hybrid rice lyp <dig> and its parental lines –and possible relatedness to heterosis.
we noticed that the high-abundance genes in mature rice embryos belong to two major functional categories, stress-tolerance and preparation-for-development, and we also identified  <dig> differentially-expressed genes  between lyp <dig> and its parental lines, representing typical expression patterns including over-dominance, high- and low-parent dominance, additivity, and under-dominance.
our results suggested that massively strengthening tissue- characteristic functions may contribute to heterosis rather than a few simple mechanistic explanations at the individual gene level.
in addition, the large collection of rice embryonic ests provides significant amount of data for future comparative analyses on plant development, especially for the important crops of the grass family.
we generated  <dig>  high-quality ests from cdna libraries made from mature rice embryos.
the mature embryo of rice  is a synchronized and integrated tissue mass laying the foundation at molecular level for its growth, development, and differentiation toward a developing and ultimately a mature plant.
