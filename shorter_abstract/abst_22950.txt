the panel displayed significant genetic variations in growth rate , turfgrass quality , survival rate , chlorophyll content  and evapotranspiration rate  in greenhouse and growth chamber trials.
<dig> and  <dig> marker alleles associated with heat tolerance-related traits were identified in greenhouse trial and growth chamber trial  using mix linear model, respectively.
identification of association between molecular markers and heat tolerance-related functional traits would promote the efficient selection of heat tolerant tall fescue cultivars.
high-temperature induced great variations of functional traits in tall fescue accessions.
and the identified marker alleles associated with functional traits could provide important information about heat tolerance genetic pathways, and be used for molecular assisted breeding to enhance tall fescue performance under heat stress.

association analysis of heat tolerance-related traits was conducted in  <dig> diverse tall fescue accessions consisting of  <dig> natural genotypes originating from  <dig> countries and  <dig> turf-type commercial cultivars.
due to different experimental conditions of the two trials,  <dig> ssr marker alleles associated with gr and et were simultaneously identified at p <  <dig>  level in two trials in response to heat stress.
heat stress is a critical threat to tall fescue in transitional and warm climate zones.
two subpopulations were detected in the panel of accessions by  <dig> ssr alleles with  <dig> ssr markers, but no obvious relative kinship was observed.
