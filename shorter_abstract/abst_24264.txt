the mechanism involves generation of a series of increasing size intermediate templates; those templates produce ram products and recursively generate smaller intermediate templates.
experimental results are consistent with the model.
however, the molecular mechanism of the ram reaction remains unexplained.
a ram reaction model predicts exponential accumulation of a double-stranded dna product size series, and product-size ratios, that are consistent with observed ram reaction products.
real-time ram reaction data are consistent with the model.
analysis of ram reaction products shows exponential growth limitation consistent with the model's predictions.
the model provides a rationale for the observed products of the ram reaction, and the molecular yield among those products.
