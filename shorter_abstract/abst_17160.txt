subsequent analysis of the networks showed that some features of drugs can be well described by this kind of interaction even for the case of structurally dissimilar drugs.
although drug interaction information has been increasingly accumulated, a novel approach like network-based method is needed to analyse that information systematically and intuitively
beyond focussing on drug-drug interactions, we examined interactions between functional drug groups.
in this work, functional drug groups were defined based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical  classification system.
we defined criteria whether two functional drug groups are related.
then we constructed the interaction network of drug groups.
our networks in this work provide intuitive insights into interactions among drug groups rather than those among single drugs.
