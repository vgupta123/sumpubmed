we investigate the effect of integration in two fundamental computational disease gene identification tasks: gene prioritization and gene clustering.
in such case, multi-view text mining is a superior and promising strategy for text-based disease gene identification.
these controlled vocabularies are selected on the basis of nine well-known bio-ontologies and are applied to index the vast amounts of gene-based free-text information available in the medline repository.
the text mining result specified by a vocabulary is considered as a view and the obtained multiple views are integrated by multi-source learning algorithms.
many text mining approaches have been introduced, but the effect of disease-gene identification varies in different text mining models.
however, how to effectively combine these models still remains a challenging question in machine learning.
we present a multi-view approach to retrieve biomedical knowledge using different controlled vocabularies.
in both tasks, the multi-view approach demonstrates significantly better performance than other comparing methods.
in particular, it is a non-trivial issue to guarantee that the integrated model performs better than the best individual model.
in practical research, the relevance of specific vocabulary pertaining to the task is usually unknown.
