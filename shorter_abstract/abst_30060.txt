complementary expression of virs in the virs deletion mutant restored transcription at the pvapa promoter, even under non-inducing conditions .
in addition, virs expression increased pvapa promoter activity in the absence of functional virr.
this study suggests that virs is required for vapa expression and that regulation of pvapa-promoter activity may be achieved by controlling virs expression levels.
virulent r. equi strains carry an 80-90 kb virulence plasmid that expresses the virulence-associated protein a .
to examine the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of vapa, we characterized an r. equi mutant in which another putative transcriptional regulator encoded on the virulence plasmid, virs, was deleted.
the lysr-type transcriptional regulator, virr, is involved in the regulation of the vapa gene.

deletion of virs reduced vapa promoter activity to non-inducible levels.
further, transcription of the icga operon containing virs was regulated by ph and temperature in the same manner as vapa.
vapa expression is regulated by temperature and ph.
