the aim of the present study was to find molecular actors involved early in the mechanism leading to symbiosis collapse.
immunolocalisation demonstrated that this host gene mediates molecular interactions between the host and the symbionts suggesting a putative role in zooxanthellae acquisition and/or sequestration.
consequently, we propose that the bleaching process is due in part to a decrease in zooxanthellae acquisition and/or sequestration.
its down-regulation could reflect a trade-off mechanism leading to the arrest of the mineralization process under stress.
in addition to a new hypothesis in coral bleaching mechanisms, this study provides promising biomarkers for monitoring coral health.
this major disturbance of reef ecosystems is principally induced by increases in water temperature.
several studies have been undertaken in the last few years to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching but the jigsaw puzzle is far from being complete, especially concerning the early events leading to symbiosis breakdown.
