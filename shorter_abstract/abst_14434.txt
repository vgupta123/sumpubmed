gene co-expression analysis has previously been based on measures that include correlation coefficients and mutual information, as well as newcomers such as mic.
in addition, ra reveals expression relationships that are not detected by traditional correlation and mutual information methods.

these include genes whose expression levels are ratiometrically stable and genes whose variance is tightly constrained.
the results open new questions about the regulatory mechanisms that produce strong ra relationships.
large-scale studies of relatively homogeneous samples, including single cell rna-seq, are experimental settings in which such relationships might be especially pertinent.
we develop and implement a ratiometric approach for detecting gene associations .
we show that our ratiometric method identifies biologically significant relationships that are often missed or low-ranked by conventional association-based methods when applied to a relatively homogenous dataset.
we also analyze data from individual lymphoblastoid cells and show that desirable properties of the ra method extend to single-cell rna-seq.
