the clinical presentation of prrsv ranges from asymptomatic to devastating.
these results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of prrsv-affected pigs.
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is a rna virus with high genetic variation.

zna probe-based real-time pcr can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic prrsv-infected pigs.
the presence of this marker in a sample of animals with high prrsv loads  seems to indicate that it correlates with the presence of prdc in pigs.
in this study, we developed a sensitive and specific zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time pcr assay to evaluate the viremia of natural prrsv-infected pigs in taiwan.
these include  <dig> clinically healthy pigs and  <dig> symptomatic pigs were confirmed to have porcine respiratory disease complex .
serum samples were collected from  <dig> pigs aged 5–12 weeks.
this virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries.
