uri mutants have transcriptional defects, reduced cell viability and differentiation in the germline, and accumulate dna damage in their nuclei.
uri protein plays a role in transcriptional regulation.
uri  is a conserved molecular chaperone implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including the transcriptional response to nutrient signalling and maintenance of dna integrity.
activity of uri is required to maintain dna integrity and cell survival in normal development.
