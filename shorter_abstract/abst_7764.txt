these variable regions contain biased mutations with a very high a + t content, multiple copies of the motif tataatata and sequences that fold into long a:t-base-paired stem loops.
central to the  <dig>  bp unit are the multiple copies of a sequence that originates from the flanking 5′ end of the translocation breakpoint type a sequence.
digeorge syndrome is a genetic abnormality involving ~3 mb deletion in human chromosome  <dig>  termed 22q.
this breakpoint flanking sequence carries the exon and intron motifs.
at its 5′ half, the  <dig>  bp sequence has three distinct sections that represent phylogenetically variable sequences.
the breakpoint type a sequence seems to be a major player in the proliferation of these rna motifs, as well as the proliferation of variable regions in the  <dig>  bp segment and other regions within 22q.
on the other hand, the highly conserved nucleotide sequence of the non-coding region may form storage sites for rna motifs.
the 3′ half of the  <dig>  bp unit, highly conserved between human and chimpanzee, has sequences representing exons of lncrna genes and segments of introns of protein genes.
in silico computer programs were used to find homologous dna sequences in human and chimpanzee genomes, generate random sequences, determine dna sequence alignments, sequence comparisons and nucleotide repeat copies, and to predicted dna secondary structures.
the data indicate that a non-coding region of the chromosome may be reserved for highly biased mutations that lead to formation of specialized sequences and dna secondary structures.
