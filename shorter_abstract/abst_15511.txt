using co-bound sites of oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog  and co-bound sites of myc and mycn  as enhancer positive and negative training sets, we performed multinomial logistic regression with lasso regularization to identify key features.
here we used histone modification and chromatin-associated protein chip-seq data sets in mouse embryonic stem  cells as well as genomic features to identify functional enhancer regions.
cross validations reveal that a combination of p <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  med <dig> and nipbl features to be top signatures of co-osn regions.
epigenetic modifications, transcription factor  availability and differences in chromatin folding influence how the genome is interpreted by the transcriptional machinery responsible for gene expression.
furthermore, we identified several motifs of known tfs significantly enriched in putative enhancer regions compared to random promoter regions and background.
enhancers buried in non-coding regions are found to be associated with significant differences in histone marks between different cell types.
in contrast, gene promoters show more uniform modifications across cell types.
comparison with an active h3k27ac mark in various cell types confirmed cell type-specificity of these enhancers.
the top enhancer signatures we identified  will allow for the identification of cell type-specific enhancer regions in diverse cell types.
these putative enhancers are associated with increased gene expression of neighbouring genes and significantly enriched in multiple tf bound loci in agreement with combinatorial models of tf binding.
