in this report we present findings showing that during drosophila melanogaster development two dada2b isoforms  - which differ in their c-terminal domains - are expressed at various levels.
comparison of whole transcriptome profiles of dada2b null and dada2bs transgene-carrier dada2b null larvae indicates partial overlap between affected genes.
the short  isoform of dada2b seems to be more capable of restoring lost dsaga functions that cause mrna level up-regulation than those that lead to decreased mrna levels.
the data presented here are in accord with results of genetic complementation experiments, and support the hypothesis that different isoforms of dada2b contribute to the functional variations of dsaga multiprotein hat complexes.
in the presence of dada2bs, the saga-specific histone h <dig> acetylation level is partially restored in dada2b mutants.
mrna levels corresponding to selected genes which are either up- or down-regulated in dada2b mutants are altered by dada2bs expression to different extents, ranging from complete restoration to wild type levels to no restoration at all.
