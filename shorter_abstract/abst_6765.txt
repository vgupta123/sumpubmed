phylogenetic analysis reveals that sloth fur hosts a number of green algal species and suggests that acquisition of these organisms from the surrounding rainforest plays an important role in the discoloration of sloth fur.
however, an alga corresponding to the morphological description of trichophilus welckeri was found to be frequent and abundant on sloth fur.
trichophilus welckeri, a green algal species first described more than a century ago, is widely believed to discolor the animals fur and provide the sloth with effective camouflage.
here we investigate the genetic diversity of the eukaryotic community present in fur of all six extant species of sloth.
our analysis streghtens the case for symbiosis between sloths and trichophilus welckeri.
these results demonstrate a unique diverse microbial eukaryotic community in the fur of sloths from central and south america.
