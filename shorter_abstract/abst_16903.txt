previously, using comparative genomic analyses,  <dig> regions of genomic plasticity have been identified in the s. pneumoniae genome.
mice infected with mutants deficient in rd <dig>  rd8b <dig>  rd <dig> and rd <dig> had significantly less bacteria in the blood two days after intranasal challenge and improved survival over time versus mice infected with wild type.
in all instances mutants colonized the nasopharynx at levels equivalent to wild type.
using allelic exchange, we created s. pneumoniae mutants that were deficient in rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  mutants deficient in rd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were attenuated in a mouse model of disease.
the ability of mutants deficient in rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to colonize the nasopharynx indicates that genes within these rds are not required for asymptomatic carriage.
nonetheless, the observation that mutants deficient in rd8b <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are attenuated indicates that genes within these loci are necessary for spread of the bacteria beyond the nasopharynx to normally sterile sites.
to date, genes within  <dig> rds have been unequivocally demonstrated to contribute to s. pneumoniae virulence.
these "regions of diversity"  accounted for half the genomic variation observed amongst all pneumococci tested, moreover, were determined to encode a variety of putative virulence factors.
streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
