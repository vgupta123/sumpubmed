retroviral vectors are valuable tools for gene transfer.
particularly convenient are ires-containing retroviral vectors expressing both the protein of interest and a marker protein from a single bicistronic mrna.
here we present several novel pprig-based vectors  in which : i) the ha tag sequence was inserted in the three reading frames 3' of the mcs ; ii) a functional domain  was inserted either 5' or 3' of the mcs ; iii) egfp was replaced by either ecfp, eyfp, mcherry or puro-r ; and iv) mcherry, eyfp or egfp was inserted 5' of the mcs of the ires-egfp, ires-ecfp or ires-puro-r containing prigs, respectively .
pap <dig> is a retroviral vector containing egfp downstream of a modified ires element of emcv origin, and a cmv enhancer-promoter instead of the u <dig> region of the 5'ltr, which increases its efficiency in transient transfection.
these novel vectors allow for straightforward detection of any expressed protein , for functional studies of chimeric proteins , for multiple transductions and fluorescence analyses of transduced cells , or for quantitative detection of studied proteins in independently identified/selected transduced cells .
additionally, some of these prigs were also constructed in a pmigr mscv background which has been widely used in pluripotent cells.
they maintain the original advantages of pprig and provide suitable tools for either transient or stable expression and functional studies in a large range of experimental settings.
