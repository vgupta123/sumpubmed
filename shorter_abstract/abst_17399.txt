applying machine learning or statistical methods to epistatic interaction detection will encounter some common problems, e.g., very limited number of samples, an extremely high search space, a large number of false positives, and ways to measure the association between disease markers and the phenotype.
in epibn, we develop a new scoring function, which can reflect higher-order epistatic interactions by estimating the model complexity from data, and apply a fast branch-and-bound algorithm to learn the structure of a two-layer bayesian network containing only one target node.
detecting epistatic interactions plays a significant role in improving pathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of complex human diseases.
applications of the proposed method to some real gwas  datasets may provide helpful insights into understanding the genetic basis of age-related macular degeneration, late-onset alzheimer's disease, and autism.
to address the problems of computational methods in epistatic interaction detection, we propose a score-based bayesian network structure learning method, epibn, to detect epistatic interactions.
experimental results on simulation data show that our method outperforms some other commonly-used methods in terms of power and sample-efficiency, and is especially suitable for detecting epistatic interactions with weak or no marginal effects.
we propose a bayesian network-based method, epibn, to detect epistatic interactions.
