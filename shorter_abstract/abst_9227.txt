anti-tnf strategies based on monoclonal antibodies or f <dig> fragments have been used in sepsis with contradictory results.
vnar domains are the smallest, naturally occurring, antibody-based immune recognition units, having potential use as therapy.
animals were treated with anti-tnf vnar domains, f <dig> antibody fragments, or saline solution  <dig> minutes before, 2 h and 24 h after lethal dose <dig>  lps administration.
tnf blockade with either vnar domains or f <dig> fragments were associated with lower mortality  compared to ld <dig>  challenge with lps induced significant production of serum tnf and interleukins - <dig> and - <dig> at 3 h. after that, significant reduction of il- <dig> at 24 h  was shown only in the vnar group.
blocking tnf was associated with a shift towards an anti-inflammatory status; however, polarization was more pronounced in animals receiving f <dig> fragments than in those with vnar therapy.
our aim was to explore the impact of an anti-tnf vnar on survival in an experimental model of endotoxic shock.
endotoxic shock was induced by lipopolysaccharide  in male balb/c mice.
anti-tnf vnar single domains improved survival in a murine model of endotoxic shock.
immunoglobulin new antigen receptors  are a unique subset of antibodies consisting of five constant  and one variable domains .
tnf blockade was associated with rapid and sustained suppression of il- <dig> expression, even more evident in the vnar group.
finally, expression of inducible-nitric oxide synthase  increased in response to lps at 3 h, but this was decreased at  <dig> h only in the anti-tnf vnar group.
in sepsis, tumor necrosis factor  is the key factor triggering respiratory burst, tissue injury and disseminated coagulation.
