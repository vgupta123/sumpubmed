using the broth microdilution method adapted for lysostaphin, we found that p <dig> is effective against s. aureus clinical strains including mrsa, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus , and a mupirocin-resistant s. aureus.
here we report results of in vitro studies evaluating the susceptibility of staphylococcal strains to this novel protein.
the protein is active against globally prevalent antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates and other clinically significant staphylococcal species including s. epidermidis.
this methodology used for in vitro assessment of p <dig> as an agent for eradicating nasal carriage is unique.
a causal relationship between nasal commensal s. aureus and infection has been reported.
p <dig> is a chimeric protein that combines the lethal activity of the phage tail-associated muralytic enzyme of phage k and the staphylococcal cell wall targeting-domain  of lysostaphin.
the novel chimeric protein p <dig> is a staphylococcal cell wall-degrading enzyme under development for clearance of s. aureus nasal colonization and mrsa infection.
p <dig> hydrogel was lethal to staphylococci recovered from nares of healthy people and treated without any processing or culturing steps, indicating its in situ efficacy.
the p <dig> hydrogel formulation was bactericidal against staphylococci including s. aureus recovered from the nares of  <dig> healthy people, demonstrating its in situ efficacy.
accordingly, elimination of nasal s. aureus reduces the risk of infection.
minimum bactericidal concentrations and minimum inhibitory concentrations of p <dig>  were similar across the  <dig> s. aureus strains tested, demonstrating its bactericidal nature.
