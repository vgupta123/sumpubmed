the variability in compounds associated with aroma was analyzed by a metabolomic approach based on gc-ms to profile  <dig> volatiles across the population from two locations.
the improvement of fruit aroma is currently one of the most sought-after objectives in peach breeding programs.
to better characterize and assess the genetic potential for increasing aroma quality by breeding, a quantity trait locus  analysis approach was carried out in an f <dig> population segregating largely for fruit traits.
the monoterpene module is controlled by a unique locus at the top of lg <dig>  a locus previously shown to affect the levels of two terpenoid compounds.
qtl mapping showed clustering of volatile qtl included in the same volatile modules, indicating that some are subjected to joint genetic control.
the results presented here give light on the mode of inheritance of the peach volatilome confirming previously loci controlling the aroma of peach but also identifying novel ones.
linkage maps were constructed using the ipsc peach  <dig> k infinium Â® ii array, rendering dense genetic maps, except in the case of certain chromosomes, probably due to identity-by-descent of those chromosomes in the parental genotypes.
correlation-based analysis of the volatile dataset revealed that the peach volatilome is organized into modules formed by compounds from the same biosynthetic origin or which share similar chemical structures.
in addition, two novel loci controlling lactones and esters in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> were discovered.
