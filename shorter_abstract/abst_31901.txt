in a case study with whole-organ profiling data, bioqc predicted contamination events that are confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr.
gene expression data can be compromised by cells originating from other tissues than the target tissue of profiling.
we introduce bioqc, a r/bioconductor software package to detect tissue heterogeneity in gene expression data.
our experience with gene expression data indicates a prevalence of tissue heterogeneity that often goes unnoticed.
we propose bioqc as a first-line tool to ensure quality and reproducibility of gene expression data.
failures in detecting such tissue heterogeneity have profound implications on data interpretation and reproducibility.
simulation experiments show that bioqc is both fast and sensitive in detecting tissue heterogeneity.
applied to transcriptomics data of the genotype-tissue expression  project, bioqc reveals clustering of samples and suggests that some samples likely suffer from tissue heterogeneity.
