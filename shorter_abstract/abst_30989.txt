the bhs prevalence was  <dig>  % and gbs dominated , particularly serotypes v and ii; serotype v being negatively associated with h. influenzae carriage .
the dominant serotypes of gbs in this setting are serotypes v and ii.
in west africa, the carriage of group b streptococcus , among infants is poorly characterised.

although co-colonization of gbs and other bhs was not seen, colonization with gbs was positively associated with s. aureus  and negatively associated with s. pneumoniae  and m. catarrhalis .
≥ 89 % of gbs isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics tested, except for tetracycline resistance, which was 89 %.
we assessed the carriage, serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of beta-haemolytic streptococci  groups a-g; along with the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae; haemophilus influenzae; staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis in  <dig> two-month old infants.
this study provides baseline data on the carriage of gbs in two month old infants from west africa.
we investigated co-carriage of gbs with other respiratory pathogens in the infants’ nasopharynx in the gambia.
