small size  c. gariepinus fish consumed greater number of mosquito larvae than the large size fish  in the multivariate regression model .
c. gariepinus was observed to feed on mosquito larvae under laboratory and semi-field conditions.
c. gariepinus fed on the larvae of an.
the number of larvae consumed was greater during the night hours than during the light hours .
the emergence and spread of insecticide resistant mosquitoes renewed interest in investigating the use of larvivorous fish as a biological control agent.
the anopheles larvae consumed was greater in number than the culicines larvae consumed by the fish .
amount of supplementary fish food did not cause significant differences in the number of mosquito larvae consumed by the fish among different groups.
