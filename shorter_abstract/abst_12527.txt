isoform analyses of the rna-seq data predicted the existence of multiple transcripts and provided evidence of differential expression at the trpm <dig> locus.
to better characterize this region and understand the function of the snp located within trpm <dig> that was associated with r. equi pneumonia, we performed rna-seq on  <dig> horses representing the  <dig> genotypic forms of this snp.
this work demonstrates that snps in trpm <dig> are associated with differences in gene expression, suggesting that modulation of expression of this innate immune gene contributes to susceptibility to r. equi pneumonia.
currently, the genetic mechanisms that confer susceptibility and/or resistance to r. equi are not fully understood.
