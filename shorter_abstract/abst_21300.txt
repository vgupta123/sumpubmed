we identified  <dig> strain-specific genes in dsm  <dig> and  <dig> strain-specific genes in dsm  <dig>  the high number of strain-specific genes may be a result of horizontal gene transfer triggered by the large number of transposons in the genomes of these two strains.
two complete genome sequences were used in this comparative genomic study: c. urealyticum dsm  <dig> and c. urealyticum dsm  <dig>
the genome features and the presence of virulence factors in genomic islands in the two strains of c. urealyticum provide insights in the lifestyle of this opportunistic pathogen and may be useful in developing future therapeutic strategies.

therefore, spadef may play a pivotal role in facilitating the adhesion of the pathogen to the host tissue.
screening for virulence factors revealed the presence of the spadef operon that encodes pili forming proteins.
we used comparative genomics strategies to compare the two strains, dsm  <dig> and dsm  <dig>  and to analyze their metabolic pathways, genome plasticity, and to predict putative antigenic targets.
corynebacterium urealyticum is an opportunistic pathogen that normally lives on skin and mucous membranes in humans.
