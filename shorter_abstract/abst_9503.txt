in contrast, all putative sites of lbrtlr <dig> involved in the detection of viral nucleic acids were highly conserved across rodents.
yet, also several signatures of positive selection have been found in both genes, with more intense signal in the bacterial-sensing tlr <dig> than in the viral-sensing tlr <dig>  92% and 100% of sites evolving under positive selection in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  respectively, were located in the extracellular domain.
directly in the ligand-binding region  of tlr <dig> we identified two rapidly evolving amino acid residues and one site under positive selection, all three likely involved in species-specific recognition of lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria.
we sequenced genes encoding toll-like receptor  <dig>  and  <dig> , two of the key bacterial- and viral-sensing receptors of innate immunity, across  <dig> species within the subfamily murinae.
nevertheless, our results show that episodic diversifying parasite-mediated selection has shaped the present species-specific variability in rodent tlrs.
interspecific differences in the predicted 3d-structure of the lbr of both tlrs were not related to phylogenetic history, while analyses of protein charges clearly discriminated rattini and murini clades.
in this study we analysed the natural variation and the evolutionary processes acting on two genes involved in the innate-immunity recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns .
although we have shown that the phylogeny of both tlr genes is largely congruent with the phylogeny of rodents based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset, we also identified several potentially important discrepancies.
