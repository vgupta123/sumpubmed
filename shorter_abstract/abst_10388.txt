most toxicity-related reactions occur in the midgut shortly after the ingestion of an infected blood meal.
using a custom-made dna microarray, transcript levels of  <dig> loci primarily belonging to three major detoxification enzyme families  were compared in infected and uninfected mosquitoes both during ookinete invasion and the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel.
while many alterations are directly related to the mosquito's innate immune response, parasite invasion is also expected to generate toxic by-products such as free radicals.
the current study aimed at identifying which loci coding for detoxification enzymes are differentially expressed as a function of plasmodium berghei infection in midgut and fat body tissues.
interestingly, many detoxification genes including a large number of p450s were down-regulated at this stage.
anopheles gambiae has been shown to change its global gene expression patterns upon plasmodium infection.
while most gene expression changes were tissue-related, cyp6m <dig>  a cyp previously associated with insecticide resistance, was over-expressed both in the midgut and fat body during ookinete invasion.
strong up-regulation of cyp6m <dig> in the midgut and the fat body as well as its previous association with insecticide resistance shows its broad role in metabolic detoxification.
in the fat body, while less dramatic, gene expression alterations were also observed and occurred during the ookinete invasion and during the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel.
