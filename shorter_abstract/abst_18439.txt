in particular, these findings will facilitate the identification of the genes involved in insecticide resistance and the development of new compounds to control the acb.
the asian corn borer , ostrinia furnacalis , has become the most damaging insect pest of corn in asia.
the differentially expressed gene data will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of acb in response to the novel diamide insecticide, flubendiamide.
in addition, we compared and validated the differentially expressed unigenes upon flubendiamide treatment, revealing that the genes for detoxification enzymes , calcium signaling pathways and muscle control pathways , immunoglobulin , chemosensory protein and heat shock protein  <dig> were significantly overexpressed in response to flubendiamide, while the genes for cuticular protein, protease and oxidoreductase showed much lower expression levels.
these sequences were annotated with non-redundant protein , gene ontology , clusters of orthologous groups  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  to better understand their functions.
a total of  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases ,  <dig> carboxyl/cholinesterases  and  <dig> glutathione s-transferases  were manually curated to construct phylogenetic trees, and  <dig> unigenes encoding target proteins  were identified.
here, we used the ion torrent personal genome machine  sequencer to explore the acb transcriptome and to identify relevant genes in response to flubendiamide, showing high selective activity against acb.
we obtained  <dig>  unigenes, with an average length of 716Â bp, representing a dramatic expansion of existing cdna sequences available for acb.
