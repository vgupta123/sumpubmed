rab <dig> is thought to act as a molecular switch and can change between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound conformation.
it was initially identified by yeast two-hybrid screening experiments with the active mutant of rab1b  as bait.
the small gtpase rab1a and its isoform rab1b are essential regulating components in the vesicle transport between the er and the golgi apparatus.
the characterization of this novel intermolecular relation could help to elucidate how vesicles find their way from er to the golgi apparatus.
iporin contains a sh <dig> domain and two polyproline stretches, which are known to play a role in protein/protein interactions.
in addition, iporin encloses a run domain, which seems to be a major part of the rab1binding domain .
our results demonstrate that iporin is a potential new interacting partner of rab <dig>  iporin is different from already identified rab <dig> interacting proteins concerning protein structure and cellular localization.
interestingly, we also show that iporin interacts with another rab <dig> interacting partner, the gm <dig> protein.
