on the other hand, membrane proteins undergo conformational changes to allow transport as well as ligand binding.
although the dynamics studied here concerns local atomic fluctuations, a similar analysis in terms of global structural features will be helpful in predicting large-scale conformational changes, for which work is in progress.
many structural properties such as solvent accessibility, dihedral angles and helix-helix contacts can be assigned to each residue in a membrane protein.
in particular, the performance of the solvent accessibility and bend-angle prediction improved in this way.
the prediction performance of the integrated model is significantly better than that of the models performing the task separately for each feature for the solvent accessibility and bend-angle predictions.
further, we showed that single-chain conformational dynamics, measured by b-factors derived from normal mode analysis, could be predicted from observed and predicted esfs with good accuracy.
we performed a statistical analysis of common patterns among selected one-dimensional equilibrium structural features  and developed a method for simultaneously predicting all of these features using an integrated system.
a web server was developed  for predicting the one-dimensional esfs from sequence information and analyzing the differences between the predicted and observed values of the esfs.
our results show that the prediction performance can be improved if multiple structural features are trained in an integrated model, compared to the current practice of developing individual models.
the well-performing bend-angle prediction can be used to predict helical positions with severe kinks at a modest success rate.
