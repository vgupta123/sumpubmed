despite their ecological importance and ubiquity, little is known about the genetic basis of adaption in lichen populations.
we detected two strongly differentiated genetic clusters linked to mediterranean and temperate-oceanic climate, and an admixture zone, which coincided with the transition between the two bioclimates.
we then detected gene-environment correlations while controlling for shared population history and pooled sequencing bias, and performed ecophysiological experiments to assess fitness differences of individuals from different environments.
taken together our results provide evidence for a complex interplay between demographic history and spatially varying selection acting on a number of key biological processes, suggesting a scenario of ecological speciation.
highly differentiated genome regions contained a number of genes associated with stress response, local environmental adaptation, and sexual reproduction.
here we studied patterns of genome-wide differentiation in the lichen-forming fungus lasallia pustulata along an altitudinal gradient in the mediterranean region.
many fungal species occur across a variety of habitats.
