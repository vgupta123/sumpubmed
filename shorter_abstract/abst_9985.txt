the analysis of the correlation between real copy number from mpfish and the average normalized inter-locus fluorescence ratio  value detected by array-cgh demonstrated that copy number is a linear function of parameters that include the variable, anilfr, and two constants, ploidy and background normalized fluorescence ratio.
totally  <dig> chr <dig> fragments were identified having copy numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  mpfish results from the bac/pac clones and array-cgh gave mainly corresponding results.
chr <dig> locus copy number was assessed by interphase and metaphase mpfish.
each copy number change on the array profile could be related to a specific chromosome aberration detected by metaphase mpfish.
in most cases, the changes in copy number seen on array-cgh profiles reflected cumulative chromosome rearrangements.
although our chr <dig> bac/pac array could identify single copy number changes even in pentaploid cells, mpfish provided a more accurate analysis in the dissection of complex karyotypes at high ploidy levels.
in this study we have compared array-cgh  and multipoint fish  for their ability to characterize complex rearrangements on human chromosome  <dig>  in tumour cell lines.
the ploidy of the tumour cell lines ranged from near-diploid to near-pentaploid.
we have used  <dig> bac/pac clones covering chr <dig> with an approximately  <dig> mb resolution to analyze nine carcinoma lines.
recently, several high-resolution methods of chromosome analysis have been developed.
