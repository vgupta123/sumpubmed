one such region, 1q <dig> -q <dig> , is of increasing interest due to its relevance to human disease and evolution.
the duf1220-encoding nbpf genes required the most corrections, with  <dig> genes removed,  <dig> genes reassigned to the 1p <dig>  region,  <dig> genes requiring assembly corrections for duf <dig> domains , and multiple instances of nucleotide changes that reassigned the domain to a different duf <dig> subtype.
approximately  <dig> of these new duf <dig> copies were the result of a segmental duplication from 1q <dig>  to 1p <dig>  that included two nbpf genes.
this region also contains  <dig> of the  <dig> human duf <dig> protein domains, which are implicated in human brain evolution and neurodevelopment.
additionally, examinations of this protein domain have been challenging due to the incomplete 1q <dig> build.
although the reference human genome sequence was declared finished in  <dig>  some regions of the genome remain incomplete due to their complex architecture.
finally, the corrected sequence identified a recent segmental duplication that added  <dig> additional duf <dig> copies to the human genome, and may have facilitated the chromosome  <dig> pericentric inversion that is among the most notable human-specific genomic landmarks.
