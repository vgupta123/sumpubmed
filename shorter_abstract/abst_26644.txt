three hundred and fifty nine clones presenting a hybridization signal above the background were sequenced and shown to correspond to  <dig> different genes.
comparative mapping data indicate that these imprinted clusters are maintained in synteny in mice, and apparently in cattle and pigs, suggesting that the maintenance of such syntenies is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.
highly expressed placental genes may be in syntenies conserved interspecifically, suggesting that the maintenance of such clusters is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.
for achieving this, two reciprocal suppressive/subtractive hybridization procedures  were applied to early  human placental villi after incubation either in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions.
we could demonstrate that genes induced in pe were also genes highly expressed under hypoxic conditions , which was not the case for isolated iugr.
as a first step to explore the possible relationships existing between the effects of low oxygen pressure in the first trimester placenta and placental pathologies developing from mid-gestation, two subtracted libraries totaling  <dig> cdna clones were constructed.
specific expression profiles characteristic of preeclampsia  could be identified, as well as profiles specific of intra-uterine growth retardation .
