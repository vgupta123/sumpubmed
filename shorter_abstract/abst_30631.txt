the approach relies on the design of "electroporation chambers" that enable reproducible positioning of fixed-spaced electrodes coupled with accurate dna/mo injection.
we describe here an electroporation procedure that can be used with high efficiency and low toxicity for targeting dna and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides  into spatially restricted regions of the xenopus cns at a critical time-window of development  when axonal tracts are first forming.
however, functional analysis of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding by this method is often hampered by earlier function of these genes during development.
therefore, fine spatio-temporal control of over-expression or knock-down approaches is required to specifically address the role of a given gene in these processes.
blastomere injection of mrna or antisense oligonucleotides has proven effective in analyzing early gene function in xenopus.
