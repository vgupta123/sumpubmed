we applied the proposed method to two publicly available microarray datasets of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma , a notoriously heterogeneous phenotype.
the basic strategy of the proposed method was to iteratively partition in two ways sample and feature space with super-paramagnetic clustering technique and to seek for hard and robust gene clusters that lead to a natural partition of disease samples and that have the highest functionally conceptual consensus evaluated with gene ontology.
our results showed that the proposed algorithm is a promising computational strategy for peeling off the hidden genetic heterogeneity based on transcriptionally profiling disease samples, which may lead to an improved diagnosis and treatment of cancers.
microarray omics technology has provided a powerful way to dissect hidden genetic heterogeneity of complex diseases.
