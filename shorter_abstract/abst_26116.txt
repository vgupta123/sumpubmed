dependency on the host for essential nutrients is evident from the loss of genes for the biosynthesis of thiamine and some amino acids and the presence of a wide range of transport proteins, including some unique to p. brassicae.
to provide insight into the biology of the pathogen and its interaction with its primary host b. napus, we produced a draft genome of p. brassicae pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  that differ in their host range.
clustering of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  of pb <dig>  pb <dig> and three additional re-sequenced pathotypes  shows a high degree of correlation of cluster grouping with host range.
p. brassicae has remained an enigmatic plant pathogen and is a rare example of an obligate biotroph that resides entirely inside the host plant cell.
genome annotation supported by rna sequencing reveals significant reduction in intergenic space which, in addition to low repeat content, has likely contributed to the p. brassicae compact genome.
pb <dig> is highly virulent on b. napus  while pb <dig> infects only vegetable brassica crops.
the pb <dig> genome features significant reduction of intergenic space with multiple examples of overlapping untranslated regions .
the p. brassicae genome sequence reveals a compact genome, a dependency of the pathogen on its host for some essential nutrients and a potential role in the regulation of host plant cytokinin and auxin.
the expression profile of pb <dig> genes, including putative effectors, during infection and their potential role in manipulation of host defence is discussed.
the protist plasmodiophora brassicae is a soil-borne pathogen of cruciferous species and the causal agent of clubroot disease of brassicas including agriculturally important crops such as canola/rapeseed .
