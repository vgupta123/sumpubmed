the obtained m. fortis transcriptome and degs profile data demonstrated that natural and adaptive immune responses, play an important role in m. fortis immunity to s. japonicum.
gene ontology terms and pathways related to the degs revealed that up-regulated transcripts were involved in metabolism, immunity and inflammatory responses.
microtus fortis is a non-permissive host of schistosoma japonicum.

thus, studies based on high-throughput sequencing technologies are required to obtain information about resistance mechanisms against s. japonicum.
comparisons were made between m. fortis before and after infection with s. japonicum using rna-seq quantification analysis.
after infection with s. japonicum, a defensive reaction in m. fortis commenced rapidly, increasing dramatically in the second week, and gradually decreasing three weeks after infection.
quantitative real-time pcr analysis showed that patterns of gene expression were consistent with rna-seq results.
simultaneously, the strongest pathological changes in the liver were observed at week two.
the paucity of genetic information for m. fortis limits the use of available immunological methods.
using illumina single-end technology, a de novo assembly of the m. fortis transcriptome produced  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides.
these findings provide a better understanding of the natural resistance mechanisms of m. fortis against schistosomes.
it has natural resistance against schistosomes, although the precise resistance mechanisms remain unclear.
