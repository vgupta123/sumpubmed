in addition, edge <dig> provides a means for managing rna samples and arrays during the hybridization process.
the first function is to provide a workflow process for the generation of microarray data by a research laboratory or a microarray facility.
thus, the motivating factor for the development of edge <dig> was to incorporate the storage, analysis and sharing of microarray data in a manner that would provide a means for research groups to collaborate on agilent-based microarray experiments without a large investment in software-related expenditures or extensive training of end-users.
a number of software tools have been developed to store, analyze, and share microarray data.
the second is to store, analyze, and share microarray data in a manner that doesn't require complicated software.
here, we present edge <dig>  an open-source, web-based application that allows for the storage, analysis, and controlled sharing of transcription-based microarray data generated on the agilent dna platform.
to satisfy the second function, the software application utilized as the user interface of edge <dig> is a web browser.
within the web browser, a user is able to access the entire functionality, including, but not limited to, the ability to perform a number of bioinformatics based analyses, collaborate between research groups through a user-based security model, and access to the raw data files and quality control files generated by the software used to extract the signals from an array image.
edge <dig> has been developed with two major functions in mind.
the latter, the amount of data generated, has implications when it comes to effective storage, analysis and sharing of these data.
