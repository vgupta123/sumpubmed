the unexpected results observed for the pla2-btl- <dig> complex strongly suggest that the pharmacological activity of this pla <dig> is not solely dependent on the presence of enzymatic activity, and that other pharmacological regions may also be involved.
pla <dig> significantly induced platelet aggregation in washed platelets, whereas btl- <dig> did not induce significant platelet aggregation in any assay.
however, btl- <dig> significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by pla <dig>  in addition, pla <dig> exhibited strong oedematogenic activity, which was decreased in the presence of btl- <dig>  btl- <dig> alone did not induce oedema and did not decrease or abolish the oedema induced by the 48/ <dig> compound.
btl- <dig> demonstrated an inhibition of 98% in the growth of the gram-positive bacterial strain, clavibacter michiganensis michiganensis , but only  <dig> % inhibition of the gram-negative bacterial strain, xanthomonas axonopodis pv passiflorae .
in addition, btl- <dig> did not exhibit any enzymatic activity.
this pla <dig> consisted of  <dig> amino acids , its pi was estimated to be  <dig> , and its amino acid sequence shared a high degree of similarity with that of other neurotoxic and enzymatically-active pla2s.
we, herein, studied the effects elicited by a small isolectin , isolated from bryothamnion triquetrum, on the pharmacological and biological activities of a pla <dig> isolated from rattlesnake venom , to better understand the enzymatic and pharmacological mechanisms of the pla <dig> and its complex.
btl- <dig> had a molecular mass estimated in approximately  <dig> kda and was characterized as a basic protein.
the pla <dig> and btl- <dig> formed a stable heterodimer with a molecular mass of approximately 24â€“ <dig> kda, estimated by molecular exclusion hplc.
in the presence of btl- <dig>  we observed a significant increase in pla <dig> activity, 23% higher than that of pla <dig> alone.
