the double-layer agar  technique is extensively used in phage research to enumerate and identify phages and to isolate mutants and new phages.
many phages form large and well-defined plaques that are easily observed so that they can be enumerated when plated by the dla technique.
this work presents a modification of the dla technique that can be used routinely in the laboratory, leading to a more accurate enumeration of phages that would be difficult or even impossible otherwise.
antibiotics with different mechanisms of action were tested for their ability to enhance plaque morphology without suppressing phage development.
thus, antibiotics might contribute to increasing plaque size in solid media.
however, some give rise to small and turbid plaques that are very difficult to detect and count.
