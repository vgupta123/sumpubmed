among the latter, trypsin inhibitors should play a major role in drupe resistance reaction.
a bioinformatic analysis of the identified non-redundant est and protein collection indicated that different molecular processes were affected, such as stress response, phytohormone signalling, transcriptional control and primary metabolism, and that a considerable proportion of the ests could not be classified.
this study represents the first report that reveals the molecular players and signalling pathways involved in the interaction between the olive fruit and its most damaging biotic stressor.
we also cloned the full-length coding sequences of two genes, oe-chitinase i and oe-pr <dig>  and showed that these are wound-inducible genes and activated by b. oleae punctures.
the identifications of genes and proteins involved in the fruit response were performed using a suppression subtractive hybridisation technique and a combined bi-dimensional electrophoresis/nanolc-esi-lit-ms/ms approach, respectively.
drupe response is complex, involving genes and proteins involved in photosynthesis as well as in the production of ros, the activation of different stress response pathways and the production of compounds involved in direct defence against phytophagous larvae.
oleae interaction, we conducted transcriptomic and proteomic investigations of the molecular response of the drupe.
