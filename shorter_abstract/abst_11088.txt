these membrane structures may serve as membrane reservoirs for membrane reversion when cells are reintroduced to normal growth conditions.
3-d reconstruction of the cell vacuole made possible an accurate analysis of large spanning folds of the vacuolar membrane under both normal and stressed conditions, and suggested interactions between surrounding plastids.
the gfp-decorated vacuole is a single continuous compartment transected by tubular-like transvacuolar strands and large membrane surfaces.
cell culture under osmotic stress led to a complex vacuolar network with an increased tonoplast surface area.
dynamic, high resolution 3-d pictures of the vacuole in tobacco suspension cells monitored under different growth conditions provide additional details about vacuolar architecture.
to extend our knowledge of how the vacuole folds inside the plant cell, we present three-dimensional reconstructions of vacuoles from tobacco suspension cells expressing the tonoplast aquaporin fusion gene bobtip26-1::gfp.
in-depth 3-d realistic inspections showed that the unity of the vacuole is maintained during acclimation to osmotic stress.
the vegetative plant vacuole occupies >90% of the volume in mature plant cells.
vacuolar unity exhibited during stress adaptation, coupled with the intimate associations of vacuoles with other organelles, suggests a physiological role for the vacuole in metabolism, and communication between the vacuole and organelles, respectively, in plant cells.
3-d processing of a gfp-labeled tonoplast provides compelling visual constructions of the plant cell vacuole and elaborates on the nature of tonoplast folding and architecture.
