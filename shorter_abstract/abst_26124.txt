this data shows the utility of the ddpcr method to resolve cryptic copy number inheritance patterns and so open avenues of genetic testing.
the aim of this study was to evaluate ddpcr in relation to quantitative pcr  and to assess the suitability of the favoured method as a genetic test for shar-pei autoinflammatory disease .
the cnvs did not follow a continuum of alleles as previously reported, rather the alleles were stable and pedigree analysis showed they adhered to mendelian segregation.

the inclusion of a genetic marker for cnv_ <dig>  in a genome-wide association test revealed that this variant explained  <dig>  % of genetic variance and  <dig>  % of the additive genetic heritability of this autoinflammatory disease.
droplet digital pcr  offers a new mechanism for cnv detection via absolute quantification with the promise of added precision and reliability.
dissecting the role copy number variants  play in disease pathogenesis is directly reliant on accurate methods for quantification.
one hundred and ninety-six individuals were assayed using both pcr methods at two cnv positions .
