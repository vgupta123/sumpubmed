the expression was also detected in various tissues of day  <dig> of the fifth instar and of from day  <dig> of the fifth to pupa, suggesting a wide distributing pattern with various signal intensities.
lin- <dig> and let- <dig>  the two founding members of heterochronic microrna genes, are firstly confirmed in caenorhabditis elegans to control the proper timing of developmental programs in a heterochronic pathway.
the detailed expression profiles in the whole life cycle and cultured cell line of silkworm showed a clear association with ecdysone pulse and a variety of biological processes.
the expression levels were higher at the end of each instar and at the beginning of each molt than at other periods, coinciding with the pulse of ecdysone and br-c as a whole.
all known members of this family share the same nucleotides at ten positions within the mature sequences.
