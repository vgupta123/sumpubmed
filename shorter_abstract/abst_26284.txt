in this paper, we present sub-populations analysis of cells at the tissue level by using dynamic features of the cells.
we report a novel method to identify sub-populations using kinetic features and demonstrate that these features improve sub-population analysis at the tissue level.
the demand of new platforms, coupled with availability of terabytes of data has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual methods and resulted in development of high-dimensional analytical methods.
we used active contour without edges for segmentation of cells, which preserves the cell morphology, and autoregressive modeling to model cell trajectories.
high content screening techniques are increasingly used to understand the regulation and progression of cell motility.
