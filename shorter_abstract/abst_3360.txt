it was also confirmed that the presence of the 5' gt/c end in intermediate/nonconventional introns is not the result of kinship with conventional introns, but is due to evolutionary pressure to preserve the purine at the 5' end.
the latter are characterized by variable non-canonical borders, rna secondary structure that brings intron ends together, and an unknown mechanism of removal.
in the recently acquired intron in the gapc gene an extended direct repeats at the intron-exon junctions are present, suggesting that double-strand break repair process could be the source of new nonconventional introns.
nuclear genes of euglenids contain two major types of introns: conventional spliceosomal and nonconventional introns.
however, it has been also postulated that most introns classified as intermediate could simply be special cases of conventional or nonconventional introns.
nonconventional introns are present at ten positions: two in the tubb gene , six in hsp <dig> , and two in the gapc gene.
sequence and rna secondary structure analyses of nonconventional introns confirmed that their most strongly conserved elements are base pairing nucleotides at positions + <dig>  + <dig> and +6/ - <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> .
however, an example of a nonconventional intron with gc-ag ends was shown, suggesting the possibility of intron type conversion between nonconventional and conventional.
furthermore, an analysis of conventional introns revealed that the ability to form a stable rna secondary structure by some introns is probably not a result of their relationship with nonconventional introns.
it was also shown that acquisition of new nonconventional introns is an ongoing process and can be observed at the level of a single species.

conventional introns were present at three positions: two in the tubb gene  and one in the gapc gene.
sequences of tubb, hsp <dig> and gapc genes from six strains of euglena agilis were obtained.
they form a stable rna secondary structure and are classified into two subtypes depending on whether they contain one  or both  canonical spliceosomal borders.
