predicting metabolic sites is important in the drug discovery process to aid in rapid compound optimisation.
here a fast and reliable method to analyse ligands and visualise potential metabolic sites is presented which is based on annotated metabolic data, described by circular fingerprints.
due to the speed of predictions , scientists can get real time decision support when editing chemical structures.
