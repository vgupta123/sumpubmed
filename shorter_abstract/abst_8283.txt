a significant correlation was observed between the microarray-derived ggi and the qrt-pcr assay using frozen  and ffpe material .
the pcr-ggi further identified two subgroups of patients with statistically different time to distant metastasis free survival  across the two cohorts of er+ bc patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.
the predictive performance for tamoxifen benefit was assessed using two er+ bc populations treated either with adjuvant tamoxifen only  or first-line tamoxifen for advanced disease .
the prognostic performance of the pcr-ggi was confirmed on ffpe samples .
pcr-ggi recapitulates in an accurate and reproducible manner the performances of the ggi using frozen and ffpe samples.
the aims of this study were to convert this microarray index to a qrt-pcr assay , which could be realized on formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples , and to assess its prognostic performance and predictive value of clinical benefit in early and advanced er+ bc patients treated with tamoxifen.
the accuracy and concordance of the pcr-ggi with the ggi was assessed using bc patients for which frozen and ffpe tissues as well as microarray data were available .
the evaluation of the prognostic value of the pcr-ggi was assessed on ffpe material using a consecutive series of  <dig> systemically treated early bc patients.
proliferation and tumor differentiation captured by the genomic grade index  are important prognostic indicators in breast cancer  especially for the estrogen receptor positive  disease.
