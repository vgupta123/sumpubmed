streptococcus suis is divided into  <dig> serotypes based on a serological reaction against the capsular polysaccharide .

multiplex pcr tests targeting the cps locus are also used to determine s. suis serotypes, but they cannot differentiate between serotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and between serotypes  <dig> and 1/ <dig>  here, we developed a pipeline permitting in silico serotype determination from whole-genome sequencing  short-read data that can readily identify all 29 s. suis serotypes.
we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> strains representing all  <dig> known s. suis serotypes.
our pipeline permits rapid and accurate determination of s. suis serotype, and other lineage information, directly from wgs data.
strains of serotype pairs  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and 1/ <dig> could be differentiated by a missense mutation in the cpsk gene.
