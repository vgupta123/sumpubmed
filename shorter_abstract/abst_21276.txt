initial characterization indicated that e. coli o <dig> are a genetically diverse group that were shown to belong to a number of pathotypes.
the aim of the present study was to assess the ability of e. coli o <dig> to survive the effects of disinfectants, acids and antimicrobials and investigate the possible influence of virulence genes in survival and persistence of e. coli o <dig> from human and cattle sources from australia.
overall,  <dig> % of isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested with no significant differences in resistance observed between pathotypes.
after e. coli o <dig>  e. coli o <dig> is the second most prevalent enterohaemorrhagic e. coli  serotype identified in cases of foodborne illness in australia and throughout the world.
notwithstanding, the tolerance to disinfectants and the elevated acid mics for ehec and the other e. coli o <dig> pathotypes examined in this study may contribute to bacterial colonization on food contact surfaces and subsequent foodborne illness caused by this pathogen.
despite this, their response to antimicrobials, disinfectants and acids is similar confirming that stress response appears unrelated to the presence of ehec virulence markers.
e. coli o <dig> associated foodborne outbreaks have drawn attention to the survival capabilities of this organism in a range of environments.
