to demonstrate its utility, we applied maggottracker to analyze both wild-type and mutant animals to identify factors affecting locomotive behaviors.
the maggottracker analysis showed that ether a go-go , shaker , slowpoke , and dunce  mutant larvae had severe phenotypes in multiple locomotive parameters such as stride distance and speed, consistent with their function in neuromuscular junctions.
this system controls the motorized microscope stage while taking a video, so that the animal remains in the viewing center.
here we present maggottracker, a single-animal tracking system for drosophila larval locomotion analysis.
sexual dimorphism was observed in body length but not in locomotive parameters such as speed.
locomotive parameters were affected by animal developmental stage and the crawling surface.
it then reduces the animal to  <dig> evenly distributed points along the midline, and computes over  <dig> parameters evaluating the shape, peristalsis movement, stamina, and track of the animal.
these results showed that maggottracker is an efficient tool for automatic phenotyping.
drosophila larvae have been used as a model to study to genetic and cellular circuitries modulating behaviors.
further, the phenotypic patterns of the k+ channel genes eag, sh and slo are highly similar.
experimental capability can be greatly enhanced by an automatic single-animal tracker that records an animal at a high resolution for an extended period, and analyzes multiple behavioral parameters.
one of the challenges in behavioral study is the quantification of complex phenotypes such as locomotive behaviors.
no significant changes in movement speed were detected in mutants of circadian genes such as period , timeout, and timeless .
