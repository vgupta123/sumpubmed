using datasets from a wide range of species and different levels of complexity we showed that our novel bioinformatic method based on phasing algorithms can be used to achieve the next two goals: i) reference-guided assembly of chloroplast/mitochondrial genomes from hts data and ii) identification and simultaneous assembly of odins.
the method was tested in different shotgun and organellar-enriched dna high-throughput sequencing  datasets from ancient and modern samples.
comparison of the results against other available organelle genome assembly methods demonstrated that our new method provides an improvement in the sequence assembly.
this method represents the first application of haplotype phasing for automatic detection of odins and reference-based organellar genome assembly.
although such insertions can be detected using various laboratory and bioinformatic strategies, there is currently no straightforward way to apply them as a standard organellar genome assembly on next-generation sequencing data.
cellular organelles with genomes of their own  can pass genetic sequences to other organellar genomes within the cell in many species across the eukaryote phylogeny.
