core metabolic graphs comprising biochemical reactions present in the presumed ancestor of parasites and non-parasites were reconstructed from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.
network integrity but not scale-freeness has acted as a selective principle during the evolutionary reduction of parasite metabolism.
here we compare the predicted core metabolic graphs of obligate endoparasites and non-parasites  in order to analyze how the parasites' metabolic networks shrunk in the course of evolution.
presumably, the corresponding enzymes were lost in adaptation to parasitism.
the parasites' networks were smaller than those of the non-parasites regarding number of nodes or edges, but not regarding network diameters.
atp-requiring reactions in particular have been retained in the parasites' core metabolism while nadh- or nadph-requiring reactions were lost preferentially.
control networks, shrunk to the size of the parasites' by random deletion of edges, were scale-free but exhibited smaller diameters and more isolated edges.
obligate endoparasites often lack particular metabolic pathways as compared to free-living organisms.
