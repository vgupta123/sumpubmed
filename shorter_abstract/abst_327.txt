we have investigated the mechanism of the dynamic interaction of the α isoform of human rcc <dig>  with chromatin in live cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  of green fluorescent protein  fusions.
these results show that the stabilisation of the dynamic interaction of rcc1α with chromatin by ran in live cells requires the n-terminal tail of rcc1α.
we show that the n-terminal tail stabilises the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin and this function can be partially replaced by another lysine-rich nuclear localisation signal.
both the n-terminal tail of rcc <dig> and its association with ran are important for its interaction with chromatin in cells.
in vitro, the association of ran with rcc <dig> induces a conformational change in the n-terminal tail that promotes its interaction with dna.
conversely, the association of ran with precipitated rcc1α does not require the n-terminal tail of rcc1α or its methylation.
the interaction of rcc1α with chromatin is destabilised by mutation of lysine  <dig> , which abolishes α-n-terminal methylation, and this interaction is no longer stabilised by rant24n.
however, α-n-terminal methylation of rcc1α is not regulated by the binding of rant24n.
localised generation of ran-gtp by rcc <dig> on chromatin is critical for nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope formation.
regulator of chromosome condensation  <dig>  is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ran gtpase.
