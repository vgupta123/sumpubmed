interest in these strains, not targeted by any of the currently available pneumococcal vaccines, has been rising as they seem to play an important role in the evolution of the species.
thus we propose that nt should be routinely identified and reported in surveillance studies.
pneumococcus is a major human pathogen and the polysaccharide capsule is considered its main virulence factor.
nt circulating in portugal are a homogeneous group belonging to cps type ncc <dig>  our observations support the theory that they are bona-fide pneumococcal isolates that do not express the capsule but are otherwise essentially similar to encapsulated pneumococci.
the capsular region was sequenced and comparative genomic hybridisation  using a microarray covering the genome of  <dig> pneumococcal strains was carried out.
nt circulating in portugal were found to have similar capsular regions, of cps type ncc <dig>  i.e., having alib-like orf <dig> and alib-like orf <dig> genes.
the presence of mobile elements was investigated as source of intraclonal variation.
intraclonal variation could not be entirely explained by the presence of prophages and other mobile elements.
also, competence genes and most virulence genes were present.
the few virulence genes absent in all nt were the capsular genes, type-i and type-ii pili, choline-binding protein a , and pneumococcal surface protein a .
nevertheless, strains lacking a capsule, named non-typeable pneumococcus , are maintained in nature and frequently colonise the human nasopharynx.
the core genome of nt was essentially similar to that of encapsulated strains.
