as it was expected, the introduction of the yras gene into an hsf− strain turned this into hsf+.
culture medium containing sds and coomassie brilliant blue dye was used to screen a mini-tn <dig> km <dig> mutant library of y. ruckeri  <dig>  blue colonies lacking a surrounding creamy deposit, a phenotype described in former studies as hsf−, were identified.
according to this, y. ruckeri strains were classified in hsf+ and hsf− in terms of the presence/absence of the factor.
moreover, the yras mutant showed a similar level of sds resistance to the parental strain.
ld <dig> experiments showed a similar virulence of the yras mutant and parental strain.
in contrast, hsf− strains did not cause mortality.
in conclusion, hsf appeared to be a relevant virulence factor in y. ruckeri.
surprisingly, although the protein allows y. ruckeri to degrade sds, the bacterium could not use this compound as the sole carbon source.
it was the interruption of the acra gene which made y. ruckeri sensitive to this compound.
the hsf of y. ruckeri is the product of the alkyl sulphatase yras, able to degrade sds to 1-dodecanol.
experiments carried out by injection challenge with hsf+ strains caused high mortalities in rainbow trout.
this degradation is not linked to the utilization of sds as a carbon source and surprisingly, the enzyme is not involved in bacterial virulence or in the high sds resistance displayed by the bacterium.
dna sequence analysis of a selected mutant revealed that this had a transposon interruption in a chromosome-located gene which codes for a heat sensitive alkyl sulphatase of  <dig>  kda  which is able to degrade sds to 1-dodecanol.
this role is played by the acrab-tolc system.
