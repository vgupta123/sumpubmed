there is a fundamental concern on whether ars vital staining, achieved by adding ars to the water, can affect bone formation in juvenile and adult zebrafish, as ars has been shown to inhibit skeletal growth and mineralization in mammals.
here we present a protocol for vital staining of mineralized structures in zebrafish with a low ars concentration that does not affect bone mineralization, even after repetitive ars staining events, as confirmed by careful imaging under fluorescent light.
alizarin compounds, either in the form of alizarin red s  or alizarin complexone , have long been used to stain the mineralized skeleton in fixed specimens from all vertebrate groups.

the correct evaluation of mineralization is fundamental for the study of skeletal development, maintenance, and regeneration.
we provide examples from wild type and transgenic gfp-expressing zebrafish, for endoskeletal development and dermal fin ray regeneration.
early and late stages of bone development are equally unaffected by this vital staining protocol.
