due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in g. uralensis, is currently unclear.
identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound.
using the  <dig> gs flx platform and titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality est database for g. uralensis.
the cytochrome p <dig> candidate genes were classified into  <dig> cyp families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into  <dig> categories by go analysis.
based on the est analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, were found.
we used the  <dig> gs flx platform and titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag  dataset from the vegetative organs of g. uralensis.
to identify novel genes that encode cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively.
with the assistance of organ-specific expression pattern analysis,  <dig> unigenes encoding cytochrome p450s and  <dig> unigenes encoding glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis.
a total of  <dig>  unique gene elements representing approximately  <dig>  independent transcripts were annotated using blast searches  against the swissprot, kegg, tair, nr and nt databases.
finally,  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and  <dig> glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time pcr.
<dig> ests were combined with the  <dig>  g. uralensis ests in genbank.
