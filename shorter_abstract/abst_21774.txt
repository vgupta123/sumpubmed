integrator provides single and multiple protein searches of the bioverse database containing experimentally-derived and predicted protein-protein interactions.
we present integrator, a web-integrated graphical search tool for protein-protein interaction networks across 50+ genomes.
the interface provides animated local network views, rapid subgraph manipulation, and cross-referencing of functional annotations.
however, unlike pure text data, network search spaces are of exponential complexity.
