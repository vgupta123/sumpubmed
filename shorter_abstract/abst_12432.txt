our data helps fill a gap in our understanding of the consequences of sexual selection for genetic load, and suggests that stronger selection on males may indeed purge deleterious mutations affecting female fitness.
we therefore investigated the effects of  <dig> generations of x-chromosome mutation accumulation on the fitness of males and females derived from an outbred population of drosophila melanogaster.
mutation-accumulation  experiments provide the most direct way to examine the consequences of new mutations, but most studies have focused on juvenile viability without regard to sex, and on autosomes rather than sex chromosomes; both adult fitness and x-linkage have been little studied.
in addition, the majority of new mutations appear to harm both males and females.
sex differences in the magnitude or direction of mutational effect may be important to a variety of population processes, shaping the mutation load and affecting the cost of sex itself.
