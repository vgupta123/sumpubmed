the analysis of metagenomic datasets indicates that microbes of this genus are widespread worldwide in medium salinity habitats representing the first ecologically defined moderate halophile.
the genomes indicate that the two isolates belong to different species within the same genus.
two strains belonging to this group have been isolated from saltern ponds of intermediate salinity in two spanish salterns and were named “spiribacter”.
both genomes are streamlined with high coding densities, have few regulatory mechanisms and no motility or chemotactic behavior.
this is the first bacterium that has been proven by culture independent approaches to be prevalent in hypersaline habitats of intermediate salinity .
recent metagenomic analysis of intermediate salinity waters  indicated the presence of an abundant and yet undescribed gamma-proteobacterium.
