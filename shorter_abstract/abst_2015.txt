we present sti-gmas , an environment for simulation of sti models, with a view to stimulating the uptake of these models within the laboratory or clinic.
sti-gmas represents the first software designed explicitly for in-silico simulation of sti models by non-theoreticians, thus presenting a novel route to bridging the gap between computational and clinical/experimental disciplines.
while many within-host models of sexually-transmitted infections  are available in existing literature, these models are difficult to deploy in clinical/experimental settings since simulations often require complex computational approaches.
the complex processes of disease progression, namely replication and ascension of the infection through the genital tract, span both extracellular and intracellular physiological scales, and in females can vary over the distinct phases of the menstrual cycle.
the software currently focuses upon the representative case-study of chlamydia trachomatis, the most common sexually-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans.
this example illustrates the ease with which existing models can be adapted to describe new studies, and its careful parameterisation within sti-gmas facilitates future tuning to experimental data as they arise.
