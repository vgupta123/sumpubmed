blanket treatment of all the exposed bulls and adequate sexual rest for the exposed cows could provide a more viable disease control option.
is a sexually transmitted protozoon that causes reproductive failure, among cattle, so disruptive that many western us states have initiated control programs.
current control programs are based on the testing and exclusion of individual bulls.
the second objective of the current study was to review the scientific basis for the banning of metronidazole for use in food animals by the animal medicinal drug use clarification act of  <dig> .
the current status of metronidazole is that the animal medicinal drug use clarification act of  <dig> prohibits its extra-label use in food-producing animals.
results from an antimicrobial assay indicated that metronidazole at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml successfully eliminated in vitro protozoal growth of bovine
the first objective was to demonstrate effectiveness for metronidazole treatment of a bull under ideal conditions and with an optimized treatment regime.
culture at weekly intervals for  <dig> weeks prior to treatment was negative for
culture at weekly intervals for five consecutive weeks following this treatment regimen.
