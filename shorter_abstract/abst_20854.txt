despite considerable progresses in term of accuracy in computational gene prediction, the ability to reliably predict as variants when there is local experimental evidence of it remains an open challenge for gene finders.
we have used a new integrative approach that allows to incorporate as detection into ab initio gene prediction.
this automatic combination of experimental data analysis and ab initio gene finding offers an ideal integration of alternatively spliced gene prediction inside a single annotation pipeline.
this method relies on the analysis of genomically aligned transcript sequences , and has been implemented in the dynamic programming algorithm of the graph-based gene finder eug√àne.
given a genomic sequence and a set of aligned transcripts, this new version identifies the set of transcripts carrying evidence of alternative splicing events, and provides, in addition to the classical optimal gene prediction, alternative optimal predictions .
