we successfully expressed p14k through genetic modifications according to n-end rule and analyzed the mechanism for its difficult expression.
although a strep tag containing p14k  was over-expressed, its low expression level and low stability affect the further analysis.
moreover, fusion of a pelb leader and strep tag together  at the n-terminus increased p14k expression.
we found that mutation of the second n-terminal amino-acid of the protein from lysine to alanine or truncating the n-terminal  <dig> amino-acid sequence resulted in successful expression of p14k.
our results are not only useful for clarification of the role of p14k involved in the nhase maturation, but also helpful for heterologous expression of other difficult expression proteins.
activators of nitrile hydratase  are essential for functional nhase biosynthesis.
however, the activator p14k in p. putida is difficult to heterogeneously express, which retards the clarification of the mechanism of p14k involved in the maturation of nhase.
