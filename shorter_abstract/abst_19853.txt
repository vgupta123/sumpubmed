despite being optimized for snp mining in  <dig> est data, it is flexible enough to automate the analysis of genomic data or even data from other ngs technologies.
additionally when the data sources  are not identified , the problem of finding reliable variation in these datasets can become much more difficult due to the lack of specialized software for this specific task.
in comparison with other snp detection approaches, 4pipe <dig> showed the best validation ratio, retrieving a smaller number of snps but with a considerably lower false positive rate than other methods.
it uses a command line interface to automatically call other programs, parse their outputs and summarize the results.
for non-model species, without a reference genome, it is possible from a panel of individuals to identify a set of snps that can be used for further population genotyping.
however the lack of a reference genome to which the sequenced data could be compared makes the finding of snps more troublesome.
here we describe 4pipe <dig>  a  <dig> data analysis pipeline particularly focused on snp detection when no reference or strain information is available.

there is also a module available for finding putative ssrs in the analysed datasets.
