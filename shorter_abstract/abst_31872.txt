we determined that human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells  given peripherally, by an intravenous injection, could rejuvenate the proliferative activity of the aged neural stem/progenitor cells.
the results demonstrate that a single intravenous injection of ucbmc in aged rats can significantly improve the microenvironment of the aged hippocampus and rejuvenate the aged neural stem/progenitor cells.
our results raise the possibility of a peripherally administered cell therapy as an effective approach to improve the microenvironment of the aged brain.
along with the increase in proliferation following ucbmc treatment, an increase in neurogenesis was also found in the aged animals.
the increase in neurogenesis as a result of ucbmc treatment seemed to be due to a decrease in inflammation, as a decrease in the number of activated microglia was found and this decrease correlated with the increase in neurogenesis.
this decrease is mostly related to a decline in proliferative activity as a result of an impoverishment of the microenvironment of the aged brain, including a reduction in trophic factors and increased inflammation.
