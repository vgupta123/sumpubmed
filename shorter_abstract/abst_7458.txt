there were  <dig> snp markers identified as unique to specific cultivars, and clusters of these markers  showed specific patterns on the consensus genetic map for each cultivar.
the accumulated data for snp marker polymorphisms amongst bread wheat genotypes from kazakhstan may be used for studying genetic diversity in bread wheat, with potential application for marker-assisted selection and the preparation of a set of genotype-specific markers.

new snp marker platforms offer the opportunity to investigate the relationships between wheat cultivars from different regions and assess the mechanism and processes that have led to adaptation to particular production environments.
the study revealed  <dig>  polymorphic markers amongst ten cultivars, of which  <dig>  were mapped in the consensus genetic map.
phylogenetic analysis based on inter-varietal polymorphism showed that the very old cultivar erythrospermum  <dig> was the most genetically distinct from the other nine cultivars from kazakhstan, falling in a clade together with the american cultivar sonora and genotypes from central and south asia.
marker coverage was approximately 10-fold lower in the d genome.
mapped snp markers were distributed almost equally across the a and b genomes, with between  <dig> and  <dig> markers assigned to each chromosome.
