here, we directly test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c is responsible for the observed insulin-dependent abrogation of binding between munc18c and syntaxin  <dig>
our data indicate that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c impairs the ability of munc18c to bind its cognate snare proteins, and may therefore represent a regulatory step in glut <dig> traffic.
we show that munc18c is directly phosphorylated by recombinant insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro.
insulin stimulates exocytosis of glut <dig> from an intracellular store to the cell surface of fat and muscle cells.
syntaxin  <dig> and munc18c form a complex that is disrupted upon insulin treatment of adipocytes.
