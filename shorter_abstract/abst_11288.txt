an automated quantification method was developed to analyze the translocation of membrane proteins and evaluated in comparison to an established manual method.
new descriptors for the intensity distribution profiles were found to be more discriminative, i.e.
a fully automated workflow for the information extraction and statistical evaluation has been developed and produces robust results.
an automated quantification is faster, more reproducible, and should yield results comparable to manual evaluation.
intra-cellular and inter-cellular protein translocation can be observed by microscopic imaging of tissue sections prepared immunohistochemically.
the automated method presented here was developed on rat liver tissue sections to study the translocation of bile salt transport proteins in hepatocytes.
finally, several different quantitative descriptors were derived from the densitometric profiles and were compared regarding their statistical significance with respect to the transport protein distribution.
further, densitometric intensity profiles are extracted orthogonally to membrane fragments, following the direction from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm.
stable performance, robustness and reproducibility were tested using several independent experimental datasets.
