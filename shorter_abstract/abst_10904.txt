this is particularly true in the biological field, whether to facilitate the analysis of large high-throughput data sets, or to perform large numbers of complex simulations â€“ a characteristic of the emerging field of systems biology.
an increasing number of scientific research projects require access to large-scale computational resources.
the framework is relatively easy to set up, hides the complexity of grid middleware from the user, and provides access to resources through a single, uniform interface.
