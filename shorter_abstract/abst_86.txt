we present the paired-genomic-loci  file standard for genomic-interactions data, and the accompanying analysis tool suite “pgltools”: a cross platform, pypy compatible python package available both as an easy-to-use unix package, and as a python module, for integration into pipelines of paired-genomic-loci analyses.
source code, an in-depth manual, and a tutorial are available publicly at www.github.com/billgreenwald/pgltools, and a python module of the operations can be installed from pypi via the pygltools module.
while many file types and analysis tools exist for storing and manipulating single locus ngs data, there is currently no file standard or analysis tool suite for manipulating and storing paired-genomic-loci: the data type resulting from “genomic interaction” studies.
this article details a file standard and novel software tool suite for working with paired-genomic-loci data.
pgltools is a freely available, open source tool suite for manipulating paired-genomic-loci data.
