we identified opsins from the spider cupiennius salei and the onychophoran euperipatoides kanangrensis and characterised the phylogeny and localisation of these transcripts.
opsins can be divided into three main groups: rhabdomeric opsins , ciliary opsins  and group  <dig> opsins.
we recovered all known visual opsins in c. salei, and in addition found a peropsin, a c-opsin and an opsin resembling daphnia pulex arthropsin.
the e. kanangrensis c-opsin and onychopsin were expressed in both the eyes and the brain but the arthropsin only in the brain.
in e. kanangrensis we found: a c-opsin; an opsin resembling d. pulex arthropsins; and an r-opsin with high sequence similarity to previously published onychophoran onychopsins.
our novel finding that opsins of both the ciliary and rhabdomeric type are present in the onychophoran and a spider suggests that these two types of opsins were present in the last common ancestor of the onychophora and euarthropoda.
our discovery of arthropsin in onychophorans and spiders dates the emergence of arthropsin to the common ancestor of onychophora and euarthropoda and their expression in the brain suggests a non-visual function.
the lack of c-opsin expression in the spider retina suggests that the role for c-opsin in vision was lost in the euarthropods.
the peropsin was expressed in all eye types except the anterior median eyes.
