finally, we survey abp orthologs in genomes from across the mammalian clade and show that bursts of abp gene duplications are not specific to the murid rodents; they also occurred recently in the lagomorph  and ruminant  lineages, although not in other mammalian taxa.
we then demonstrate, by sequencing homologs from species within the mus genus, that this burst of gene duplication occurred very recently, within the past seven million years.
we conclude that abp genes have undergone repeated bursts of gene duplication and adaptive sequence diversification driven by these genes' participation in chemosensation and/or sexual identification.
all of these have arisen since the last common ancestor with rat .
despite these studies, our understanding of the evolution of this gene family remains incomplete.
questions arise from imperfections in the initial mouse genome assembly and a dearth of information about the gene family structure in other rodents and mammals.
