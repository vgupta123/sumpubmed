three species of this botanical group are intensively used in breeding programs: e. globulus, e. grandis and e. urophylla.
e. globulus is adapted to subtropical/temperate areas and is considered a source of high-quality cellulose; e. grandis grows rapidly and is adapted to tropical/subtropical climates; and e. urophylla, though less productive, is considered a source of genes related to robustness.
data analysis showed that  most eucalyptus genes are expressed in xylem;  most genes expressed in species-specific way constitutes genes with unknown functions and are interesting targets for future studies;  relevant differences were observed in the phenylpropanoid pathway: e. grandis xylem presents higher expression of genes involved in lignin formation whereas e. urophylla seems to deviates the pathway towards flavonoid formation;  stress-related genes are considerably more expressed in e. urophylla, suggesting that these genes may contribute to its robustness.
in this study, the xylem transcriptomes of the three eucalyptus species were investigated in order to provide insights on the particularities presented by each of these species.
wood, or secondary xylem, results from cambium vascular differentiation and is mostly composed of cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses.
the comparison of these three transcriptomes indicates the molecular signatures underlying some of their distinct wood characteristics.
