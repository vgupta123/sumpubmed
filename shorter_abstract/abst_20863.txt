we have built a software library for efficiently computing the likelihood of a hidden markov model.
hidden markov models are widely used for genome analysis as they combine ease of modelling with efficient analysis algorithms.
this analysis can be saved between uses of the library and is independent of concrete hidden markov models so one preprocessing can be used to run a number of different models.
in a pre-processing step our library identifies common substrings and builds a structure over the computations in the forward algorithm which can be reused.
we have implemented the preprocessing procedure and forward algorithm as a c++ library, ziphmm, with python bindings for use in scripts.
a time efficient forward algorithm is therefore a key ingredient in an efficient hidden markov model library.
using this library, we achieve up to  <dig> times shorter wall-clock time for realistic whole-genome analyses with a real and reasonably complex hidden markov model.
