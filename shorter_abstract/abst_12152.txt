immunohistochemical and imaging techniques were used to determine the distribution of fos-ir cells and cgrp expression in the l5-s <dig> spinal cord in saline and ngf-treated rats two hours after intravesical saline distention.
ngf treatment and intravesical saline distention  increased expression of fos protein in l6-s <dig> spinal cord and altered the distribution pattern of fos-ir cells.
exogenous ngf or saline was delivered to the detrusor smooth muscle of female rats for a two-week period using osmotic mini-pumps.
two-week infusion of ngf into the bladder wall increased bladder weight, reduced bladder capacity , reduced the intercontraction interval  and increased the amplitude of non-voiding contractions.
an osmotic pump infused  <dig> % nacl  or ngf  for two weeks into the bladder wall.
we then determined:  bladder function using conscious cystometry;  organization of micturition reflexes using fos protein expression in lumbosacral  spinal cord neurons;  calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactivity  in lumbosacral spinal cord segments.
cgrp-ir in the lumbosacral spinal cord was also increased after ngf treatment.
these data suggest that ngf infusion into the bladder wall induces bladder overactivity, can reveal a "nociceptive" fos expression pattern in the spinal cord in response to a non-noxious bladder stimulus and increases cgrp-ir in the lumbosacral spinal cord.
fos expression and cgrp-ir in ngf-treated rats with bladder distention was compared to that observed in cyclophosphamide  treated rats with bladder distention.
bladder function was assessed with conscious cystometry.
ngf bladder content was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays.
