the models and evolutionary algorithm used for characterising dna periodicity are proven to be an effective tool for describing the periodicity pattern in a species, when a number of exons in the same phase are analysed.
we have shown that simulated coding sequences, which were composed using codon usage frequencies only, demonstrate dna periodicity very similar to the observed in real exons.
frequencies of the nucleotides  at each location along phase  <dig> exons were calculated for c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens.
the periodic pattern of dna in exons is a known phenomenon.
both of the models showed that the best-fit curves closely matched the actual data points.
secondly, quantification of dna periodicity was made using an evolutionary algorithm, which was not previously used for such purposes.
it is essential to differentiate between dna periodicity itself, and the length of the period equal to  <dig>  periodicity itself is a result of certain combinations of codons with different frequencies typical for a species.
two models were used to fit these data, with the key objective of describing periodicity.
the length of period equal to  <dig>  instead, is caused by the triplet nature of genetic code.
conclusion can be drawn that dna periodicity in exons is determined by codon usage frequencies.
firstly, the cause of dna periodicity, which was investigated by comparisons between real and simulated coding sequences.
it was also found that dna periodicity disappears in the simulated sequences, when the frequencies of codons become equal.
