here we assess the growth of six filamentous marine fungi on a wide range of polymeric substrates as an indication of their general capacity to produce hydrolytic enzymes.
marine fungi could be excellent sources of a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes, including those able to hydrolyse various seaweed polymers.
although fucose was used as carbon source by several species, fucoidan did not support biomass production.
although the native hosts may secrete only small amounts of these enzymes, the genes may provide a rich source of novel enzymes.
marine fungi are a diverse group of opportunistic and obligate organisms isolated from marine environments.
these fungi are now often included in screens for novel metabolites, while less attention has been given to their production of hydrolytic enzymes.

the enzymes produced by marine fungi may have different properties than those derived from bacteria or from terrestrial fungi.
all strains also grew to some extent on sulphated arabinogalactan, although only lf <dig> could utilise arabinose.
