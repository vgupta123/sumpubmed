analysis of the sp8l protein sequence reveals an amino-terminal hydrophobic sp-motif that is disrupted in sp8s, a buttonhead box and three c2h <dig> zinc-fingers.
sp <dig> mrna expression was detected in a wide range of tissues at a low level, with the highest levels being found in brain.
recently, the phenotype of sp <dig> null mice has been described, being tailless and having severe truncation of both fore and hind limbs.
they also have malformed brains with defective closure of the anterior and posterior neuropore during brain development.
one clone encodes a 508-residue protein, sp8l  and the other a shorter 490-residue protein, sp8s .
the specificity proteins  are a family of transcription factors that have three highly conserved zinc-fingers located towards the carboxy-terminal that bind gc-boxes and assist in the initiation of gene transcription.
from an osteosarcoma cell line we cloned two transcript variants that use two different first exons and have a common second exon.
