ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> are transcriptional co-repressors that modulate the activity of a large number of transcriptional repressors via the recruitment of chromatin modifiers.
whilst this sequence contains similarity to known nuclear localisation motifs, it cannot drive nuclear localisation of a heterologous protein, but rather has been shown to function as a p <dig> acetyltransferase-dependent nuclear retention sequence.
here we define the region of ctbp <dig> required to co-operate with a.a. 4– <dig> to promote ctbp <dig> nuclear accumulation as being within a.a. 1– <dig>  in addition, we show that a.a. 120– <dig> of ctbp <dig> can also promote ctbp <dig> nuclear accumulation, independently of a.a. 4– <dig>  finally, ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> can form heterodimers, and we show that the interaction with ctbp <dig> is one mechanism whereby ctbp <dig> can be recruited to the nucleus.
ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> are highly similar proteins, although evidence is emerging that their activity can be differentially regulated, particularly through the control of their subcellular localisation.
ctbp2s from diverse species contain a unique n-terminus, absent in ctbp <dig> that plays a key role in controlling the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of the protein.
here we show that amino acids  4– <dig> of ctbp <dig> direct ctbp <dig> into an almost exclusively nuclear distribution in cell lines of diverse origins.
many ctbp-regulated proteins are involved in pathways associated with tumorigenesis, including tgf-β and wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as rb/p <dig> and hdm <dig>  as well as adenovirus e1a.
