the northern blot analysis revealed various characteristics of the genes at the transcript level, such as expression level, size and the presence of isoform.
we also found that six of the genes have secretory activity, indicating that they may interact with sperm and have functional roles in sperm maturation.
our study is unique in the aspect of systematic identification of novel epididymal genes and should be a firm basis for future investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying sperm maturation in the epididymis.
further expression analyses demonstrated that the novel genes are region-specific and developmentally regulated.
we identified and characterized  <dig> novel epididymis-specific or -predominant genes by an integrative approach.
we systematically identified  <dig> novel genes with epididymis-specific or -predominant expression in the mouse epididymis unigene library, containing  <dig> gene-oriented transcript clusters, by in silico and in vitro analyses.
comprehensive understanding of sperm maturation requires identification and characterization of unique genes expressed in the epididymis.
a number of the novel genes are putative epididymal protease inhibitors or Î²-defensins.
computational analysis showed that  <dig> of the genes lack human orthologues, suggesting their implication in male reproduction unique to the mouse.
