this extra sequence, tcccac, is highly conserved and has been found in multiple ndv strains, including zj- <dig>  wf00g, jsg <dig>  and na- <dig>  in the current study, an infectious clone from strain na- <dig> was isolated and designated rna- <dig>  subsequently, strain rna- <dig> was mutated to delete the six-nucleotide insertion, producing strain rna- <dig>  virulence of the recombinant virus was then assayed in chickens and geese.
the virulent newcastle disease virus  strain na- <dig>  was isolated from an epizootic involving a flock of geese in jilin province, northeast china, in  <dig>  compared with the classical ndv strains, which have a genome size of  <dig>  bp, the more recently isolated ndv strains, including that involved in the goose outbreak, have an extra six nucleotides in the 5′-untranslated region  of the nucleoprotein  gene.
following deletion of six nucleotides in the 5′-utr of the np gene of ndv strain na- <dig>  the virulence of the rna- <dig> recombinant strain was decreased in both chickens and geese.
furthermore, the virulence of the recombinant strain was slightly decreased in 1-day-old spf chickens when compared with that in 1-day-old geese.
