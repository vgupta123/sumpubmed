classifiers were built on conventionally diagnosed training data.
multivariate classification techniques allow for automating cell population detection in cytometry readouts for diagnostic purposes.
leukemic blasts within blood samples, has become increasingly important in therapeutic disease monitoring.
svm classification can recover manually gated leukemic cells with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % specificity.
modern flow cytometers enable researchers to reliably measure six and more variables, describing cellular size, granularity and expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins, for thousands of cells per second.
currently, analysis of cytometry readouts relies on visual inspection and manual gating of one- or two-dimensional projections of the data.
we assessed the detection accuracy on independent test data and analyzed marker expression of incongruently classified cells.
