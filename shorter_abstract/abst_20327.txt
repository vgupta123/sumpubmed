the gene targets of cos identified in this study indicate that cosâ€™s mechanism of action is different from other commonly studied fungicides that target membranes, suggesting that cos may be an effective fungicide for drug-resistant fungal pathogens.
the genes identified are involved in processes such as rna biology , membrane functions , membrane structural components, cell division, and proteasome processes.
the transcriptomes of control wild type and  <dig> suppressor strains overexpressing arl <dig>  bck <dig>  erg <dig>  msg <dig>  or rba <dig>  were analyzed in the presence and absence of cos. some of the up-regulated transcripts in the suppressor overexpressing strains exposed to cos included genes involved in transcription, cell cycle, stress response and the ras signal transduction pathway.
we found that the arl <dig> cos-resistant over-expression strain was as sensitive to amphotericin b, fluconazole and terbinafine as the wild type cells and that when cos and fluconazole are used in combination they act in a synergistic fashion.
the fitness assays identified  <dig> yeast deletion strains sensitive to cos and  <dig> suppressors of cos sensitivity.
the cos-induced transcriptional response is distinct from previously described environmental stress responses  and pre-treatment with these well characterized environmental stressors provided little or any resistance to cos.

by identifying the molecular and genetic targets of cos, we hope to gain a better understanding of the antifungal mode of action of cos.
chitosan oligosaccharide , a deacetylated derivative of chitin, is an abundant, and renewable natural polymer.
three different chemogenomic fitness assays, haploinsufficiency , homozygous deletion , and multicopy suppression  profiling were combined with a transcriptomic analysis to gain insight in to the mode of action and mechanisms of resistance to chitosan oligosaccharides.
