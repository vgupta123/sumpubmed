high-parent dominance of mrna levels was found to be associated with high parental mrna expression levels, the absence of tes, and for some genes, with small rna fragments that are predominantly from the sense strand.
thus, increased as well as decreased gene expression in hybrids relative to the parental mean is associated with gene expression levels, te presence and small rna fragments with differing characteristics.
expression levels below mid-parent values in the hybrids were associated with low mrna expression in parents, with the presence of small rna from both strands, and with the presence of tes.
gene expression inheritance patterns in arabidopsis hybrid plants were investigated for correlation with the presence of transposable elements  and small rna profile.
the data presented here is consistent with a role for differential mrna decay kinetics as one mechanism contributing to high-parent dominance in gene expression.

the presence of tes in a gene and the expression of small rna matching a gene were both found to be associated with non-additive mrna inheritance patterns in hybrids.
these small rnas exhibit a broader size distribution than sirna and reduced nucleotide end bias, which are consistent with an origin from degraded mrna.
our evidence is also consistent with trans repression by sirna and tes as the cause of low-parent dominance.
