using sureselect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chifitm locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a white leghorn, and a turkey.
interferon inducible transmembrane  proteins are effectors of the immune system widely characterized for their role in restricting infection by diverse enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.
the pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of a63v in the cil domain of ifitm <dig> compared to red jungle fowl and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differences between ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of chickens and turkeys, respectively.
we re-sequenced the locus using both illumina miseq and pacbio rs ii sequencing technologies and we mapped rna-seq data from the european nucleotide archive  to this finalized chifitm locus.
rna-seq shows chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig> expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chifitm <dig> is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues.
recently, a new chicken reference genome assembly gallus gallus v <dig> was generated using sanger,  <dig>  illumina and pacbio sequencing technologies identifying considerable differences in the chifitm locus over the previous genome releases.
