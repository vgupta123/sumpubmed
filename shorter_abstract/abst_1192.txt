maintenance of antimicrobial concentrations above the mpc for > 50% of administration interval is a straightforward way to restrict the acquisition of resistance in this tissue cage model.
in order to inhibit the bacterial resistance production, the mutant selection window  hypothesis with escherichia coli  atcc  <dig> exposed to cefquinome in an animal tissue-cage model was investigated.
when auc <dig> h/mic <dig> and auc <dig> h/mpc were considered, the mutant selection window extended from  <dig>  h to  <dig>  h and from  <dig>  h to  <dig>  h, respectively.

e. coli lost susceptibility when drug concentrations fluctuated between the lower and upper boundaries of the window, which defined in vitro as the mic <dig>  and the mpc  respectively.
localized infection with e. coli was established in piglets, and the infected animals were administrated intramuscularly with various doses and intervals of cefquinome to provide antibiotic concentrations below the mic <dig>  between the mic <dig> and the mutant prevention concentration , and above the mpc.
for pk/pd parameters, there were no mutant selection enrichment when t>mic <dig> was ≤ 25% or t>mpc was ≥ 50% of administration interval.
this situation was achieved with daily intramuscular doses of 1 mg cefquinome/kg body weight.
