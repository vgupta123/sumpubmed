it can be used to manipulate aligned sequences, calculate evolutionary distances, estimate synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates, and infer phylogenetic trees.
however, few functions are freely available in matlab to perform the sequence data analyses specifically required for molecular biology and evolution.
we have developed a matlab toolbox, called mbetoolbox, aimed at filling this gap by offering efficient implementations of the most needed functions in molecular biology and evolution.
mbetoolbox is a useful tool that can aid in the exploration, interpretation and visualization of data in molecular biology and evolution.
moreover, it provides an extensible, functional framework for users with more specialized requirements to explore and analyze aligned nucleotide or protein sequences from an evolutionary perspective.
matlab is a high-performance language for technical computing, integrating computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment.
