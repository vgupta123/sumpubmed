in this context, identifying a potential binding site between proteins is of primary interest.
in the literature, methods for predicting a potential binding site location generally are based on classification tools.
the aim of this paper is to show that regression tools are more efficient than classification tools for patches based binding site predictors.
for this purpose, we developed a patches based binding site localization method usable with either regression or classification tools.
using leave-one-out cross-validation, we showed that regression tools provide better predictions than classification ones.
regression is more efficient than classification when applied to our binding site localization method.
when it is possible, using regression instead of classification for other existing binding site predictors will probably improve results.
we compared also the predictive performance of our patches based method using multilayer perceptron with the performance of three other methods usable through a web server.
this adaptability is useful when either false positive or negative rates have to be limited.
we compared predictive performances of regression tools with performances of machine learning classifiers.
the structural genomics centers provide hundreds of protein structures of unknown function.
among regression tools, multilayer perceptron ranked highest in the quality of predictions.
