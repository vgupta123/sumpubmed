abnormal changes instead influence the development of disease states like cancer.
we have developed an approach for identifying histone modifications in biomedical literature with conditional random fields  and for resolving the recognized histone modification term variants by term standardization.
due to the lack of terminologies exhaustively covering specific histone modification types, we developed a histone modification term hierarchy for use in a semantic text retrieval system.
for the term identification f <dig> measures of  <dig>  by 10-fold cross-validation on the training corpus and  <dig>  on an independent test corpus have been obtained.
it contains information about experimental studies, the conditions used, and results.
since text contains context information about performed studies and experiments, the identification of histone modifications is the basis for supporting literature-based knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation to accelerate epigenomic research.
certain histone modification patterns, distributed over the genome, are connected to cell as well as tissue differentiation and to the adaption of organisms to their environment.
to our knowledge, no approach has been published so far for identifying histone modifications in text.
the developed approach highly improves the retrieval of articles describing histone modifications.
