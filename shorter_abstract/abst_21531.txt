in recent years, various solutions have been implemented to tackle this problem.
gimli achieves an f-measure of  <dig> % on genetag and  <dig> % on jnlpba corpus, significantly outperforming existing open-source solutions.
we present gimli, an open-source, state-of-the-art tool for automatic recognition of biomedical names.
based on the underlying system characteristics and functionality, both for final users and developers, and on the reported performance results, we believe that gimli is a state-of-the-art solution for biomedical ner, contributing to faster and better research in the field.
it can be used as a command line tool, offering full functionality, including training of new models and customization of the feature set and model parameters through a configuration file.
automatic recognition of biomedical names is an essential task in biomedical information extraction, presenting several complex and unsolved challenges.
