"candidatus phytoplasma aurantifolia", is the causative agent of witches' broom disease in mexican lime trees , and is responsible for major losses of mexican lime trees in southern iran and oman.
therefore, we have applied a cdna- amplified fragment length polymorphism  approach to analyze gene expression in mexican lime trees infected by "ca.
we carried out cdna-aflp analysis on grafted infected mexican lime trees of the susceptible cultivar at the representative symptoms stage.
the present study identifies a number of candidate genes that might be involved in the interaction of mexican lime trees with "candidatus phytoplasma aurantifolia".
these results should help to elucidate the molecular basis of the infection process and to identify genes that could be targeted to increase plant resistance and inhibit the growth and reproduction of the pathogen.
these included the genes for modifier of snc <dig> and autophagy protein  <dig>  furthermore, down-regulation of genes involved in metabolism, transcription, transport and cytoskeleton was observed, which included the genes for formin, importin β  <dig>  transducin, l-asparaginase, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, and rna polymerase β. in contrast, genes that encoded a proline-rich protein, ubiquitin-protein ligase, phosphatidyl glycerol specific phospholipase c-like, and serine/threonine-protein kinase were up-regulated during the infection.
