cd <dig> has little or no base exchange activity, but some adp-ribosyl cyclase activity, indicating that cd <dig> formed cyclic adp-ribose but much less nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, with both mobilizing ca2+ from intracellular ca2+ pools.
social avoidance in cd <dig> knockout mice was rescued by a single intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin.
cd <dig> immunoreactivity colocalized with nestin-positive cells and elements in the ventricular zones in e <dig> embryos.
weak but distinct immunoreactivity was detected in several areas in the adult brain, including the amygdala.
the functional features of cd <dig> can be explained in part through the production of cyclic adp-ribose rather than nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
it has been shown that social behaviors are impaired in cd <dig> knockout mice without severe motor dysfunction and that cd157/bst <dig> gene single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with autism spectrum disorder in humans.
recent rodent and human studies provide evidence in support of the fact that cd <dig>  well known as bone marrow stromal cell antigen- <dig>  and a risk factor in parkinson’s disease, also meaningfully acts in the brain as a neuroregulator and affects social behaviors.
to gain fresh insights about the relationship between the presence of cd <dig> in the brain and its enzymatic activity, and aberrant social behavior, cd <dig> knockout mice of various ages were tested.
further experiments are required to elucidate how the embryonic expression of cd <dig> in neural stem cells contributes to behaviors in adults or to psychiatric symptoms.
