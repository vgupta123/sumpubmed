similar results were obtained in primary human differentiated macrophages.
similar results were obtained with ospa.
these results demonstrated the ability of serum lipids to attenuate proinflammatory activity of bacterial lipoproteins and suggested that serum lipoproteins interact with acyl chains of the lipid part of bacterial lipoproteins to render it biologically inactive.
chlamydia trachomatis was previously shown to express a lipoprotein, the macrophage infectivity potentiator , exposed at the bacterial surface, and able to stimulate human primary monocytes/macrophages through toll like receptor 2/tlr1/tlr <dig>  and cd <dig>  in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells the proinflammatory activity of mip was significantly higher in the absence than in the presence of serum.
the most efficient inhibitors were ldl, vldl, and apob that reduced the mean concentration of tnf-α release in mip-induced macrophages to  <dig>   <dig>  and 2%, respectively .
the present study aims to investigate the ability of different serum factors to attenuate mip proinflammatory activity in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells and in primary human differentiated macrophages.
finally, tlr1/ <dig> human embryonic kidney- <dig>  transfected cells were used to test the ability of the serum factors to inhibit mip and ospa proinflammatory activity.
in the presence of 10% human serum, the concentrations of tnf-α and il- <dig> were  <dig> to  <dig> times lower than in the presence of 10% fbs suggesting the presence of more potent inhibitor in human serum than in fbs.
different lipid components of human serum were then tested a-i, b, e <dig>  and e3).
in the absence of any serum and in the presence of 10% delipidated fbs, production of mip-induced tnf-α and il- <dig> in pma-differentiated thp- <dig> cells were similar whereas they were significantly decreased in the presence of 10% fbs suggesting an inhibiting role of lipids present in fbs.
the study was also extend to another lipoprotein, the borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein a. the proinflammatory activity was studied through tumor necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin - <dig> release.
