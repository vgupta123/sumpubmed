amda covers all of the steps, performing a full data analysis, including image analysis, quality controls, normalization, selection of differentially expressed genes, clustering, correspondence analysis and functional evaluation.
amda is free and it is available as an r package.
amda is freely available as an r package under the gpl license.
the package as well as an example analysis report can be downloaded in the services/bioinformatics section of the genopolis
finally a latex document is dynamically generated depending on the performed analysis steps.
in spite of this fact, few and limited tools exist for quickly and easily analyzing the results.
the generated report contains comments and analysis results as well as the references to several files for a deeper investigation.
microarray analysis can be challenging for researchers without the necessary training and it can be time-consuming for service providers with many users.
this automated pipeline integrates different functions available in the r and bioconductor projects with newly developed functions.
