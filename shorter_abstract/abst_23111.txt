the superior performance of the approach is demonstrated via simulation study.
missing trait and/or marker values prevent one from directly applying the classical model selection criteria such as akaike's information criterion  and bayesian information criterion .
identifying quantitative trait loci  for both additive and epistatic effects raises the statistical issue of selecting variables from a large number of candidates using a small number of observations.
the regression coefficient priors are flexible enough to incorporate the characteristic of "large p small n" data.
the two-step procedure coupled with bayesian classification offers flexibility in modeling "large p small n" data, especially for the sparse and asymmetric parameter space.
specifically, sparseness and possible asymmetry of the significant coefficients are dealt with by developing a gibbs sampling algorithm to stochastically search through low-dimensional subspaces for significant variables.
we propose a two-step bayesian variable selection method which deals with the sparse parameter space and the small sample size issues.
