representative otus were grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> different taxa at family and genus level taxonomic classification, respectively.
saudi arabia is mostly barren except the southwestern highlands that are susceptible to environmental changes, a hotspot for biodiversity, but poorly studied for microbial diversity and composition.
the large number of otus shared between the studied samples suggest the presence of a core soil bacterial community in the southwestern highlands of saudi arabia.

in general, lower percentage of total soil organic matter  and nitrogen were detected in the analyzed soil samples.
in this study, 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene hypervariable region v <dig> was used to analyze soil bacterial community along elevation gradients of the southwestern highlands.
jackknifed principal coordinates analysis  revealed, overall differences in the bacterial community were more related to the quantity of specific otus than to their diversity among the studied samples.
bacterial diversity and soil physicochemical properties did not show consistent changes along the elevation gradients.
