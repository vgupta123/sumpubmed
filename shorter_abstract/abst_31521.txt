a c-terminal region of vpr, comprising the  <dig> residues 75gcrhsrigvtrqrrar <dig>  with high binding affinity for cypa has been identified.
the n- and c-terminal binding regions of full-length vpr bind cooperatively to cypa and have allowed a model of the complex to be created.
the dissociation constant of full-length vpr to cypa was determined to be approximately  <dig> nm, indicating that the binding may be stronger than that of the well characterized interaction of hiv- <dig> ca with cypa.
for the first time the interaction of full-length vpr and cypa has been characterized and quantified.
a non-proline-containing 16-residue region of c-terminal vpr which binds specifically to cypa with similar high affinity as full-length vpr has been identified.
it is interesting to note that several previously reported key functions of hiv- <dig> vpr are associated with the identified n- and c-terminal binding domains of the protein to cypa.
cyclophilin a  represents a potential key molecule in future antiretroviral therapy since inhibition of cypa suppresses human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  replication.
the fact that the mutant peptide vpr75- <dig> r80a binds more weakly to cypa than the wild-type peptide confirms that arg- <dig> is a key residue in the c-terminal binding domain.
here the interaction of full-length hiv- <dig> vpr with the host cellular factor cypa has been characterized and quantified by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.
