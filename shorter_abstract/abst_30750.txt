two common classes of genomic resources that can be mined are bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and expressed sequence tag  libraries.
allelic diversity of ssrs was positively correlated with repeat length and was generally higher in at-rich repeat motifs.
the first large-scale survey of orthopteran ssr allelic diversity is presented.
selection contributes more strongly to the size and density distributions of ssr loci derived from est library sequence than from bac library sequence, although all ssrs likely are subject to similar physical and structural constraints, such as slippage of dna replication machinery, that may generate increased allelic diversity in at-rich sequence motifs.
simple sequence repeats  are tandemly repeated sequence motifs common in genomic nucleotide sequence that often harbor significant variation in repeat number.
ssrs were more densely distributed and contained longer repeat structures in bac library-derived sequence than in est library-derived sequence, although neither repeat density nor length was exceptionally elevated despite the relatively large genome size of laupala.
although in silico approaches work well for ssr locus identification in both est and bac libraries, bac library sequence and at-rich repeat motifs are generally superior ssr development resources for most applications.
<dig> ssr loci were screened in the rapidly radiating hawaiian swordtail cricket genus laupala.
frequently used as molecular markers, ssrs are increasingly identified via in silico approaches.
