we applied this protocol to  <dig> hcv positive clinical samples, and had a successful genome amplification rate of 90 %, when the viral load was greater than  <dig>  iu/ml.
illumina sequencing resulted in deep coverage and allowed detection of rare variants as well as hcv co-infection with multiple genotypes.
all hcv genotypes cause chronic hepatitis, which ultimately leads to liver diseases such as cirrhosis.
in this study we describe a genotype-specific protocol for the amplification and sequencing of the near-full length genome of all six major hcv genotypes.
the assay was shown to have a detection limit of 1– <dig> cdna copies per reaction.
hepatitis c virus  is a rapidly evolving rna virus that has been classified into seven genotypes.
although recent improvements have been made in full genome sequencing methodologies, these protocols are still either limited to a specific genotype or cost-inefficient.
