in order to identify new virulence determinants in y. pseudotuberculosis a comparison between its genome and that of yersinia pestis was undertaken.
this reveals dozens of pseudogenes in y. pestis, which are still putatively functional in y. pseudotuberculosis and may be important in the enteric lifestyle.
one such gene, yptb <dig> in the y. pseudotuberculosis ip <dig> genome sequence, encodes a protein with similarity to invasin, a classic adhesion/invasion protein, and to intimin, the attaching and effacing protein from enteropathogenic  and enterohaemorraghic  escherichia coli.
a new y. pseudotuberculosis adhesin has been identified and characterised.
cysteine and tryptophan residues in the c-terminal region of intimin that are essential for function in epec and ehec are conserved in ifp.
this ifp is a new member in the family of invasin/intimin outer membrane adhesins.
protein binding occurred at distinct foci on the hep- <dig> cell surface and can be disrupted by mutation of a single cysteine residue at the c-terminus of the protein.
