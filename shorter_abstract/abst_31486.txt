in this study, based on the search of the complete genome database from genbank, the whole genome shotgun  databases, and some published literatures, thirty-three prophages were described in detail.
eleven of them were full-length prophages, and others were prophage-like elements.
prophages, integral components of many bacterial genomes, play significant roles in cognate host bacteria, such as virulence, toxin biosynthesis and secretion, fitness cost, genomic variations, and evolution.
many prophages and prophage-like elements present in sequenced bacterial genomes, such as bifidobacteria, lactococcus and streptococcus, have been described.
they were phimav_ <dig>  phimav_ <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phibn42_ <dig>  phibn44_ <dig>  phimcan_ <dig>  phimycsm_ <dig>  and phiw7s_ <dig>  their genomes and gene contents were firstly analyzed.
to our knowledge, this is the first systematic characterization of mycobacterioprophages, their genomic organization and phylogeny.
