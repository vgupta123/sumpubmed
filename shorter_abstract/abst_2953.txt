while previous studies in wheat and barley have revealed the functional role of histone modification in setting vrn <dig> expression, other mechanisms might also be involved.
we provide the first dna methylation analysis of the vrn-a <dig> gene, and describe the existence of methylation at cg but also at non cg sites.
interestingly, cold induces a site-specific hypermethylation at these non cg sites.
the finding that this shift occurs at non cg sites in a te-rich region opens interesting questions onto the possible consequences of this type of methylation in gene expression.
while cg sites show a bell-shape profile typical of gene-body methylation, non cg methylation is restricted to the large  intron  <dig>  in a region harboring fragments of transposable elements .
the genetic bases of vernalization response have been largely studied in wheat, leading to the characterization of a regulation pathway that involves the key gene vernalization <dig> .
in wheat, winter cultivars require vernalization to initiate flowering, making vernalization requirement a trait of key importance in wheat agronomy.
these results demonstrate that vrn-a <dig> has a particular dna methylation pattern, exhibiting rapid shift within the life cycle of a winter wheat plant following exposure to particular environmental conditions.
here, we were interested in determining whether the cold-induced expression of the wheat vrn-a <dig> gene is associated with a change in dna methylation.
this increase in dna methylation is transmitted through mitosis, and is reset to its original level after sexual reproduction.
