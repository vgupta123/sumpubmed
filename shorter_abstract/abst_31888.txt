recent studies have demonstrated the genetic significance of insertions, deletions, and other more complex structural variants  in the human population.
all current sv calling methods have multilevel biases in their identifications due to both experimental and computational limitations .
compared with the existing read-depth and read-pair approaches for sv identification, our method can pinpoint the exact breakpoints of sv events, reveal the actual sequence content of insertions, and cover the whole size spectrum for deletions.
then to identify svs, we score each of the many initial mappings with an assessment strategy designed to take into account both sequencing and alignment errors .
we start by mapping each read to the reference genome in standard fashion using gapped alignment.
coupling the observed numbers of events on chromosome  <dig> with the calibrations gleaned from the simulations  allows us to construct a relatively unbiased estimate for the total number of svs in the human genome across a wide range of length scales.
this allows us to calculate sensitivity and the positive predictive value under different parameter-value scenarios and for different classes of events .
here we present split-read identification, calibrated , a sequence-based method for sv detection.
