sec <dig> is highly expressed in mammalian nervous systems and has been proposed to play a role in several aspects of neural development and function, including neurite outgrowth, calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion, trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors and regulation of neuronal microtubule assembly.
the drosophila nmj is genetically malleable and accessible throughout development to electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, making it ideal for examination of the sec <dig> mutant synaptic phenotype.
sec <dig> is abundant in the drosophila nmj.
contrary to the hypothesis that sec <dig> is required for neurite outgrowth or synaptic terminal growth, immunocytochemical examination revealed that sec <dig> mutant nmjs developed more branches and presynaptic terminals during larval development, compared to controls.
sec <dig> is required in vivo for regulation of synaptic microtubule formation, and  regulation of synaptic growth and glutamate receptor trafficking.
the most dramatic nmj phenotype in sec <dig> mutants was an increase in synaptic microtubule density, which was approximately doubled compared to controls.
synaptic electrophysiology showed no evidence that sec <dig> is required for basal neurotransmission, though glutamate receptor trafficking was mildly disrupted in sec <dig> mutants.
in our sec <dig> null mutants, in which the sec <dig> gene is specifically deleted, sec <dig> immunoreactivity at the nmj is eliminated but immunoblots reveal substantial maternal contribution in the rest of the animal.
we identified lethal sec <dig> mutants in an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutations causing defects in development of glutamatergic drosophila neuromuscular junctions .
we did not find any evidence that sec <dig> is required for basal neurotransmission.
