the fold change error assessable on simulated data was on average  <dig>   with an error-to-signal ratio and labeling efficiency distributions similar to the ones found in the experimentally observed spectra.
different degrees of phosphorylation were reported using the fold change measure which was extended with a confidence interval found to reflect the quality of the underlying spectra.
the presented method quantitatively compares peptide abundances from experiments using 18o/16o labeling starting from elaborated ms spectra.
the presented method assesses, in complete cell lysates, the degree of phosphorylation of specific peptide residues from ms spectra using 18o/16o labeling.
using simulated data generated in a manner mimicking real data it was possible to show the method's robustness both with increasing noise levels and with decreasing labeling efficiency.
