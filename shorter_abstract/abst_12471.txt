the transgenic plants did not show any change in growth or in lignocellulose saccharification.
the scagu <dig> extracted from cell walls of arabidopsis was active on the internally substituted aldopentaouronic acid .
in contrast, gux1gux <dig> mutant was lacking ux <dig> signals in both native and deacetylated cell walls.

this indicates that acetyl substitution on the xylopyranosyl residue carrying glca or on the neighboring xylopyranosyl residues may restrict post-synthetic modification of xylans by scagu <dig> in planta.
expressing microbial polysaccharide-modifying enzymes in plants is an attractive approach to custom tailor plant lignocellulose and to study the importance of wall structures to plant development.
in this work, a gh <dig> α-glucuronidase from schizophyllum commune, scagu <dig>  was expressed in arabidopsis thaliana and targeted to apoplast.
the cell wall glca and other non-cellulosic sugars, as well as the lignin content, remained unchanged.
the cell wall–targeted scagu <dig> was shown to affect those glucuronate substitutions of xylan, which are accessible to ux <dig> antibody and constitute a small fraction in arabidopsis, whereas majority of glca substitutions were resistant, most likely due to the shielding by acetyl groups.
the transgene effects on native xylans’ structures, plant development, and lignocellulose saccharification were evaluated and compared to those of knocked out glucuronyltransferases atgux <dig> and atgux <dig>
