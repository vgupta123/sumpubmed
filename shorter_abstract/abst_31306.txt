host defence peptides , also known as antimicrobial peptides , have emerged as potential new therapeutics and their antimicrobial spectrum covers a wide range of target organisms.
the hssr mutation also enhanced resistance to the plectasin-like defensin eurocin, but not to other classes of hdps or to other stressors tested.
our data suggest that a functional difference between response regulators hssr and rr <dig> is responsible for the difference in plectasin susceptibility observed between s. aureus and l. monocytogenes.
in the present study we aimed to use transposon mutagenesis to determine the genetic basis for s. aureus and l. monocytogenes susceptibility to plectasin.
in order to identify genes that provide susceptibility to plectasin we constructed bacterial transposon mutant libraries of s. aureus nctc8325- <dig> and l. monocytogenes  <dig> and screened for increased resistance to the peptide.
however, in s. aureus, four mutants with insertion in the heme response regulator  were 2- <dig> fold more resistant to plectasin as compared to the wild type.
the genome of l. monocytogenes lo <dig> encodes a putative hssr homologue, rr <dig>  with 48% identity to the s. aureus hssr, but a mutation in the rr <dig> gene did not change the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to plectasin.
s. aureus hssr, but not the homologue rr <dig> from l. monocytogenes, provides susceptibility to the defensins plectasin and eurocin.
no resistant mutants arose when l. monocytogenes was screened on plates containing  <dig> and  <dig> fold minimal inhibitory concentration  of plectasin.
plectasin is a recently discovered hdp active against gram-positive bacteria with the human pathogen, staphylococcus aureus  being highly susceptible and the food borne pathogen, listeria monocytogenes  being less sensitive.
