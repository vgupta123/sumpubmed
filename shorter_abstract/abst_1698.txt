functional annotation of these genes reveals unequal distribution among taxonomic groups and intriguing putative functions such as cytotoxicity and nucleic acid repair.
while averaged codon bias is the same in physcomitrella and arabidopsis, the distribution pattern is different, with 15% of moss genes being unbiased.
the moss physcomitrella patens is an emerging plant model system due to its high rate of homologous recombination, haploidy, simple body plan, physiological properties as well as phylogenetic position.
we have clustered and assembled physcomitrella patens est and cds data in order to represent the transcriptome of this non-seed plant.
more than  <dig> transcripts are not present in seed plants but can be found in other kingdoms.
these potential "retained genes" might have been lost during seed plant evolution.
whereas introns in the moss are larger on average than in the seed plant arabidopsis thaliana, position and amount of introns are approximately the same.
interestingly, moss orthologs of arabidopsis genes show a significant drift of codon fraction usage, towards the seed plant.
analysis of the moss transcriptome displays differences in gene structure, codon and splice site usage in comparison with the seed plant arabidopsis.
of these putative transcripts, approximately 30% have a homolog in both rice and arabidopsis transcriptome.
contrary to arabidopsis, where cds contain on average 44% g/c, in physcomitrella the average g/c content is 50%.
species-specific, sensitive and selective splice site prediction for physcomitrella has been developed using a dataset of  <dig> donor and acceptor sites, utilizing a support vector machine.
