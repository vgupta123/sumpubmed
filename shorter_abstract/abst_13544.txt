line angle sizes of  <dig> ° and  <dig> ° were presented.
moreover, the head-tilt effect was also modulated by the stimulus' angle size.
the large angle size led to deviations in the direction of head-tilt, whereas the small angle size had the opposite effect.
our results showed that gender and line angle size have an impact on the evaluation of the svv.
forty healthy participants  were asked to make visual vertical adjustments of a light bar with their head held vertically or roll-tilted by 30° to the left or to the right.
the present study examined the impact of two methodological factors  on deviations of the svv caused by head tilt.
these findings must be taken into account in the growing body of research that uses the svv paradigm in disease settings.
moreover, this methodological issue may explain  the discrepancies found in the literature on the head-tilt effect.
the svv tended to move in the direction of head tilt in women but away from the direction of head tilt in men.
