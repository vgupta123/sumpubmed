our results strongly support the involvement of hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> in transcriptional co-activation of a genetic program of longevity and desiccation tolerance in sunflower seeds.
in addition, the overexpression of hahsfa <dig> in vegetative organs conferred tolerance to drastic levels of dehydration and oxidative stress.

these results would also have potential application for improving seed longevity and tolerance to severe stress in vegetative organs.
the improved phenotypes occurred in coincidence with only subtle changes in the accumulation of small heat shock proteins  that are encoded by genes activated by hahsfa <dig>  the single overexpression of hahsfa4a in vegetative organs  did not induce shsp accumulation under control growth conditions; neither it conferred thermotolerance.
we have previously reported that the seed-specific overexpression of sunflower  heat shock factor a <dig>  enhanced seed longevity in transgenic tobacco .
