research initiatives have been launched to produce genomic and transcriptomic data about coffea spp.
protein domain and gene ontology analyses suggested differences between coffea spp.
the identification of differentially expressed transcripts offers a starting point for the correlation between gene expression profiles and coffea spp.
c. arabica is an allotetraploid from a recent hybridization of the diploid species, c. canephora and c. eugenioides.
based on these results, we emphasize gene annotation and discuss plant defenses, abiotic stress and cup quality-related functional categories.
c. arabica has lower genetic diversity and results in a higher quality beverage than c. canephora.
assembling the expressed sequence tags  of c. arabica and c. canephora produced by the brazilian coffee genome project and the nestl√©-cornell consortium revealed  <dig>  clusters of c. arabica and  <dig>  clusters of c. canephora.
hierarchical clustering was used to independently group c. arabica and c. canephora expression clusters according to expression data extracted from est libraries, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed genes.
we present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study of c. arabica and c. canephora, which can be freely assessed by the scientific community at http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/coffea.
using ka/ks analysis, we identified coffee genes under purifying and positive selection.
coffea arabica and c. canephora are responsible for  <dig> and 30% of commercial production, respectively.
developmental traits, providing valuable insights for coffee breeding and biotechnology, especially concerning sugar metabolism and stress tolerance.
among the interesting families annotated are new cystatins, glycine-rich proteins and ralf-like peptides.
orthomcl was used to identify specific and prevalent coffee protein families when compared to five other plant species.
