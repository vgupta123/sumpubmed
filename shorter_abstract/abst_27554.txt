using bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite conversion of dna, we have performed multiplexed targeted sequencing to analyse several kilobases of genomic dna in up to  <dig> samples, and achieved high coverage data of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine at single-base resolution.
here, we present a cost-effective and versatile methodology for the analysis of dna methylation in targeted genomic regions, which comprises multiplexed, pcr-based preparation of bisulfite dna libraries followed by customized miseq sequencing.
our results demonstrate the ability of this methodology to detect all levels of cytosine modifications at greater than 100Ã— coverage in large sample sets at low cost compared to other targeted methods.
epigenetic modifications of dna, such as 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine, play important roles in development and disease.
