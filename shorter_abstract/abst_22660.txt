translation initiation factors of the 4e and 4g protein families mediate resistance to several rna plant viruses in the natural diversity of crops.
a high conservation of eif4e exonic regions was found, with six polymorphic sites identified out of ecotilling  <dig> accessions.
was characterised for susceptibility to mnsv and cucumber vein yellowing virus  and used for the implementation of ecotilling to identify new allelic variants of eif4e.
we have also characterized a new allele of eif4e from cucumis zeyheri, a wild relative of melon.
sequencing of regions surrounding polymorphisms revealed that all of them corresponded to silent nucleotide changes and just one to a non-silent change correlating with mnsv resistance.
this study shows the applicability of ecotilling in cucumis spp., but given the conservation of eif4e, new candidate genes should probably be considered to identify new sources of resistance to plant viruses.
functional analyses suggested that this new eif4e allele might be responsible for resistance to mnsv.
part of the methodology described here could alternatively be used in tilling experiments that serve to generate new eif4e alleles.
except for the mnsv case, no correlation was found between variation of eif4e and virus resistance, suggesting the implication of different and/or additional genes in previously identified resistance phenotypes.
