the increased antimicrobial activity against virulent fungal strains without altering the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis observed in mssn1-overexpressing alfalfa transgenic plants opens the way to the production of effective legume transgenic cultivars for biotic stress resistance.
the results reported here suggest that snakin peptides have important and ancestral roles in land plant innate immunity.
the production of antimicrobial peptides is a common defense strategy of living cells against a wide range of pathogens.
our data indicate a coevolutionary process, in which alfalfa exerts a selection pressure for resistance to mssn <dig> on rhizobial bacteria.

plant snakin peptides inhibit bacterial and fungal growth at extremely low concentrations.
the antimicrobial activity of mssn <dig> against bacterial and fungal pathogens of alfalfa was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.
phylogenetic analysis showed complete congruence between snakin- <dig> and plant trees.
however, mssn <dig> did not affect nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains only when these had an alfalfa origin.
transgenic alfalfa overexpressing mssn <dig> showed increased antimicrobial activity against virulent fungal strains.
