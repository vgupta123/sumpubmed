thirteen unrelated strains of n. lactamica were investigated using comparative genome hybridization to the pan-neisseria microarray-v <dig>  which contains  <dig> unique gene probes.
neisseria meningitidis causes the life-threatening diseases meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia.
further, a related species, neisseria lactamica is not associated with either type of infection in normally healthy people, and lives as a harmless commensal.
the presence of  <dig> 'virulence genes' was specifically addressed; of these  <dig> are present in n. lactamica.
assessment of the complete dataset revealed that the vast majority of genes present in the pathogens are also present in n. lactamica.
of the  <dig>  probes to genes shared by all four pathogenic genome sequences,  <dig>  hybridize to n. lactamica.
these shared genes cannot include genes that are necessary and sufficient for the virulence of the pathogens, since n. lactamica does not share this behaviour.
neisseria gonorrhoeae is closely related to the meningococcus, but is the cause of the very different infection, gonorrhea.
we have determined which of the genes so far identified in the genome sequences of the pathogens are also present in this non-pathogenic related species.
