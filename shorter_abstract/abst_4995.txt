we have compared the degradomes of zebra finch, chicken and several mammalian species, with the finding of multiple differences which illustrate the evolution of the protease complement of these organisms.
this analysis revealed important differences in the evolution of mammalian and bird degradomes, including genomic expansions and deletions of caspases, cytotoxic proteases, kallikreins, matrix metalloproteases, and trypsin-like proteases.
detailed analysis of these changes in zebra finch proteases has shown that they are mainly related to immunological, developmental, reproductive and neural functions.
therefore, the sequencing of the zebra finch genome allows the comparison between the degradomes of mammals and birds and may help to understand the biological peculiarities of the zebra finch.
a set of curated protease sequences from humans and chicken was used to predict the sequences of  <dig> protease and protease-like genes in the zebra finch genome.
furthermore, we found several zebra finch-specific features, such as duplications in casp <dig> and bace, and a large genomic expansion of acrosin.
