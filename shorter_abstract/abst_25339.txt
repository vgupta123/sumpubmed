cnidoin is expressed in nematocytes of all types and immunostainings revealed incorporation into capsule walls and tubules concomitant with minicollagens.
similar to spider silk proteins, to which it is related at sequence level, cnidoin possesses high elasticity and fast coiling propensity as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations and quantified by force spectroscopy.
recombinant cnidoin showed a high tendency for spontaneous aggregation to bundles of fibrillar structures.
here, we characterise cnidoin, a novel elastic protein identified as a structural component of hydra nematocysts.
hitherto, the molecular basis for the unusual biomechanical properties of nematocysts has been elusive, as their structure was mainly defined as a stress-resistant collagenous matrix.
