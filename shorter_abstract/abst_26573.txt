however, a substantial amount of the species diversity, relationships, habitats, and life strategies of these microorganisms remain to be discovered and characterized.
for most of the basidiomycota genera, the three genomic markers performed similarly, i.e., when one was considered a good marker for the identification of a genus, the others were also; the same results were observed when the performance was insufficient.
however, based on barcode gap analyses, we identified genomic markers that had a superior identification performance than the others and genomic markers that were not indicated for the identification of some genera.
our study provides information that may guide researchers in choosing the most suitable genomic markers for identifying basidiomycota species.
the nrits region is considered the universal barcode of fungi, and the its <dig> and its <dig> sub-regions have been applied as metabarcoding markers.
notably, neither the complete its nor the sub-regions were useful in identifying  <dig> of the  <dig> basidiomycota genera.
the complex phylogenetic relationships and the presence of cryptic species in some genera are possible explanations of this limitation and are discussed.
later, dna barcoding has emerged as a new method for the rapid and reliable identification of species.
knowledge regarding the efficiency and limitations of the barcode markers that are currently used for the identification of organisms is crucial because it benefits research in many areas.
