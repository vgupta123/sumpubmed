light and electron microscopic analyses of whrn knockout mice reveal bead-like swellings in cerebellar purkinje axons containing mitochondria and vesicles by both.
whrn likely contributes to the stabilization of paranodal myelin loops and axonal cytoskeleton through yet unconfirmed cytoskeletal proteins.
a significant lack of knowledge remains as to cytoskeletal proteins which stabilize paranodal domains and underlying cytoskeleton.
here we demonstrate that loss of whrn disrupts proper axonal domain organization.
in conclusion, our observations suggest that whrn is not required for the organization of axonal domains, but once organized, whrn acts as a cytoskeletal linker to ensure proper paranodal compaction and stabilization of the axonal cytoskeleton in myelinated axons.
without proper organization, electrical nerve conduction is delayed, resulting in detrimental physiological outcomes.
comparing wild-type mice to whrn knockout  mice, we observed no significant differences in the expression of standard axonal domain markers by immunoblot analysis but observed and quantified a novel paranodal compaction phenotype in  <dig> to 8 week-old whrn−/− nerves.
whirlin  is a pdz domain-containing cytoskeletal scaffold whose absence in humans results in usher syndromes or variable deafness-blindness syndromes.
domain organization in myelinated axons remains a complex developmental process.
rt-pcr and immunoblot analyses revealed expression of whrn mrna and whrn full-length protein, respectively, in several stages of central and peripheral nervous system development.
the paranodal compaction phenotype and associated cytoskeletal disruption was observed in whrn−/− mutant sciatic nerves and spinal cord fibers from early  to late  stages of development.
paranodal abnormalities are consistently observed throughout development  and similar between central and peripheral nervous systems.
