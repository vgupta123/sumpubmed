we now complement this work with ciruvis, a web-based tool for the construction of rule networks from classifiers made of if-then rules.
rule networks enable a fast method for model visualization and provide an exploratory heuristic to interaction detection.
furthermore, we used the rule networks to identify feature interactions, compared them to alternative methods, and computationally validated the findings.
simulated and biological data served as an illustration of how the tool may be used to visualize and interpret classifiers.
