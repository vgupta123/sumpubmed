we constructed a phylogenetic tree of a. westerdijkiae and eight other sequenced aspergillus species and found that the sister group of a. westerdijkiae was the a. oryzae - a. flavus clade.

by combining comparative analysis with kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes , conserved domains database , and pfam annotations, we predicted  <dig> potential carbohydrate-active enzymes related to plant polysaccharide degradation .
in particular, for the ota-related sm gene clusters, we delivered their components with domain and pathway annotations.
to understand the genetic factors underlying its pathogenicity, enzymatic degradation, and secondary metabolism, we analysed the whole genome of a. westerdijkiae and compared it with eight other sequenced aspergillus species.
we sequenced the complete genome of a. westerdijkiae and assembled approximately 36 mb of its genomic dna, in which we identified  <dig>  putative protein-coding genes.
we found a large number of secondary biosynthetic gene clusters, which suggested that a. westerdijkiae had a remarkable capacity to produce secondary metabolites.
the genomic information obtained in this study is valuable for understanding the life cycle and pathogenicity of a. westerdijkiae.
this study sets the stage for experimental verification of the biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms of ota and for the discovery of new secondary metabolites.
it is responsible for the contamination of agricultural crops, fruits, and food commodities, as its secondary metabolite ota poses a potential threat to animals and humans.
