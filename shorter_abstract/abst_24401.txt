phylogenetic methods are well-established bioinformatic tools for sequence analysis, allowing to describe the non-independencies of sequences because of their common ancestor.
the tools implemented by b2n allow to describe and visualize in a new way some of the evolutionary features of plasmid molecules of enterobacteriaceae; in particular it helped to shed some light on the complex history of escherichia, salmonella and shigella plasmids and to focus on possible roles of unannotated proteins.
actually, they can be transferred among different organisms allowing the dissemination of novel functions, thus playing a pivotal role in prokaryotic evolution.
the proposed methodology is general enough to be used for comparative genomic analyses of bacteria.
in this context, plasmid sequences are paradigms of network-like relationships characterizing the evolution of prokaryotes.
to overcome such limitations we developed a bioinformatic package, named blast2network , allowing the automatic phylogenetic profiling and the visualization of homology relationships in a large number of plasmid sequences.
however, the study of their evolutionary dynamics is complicated by the absence of universally shared genes, a prerequisite for phylogenetic analyses.
