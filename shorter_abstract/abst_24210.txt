here we present a new algorithm, seed extension , for generating the sequence alignment from a pair of superimposed structures.
generating sequence alignments from superimposed structures is an important part of many structure comparison programs.
many programs use a dynamic programming algorithm to generate the sequence alignment from superimposed structures.
the manually curated alignments in the conserved domain database were used as the standard to assess the quality of the sequence alignments.
the seed extension algorithm is fast and, without using a gap penalty, produces more accurate sequence alignments from superimposed structures than three other programs tested that use dynamic programming algorithm.
however, this procedure requires using a gap penalty and, depending on the value of the penalty used, can introduce spurious gaps and misalignments.
se gave an average accuracy of  <dig> % over  <dig> pairs of superimposed proteins tested, while chimera, lsqman, and dp extracted from sheba, which all use a dynamic programming algorithm, yielded  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
when the se algorithm was implemented in sheba to replace the dynamic programming routine, the alignment accuracy improved by 10% on average for structure pairs with rmsd between  <dig> and  <dig> Ã…. se also used considerably less cpu time than dp.
for pairs of proteins with low sequence or structural similarity, se produced alignments up to 18% more accurate on average than the next best scoring program.
the se algorithm first finds "seeds", which are the pairs of residues, one from each structure, that meet certain stringent criteria for being structurally equivalent.
