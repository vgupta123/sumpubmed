an nadh dehydrogenase, the atp synthase, and several tca cycle enzymes were among the best conserved in the genomes.
the results showed that enzymes for acetate transport and oxidation, and for proton transport across the inner membrane were well conserved.
these results indicate there is a common pathway for acetate oxidation and energy generation across the family and in the last common ancestor.
they also suggest that while cytochromes are important for extracellular electron transport, the path of electrons across the periplasm and outer membrane is variable.
here we present comparative analysis of six geobacter genomes, including species from the clade that predominates in the subsurface.
study of geobacter sulfurreducens has shown that tca cycle enzymes, inner-membrane respiratory enzymes, and periplasmic and outer-membrane cytochromes are required.
this combination of abundant cytochromes with weak sequence conservation suggests they may not be specific terminal reductases, but rather may be important in their heme-bearing capacity, as sinks for electrons between the inner-membrane electron transport chain and the extracellular acceptor.
conservation of proteins across the genomes was determined to better understand the evolution of geobacter species and to create a metabolic model applicable to subsurface environments.
geobacter species grow by transferring electrons out of the cell - either to fe-oxides or to man-made substances like energy-harvesting electrodes.
