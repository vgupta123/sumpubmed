the effects of replicator mobility and metabolite diffusion on different aspects of replicator coexistence in mrm are determined, including the maximum attainable size of the metabolic replicator system and its resistance to the invasion of parasitic replicators.
using our surface-bound rna world model – the metabolic replicator model  platform – we show that the mobilities on the mineral substrate surface of both the macromolecular replicators and the small molecules of metabolites they produce catalytically are the key factors determining the stable persistence of an evolvable metabolic replicator community.
the necessary spatial constraints might have been supplied by mineral surfaces initially, preceding the more effective compartmentalization in membrane vesicles which must have been a later development of chemical evolution.
