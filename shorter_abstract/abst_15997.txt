these results suggest that hrp  <dig> exon ii contains immunogenic sites similar to those of the native antigen and can be used for the development of mabs suitable for malaria diagnosis in endemic communities.
the recombinant protein was expressed in soluble form in e. coli and used to immunize mice for mab production.
two igg <dig> mabs  with high affinity, specificity and sensitivity for both native and recombinant hrp  <dig> were selected after fusion of mouse spleen with myeloma cells.
subsequently, an immunochromatograhic assay was used for screening of clinical samples in endemic regions of china and myanmar.
histidine-rich protein  <dig>  is the major protein released into human blood upon infection by plasmodium falciparum.
the immunochromatographic test retrospectively showed an overall sensitivity of  <dig> %, and specificity of 100%.
