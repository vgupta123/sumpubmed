this study examined nine adult cattle with persistently high antibody responses to s. dublin o-antigen based lipopolysaccharide for cultivable bacteria in faeces, milk and internal organs before and after transportation, isolation and experimental immunosuppression with dexamethasone sodium phosphate over a period of 7– <dig> days.
the bacterium can cause subclinical persistent infection in cattle , which may be reactivated.
the study questions the general conception that cattle with persistently high antibody levels against s. dublin o-antigens in naturally infected herds should be considered high risk for transmission and therefore culled as part of effective intervention strategies.
however, this has been questioned by other studies in which s. dublin were not found in all animals suspected of being carriers based on antibody measurements when such animals were examined at slaughter.
no shedding of s. dublin was found in faeces  or milk  at any point in time during the 7– <dig> day period.
s. dublin was recovered by a conventional culture method from tissue samples from mammary lymph nodes, spleen and liver collected from three animals at necropsy.
in this study, immunosuppression by transportation stress or dexamethasone treatment did not lead to excretion of s. dublin in milk or faeces from infected animals.
it is suggested that the location of s. dublin infected foci in the animal plays a major role for the risk of excreting bacteria.
some authors suggest that persistently high antibody levels in serum or milk is indicative of a carrier state in cattle.
salmonella dublin  is a zoonotic bacterium which is host adapted to cattle.
identification of such carriers is assumed to be critical in attempts to control and eradicate the infection.
clear signs of immunosuppression were seen as expression of leucocytosis and neutrophilia in all animals on day 3– <dig> after the first injections with dexamethasone sodium phosphate.
