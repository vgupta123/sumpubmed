food allergy is a serious health concern among infants and young children.
although immunological mechanism of food allergy is well documented, the molecular mechanism involved in food allergen sensitization have not been well characterized.
microarray studies identified several differentially expressed genes in the sensitization phase of the food allergy.
these findings will help to better understand the underlying molecular mechanism of food allergen sensitizations and may be useful in identifying the potential biomarkers of food allergy.
therefore, the present study analyzed the mesenteric lymph node  transcriptome profiles of balb/c mice in response to three common food allergens.
immunological profiles indicate that the allergen dosages used are sufficient to sensitize the balb/c mice and to conduct transcriptome profiling.
treatment with ova and pna significantly induced plasma histamine concentrations .
the expression of seven representative genes from microarray experiment was validated by real-time rt-pcr.
microarray analysis identified a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in response to Î²-lactoglobulin  from cow's milk, ovalbumin  from hen's egg white and peanut agglutinin  sensitizations, respectively .
