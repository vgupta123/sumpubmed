we found that both of the lamprey mc receptors were expressed in skin, while the mcb receptor was also found in liver, heart and skeletal muscle.
they belong to the rhodopsin family of g protein-coupled receptors .
the lamprey mca receptor had relatively high affinity for acth derived peptides similarly to the fish mc receptors.
expression and pharmacological characterization showed that the lamprey mca receptor was able to bind and be activated by both lamprey and human msh peptides.
the purpose of this study was to identify ancestral mc receptors in agnathan, river lamprey.
we report cloning of two mc receptors from river lamprey.
this study shows presence of mc receptors in agnathans indicating early signs of specific functions of melanocortin receptor subtypes.
the lamprey receptors, designated mca and mcb, showed orthology to the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptor subtypes, respectively.
the molecular clock analysis suggested that lamprey mc receptor genes were not duplicated recently and diverged from each other more than  <dig> myr ago.
