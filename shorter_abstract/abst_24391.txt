it is essentially an efficient implementation of the switching neural network model and reaches excellent classification accuracy while keeping low the computational demand.
classification accuracy can be improved by combining information from different markers using standard data mining techniques, like decision tree , artificial neural network , and k-nearest neighbour  classifier.
concentration of three tumour markers  was measured in the pleural fluid of each patient and a cytological examination was also carried out.
the performance of llm and that of three competing methods  was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.
tumour markers are standard tools for the differential diagnosis of cancer.
finally, llm provided classification rules in a very good agreement with a priori knowledge about the biological role of the considered tumour markers.
however, the occurrence of nonspecific symptoms and different malignancies involving the same cancer site may lead to a high proportion of misclassifications.
logic learning machine  is an innovative method of supervised data analysis capable of building classifiers described by a set of intelligible rules including simple conditions in their antecedent part.
llm is a new flexible tool potentially useful for the differential diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma.
llm was applied to data from a consecutive cohort of  <dig> patients admitted for diagnosis to two pulmonary departments in northern italy from  <dig> to  <dig>  patients included  <dig> malignant pleural mesotheliomas ,  <dig> pleural metastases  from other tumours and  <dig> benign diseases  associated with pleurisies.
