all phylogenetic methods support the placement of enhydris plumbea outside of the  cluster, providing mitochondrial genomic evidence for the familial rank of homalopsidae.
previous studies on mitochondrial genomes of snakes have demonstrated duplication of the control region and translocation of trnl to be two notable features of the alethinophidian  mtdnas.
comparative analyses with other snake mitochondrial genomes allowed us to summarize six types of mitochondrial gene arrangement in snakes.
after the divergence of the early ramphotyphlops lineage, three types of rearrangements occurred.
phylogenetic reconstruction with commonly used methods of phylogenetic inference  arrived at a similar topology, which was used to reconstruct the evolution of mitochondrial gene arrangements in snakes.
despite abundant analyses of morphological characters, molecular studies using mitochondrial and nuclear genes are limited.
the gene arrangement in ramphotyphlops braminus mtdna is inferred to be ancestral for snakes.
the phylogenetic relationships among the major families of snakes are in accordance with the mitochondrial genomes in terms of gene arrangements.
our purpose is to further investigate the gene organizations, evolution of the snake mitochondrial genome, and phylogenetic relationships among several major snake families.
the mitochondrial genomes were sequenced for four taxa representing four different families, and each had a different gene arrangement.
these changes involve translocations within the iqm trna gene cluster and the duplication of the cr.
