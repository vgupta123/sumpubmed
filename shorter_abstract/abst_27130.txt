apart from single nucleotide polymorphism , copy number variation  is another important type of genetic variation, which may affect growth traits and play key roles for the production of beef cattle.
to date, no genome-wide association study  for cnv and body traits in beef cattle has been reported, so the present study aimed to investigate this type of association in one of the most important cattle subspecies: bos indicus .
the gene overlapping with cnv <dig>  kcnj <dig>  is a functional candidate for muscle development and plays critical roles in muscling traits.

we have used intensity data from over  <dig>  snp probes across the bovine genome to detect common cnvs in a sample of  <dig> nellore cattle, and performed gwas between the detected cnvs and nine growth traits.
this study presents the first cnv-based gwas of growth traits using high density snp microarray data in cattle.
we detected  <dig> cnvs significantly associated with seven growth traits and one of them  may be involved in growth traits through kcnj <dig>
there were  <dig> significant associations identified among  <dig> cnvs and seven body traits after false discovery rate correction .
