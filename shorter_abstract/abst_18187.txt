we show that a group of mirnas and tasirnas orchestrates the expression of target genes involved in n. attenuataâ€™s responses to herbivore attack.
moreover, cdna microarray analysis indicated that the expression patterns of the corresponding target genes were correlated with the accumulation of mirnas and tasirnas.
we characterized the response of the precursor and mature mirnas to simulated attack from the specialist herbivore manduca sexta by quantitative pcr analysis and used ir-aoc rnai transformants, deficient in jasmonate biosynthesis, to identify jasmonate-dependent and -independent mirna regulation.
however, the role of mirnas in responses to insect herbivory has not been thoroughly explored.
expression analysis revealed that groups of mirnas and tasirnas were specifically regulated by either mechanical wounding or wounding plus oral secretions from m. sexta larvae, and these small rnas were accumulated in jasmonate-dependent or -independent manners.
