here we demonstrate that subcutaneous-administration of a read-through inducing compound  to an intermediate sma model  had beneficial effects on muscle fiber size and gross motor function.
spinal muscular atrophy  is the leading genetic cause of infantile death.
there is a nearly identical copy gene, smn <dig>  but it is unable to rescue from disease due to an alternative splicing event that excises a necessary exon  from the majority of smn2-derived transcripts.
delivery of the read-through inducing compound tc <dig> reduces the disease-associated phenotype in sma mice, however, does not significantly extend survival.
