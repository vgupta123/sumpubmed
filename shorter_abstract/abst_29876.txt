future work will examine the expression of these mirnas in different colour pattern races and identify mirna targets among wing patterning genes.
heliconius butterflies are an excellent system for studies of adaptive convergent and divergent phenotypic traits.
we sequenced small rna libraries from two colour pattern races and detected  <dig> heliconius mirnas with homology to others found in mirbase.
wing colour patterns are used as signals to both predators and potential mates and are inherited in a mendelian manner.
micrornas  are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have key roles in many biological processes, including development.
these candidates were tested further using northern blots, showing that differences in expression were primarily due to developmental stage rather than colour pattern.
a search for mirnas in all available h. melpomene bac sequences  did not reveal any other mirnas and no novel mirnas were predicted.
for this reason we characterised mirnas in developing butterfly wings and examined differences in their expression between colour pattern races.
several highly abundant mirnas were differentially represented in the libraries between colour pattern races.
assembly of sequenced reads to the hmyb region identified hme-mir- <dig> and hme-mir-2788; located  <dig> bp apart in an intergenic region.
two mirnas were located in the hmyb region and were expressed in developing pupal wings.
in heliconius melpomene, the yellow hindwing bar is controlled by the hmyb locus.
mirnas could act as regulators of genes involved in wing development, patterning and pigmentation.
these two mirnas are expressed in wings and show an upregulation between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-pupation, indicating a potential role in butterfly wing development.
some show differences in expression across developing pupal stages and may have important functions in butterfly wing development.
