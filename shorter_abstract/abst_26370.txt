user-dependent technical variation, including pipette inaccuracy and specific sources of sample heterogeneity, leads to a steep increase in uncertainty of estimated concentrations.
we reveal how system-specific technical factors influence accuracy as well as precision of concentration estimates.
users can discover this through replicate experiments and derived variance estimation.
besides clever choices of sample dilution levels, experiment-specific tuning of machine settings can greatly improve results.
corresponding uncertainty may be controlled with an adapted experimental design.

finally, the detection performance can be improved by optimizing the fluorescence intensity cut point as suboptimal thresholds reduce the accuracy of concentration estimates considerably.
these stem from both technical and biological factors, where we distinguish features that are 1) hard-wired in the equipment, 2) user-dependent and 3) provided by manufacturers but may be adapted by the user.
