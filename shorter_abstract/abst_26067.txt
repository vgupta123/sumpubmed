the product of the drab gene, located downstream in the dratgb operon, may be involved in the regulation of nitrogenase activity by an, as yet, unknown mechanism.
in a. brasilense nitrogenase activity is regulated by the products of drag and drat.
a deep in silico analysis of the product of drab was undertaken aiming at suggesting its possible function and involvement with drat and drag in the regulation of nitrogenase activity in a. brasilense.
proclat was applied to this case study and the results revealed that the a. brasilense drab gene codes for a protein highly similar to the nitrogenase associated nifo protein of azotobacter vinelandii.

this tool allowed the reclassification of drab/nifo homologous proteins, hypothetical, conserved hypothetical and those annotated as putative arsenate reductase, arsc, as nifo-like.
since nitrogen fixation has a high-energy demand, the reduction of n <dig> to nh4
an analysis of co-occurrence of drab, drat, drag and of other nif genes was performed, suggesting the involvement of drab  in nitrogen fixation, however, without the definition of a specific function.
in this work, we present a new artificial intelligence strategy for protein classification, named proclat.
+ by nitrogenase occurs only under limiting conditions of nh4
the features used by the pattern recognition model were derived from the primary structure of the drab homologous proteins, calculated by a proclat internal algorithm.
