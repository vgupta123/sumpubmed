the results showed that, compared to control piglets, treatment with arg decreased inflammatory reactions caused by weaning.
twelve healthy landrace × yorkshire piglets that had been weaned at  <dig> d  were randomly divided into a control group and an arg group .
the immunohistochemical localization of hsp <dig> in liver revealed strong expression in the arg group.
at age  <dig> d, all of the piglets were slaughtered to obtain liver samples to determine hsp <dig> expression by real-time pcr, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
