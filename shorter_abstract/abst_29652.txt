studies have shown that decreased ampk activity is associated with obesity and type ii diabetes, while ampk activity is increased with metabolically favorable conditions and cholesterol lowering drugs.
the ultimate outcome of par <dig> activation depended on the cell type studied; in cultured fibroblasts with low endogenous β-arrestins, par <dig> activated ampk; however, in primary fat and liver, par <dig> only activated ampk in β-arrestin-2-/- mice.
these results suggest a role for β-arrestin in the inhibition of ampk signaling, raising the possibility that β-arrestin-dependent par <dig> signaling may act as a molecular switch turning a positive signal to ampk into an inhibitory one.
proteinase-activated-receptor- <dig>  is a seven transmembrane receptor that can activate two separate signaling arms: one through gαq and ca2+ mobilization, and a second through recruitment of β-arrestin scaffolds.
