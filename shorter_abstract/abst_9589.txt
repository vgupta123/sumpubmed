there is no specific treatment available for japanese encephalitis, and vaccination is the only effective way to prevent jev infection in humans and domestic animals.
cell culture fluid containing the jev-vlp antigen could be harvested five to seven times continuously at intervals of 4– <dig> days while maintaining the culture.
cell line bj-me can stably produces a secreted form of japanese encephalitis virus virus-like particle  which contains the jev envelope glycoprotein  and membrane protein .
japanese encephalitis virus  is the most important cause of epidemic encephalitis in most asian regions.
the amount of jev-vlp antigen released into the culture fluid of bj-me cells was as high as 15–20 μg/ml.
mice immunized with the jev-vlp antigen with or without adjuvant developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies and 100% protection against lethal jev challenge.
these results suggest that the recombinant jev-vlp antigen produced by the bj-me cell line is an effective, safe and affordable subunit japanese encephalitis vaccine candidate, especially for domestic animals such as pig and horse.
the bj-me cells were engineered by transfecting bhk- <dig> cells with a code-optimized cdna encoding jev prm and e protein expression plasmid.
we generated a new cell clone  that stably produces a secreted form of japanese encephalitis virus  virus-like particle .

the purpose of this study is to establish a new mammalian cell line stably and efficiently expressing virus-like particle of jev for potential use of jev subunit vaccine.
