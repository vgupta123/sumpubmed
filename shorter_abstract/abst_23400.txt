due to the computational complexity, most approaches for grn reconstruction are limited on a small number of genes and low connectivity of the underlying networks.
furthermore, we present the efficient block pca method for searching communities in grns.
identifying gene regulatory network  from time course gene expression data has attracted more and more attentions.
we propose the network and community identification  method for identifying multiple subnetworks from gene expression data by incorporating community structure information into grn inference.
the nci method is effective in identifying multiple subnetworks in a large-scale grn.
