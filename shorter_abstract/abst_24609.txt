finally, we use a global robustness analysis method based on semi-definite programming to evaluate the modification of the bistable steady states induced by multiple parametric variations throughout bounded regions of the parameter space.
we show how a control-theoretic analysis of the robustness of a model of the gal regulatory network may be used to establish the modelâ€™s plausibility in characterizing the persistent memory of different carbon sources, without the need for extensive simulations.
our analysis provides convincing evidence for the robustness, and hence plausibility, of the gal regulatory network model.
a crucial requirement for any plausible mechanistic model of this system is that it reproduces the robustness of the bistable response observed in vivo against inter-individual parametric variability and fluctuating environmental conditions.
the robustness of each of the two operative conditions against fluctuations of the species concentrations is demonstrated by studying the domains of attraction of the corresponding equilibrium points.
