genetic distance analysis was used to identify differences among provinces, with the strongest correlations seen between landraces from herat and ghor province, followed closely by those between badakhshan and takhar provinces.
the recent development of array based marker systems, particularly single nucleotide polymorphism  markers, provide an excellent tool for examining the genetic diversity of local populations.
landraces are an important source of genetic diversity in common wheat, but archival collections of afghan wheat landraces remain poorly characterised.
here we used snp analysis to demonstrate the importance of afghan wheat landraces and found tremendous genetic diversity and province-specific characteristics unique to this geographic region.
the snp analyses presented here highlight the importance and genetic diversity of afghan wheat landraces.

this result closely resembles existing agro-climatic zones within afghanistan, as well as the wheat varieties commonly cultivated within these regions.
a total of  <dig> afghan wheat landraces were analysed using genotype by sequencing  arrays containing ~10 k unique markers.
taken together, these analyses can be used to help improve wheat cultivation in afghanistan, while providing insights into the evolution and selective pressures underlying these distinct landraces.
population-based analyses revealed an additional  <dig> sub-populations within our germplasm, and significant correlations were evident in both the provincial and botanical varieties.
from these analyses, we were able to divide the landraces into  <dig> major classes, with the greatest degree of diversity evident among landraces isolated from badakhshan province.
