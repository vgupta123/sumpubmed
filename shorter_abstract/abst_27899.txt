specific issues affecting the analysis and interpretation of simulation data are investigated, including:  the effect of time interval on data presentation and time-weighted averaging of molecule numbers,  effect of time averaging interval on reaction rate analysis,  effect of number of simulations on precision of model predictions, and  implications of stochastic simulations on optimization procedures.
in recent years, several stochastic simulation algorithms have been developed to generate monte carlo trajectories that describe the time evolution of the behavior of biomolecular reaction networks.
the two main factors affecting the analysis of stochastic simulations are:  the selection of time intervals to compute or average state variables and  the number of simulations generated to evaluate the system behavior.
however, the effects of various stochastic simulation and data analysis conditions on the observed dynamics of complex biomolecular reaction networks have not recieved much attention.
