we describe homolmapper, a command-line application for mapping information from a multiple protein sequence alignment onto a protein structure for analysis in the viewing software of the user's choice.
homolmapper also provides tools for defining and analyzing subfamilies relative to a larger alignment, for mutual information analysis, and for rapidly visualizing the locations of mutations and multi-residue motifs.
most recent software implementations for such analysis are tied to specific molecular viewing programs, which can be problematic for collaborations involving multiple viewing environments.
homolmapper is a useful tool for analysis of homology relationships among proteins in a structural context.
over the past decade, a number of tools have emerged for the examination of homology relationships among protein sequences in a structural context.
