for example, gene expression data has been analyzed to reveal novel disease subtypes  and assign particular samples to well-defined classes .
the results demonstrate that our method not only can reveal the subtle structures underlying those cancer gene expression data but also can accurately predict the class labels of unknown cancer samples.
we propose a unified computational framework for class discovery and class prediction to facilitate the discovery and prediction of subtle subtypes of cancers.
we propose a novel convex optimization model to perform class discovery and class prediction in a unified framework.
our method can be generally applied to multiple types of measurements, e.g., gene expression profiling, proteomic measuring, and recent next-generation sequencing, since it only requires the similarities among samples as input.
we then applied otcc to acute leukemia and breast cancer datasets.
gene expression profiling technologies have gradually become a community standard tool for clinical applications.
