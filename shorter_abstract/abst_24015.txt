recent studies have indicated that the extended c-termini of the mammalian crys, as compared to photolyase proteins, interact with per proteins.
cryptochromes  are a class of flavoprotein blue-light signaling receptors found in plants and animals, and they control plant development and the entrainment of circadian rhythms.
we identified a region on mcry <dig>  responsible for direct physical interaction with mper <dig> by mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays.
our results identify mcry <dig> amino acid residues that interact with the mper <dig> binding region and suggest the potential for rational drug design to inhibit crys for specific therapeutic approaches.
