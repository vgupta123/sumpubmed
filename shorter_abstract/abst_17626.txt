<dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> individual sequences were classified as novel mirnas, including mirna* species of  <dig> known mirnas.
neuroblastoma  is an embryonal tumour consisting of neural crest-derived undifferentiated cells and is characterised by variable clinical courses ranging from spontaneous regression to therapy-resistant progression.
however, the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in nbs is not available.
recent advances identified a subset of mirnas with putative function in nb biology.
some of these newly identified sequences reside within frequently altered chromosomal regions in nb tumours and may play a role in nb biology.
