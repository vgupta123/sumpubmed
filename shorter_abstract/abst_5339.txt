this is supported by the close relationship from the voltage clamp data, through the quantitative simulation, to the action potential threshold, changing the properties of neurons in a rhythmic network.
the ionic currents evoked by voltage steps were recorded using 2-electrode voltage clamp.
the increase in inward sodium current provides an explanation for the polycyclic modulation of the feeding system by the octopamine-containing interneurons, making feeding easier to initiate and making the feeding bursts more intense.
the excitability of the b <dig> and b <dig> motoneurons in the buccal ganglia to depolarising current clamp pulses is significantly  increased by  octopamine, whereas the b <dig> motoneuron becomes significantly less excitable.
the fast inward current was eliminated in sodium â€“ free saline and so is likely to be carried by sodium ions.
a hodgkin-huxley style simulation of the b <dig> motoneuron confirms that a 33% increase in the fast inward current by octopamine increases the excitability markedly.
