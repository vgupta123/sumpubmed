gonadectomy or sex steroid replacement did not alter bdnf or trkb mrna levels in young adult male rat or rhesus macaque hippocampus.
first,  we sought to localize the site of synthesis of the full length and truncated trkb receptor in the neurogenic regions of the adolescent rhesus macaque hippocampus.
we find that truncated trkb mrna+ cells are highly abundant in the proliferative subgranular zone  of the primate hippocampus; in addition, there are scant and scattered full length trkb mrna+ cells in this region.
next,  we asked if gonadectomy or sex hormone replacement altered hippocampal bdnf and trkb expression level in mammalian hippocampus , and  if the relationship between bdnf/trkb expression was altered depending on the sex steroid environment.
however, bdnf/trkb mrna appears to have a greater link to cell proliferation in the presence of circulating testosterone.
in the monkey and rat, we find a positive correlation with cell proliferation and trkb-tk+ mrna expression, and this positive relationship was found only when sex steroids were present.
testosterone attenuates postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in adolescent male rhesus macaques through altering neuronal survival.
we suggest that testosterone does not down-regulate neurogenesis at adolescence via overall changes in bdnf or trkb expression.
