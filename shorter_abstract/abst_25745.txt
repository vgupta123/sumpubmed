the infection and colonization process of rhizoctonia during pathogenic interactions is well described.
using microscopic and histopathological techniques, the early steps of the infection process, the colonization process and several host responses were studied.
ranking the ags based on infection rate, level of induced host responses and pectin degradation revealed a strong correlation with the disease severity caused by the ags.
for aggressive rhizoctonia ags , a higher developmental rate was detected for several steps of the infection process, including directed growth along anticlinal cell walls and formation of t-shaped branches, infection cushion formation and stomatal penetration.
histopathological observations indicated that rhizoctonia ags provoked differential host responses and pectin degradation.
all rhizoctonia ags studied penetrated the plant tissue, indicating all constitutive barriers of cauliflower were defeated and differences in aggressiveness were caused by inducible defence responses, including cell wall fortifications with phenolic compounds and callose.
the differences in aggressiveness towards cauliflower observed among rhizoctonia ags correlated with the infection rate, induction of host defence responses and pectin breakdown.
degradation of pectic compounds was observed for all pathogenic ags, except for ag 2- <dig> iiib.
weak or non-aggressive ags  required more time, notwithstanding all ags were able to penetrate cauliflower hypocotyls.
we demonstrated the pronounced deposition of phenolic compounds and callose against weak and non-aggressive ags which resulted in a delay or complete block of the host colonization.
in cauliflower , several anastomosis groups  including both multinucleate r. solani and binucleate rhizoctonia species have been identified showing different levels of aggressiveness.
in this study the interaction of cauliflower with seven r. solani ags and one binucleate rhizoctonia ag differing in aggressiveness, was compared.
in contrast, insights into processes during interactions with weak aggressive or non-pathogenic isolates are limited.
