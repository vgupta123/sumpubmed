this recombinant protein and bprp <dig> were bioassayed using nb <dig> lymphoma cells; it was confirmed that neither ruminant prp had lactogenic activity because the nb <dig> lymphoma cells did not proliferate.
absence of lactogenic activity was confirmed for the oprp <dig> molecule.
it is anticipated that novel and known ruminant prps have common functions, except for lactogenic activity.
we have identified two novel prps, oprp <dig> and oprp <dig>  in ovine placenta.
both oprps were expressed in trophoblast giant binucleate cells  as in cattle and goat.
we cloned two novel ovine prps, named oprp <dig> and oprp <dig>  oprp <dig> had a typical prp sequence similar to bovine prp <dig> .
both these ovine prps were localized and quantitatively expressed in bnc.
oprp <dig> had a short sequence identical with bovine or caprine type prp but the reading frame was shifted.
