genomic and proteonomic sequences can also be linked to the tree and extracted from internal and external nodes.
integrated geographical information allows ancestral character reconstruction for phylogeographic plotting based on parsimony and likelihood algorithms.
file support includes the most popular formats such as newick and csv.
a wide variety of tree visualization and annotation tools have been developed in the past, however none of them are intended for an integrative and comparative analysis.
phylogenetic trees are central to a wide range of biological studies.
treelink is a platform-independent software for linking datasets and sequence files to phylogenetic trees.
our software can successfully integrate phylogenetic trees with different data sources, and perform operations to differentiate and visualize those differences within a tree.
a novel clustering algorithm to simplify trees and display the most divergent clades was also developed, where validation can be achieved using the data integration and classification function.
