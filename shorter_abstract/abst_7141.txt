furthermore, predicting peptides that would bind to a specific mhc alleles would be of tremendous benefit to improve vaccine based therapy and possibly generate antibodies with greater affinity.
the cellular function of a vast majority of proteins is performed through physical interactions with other biomolecules, which, most of the time, are other proteins.
combined with kernel ridge regression and supck, a novel binding pocket kernel, the proposed kernel yields biologically relevant and good prediction accuracy on the pepx database.
modern computational methods have the potential to accelerate and lower the cost of drug and vaccine discovery by selecting potential compounds for testing in silico prior to biological validation.
the kernel incorporates physico-chemical properties of amino acids and elegantly generalizes eight kernels, comprised of the oligo, the weighted degree, the blended spectrum, and the radial basis function.
moreover, generating reliable peptide-protein binding affinities will also improve system biology modelling of interaction pathways.
for the first time, a machine learning predictor is capable of predicting the binding affinity of any peptide to any protein with reasonable accuracy.
we provide a low complexity dynamic programming algorithm for the exact computation of the kernel and a linear time algorithm for itâ€™s approximation.
they are thus an interesting class of therapeutics since they also display strong activity, high selectivity, low toxicity and few drug-drug interactions.
we propose a specialized string kernel for small bio-molecules, peptides and pseudo-sequences of binding interfaces.
peptides represent templates of choice for mimicking a secondary structure in order to modulate protein-protein interaction.
