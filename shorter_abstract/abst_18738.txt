our results suggest that artificial hibernation in the brown tree frog  could reduce microbial diversity, and artificially hibernating frogs tend to harbor core operational taxonomic units that are rarely distributed among nonhibernating frogs.
furthermore, functional predictions via picrust and tax4fun suggested that artificial hibernation has effects on metabolism, disease, signal transduction, bacterial infection, and primary immunodeficiency.
the proportion of pathogenic bacteria is greater in hibernating frogs than that found in nonhibernating frogs.
this natural cycle is also accompanied by a remodeling of the intestinal immune system, which is an aspect of host biology that is both influenced by, and can itself influence, the microbiota.
we infer that artificial hibernation may impose potential effects on primary immunodeficiency and increase the risk of bacterial infections in the brown tree frog.
however, these results were derived from culture-based approaches that only covered a small portion of bacteria in the intestinal tract.

in addition, artificial hibernation increased significantly the relative abundance of the red-leg syndrome-related pathogenic genus citrobacter.
in this study, we use a more comprehensive analysis, including bacterial appearance and functional prediction, to reveal the global changes in gut microbiota during artificial hibernation via high-throughput sequencing technology.
in amphibians, the bacteria in the intestinal tract show a drop in bacterial counts.
