our layout optimization technique fragviz meets these requirements and specifically addresses the visualization of fragmented networks, for which standard algorithms do not consider similarities between unconnected components.
in the experimental study with the leukemia gene networks we demonstrate that fragviz can obtain network layouts which are more interpretable and hold additional information that could not be exposed using classical network layout optimization algorithms.
researchers in systems biology use network visualization to summarize the results of their analysis.
we propose a new network layout optimization technique called fragviz which can incorporate additional information on relations between unconnected network components.
network visualization relies on computational techniques for proper placement of objects under consideration.
