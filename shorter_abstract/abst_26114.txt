reprogrammed cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells  and nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells , are similar in many respects to natural embryonic stem cells .
our data suggest that mirnas play a part in the difference between escs and reprogrammed cells, as well as between mefs and pluripotent cells.
however, previous studies have demonstrated that ipscs retain a gene expression signature that is unique from that of escs, including differences in microrna  expression, while nt-escs are more faithfully reprogrammed cells and have better developmental potential compared with ipscs.
the comparison of differently reprogrammed cells  suggests that several mirnas have key roles in the distinct developmental potential of reprogrammed cells.
the variation of mirna expression in reprogrammed cells derived using different reprogramming strategies suggests different characteristics induced by nuclear transfer and ipsc generation, as well as different developmental potential among nt-escs, ipscs and nt-ipscs.
the results demonstrated that reprogrammed cells  have unique mirna expression patterns compared with escs.
we focused on mirna expression and explored the difference between escs and reprogrammed cells, especially escs and nt-escs.
