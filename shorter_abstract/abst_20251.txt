we used geometric morphometric analyses to investigate the interplay between soil hardness  and allometry  on crania and humeri in this fast-evolving mammalian clade.
in contrast, humeral shape varies less with body size and with soil hardness.
in addition, we found a new case of convergent evolution of incisor procumbency among large-, medium-, and small-sized species inhabiting hard soils.

highly procumbent, tooth-digging rodent skull shapes are often geometric consequences of increased body size.
a good example is subterranean rodents of the genus thomomys, one of the most taxonomically and morphologically diverse mammalian genera.
our findings illustrate how a variety of intrinsic processes, resulting in species-level convergence, could sustain a genus-level range across a variety of extrinsic environments.
this occurs through different combinations of allometric and non-allometric changes, contributing to shape diversity within the genus.
our results show that conflict between morphological function and intrinsic allometric patterning can quickly and differentially alter the rodent skeleton, especially the skull.
counter to earlier suggestions, cranial shape within thomomys does not follow a genus-wide allometric pattern as even regional subpopulations differ in allometric slopes.
larger thomomys species/subspecies tend to have more procumbent cranial shapes with some exceptions, including a small-bodied species inhabiting hard soils.
the strong influence of allometry on cranial shape appears to confirm suggestions that developmental change underlies mammalian cranial shape divergences, but this requires confirmation from ontogenetic studies.
in the hardest soils, both humeral and cranial morphology are derived through large muscle attachment sites and a high degree of procumbency.
