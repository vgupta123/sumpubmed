since recent findings have focussed on podoplanin's potential role as a tumour progression factor, we aimed at identifying regulatory elements conferring pdpn promoter activity.
here, we characterized the molecular mechanism controlling basal pdpn transcription in human osteoblast-like mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells.
these data establish that in human osteoblast-like mg <dig> cells, sp <dig> and sp <dig> stimulate basal pdpn transcription in a concerted, yet independent manner, whereas saos- <dig> cells lack sufficient nuclear sp protein amounts for transcriptional activation.
we cloned and sequenced  <dig> nucleotides from the 5'-flanking region of the pdpn gene and a computational search revealed that the tata and caat box-lacking promoter possesses features of a growth-related gene, such as a gc-rich 5' region and the presence of multiple putative sp <dig>  ap- <dig> and nf- <dig> sites.
concomitantly, treatment with the dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacdr in combination with trichostatin a  downregulated podoplanin mrna levels in mg <dig> cells, and region-specific in vitro methylation of the distal promoter suggested that dna methylation rather enhanced than hindered pdpn transcription in both cell types.
weak pdpn promoter activity of saos- <dig> cells correlated with low sp1/sp <dig> nuclear levels, which was confirmed by sp1/sp <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitations in vivo.
moreover, a highly methylated chromatin conformation of the distal promoter region confers cell-type specific podoplanin upregulation versus saos- <dig> cells.
moreover, methylation-sensitive southern blot analyses and bisulfite sequencing detected strong methylation of cpg sites upstream of bp - <dig> in mg <dig> cells, but hypomethylation of these sites in saos- <dig> cells.
deletion studies demonstrated the functional importance of two sp1/sp <dig> sites for pdpn promoter activity.
