the proteins were easily immobilized via ionic tags onto ionic exchange resins and could thus be purified by direct capture from crude protein extracts.
the fusions were designed so their surfaces were charged under enzyme reaction conditions, which allowed isolation and immobilization in a single step, through a simple capture with either an anionic or a cationic exchanger  that electrostatically bound the 5d or 5r tag.
two sequential enzymes in the production of sialic acids, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase  and n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid aldolase , were overexpressed as double-tagged gene fusions.
double-tagged gene fusions were overexpressed to yield two enzymes that perform sequential steps in sialic acid synthesis.
both fusion proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli and retained enzymatic activity.
both were tagged with glutathione s-transferase  at the n-terminus, but at the c-terminus, one was tagged with five contiguous aspartate residues , and the other with five contiguous arginine residues .
the immobilized, double-tagged proteins were effective for one-pot enzymatic production of sialic acid.
combined use of the fusion proteins led to the production of n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid  from n-acetyl-d-glucosamine .
