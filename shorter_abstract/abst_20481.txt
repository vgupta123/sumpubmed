evolutionary conservation of rna secondary structure is a typical feature of many functional non-coding rnas.
as a general trend, we observed that methods that include a consensus structure prediction outperformed equivalent methods that only consider pairwise comparisons.
since almost all of the available methods used for prediction and annotation of non-coding rna genes rely on this evolutionary signature, accurate measures for structural conservation are essential.
we systematically assessed the ability of various measures to detect conserved rna structures in multiple sequence alignments.
we tested three existing and eight novel strategies that are based on metrics of folding energies, metrics of single optimal structure predictions, and metrics of structure ensembles.
a variant of the sci performed particularly well on highly conserved alignments and is thus a viable alternative when only little evolutionary information is available.
structural conservation can be measured accurately with relatively simple and intuitive metrics.
