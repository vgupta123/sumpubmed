the female organs are borne in pairs on short peduncles that are arranged along the axis of the female structure.
each of the female organs has a central unit that is surrounded by an envelope with characteristic longitudinal ribs.
one of the female structures is physically connected to the apex of a short shoot.
the fossils were collected from the haifanggou formation  in western liaoning, northeast china.
each central unit has two locules completely separated by a vertical septum.
this angiospermous trait implies either a jurassic angiosperm or a new seed plant group parallel to angiosperms and other known seed plants.
although still uncertain, this could have a great impact on our perspective of the history, diversity and systematics of seed plants and angiosperms.
they include two female structures and an associated leaf on the same slab.
while there has been much speculation in past decades about pre-cretaceous angiosperms, including archaefructus, these reports are controversial.
the apex of the central unit is completely closed.
because the closed carpel is a character only found in angiosperms, the closed apex of the central unit suggests the presence of angiospermy in schmeissneria.
