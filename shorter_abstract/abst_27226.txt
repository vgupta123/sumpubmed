the cleaved-prm <dig> domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping.
their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility.
we also assessed if and how changes in prm <dig> coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions.
changes in cleaved-prm <dig> coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents.
however, sexual selection on its sequence may be difficult to detect until it is identified which sperm head phenotype  confers advantages for sperm performance in different mammalian clades.
previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents.
protamines are sperm nuclear proteins with a crucial role in chromatin condensation.
protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints.
here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine  <dig>  gene sequences of  <dig> species of primates and rodents.
we focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of prm <dig> .
contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade.
