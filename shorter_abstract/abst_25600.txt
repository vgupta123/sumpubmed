its mode of action was probably strictly due to its fungicide effect at high concentrations because treatment did not induce significant change in the expression level of selected defense-related genes.
two defense inducers, benzothiadiazole  and fosetyl-aluminum , have been tested in natura using the “neovigen96” chip as well as their efficacy against downy mildew.
grapevine responses after bth elicitation in the vineyard were similar to those obtained in laboratory conditions, whereas our results suggest that the protective effect of fos against downy mildew in the vineyard was only due to its fungicide activity since no activity on plant defense genes was observed.
bth-induced grapevine resistance is accompanied by the induction of pr protein genes , genes coding key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway , a gst gene coding an enzyme involved in the redox status and an acc gene involved in the ethylene pathway.
an alternative strategy could be the use of compounds able to stimulate plant immune responses which significantly limit the development of pathogens in laboratory conditions.
to understand and to improve the mode of action of plant defense stimulators in the field, it is essential to develop reliable tools that describe the resistance status of the plant upon treatment.
this tool provides better understanding of how the grapevine replies to elicitation in its natural environment and how the elicitor potential can be used to reduce chemical fungicide inputs.
fos, a phosphonate known to possess a toxic activity against pathogens and an inducing effect on defense genes provided a better grapevine protection than bth.
