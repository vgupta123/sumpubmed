the drosophila sex determination hierarchy is a classic example of a transcriptional regulatory hierarchy, with sex-specific isoforms regulating morphology and behavior.
we use a structural equation modeling approach, leveraging natural genetic variation from two studies on drosophila female head tissues – dspr collection  and cegs population  – to expand understanding of the sex hierarchy gene regulatory network .
we expanded the sex hierarchy grn adding novel links among genes, including a link from fruitless  to sex-lethal  identified in both populations.
independent studies of doublesex and transformer mutants support many additions, including evidence for a link between the sex hierarchy and metabolism, via insulin-like receptor.
using natural alleles we can not only identify novel relationships, but using supervised approaches can order genes into a regulatory hierarchy.
combining these results with independent large effect mutation studies, allows clear candidates for detailed molecular follow-up to emerge.
the genes added in the cegs population were enriched for genes with sex-biased splicing and components of the spliceosome.
