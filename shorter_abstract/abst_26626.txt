most current methods for learning dbn employ either local search such as hill-climbing, or a meta stochastic global optimization framework such as genetic algorithm or simulated annealing, which are only able to locate sub-optimal solutions.
globalmit+ is able to learn high-order time delayed genetic interactions, which are common to most biological systems.
dynamic bayesian network  is among the mainstream approaches for modeling various biological networks, including the gene regulatory network .
to overcome the above difficulties, we introduce here a deterministic global optimization based dbn approach for reverse engineering genetic networks from time course gene expression data.
our studies demonstrate that deterministic global optimization approaches can infer large scale genetic networks.
the proposed approach, named globalmit+, employs the recently proposed information theoretic scoring metric named mutual information test .
