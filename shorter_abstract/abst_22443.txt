it facilitates the handling of pathway-related data and is designed to help biochemists and molecular biologists in their daily research.
as a first application of meta-all, we show how the information contained in a detailed kinetic model can be stored and accessed.
data can be stored together with quality tags and in different parallel versions.
we have designed meta-all, an information system that allows the management of metabolic pathways, including reaction kinetics, detailed locations, environmental factors and taxonomic information.
they can either develop their own information system for managing that own data, which is very time-consuming and costly, or they can try to store their data in existing systems, which is often restricted.
hence, an out-of-the-box information system for managing metabolic pathway data is needed.
we provide the meta-all information system for download and use.
if experimentalists want to store their own data, possibly still under investigation, there are two possibilities.
meta-all uses oracle dbms and oracle application express.
databases on metabolic pathways, which provide an increasingly important foundation for many analyses of biochemical processes at a systems level, are no exception from the rule.
meta-all is a system for managing information about metabolic pathways.
