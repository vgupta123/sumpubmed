this study integrates morphology, physiology and proteomic profiling alteration of dp and tp to address their underlying different molecular mechanisms.
results indicated that both photosynthesis and metabolic pathways were highly significantly associated with proteomic alteration between dp and tp based on biological process and pathway enrichment analysis, and  <dig> higher abundance chloroplast proteins involving in these two pathways were identified in tp.
diploid  and triploid  rice shows differences in morphological parameters, such as plant height, leaf length, leaf width and the physiological index of chlorophyll content.
to better understand the proteomic changes between dp and tp, tandem mass tags  mass spectrometry /ms was used to detect the significant changes to protein expression between dp and tp.
our finding revealed that atpf, psaa, psab, psbb and rbl can induce considerable expression changes in tp and may affect the development and growth of rice through photosynthesis and metabolic pathways.
