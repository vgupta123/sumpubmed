this study investigated the effects of administering subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials to beef cattle on the abundance and persistence of resistance genes within the microbial community of fecal deposits.
model fecal deposits  were prepared by mixing fresh feces from each pen into a single composite sample.
antimicrobial treatment differentially affected the abundance of certain resistance genes but generally not their persistence.
environmental transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistance gene determinants originating from livestock is affected by their persistence in agricultural-related matrices.
real-time pcr was used to measure concentrations of tet, sul and erm resistance genes in dna extracted from composites over  <dig> days of environmental exposure in the field.
dgge profiles of 16s-rrna differed amongst treatments and with time, illustrating temporal shifts in microbial communities.
the abundance of genes coding for antimicrobial resistance in bovine feces can be affected by inclusion of antibiotics in the feed.
management practices that accelerate dna degradation such as frequent land application or composting of manure may reduce the extent to which bovine feces serves as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance.
resistance genes can persist in feces from cattle beyond  <dig> days with concentrations of some genes increasing with time.
