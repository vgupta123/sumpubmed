alpha-synuclein , a  <dig> amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of lewy bodies in parkinson's disease .
we report that lipids and atp are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate wt and a53t α-syn binding to the synaptic membrane.
in addition, the impaired membrane binding observed for a30p α-syn was significantly mitigated by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol.
these findings suggest that endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate wt and mutant α-syn membrane binding, and could represent potential targets to influence α-syn solubility in brain.
in the present study, we analysed the ability of cytosolic factors to regulate α-syn binding to synaptic membranes.
we further show that 1-o-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine  is one of the principal lipids found in complex with cytosolic proteins and is required to enhance α-syn interaction with synaptic membrane.
we show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and pd-linked mutant α-syn.
