perhaps correlated with this division of genetic content, the copy number of mtdna-ii was more than four-fold that of mtdna-i in individual nematodes.
the g. ellingtonae mt genome was found to be comprised of two circles, each larger than any other multipartite circular mt chromosome yet reported, and both were larger than the single mt circle of the model nematode caenorhabditis elegans.
the segregation of gene types to different mt circles in g. ellingtonae could provide benefit by localizing gene functional types to independent transcriptional units.
we report on the two circle multipartite mt genome of a newly described cyst nematode, globodera ellingtonae.
the  <dig>  kb circle  contained ten protein-coding genes and two trna genes, whereas the  <dig>  kb circle  contained two protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna genes and both rrna genes.
the difference in copy number increased between second-stage and fourth-stage juveniles.
the differential copy number associated with this multipartite mt organization could provide a model system for deconstructing mechanisms regulating mtdna copy number both in somatic cells and during germline development.
