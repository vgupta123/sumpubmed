we provide an implementation of the original csp algorithm in copasi  and applied the strategy to two example models of different degree of complexity - a simple one-enzyme system and a full-scale model of yeast glycolysis.
we have developed a strategy based on the computational singular perturbation  method which can be used to perform a "biochemically-driven" model reduction of even large and complex kinetic ode systems.
the results should be easily accessible and interpretable.
the results show the usefulness of the method for model simplification purposes as well as for analyzing fundamental biochemical mechanisms.
difficult intuitive understanding, variety of time scales or non-identifiable parameters.
given the complex mechanisms underlying biochemical processes systems biology researchers tend to build ever increasing computational models.
