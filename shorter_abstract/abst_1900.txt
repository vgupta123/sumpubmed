siteseek is trained using a novel compact evolutionary and hydrophobicity profile to detect possible protein phosphorylation sites for a target sequence.
accurate prediction of protein phosphorylation sites is of great importance for the understanding of diverse cellular signalling processes in both the human body and in animals.
our newly proposed methods used in siteseek were shown to be useful for the identification of protein phosphorylation sites as it performed much better than widely known predictors on the newly built ps-benchmark_ <dig> dataset.
post-translational modifications have a substantial influence on the structure and functions of protein.
siteseek showed better predictive performance with  <dig> % accuracy,  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity and  <dig>  correlation-coefficient on the four main kinase families .
post-translational phosphorylation is one of the most common modification that occur in intracellular proteins.
the newly proposed method proves to be more accurate and exhibits a much stable predictive performance than currently existing phosphorylation site predictors.
in this study, we propose a new machine learning based protein phosphorylation site predictor, siteseek.
