such knowledge about the vulnerability of different livestock systems related to trade movements can be used to inform the design of animal health surveillance systems to facilitate the trade in animals between european member states.
data on the number of animals moved were obtained from the directorate general sanco  for  <dig>  these were converted to livestock units to enable direct comparison across species and their movements were mapped, used to calculate the indegrees and outdegrees of  <dig> european countries and the density and transitivity of movements within europe.
trade in live animals can contribute to the introduction of exotic diseases, the maintenance and spread endemic diseases.
this is of concern to highly connected countries particularly those where imported animals constitute a large proportion of their national livestock populations, and have a high indegree.
the transport of poultry  and unweaned animals would require more rest breaks than the movement of weaned animals, which may provide more opportunities for disease transmission.
