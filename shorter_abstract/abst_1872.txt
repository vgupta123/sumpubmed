heavy regular smoking is also associated with changes in the dna methylation of peripheral mononuclear cells.
to help understand whether peripheral mononuclear cells have a role in mediating these responses in older smokers with higher cumulative smoke exposure, we examined genome-wide dna methylation in a group of well characterized adult african american subjects informative for smoking, as well as serum c-reactive protein  and interleukin- <dig> receptor  levels.
genome-wide dna methylation analysis with respect to smoking status yielded  <dig> significant loci after benjamini-hochberg correction.
the bioinformatic analyses showed that long-term chronic smoking is associated with altered promoter dna methylation of genes coding for proteins mapping to critical sub-networks moderating inflammation, immune function, and coagulation.
regular smoking is associated with a wide variety of syndromes with prominent inflammatory components such as cancer, obesity and type  <dig> diabetes.
we conclude that chronic regular smoking is associated with changes in peripheral mononuclear cell methylation signature which perturb inflammatory and immune function pathways and may contribute to increased vulnerability for complex illnesses with inflammatory components.
in addition, complementary bioinformatic analyses were conducted to delineate possible pathways affected by long-term smoking.
in particular, two loci from the ahrr gene  and one locus from the gpr <dig> gene  were identified as highly significantly differentially methylated between smokers and non-smokers.
