the method was tested with artificial data and subsequently applied to a comprehensive phosphoproteomics study investigating the mode of action of sorafenib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor.
here, we introduce subextractor, an algorithm that combines phosphoproteomic data with protein network information from string to identify differentially regulated subnetworks and individual proteins.
the method is based on a bayesian probabilistic model combined with a genetic algorithm and rigorous significance testing.
the method can also be applied to gene or protein expression data.
in particular, processing mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic data in this manner may expose signal transduction pathways and, in the case of experiments with drug-treated cells, reveal the drug's mode of action.
subextractor reliably identifies differentially regulated subnetworks from phosphoproteomic data by integrating protein networks.
the bayesian model accounts for information about both differential regulation and network topology.
furthermore, such integration can support identification of regulated entities from often noisy high throughput data.
