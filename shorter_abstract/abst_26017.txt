regarding the hlye regulation in s. typhi, it has been reported that rpos participates as transcriptional up-regulator under low ph and high osmolarity.
moreover, phop-dependent hlye up-regulation has been reported in bacteria cultured simultaneously under low ph and low concentration of mg2+.
moreover, phop up-regulates hlye expression via rpos under low ph and low mg2+ conditions.
all these results together show that, at least under the tested conditions, rpos is the central regulator in the hlye regulatory network, integrating multiple environmental signals and global regulators.
previously, it has been suggested that there is another factor related to catabolite repression, different from crp, involved in the down-regulation of hlye.
nevertheless, the relative contribution of each environmental signal is not completely clear.
in this work we aimed to better understand the regulation of hlye in s. typhi and the integration of different environmental signals through global regulators.
spi- <dig> is a pathogenicity island found in some salmonella enterica serovars, including s. typhi.
we found that fis participates as a crp-independent glucose-dependent down-regulator of hlye.
in addition, crp down-regulates hlye expression during exponential growth.
