we hypothesized that the specific targeting of tnf-alpha antagonists to inflamed tissues could increase drug efficacy and reduce side effects.
despite the very fast clearance from the blood, this fusion protein was able to significantly improve the severe symptomatology of arthritis in collagen antibody-induced arthritis  mouse model.
l19-ug-tnfrii is a stable, soluble homodimeric protein that maintains the activities of both moieties: the immuno-reactivity of l <dig> and the capability of tnfrii to inhibit tnf-alpha.
b-fn has also been demonstrated in the pannus in rheumatoid arthritis.
using uteroglobin , a potent anti-inflammatory protein, as a scaffold, we prepared a bispecific tetravalent molecule consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human tnf-alpha receptor p <dig>  and the scfv l <dig>  l <dig> binds to the ed-b containing fibronectin isoform , which is expressed only during angiogenesis processes and during tissue remodeling.
the recombinant protein described here, able to selectively deliver the tnf-alpha antagonist tnfrii to inflamed tissues, could yield important contributions for the therapy of degenerative inflammatory diseases.
