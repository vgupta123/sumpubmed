the  <dig> Â mb assembled genome with  <dig>  predicted genes showed less efficiency of this isolate in plant cell wall degradation.
nevertheless, we have identified peptidases from m10a, m12a and s <dig> families that may allow um  <dig> to invade its host via extracellular matrix and collagen degradation.
the expanded glutathione-s-transferase domains and rta1-like protein families indicate the selection of genes in um  <dig> towards adaptation in hostile environments.
we identified an isolate of o. mirabilis from a skin scraping with morphological and molecular studies.
um  <dig> was identified as o. mirabilis based on morphology and internal transcribed spacer -based phylogeny.
the genomic analysis of o. mirabilis um  <dig> provides a better understanding of fungal survival tactics in different habitats.
results from the peptidase comparison analysis with reported keratin-degrading peptidases from dermatophytes suggest that um  <dig> is very unlikely to be utilising these peptidases to survive in the host.
ochroconis mirabilis, a recently introduced water-borne dematiaceous fungus, is occasionally isolated from human skin lesions and nails.
