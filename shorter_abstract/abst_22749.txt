the upregulated genes comprised  <dig> kog groups, but were most abundant from the groups representing posttranslational processing, and amino acid metabolism, and included components of the stress response, reaction to nitrogen shortage, signal transduction and lipid catabolism.
we analyzed genome-wide gene expression changes during the begin of physical contact between trichoderma atroviride and two plant pathogens botrytis cinerea and rhizoctonia solani, and compared with gene expression patterns of mycelial and conidiating cultures, respectively.
about  <dig> ests, representing about  <dig> genes, were obtained from each of these three growth conditions.
combating the action of plant pathogenic microorganisms by mycoparasitic fungi has been announced as an attractive biological alternative to the use of chemical fungicides since two decades.
metabolic network analysis confirmed the upregulation of the genes for amino acid biosynthesis and of those involved in the catabolism of lipids and aminosugars.
the analysis of the genes overexpressed during the onset of mycoparasitism in t. atroviride has revealed that the fungus reacts to this condition with several previously undetected physiological reactions.
