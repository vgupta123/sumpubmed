comparison of agave proteomes to those of additional plant species identifies biological functions of gene families displaying sequence divergence in agave species.
additionally, a focus on the transcriptomics of the a. deserti juvenile leaf confirms evolutionary conservation of monocotyledonous leaf physiology and development along the proximal-distal axis.
here, we present comprehensive, high quality de novo transcriptome assemblies of two agave species, a. tequilana and a. deserti, built from short-read rna-seq data.
because of their adaptations to their environment, including crassulacean acid metabolism , and existing technologies for ethanol production, agaves have gained attention both as potential lignocellulosic bioenergy feedstocks and models for exploring plant responses to abiotic stress.
our analyses support completeness and accuracy of the de novo transcriptome assemblies, with each species having a minimum of approximately  <dig>  protein-coding genes.
our work presents a comprehensive transcriptome resource for two agave species and provides insight into their biology and physiology.
agaves are succulent monocotyledonous plants native to xeric environments of north america.
