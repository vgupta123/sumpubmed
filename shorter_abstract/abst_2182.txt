to investigate the role of the vntr in leua, we compared two α-ipms proteins with different numbers of amino acid repeats, one with two copies and the other with  <dig> copies.
the recombinant his6-α-ipms proteins with two and  <dig> copies  of the repeat units were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration.
the differences in the kinetic properties and the l-leucine feedback inhibition between the two m. tuberculosis α-ipms proteins containing low and high numbers of vntr indicate that a large vntr insertion affects protein structure and function.
we have cloned leua with  <dig> copies of the repeat units into the pet15b expression vector with a his6-tag at the n-terminus, as was previously done for the leua gene with two copies of the repeat units.
alpha-isopropylmalate synthase  is the key enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in the leucine biosynthetic pathway.
both enzymes were found to be dimers by gel filtration.
the gene encoding α-ipms in mycobacterium tuberculosis, leua, is polymorphic due to the insertion of 57-bp repeat units referred to as variable number of tandem repeats .
α-ipms-14cr has higher affinity than α-ipms-2cr for the two substrates, α-ketoisovalerate and acetyl coa.
