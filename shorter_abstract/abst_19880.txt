the current taxonomy of the african giraffe  is primarily based on pelage pattern and geographic distribution, and nine subspecies are currently recognized.
the analyses of the maternally inherited sequences reveal a deep divergence between northern and southern giraffe populations in africa, and a general pattern of distinct matrilineal clades corresponding to their geographic distribution.
detailed knowledge about the genetic variation and phylogeography of the south african giraffe  and the angolan giraffe  is lacking.

our increased sampling in southern africa suggests that the distribution ranges of the angolan and south african giraffe need to be redefined.
we investigate genetic variation among giraffe matrilines by increased sampling, with a focus on giraffe key areas in southern africa.
knowledge about the phylogeography and genetic variation of these two maternal lineages is crucial for the development of appropriate management strategies.
divergence time estimates among giraffe populations place the deepest splits at several hundred thousand years ago.
