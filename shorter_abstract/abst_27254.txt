axr3- <dig> protein turnover does not appear to be altered by pax1- <dig>  however, expression of an axr3::gus reporter is reduced in a pax1- <dig> background, suggesting that pax <dig> positively regulates axr <dig> transcription.
the pax1- <dig> mutation also affects the phenotypes conferred by stabilising mutations in other aux/iaa proteins; however, the interactions are more complex than with axr3- <dig>
we present the isolation of the partial suppressor of axr3- <dig>  mutant, which partially suppresses almost every aspect of the axr3- <dig> phenotype, and that of the weaker axr3- <dig> allele.
semi-dominant mutations in axr <dig> result in an increased amplitude of auxin responses due to hyperstabilisation of the encoded protein.
the arabidopsis gene axr3/iaa <dig> encodes a member of the aux/iaa family of auxin responsive transcriptional repressors.
the aim of this study was to identify novel genes involved in auxin signal transduction by screening for second site mutations that modify the axr3- <dig> gain-of-function phenotype.
