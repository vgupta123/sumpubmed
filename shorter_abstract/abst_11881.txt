we collected measures of ovarian hormone data from faeces, sexual swelling size from digital images, and male and female behaviour.
we show that both sexual swelling size and female proceptivity are graded-signals, but relatively reliable indicators of ovulation, with swelling size largest and female proceptive behaviours most frequent around ovulation.
sexual swelling size was also larger in conceptive cycles.
one cause of this variation may be differences in male competitive regimes: some species show marked sexual dimorphism and reproductive skew, with males fighting for dominance, while others show low dimorphism and skew, with males queuing for dominance.
however, data on ovulatory signals are absent from species at one end of the macaque continuum, where selection has led to high sexual dimorphism and male reproductive skew.
among the most interesting study systems are those of multimale multifemale group-living primates, where females signal fertility to males through multiple signals, and in which there is substantial inter-specific variation in the composition and reliability of such signals.
we argue that in species where males fight over dominance, male dominance rank is surrogate for competitiveness.
female signals of fertility have evolved in diverse taxa.
as such, we suggest that it may in part be variation in male competitive regimes that leads to the evolution of fertility signalling systems of different reliability.
male mating behaviour was well timed to female ovulation, suggesting that males had accurate information about this.
here we present data from  <dig> cycles of  <dig> wild female crested macaques, a highly sexually dimorphic species with strong mating skew.
