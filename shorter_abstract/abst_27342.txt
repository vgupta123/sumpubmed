this process is repeated until an optimal classification is obtained.
the gene expression network analysis tool  is applied to the remaining genes to form n clusters of genes that are highly connected in the network.
large databases of gene interaction networks provide an important resource for the analysis of genetic phenomena and for classification studies using interacting genes.
classification using microarray datasets is usually based on a small number of samples for which tens of thousands of gene expression measurements have been obtained.
more than 90% accuracy can be obtained in classification of selected microarray datasets by integrating the interaction network information with the gene expression information from the microarrays.
the least informative clusters are removed while retaining the remainder for the next classification step.
linear svm is used to classify the samples using these clusters, and a weight is assigned to each cluster based on its importance to the classification.
we now demonstrate that an algorithm which integrates network information with recursive feature elimination based on svm exhibits good performance and improves the biological interpretability of the results.
