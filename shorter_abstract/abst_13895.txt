a loss of function in pcdhb <dig> is unlikely because intra-human variability did not increase relative to the other human beta-protocadherins.
the brain-expressed protein with the highest number of human-specific substitutions is pcdhb <dig>  in spite of its fast evolution and low intra-human variability, cell-based tests on the only proposed function for pcdhb <dig> did not indicate a functional change.
brain-expressed proteins that have undergone functional change during human evolution may contribute to human cognitive capacities, and may also leave us vulnerable to specifically human diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism or alzheimer’s disease.
homophilic adhesion caused by a pcdhb <dig> with reversion of human-specific changes was as low as for modern human pcdhb11; while neither human nor reverted pcdhb <dig> adhered to controls, they did adhere to each other.
in order to search systematically for those proteins that have changed the most during human evolution and that might contribute to brain function and pathology, all proteins with orthologs in chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque and annotated as being expressed on the surface of cells in the human central nervous system were ordered by the number of human-specific amino acid differences that are fixed in modern populations.
