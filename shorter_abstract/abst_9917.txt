since c57bl/6j mice possess only a single itln gene, this is likely to contribute to functional differences between c57bl/6j and other mouse strains.
strong evidence for tissue-specific distribution of itln variants was found, indicating that itln duplication contributes more than a simple gene dosage effect.
in contrast to c57bl/6j mice, there is evidence for expansion of the itln locus in other strains and at least one additional mouse itln gene product has been described.
the locus contained six distinct itln genes, two cd <dig> genes and several itln- and cd244-related pseudogenes.
the expansion of the itln locus appears to have occurred through multiple duplications of a segment consisting of a full-length itln gene, a cd <dig> gene and an itln pseudogene fragment.
we have characterised the itln locus in 129s <dig> mice to reveal six itln genes with distinct sequence and expression characteristics.
the aim of this study was to sequence and characterise the itln locus in the 129s <dig> strain, to determine the nature of the chromosomal expansion and to inform possible future gene deletion strategies.
six 129s <dig> bac clones were sequenced and assembled to generate  <dig> kbp of chromosomal sequence, including the entire itln locus of approximately  <dig> kbp.
c57bl/6j mice possess a single intelectin  gene on chromosome  <dig>  the function of intelectins is not well understood, but roles have been postulated in insulin sensitivity, bacterial recognition, intestinal lactoferrin uptake and response to parasites and allergens.
