to identify genes commonly regulated by β-catenin in colorectal cancer cell lines, we analyzed β-catenin target gene expression in two non-isogenic cell lines, dld <dig> and sw <dig>  using dna microarrays and compared these genes to β-catenin target genes published in the pubmed database and dna microarray data presented in the gene expression omnibus  database.
deregulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling is a hallmark of the majority of sporadic forms of colorectal cancer and results in increased stability of the protein β-catenin.
based on the large number of potential β-catenin target genes found to be similarly regulated in dld <dig>  sw <dig> and ls174t cells as well as the large overlap with confirmed β-catenin target genes, we conclude that dld <dig> and sw <dig> colon carcinoma cell lines are suitable model systems to study wnt/β-catenin signaling and associated colorectal carcinogenesis.
treatment of dld <dig> and sw <dig> cells with β-catenin sirna resulted in differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.
furthermore, the confirmed and the newly identified potential β-catenin target genes are useful starting points for further studies.
comparison of these data with published β-catenin target genes for the colon carcinoma cell line ls174t revealed  <dig> genes that are regulated similarly in all three cell lines.
the overlapping gene set includes confirmed β-catenin target genes like axin <dig>  myc, and ascl <dig>  we also identified  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways that are regulated similarly in dld <dig> and sw <dig> cells and one pathway – the steroid biosynthesis pathway – was regulated in all three cell lines.
<dig> of these genes were regulated in the same direction in both cell lines.
