defensins are antimicrobial peptides of innate immunity functioning by non-specific binding to anionic phospholipids in bacterial membranes.
this could potentially be used to design human defensins that may be effective at lower concentrations and hence have therapeutic benefits.
based on homology greater than 40%, structural models of  <dig> homologs of hbd- <dig> were constructed.
based on structural information on human Î²-defensin  <dig>  we examine homologous defensins from various mammalian species for conserved functional physico-chemical characteristics.
