specialization in veterinary medicine in europe is organized through the colleges of the european board of veterinary specialization.
besides knowledge and clinical skills, residents and diplomates are expected to demonstrate high standards in teaching and communication.
the results of this study will help to create a european curriculum for postgraduate education in veterinary neurology.
to inform updating of the curriculum for residents of the european college of veterinary neurology  job analysis was used.
in addition, opinions of different groups were subjected to statistical analysis and the result compared.
defining job competencies of diploma holders in veterinary neurology can be used as references for curriculum design of resident training.
the outcomes of this “delphi job analysis” provide a powerful tool to align the curriculum for ecvn resident training and can be adapted to the required job competencies, based on expectations.
a return rate of 62%  was achieved.
of the competencies identified by the delphi process, 75% objectives were expected to attain expert level; 24% attain advanced level; 1% entry level.
the expectation is that for majority of these competencies diplomates should attain an expert level.
in addition, the exercise described the  <dig> highly ranked competencies, the  <dig> most frequently seen diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems and the most frequently used immunosuppressive, antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic drugs.
with the support of the diplomates of the ecvn and the members of the european society of veterinary neurology  a mixed-method research, including a qualitative search of objectives and quantitative ranking with  <dig> likert scale questions and  <dig> free text questions in  <dig> categories in a survey was conducted.
