there is a legitimate need for integrating and visualizing these disparate data sets to reveal structural relationships not apparent when looking at these data in isolation.
genome3d is unique is its ability to manipulate large amounts of multi-resolution data from diverse sources to uncover complex and new structural relationships within the genome.
we have applied object-oriented technology to develop a downloadable visualization tool, genome3d, for integrating and displaying epigenomic data within a prescribed three-dimensional physical model of the human genome.
we describe here the major features of genome3d and discuss our multi-scale data framework using a representative basic physical model.
data from various sources of differing scales can be integrated within a hierarchical framework that is easily adapted to new developments concerning the structure of the physical genome.
much of this new data is increasingly structural in nature, and is often difficult to coordinate with other data sets.
to our knowledge, this is the first such tool developed that can visualize human genome in three-dimension.
new technologies are enabling the measurement of many types of genomic and epigenomic information at scales ranging from the atomic to nuclear.
