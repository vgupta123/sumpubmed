in the present study, we aimed to isolate bacteria from root rhizosphere of the same plant that is capable of antagonizing colletotrichum gloeosporioides and fusarium oxysporum as well as promotes plant growth.
the isolate showed maximum similarity with bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
colletotrichum and fusarium species are among pathogenic fungi widely affecting coffea arabica l., resulting in major yield loss.
a total of  <dig> bacillus species were isolated, one of the isolates named bt <dig> showed maximum radial mycelial growth inhibition against colletotrichum gloeosporioides  and fusarium oxysporum .
the mechanism of action of inhibition of the pathogenic fungi found to be synergistic effects of secondary metabolites, lytic enzymes, and siderophores.
bt <dig> increased germination of coffee arabica l. seeds by  <dig> %, decreased disease incidence due to infection of colletotrichum gloeosporioides to  <dig> % and due to infection of fusarium oxysporum to  <dig> .
bacillus species , isolated in the present work was found to be capable of antagonizing the pathogenic effects of colletotrichum gloeosporioides and fusarium oxysporum.
the major inhibitory secondary metabolite identified as harmine .
