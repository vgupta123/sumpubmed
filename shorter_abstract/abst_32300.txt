lastly, animals were pretreated with either stgf-βr  or igg2a  prior to immunization with an adenoviral vector encoding the human papillomavirus e <dig> gene .
one week later, flow cytometry was utilized to measure the number of splenic e7-specific cd8+ t cells.
we observed, paradoxically, that inhibiting tgf-β before exposing animals to tumor cells increases tumor growth kinetics.
inhibition of tgf-β before the injection of tumor cells resulted in significantly larger average tumor volumes on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post tumor-inoculation .
this finding has important implications for our understanding of anti-tumor immune responses, the role of tgf-β in the immune system, and the future development of tgf-β inhibiting drugs.
transforming growth factor -β is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine necessary for cancer growth.
in vivo lymphocyte assays and depletion experiments were then performed to investigate the immunological basis of our results.
these studies provide the first in vivo evidence that tgf-β may be necessary for anti-tumor immune responses in certain cancers.
furthermore, pretreatment with stgf-βr inhibited tumor-specific ctl activity in a winn assay.
this effect was due to the inhibition of ctls, as it was not present in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency  or those depleted of cd8+ t cells.
tumors grew to a much larger size when mixed with cd8+ t cells from mice pretreated with stgf-βr than when mixed with cd8+ t cells from mice in the control group:  <dig> mm <dig> vs.  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively .
in addition, fewer cd8+ t cells were generated in ad.e7-immunized mice pretreated with stgf-βr than in mice from the control group:  <dig> % total cd8+ t cells vs.  <dig> %, respectively .
animal and human studies have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of tgf-β slows the growth rate of established tumors and occasionally eradicates them altogether.
