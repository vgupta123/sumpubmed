these partial alignments are assembled together to form a complete alignment of the original sequences.
complete bacterial genomes are reported almost everyday.
this creates challenges for developing new multiple sequence alignment methods.
we present a new method of multiple sequence alignment, called mishima , that does not depend on pairwise sequence comparison.
divide and conquer approach is then applied to break the sequences into fragments that can be aligned independently by an external alignment program.
