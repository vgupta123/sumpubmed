in this study, the rna extracted from visually unaffected and necrotic tissue from pigs infected with actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was subjected to small rna deep sequencing.
of these,  <dig> were significantly up-regulated in the necrotic sample and  <dig> were down-regulated.
this is the first study revealing significant differences in composition and expression profiles of mirnas in lungs infected with a bacterial pathogen.
severe damage to the lungs, in many cases deadly, is caused by toxins released by the bacterium and to some degree by host mediated tissue damage.
our results extend annotation of microrna in pig and provide insight into the role of a number of micrornas in regulation of bacteria induced immune and inflammatory response in porcine lung.
we identified  <dig> conserved and  <dig> candidate novel micrornas in the pig.
mir- <dig>  a known key player in inflammation, was found expressed in both samples.
whereas a large number of mirnas have been annotated at the structural level during the latest years, functional annotation is sparse.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  causes serious lung infections in pigs.
