novel algorithms for chemical fragments, 3d motifs, ϕ/ψ sequences, super-secondary structure motifs and for small 3d structural motif associations searches are incorporated.
it provides multiple views of data found in the pdb archive for exploring protein structures.
we describe here a web application for querying the pdb for ligands, binding sites, small 3d structural and sequence motifs and the underlying database.
msdmotif is an integrated system where a results page is also a search form.
protein structures have conserved features – motifs, which have a sufficient influence on the protein function.
the protein data bank  is the source of this information however present search tools have limited 3d options to integrate protein sequence with its 3d structure.
