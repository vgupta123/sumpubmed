furthermore, an asymmetrical gene flow occurring between these main lineages was detected, resulting in highly admixed strains.
this atypical genomic architecture of the highly recombinogenic strains is consistent with the distributive conjugal transfer  observed in m. smegmatis.
genome sequencing of those hybrid strains confirmed that half of their genomic content was remodelled in large genomic blocks, leading to original tri-modal ‘patchwork’ architecture.
taken together, our results strongly suggest that mab evolution is sporadically punctuated by dramatic genome wide remodelling events.
one of these hybrid strains acquired a locus conferring inducible macrolide resistance, and a large genomic insertion from a slowly growing pathogenic mycobacteria, suggesting an adaptive gene transfer.
