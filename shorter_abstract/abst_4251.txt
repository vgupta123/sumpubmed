our method of applying network topological differences can aid in identifying the differences among similar  yet very different biological conditions  to generate testable hypotheses.
we characterised the global genomic response following 10 cgy  and 100 cgy  doses of x-ray ionising radiation at four time points by analysing the topology of gene coexpression networks.
this is the first study where a network level analysis was performed across two different radiation doses at various time points, thereby illustrating changes in the cellular response over time.
this study includes a rich experimental design and state-of-the-art computational systems biology methods of analysis to study the differences in the transcriptional response of skin cells exposed to low and high doses of radiation.
using this method we found important genes that have been linked to immune response, cell survival and apoptosis.
