the predikin website has been redesigned to incorporate the new features.
new features in predikin include the use of sql queries to predikindb to generate predictions, scoring of predictions, more reliable identification of substrate-determining residues and putative phosphorylation sites, extended options to handle protein kinase and substrate data and an improved web interface.
the new features significantly enhance the ability of predikin to analyse protein kinases and their substrates.
we have previously described an approach to predicting the substrate specificity of serine-threonine protein kinases.
predikin now consists of two components:  predikindb, a database of phosphorylation sites that links substrates to kinase sequences and  a perl module, which provides methods to classify protein kinases, reliably identify substrate-determining residues, generate scoring matrices and score putative phosphorylation sites in query sequences.
predikin was implemented originally as a web application written in javascript.
the method, named predikin, identifies key conserved substrate-determining residues in the kinase catalytic domain that contact the substrate in the region of the phosphorylation site and so determine the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site.
