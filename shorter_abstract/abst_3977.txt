the cajal body  is a nuclear suborganelle involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins , which are vital for pre-mrna splicing.
the tim50a transcript can be detected in some cancer cell lines and normal brain tissue.
newly imported sm-class snrnps traffic through cbs, where the snrna component of the snrnp is modified, and then target to other nuclear domains such as speckles and perichromatin fibrils.
tim50a may play a role in snrnp biogenesis given its cellular localization and protein interaction characteristics.
in addition to coilin, tim50a interacts with snrnps and smn.
the marker protein for cbs, coilin, may play a role in snrnp biogenesis given that it can interact with snrnps and smn, the protein mutated in spinal muscular atrophy.
competition binding experiments demonstrate that coilin competes with sm proteins of snrnps and smn for binding sites on tim50a.
loss of coilin function in mice leads to significant viability and fertility problems and altered cb formation.
