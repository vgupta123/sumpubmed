the transformation event is characterized by a dramatic cellular deformation process which includes: condensation of certain cellular materials into a much smaller tubular structure, synthesis of a tubular wall and growth of filamentous extensions.
mammalian cells transform into individual tubular straw cells naturally in tissues and in response to desiccation related stress in vitro.
the straw blood cell count  is  <dig> million/ml, which accounts for  <dig> % of the bloods dry weight.
this study continues the characterization of straw cells in blood, as well as the mechanisms of tubular transformation in response to stress; with specific emphasis placed on investigating whether tubular transformation shares the same signaling pathway as apoptosis.
studies using apoptosis inhibitors and a tubular transformation inhibitor in caco <dig> cells and in mice suggested apoptosis produced apoptotic bodies are mediated differently than tubular transformation produced straw cells.
tubular transformation is a programmed cell survival process that diverges from apoptosis.
a single dose of  <dig>  mg/kg/day of p <dig> mapk inhibitor in wild type mice results in a 30% reduction in the sbc.
there are approximately  <dig> billion, unconventional, tubular straw cells in human blood at any given time.
lipid profiling reveals severe disruption of the plasma membrane in caco cells during transformation.
straw cells originating from the lungs, liver and lymphocytes have varying nodules, hairiness and dimensions.
the growth rates for the elongation of filaments and enlargement of rabbit straw cells is  <dig> ~ <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.
straw cells are observed residing in the mammalian blood with large quantities.
sbcs may be an important indicator of intrinsic aging-related stress.
