to maximally exploit the information contained in such compendia, we propose an analysis flow that combines publicly available expression compendia and sequence-based predictions to infer novel srna-target interactions and to reconstruct the relation between the srna and the transcriptional network.
combining these expressions with sequence-based srna-target interactions allowed us to predict  <dig> novel srna-target interactions comprising  <dig> srnas.
our results highlight the role of the posttranscriptional network in finetuning the transcriptional regulation, e.g.
publicly available expression compendia that measure both mrnas and srnas provide a promising resource to simultaneously infer the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network.
in this work we show how strategies that combine expression information with sequence-based predictions can help unveiling the intricate interaction between the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network in prokaryotic model systems.
we relied on module inference to construct modules of coexpressed genes .
