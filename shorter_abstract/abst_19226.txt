finally, cortical cultures derived from cxcr4-/- mutants show a close parallel to amd <dig> treatment with reduced cell proliferation and differentiation of gabaergic neurons.
second, sdf- <dig> signaling upregulates the differentiation of cortical gabaergic neurons, independent of sonic signaling pathway.
results from this study show that sdf- <dig> regulates distinct cortical cell populations in vitro.
stromal derived factor , an alpha chemokine, is a widely known chemoattractant in the immune system.
first, sdf- <dig> signaling maintains cortical progenitors in proliferation, possibly through a mechanism involving connexin  <dig> mediated intercellular coupling.
third, sdf- <dig> enables the elongation and branching of axons of cortical glutamatergic neurons.
a growing body of evidence now suggests multiple regulatory roles for sdf- <dig> in the developing nervous system.
using sdf- <dig> medium and amd <dig>  a receptor antagonist, we demonstrate that the chemokine signaling regulates key events during early cortical development.
