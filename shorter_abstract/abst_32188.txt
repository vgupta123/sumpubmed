we show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the deduced product of the spp genes displayed antibacterial activity.
transcriptional fusions showed that the three paralogues identified in this strain were expressed in a plcr-dependent manner.
in the genomes of bacteria belonging to the b. cereus group, including bacillus anthracis and bacillus thuringiensis, a small gene encoding a 26-amino acid peptide was present in multicopy.
in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  the small gene and the clo gene are co-transcribed.
in the human pathogen bacillus cereus, the expression of most extracellular virulence factors is controlled by the transcriptional activator plcr.
among these virulence factors, cereolysin o  is an haemolysin belonging to the cholesterol-dependant cytolysins, a protein family extensively studied in gram-positive bacteria.
