by representing both data and processes as formal rules within a database, an ultra-structure system constitutes a flexible framework that enables users to explicitly store domain knowledge in both a machine- and human-readable form.
it also enables us to readily incorporate new data types, sources, and domain knowledge with no change to the database structure or associated computer code.
we transitioned our proteogenomic mapping information system from a traditional entity-relationship design to one based on ultra-structure.
we find ultra-structure offers substantial benefits for biological information systems, the largest being the integration of diverse information sources into a common framework.
end users themselves can change the system's capabilities without programmer intervention, simply by altering database contents; no computer code or schemas need be modified.
this provides flexibility in adapting to change, and allows integration of disparate, heterogenous data sets within a small core set of database tables, facilitating joint analysis and visualization without becoming unwieldy.
ultra-structure may be a significant step towards solving the hard problem of data management and integration in the systems biology era.
research is dynamic, with frequently changing protocols, techniques, instruments, and file formats.
the system is not tied specifically to proteogenomic research, but is rather designed to accommodate virtually any kind of biological research.
