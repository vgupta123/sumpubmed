interestingly, transient assay of  <dig> mbigyps showed that the mbigyp <dig> protein induced cell death in resistant poplar clones.
in spite of overall low sequence similarity among igyps; they showed conserved n- and c-terminal motifs and a unified gene structure.
igyp homologues were also found in  <dig> other dikarya fungal species, all of which shared conserved motifs and the same gene structure.
gene structure and genomic context analyses indicated that igyps originated from a common ancestor.
real-time rt-pcr showed that  <dig> mbigyps were highly expressed in the biotrophic stage.
in m. brunnea, the expansion of highly divergent mbigyps possibly is associated with plant-pathogen arms race.
