although this situation was improved recently by the molecular phylogenetic study of jin et al., comparatively few species were analyzed from the species-rich and taxonomically controversial east asian amitostigma alliance.
our results suggest key phylogenetic placements for sirindhornia and brachycorythis, and confirm previous assertions that the amitostigma alliance is monophyletic and sister to the eurasian plus european clades of subtribe orchidinae.
we provide a new framework on the complex phylogenetic relationships between amitostigma and other genera traditionally included in its alliance; based on which, we combine the entire amitostigma alliance into a morphologically and molecularly circumscribed amitostigma sensu latissimo that also contains seven molecularly circumscribed sections.
nuclear and plastid data were analyzed separately due to a few hard incongruences that most likely reflect chloroplast capture.
seven robust clades are evident within the alliance, but none corresponds precisely with any of the traditional genera; the smaller and more morphologically distinct genera tsaiorchis, hemipilia, neottianthe and hemipiliopsis are monophyletic but each is nested within a polyphyletic plexus of species attributed to either ponerorchis or the most plesiomorphic genus, amitostigma.
