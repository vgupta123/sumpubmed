a neighbor joining tree constructed based on cadf  gene sequence information formed a major cluster consisting of c. lari isolates, separating from the other three thermophilic campylobacters.
the putative cadf  orfs from all c. lari isolates were nine amino acid larger than those from c. jejuni, and showed amino acid residues  <dig> - <dig> of falg , instead of the frls residues of the maximal fibronectin-binding activity site demonstrated within c. jejuni cadf.
the combined sequences encoding a partial and putative rpsi open reading frame , non-coding  region, a putative orf for the campylobacter adhesin to fibronectin-like protein , a putative cla_ <dig> orf, nc region and a partial and putative cla_ <dig> orf, were identified in  <dig> campylobacter lari isolates, using two novel degenerate primer pairs.
thus, cadf  gene is highly conserved among c. lari organisms.
a peptidoglycan-associating alpha-helical motif in the c-terminal regions of some bacterial cell-surface proteins was completely conserved amongst the putative cadf  orfs from the c. lari isolates.
probable consensus sequence at the - <dig> and - <dig> regions were identified in all c. lari isolates, as a promoter.
transcription of the cadf  gene in c. lari cells in vivo was also confirmed and the transcription initiation site was determined.
