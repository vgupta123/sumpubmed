salmonicida strains, only about 25% were found in other a. salmonicida subspecies and none were detected in other aeromonas species.
comparison with the a. hydrophila atcc 7966t genome reveals multiple large inversions in the chromosome as well as an approximately 9% difference in gene content indicating instances of single gene or operon loss or gain.
salmonicida a <dig> chromosome and two large plasmids are characterized.
the chromosome is  <dig> , <dig> bp and encodes  <dig> genes, while the two large plasmids are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.
notable features are a large inversion in the chromosome and, in one of the large plasmids, the presence of a tn <dig> composite transposon containing mercury resistance genes and an in <dig> integron encoding genes for resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin, quaternary ammonia compounds, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol.
these changes appear to be a consequence of adaptation to a specific host, salmonid fish, and provide insights into the mechanisms used by the bacterium for infection and avoidance of host defence systems.
a large number of genes encoding potential virulence factors were identified; however, many appear to be pseudogenes since they contain insertion sequences, frameshifts or in-frame stop codons.
salmonicida causes disease in healthy fish.
the genome sequence of a. salmonicida was determined to provide a better understanding of the virulence factors used by this pathogen to infect fish.
while other species of aeromonas are opportunistic pathogens or are found in commensal or symbiotic relationships with animal hosts, a. salmonicida subsp.
the nucleotide sequences of the a. salmonicida subsp.
a total of  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> insertion sequences  are found in the a. salmonicida genome.
a limited number of the pseudogenes found in a. salmonicida a <dig> were investigated in other aeromonas strains and species.
while nearly all the pseudogenes tested are present in a. salmonicida subsp.
relative to the a. hydrophila atcc 7966t genome, the a. salmonicida subsp.
salmonicida is a gram-negative bacterium that is the causative agent of furunculosis, a bacterial septicaemia of salmonid fish.
