genes are more likely to be co-regulated by pairs of tfs or pairs of mirnas than by pairs of tf-mirna, perhaps due to higher probability of evolutionary duplication events of shorter dna sequences.
putative pairs of regulators selected by this procedure are more likely to have biological coordination.
we found that combinatorial regulation by transcription factor pairs and mirna pairs is much more abundant than the combinatorial regulation by tf-mirna pairs.
in addition, many of the strongly interacting tf-mirna pairs involve a subset of master tf regulators that co-regulate genes in coordination with almost any mirna.
importantly, we found that the probability of a tf-mirna pair forming feed forward loops with its common target genes  is increased for strongly interacting tf-mirna pairs.
moreover, the particular type of feed forward loop  is more prevalent among strongly interacting tf-mirna pairs.
combinatorial regulation by transcription factors alone or mirnas alone offers a wide range of regulatory programs.
here, we studied the nature and scope of coordination among regulators from the transcriptional and mirna regulatory layers in the human genome.
application of standard measures for evaluating the degree of interaction between pairs of regulators show that strongly interacting tf-mirna, tf-tf or mirna-mirna pairs tend to include tfs or mirnas that regulate very large numbers of genes.
in mammalian cells, mirnas repress the translation of messenger rnas  or degrade mrnas.
this may be attributed to a process that prevents waste of cellular resources or a mechanism to accelerate mrna degradation.
micrornas  are a novel class of non-coding small rnas.
