additionally, antimicrobial peptides described in the phytamp database served as queries to retrieve and generate expression profiles of these defense genes in the libraries compared to the libraries obtained under symbiotic interactions.
the knowledge integrated in symgrass may guide studies on molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms by which sugarcane controls the establishment and efficiency of endophytic associations.
we curated sequence information publicly available for the biofuel plant sugarcane, performed an analysis of the common sym pathway known to control symbiosis in other plants, and provide results, sequences and literature links as an online database.
we believe that the candidate sequences for the sym pathway together with the pool of exclusively expressed tentative consensus  sequences are crucial for the design of molecular studies to unravel the mechanisms controlling the establishment of symbioses in sugarcane, ultimately serving as a basis for the improvement of grass crops.
the rationale for gathering information from plants procuring nitrogen through symbiotic interactions controlled by a common genetic program for a sustainable biofuel production is the high energy demanding application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
protein sequences known in the sym pathway were used as queries to search the symgrass sequence database.
we describe the symgrass, a database of sugarcane orthologous genes involved in arbuscular mycorrhiza  and root nodule  symbiosis.
the database aggregates knowledge about sequences, tissues, organ, developmental stages and experimental conditions, and provides annotation and level of gene expression for sugarcane transcripts and sym orthologous genes in sugarcane through a web interface.
