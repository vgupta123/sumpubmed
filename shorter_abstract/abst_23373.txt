the immunization with rth and hph prolonged the survival of treated animals, improve humoral anti-cancer response and moderate the manifestation of c- <dig> carcinoma symptoms as tumor growth, splenomegaly and lung metastasis appearance.
klh  is the most studied molecule of this group setting a standard for natural carrier protein for small molecules and has been used in anti-tumor clinical trials.
among them are the hemocyanins  - extracellular copper proteins isolated from different arthropod and mollusc species.
hemocyanins are used so far for therapy of superficial bladder cancer and murine melanoma models.
the hcs isolated from marine snail rapana thomasiana  and the terrestrial snail helix pomatia  express strong in vivo anti-cancer and anti-proliferative effects in the developed by us murine model of colon carcinoma.
our findings demonstrate a potential anti-cancer effect of hemocyanins on a murine model of colon carcinoma suggesting their use for immunotherapy of different types of cancer.
