comparative genomics analysis against fully-sequenced soil bacteria p. jdr <dig> and p. vortex showed that regions of poor conservation may contain putative virulence factors.
finally, mass spectrometry was used to provide experimental evidence that at least 35% of the genes are expressed at the protein level.
we used the illumina gaiix platform and conventional sanger sequencing to generate a 182-fold sequence coverage of the p. larvae genome, and assembled the data using abyss into a total of  <dig> contigs spanning  <dig>  mbp.
this update on the genome of p. larvae and annotation represents an immense advancement from what we had previously known about this species.
biologists have studied this organism since the early 1900s, and a century later, the molecular mechanism of infection remains elusive.
