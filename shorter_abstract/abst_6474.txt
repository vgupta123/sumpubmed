cd4+ t helper cells are poised to be influenced by mt transduced zinc signaling because they produce intracellular reactive oxygen species following activation through the t cell receptor and are sensitive to small changes in intracellular .
when tr <dig> cells from wildtype mice are compared with congenic mice lacking functional mt <dig> and mt <dig> genes, the expression of intracellular mt is associated with a greater increase in intracellular  immediately following exposure to reactive oxygen species or upon restimulation through the t cell receptor.

increased expression of mt after exposure to heavy metals, oxidative stress, or inflammatory cytokines leads to an increased intracellular redox-mobilizable zinc pool that can affect downstream zinc-sensitive signaling pathways.
mt expression and intracellular  are both increased during primary activation and expansion of naïve cd4+ t cells into the tr <dig> phenotype in vitro.
by expressing mt in response to certain environmental conditions, cd4+ t cells are able to more efficiently release intracellular zinc and regulate signaling pathways following stimulation.
differences in zinc signaling associated with mt expression appear to be a result of preferential oxidation of mt and concomitant release of zn2+.
the link between mt expression and increased zinc signaling following activation represents an important immunomodulatory mechanism of mt and illuminates the complex role mt plays in shaping immune responses.
