the biological sample model included two mycobacterium smegmatis unlabeled cell cultures grown at ph  <dig> and ph  <dig>  the objective was to compare the protein relative abundance between the two unlabeled cell cultures, with an emphasis on significance analysis of protein differential expression using the sam method.
results using the sam method are compared with those obtained by fold change and the conventional t-test.
we have applied the sam method to solve the two-sample significance analysis problem in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  based quantitative proteomics.
we demonstrate that the sam method can be adapted for effective significance analysis of proteomic data.
each biological replicate was mixed with a common 15n-labeled reference culture cells for normalization prior to sds/page fractionation and lc/ms analysis.
for each biological replicate, one center sds/page gel fraction was selected for triplicate lc/ms analysis.
although fold change is a commonly used criterion in quantitative proteomics for differentiating regulated proteins, it does not provide an estimation of false positive and false negative rates that is often desirable in a large-scale quantitative proteomic analysis.
the quantitative proteomic analysis was carried out with nanoliquid chromatography/linear iron trap-fourier transform mass spectrometry.
we explore the possibility of applying the significance analysis of microarray  method  to a differential proteomics problem of two samples with replicates.
the results indicate that sam appears to overcome the false positives one encounters using the peptide-based t-test while allowing for identification of a greater number of differentially expressed proteins than the protein-based t-test.
it provides much richer information about the protein differential expression profiles and is particularly useful in the estimation of false discovery rates and miss rates.
of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> were significant in differential expression by the t-test  based on peptide-level replicates,  <dig> were significant in differential expression by sam with Î” =  <dig>  cutoff and false positive rate at 5%, and  <dig> were significant in differential expression by the t-test  based on protein-level replicates.
we grew the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabelled cell cultures in triplicate resulting in  <dig> biological replicates.
there were  <dig> proteins quantified in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> biological replicates.
