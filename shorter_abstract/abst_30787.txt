the putative ancestral eutherian genome, reconstructed on the basis of the synteny analysis of  <dig> vertebrate genome sequences, not only confirmed the results of previous molecular cytogenetic studies but also increased the definition of the inferred structure of ancestral eutherian chromosomes.
genome comparisons have made possible the reconstruction of the eutherian ancestral karyotype but also have the potential to provide new insights into the evolutionary inter-relationship of the different eutherian orders within the mammalian phylogenetic tree.
such comparisons can additionally reveal  the nature of the dna sequences present within the evolutionary breakpoint regions and  whether or not the evolutionary breakpoints occur randomly across the genome.
a total of  <dig> evolutionary breakpoint intervals were identified and these were mapped to a median resolution of  <dig> kb, the highest level of resolution so far obtained.
gene synteny analysis  not only greatly reduces the complexity of comparative genome sequence analysis but also extends its evolutionary reach.
primate-specific chromosomal rearrangements were however found to occur preferentially in regions containing segmental duplications and copy number variants.
contrary to previous findings, a comparison of evolutionary breakpoint locations with the chromosomal positions of well mapped common fragile sites and cancer-associated breakpoints failed to reveal any evidence for significant co-location.
this served to confirm our previous model of the ancestral eutherian genome since all ancestral syntenic segment associations were also noted in this marsupial.
a marked correlation was noted between evolutionary breakpoint frequency and gene density.
