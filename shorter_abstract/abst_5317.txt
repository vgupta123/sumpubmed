even though lps is a modulator of plant defense responses, reports of interstrain variation in lps gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria are rare.
one end of the bxo <dig> lps gene cluster, comprised of ten genes, is also present in the related rice pathogen, x. oryzae pv.
in xoc, the remainder of the lps gene cluster, consisting of seven genes, is novel and unrelated to lps gene clusters of any of the sequenced xanthomonads.
our analyses indicate that hgt has altered the lps locus during the evolution of xanthomonas oryzae pathovars and suggest that the ancestor of all xanthomonas oryzae pathovars had an xac type of lps gene cluster.
we also report substantial interstrain variation suggestive of very recent horizontal gene transfer  at the lps biosynthetic locus of xanthomonas campestris pv.
surprisingly, except for one orf, all the other orfs at the bxo <dig> lps locus are orthologous to the genes present at this locus in a sequenced strain of x. axonopodis pv.
in this study we report the complete sequence of a variant  <dig>  kb lps locus present in the bxo <dig> strain of xanthomonas oryzae pv.
variation at the interstrain level is common in lps biosynthetic gene clusters of animal pathogenic bacteria.
this region is completely different in size, number and organization of genes from the lps locus present in most other strains of xoo from india and asia.
our finding of interstrain variation in two major xanthomonad pathogens infecting different hosts suggests that the lps locus in plant pathogenic bacteria, as in animal pathogens, is under intense diversifying selection.
lipopolysaccharide  is a pathogen associated molecular pattern  of animal and plant pathogenic bacteria.
