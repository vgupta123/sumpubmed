fusion of lipid bilayer of endosomal compartment was significant at ph  <dig>  when fusogenic peptides  were incubated in membrane vesicle, thus facilitating the escape of sirna complex to the host cytoplasm in order to silence myd <dig> transcript .
outer membrane vesicle from escherichia coli used for sirna delivery was observed more efficient when attached with invasive protein ail along with ompa  in hek293-tlr <dig> cell line.

here we report a bi-specific sirna based complex which differentially activates and silences the tlr <dig> and myd <dig> respectively in a negatively regulated fashion.
for the cases of auto immune disease and inflammation where over activation of endosomal tlrs poses serious threat, bi specific sirna could be used as negative feedback controlled system.
