the response of the trout, o. mykiss, head kidney to bacterial lipopolysaccharide  or active and attenuated infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus  intraperitoneal challenge,  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-injection, was investigated using a salmonid-specific cdna microarray.
in fish infected with ihnv a loss of cellular function including signal transduction, cell cycle and transcriptional activity  <dig> hours after infection reflects the tissue-specific pathology of ihnv infection.
the viral response at the early stage of infection highlights a suppression of hematopoietic and protein biosynthetic function and a stimulation of immune response.
attihnv treatment on the other hand shows a similar pattern to native ihnv infection at  <dig> hours however at  <dig> hours a divergence from the viral response is seen and replace with a recovery response more similar to that observed for lps is observed.
the head kidney response to i.p.
this type of analysis will lead to a greater understanding of the physiological response and the development of effective immune responses in salmonid fish to different pathogenic and pro-inflammatory agents.
