docking followed by inhibitor verification using the pnpp assay identified a series of polysulfonated aromatic inhibitors that occupy the dusp <dig> active site in the region that is likely occupied by the dual-phosphorylated erk <dig> substrate tripeptide .
polysulfonated aromatic compounds do not commonly appear in drugs and have a tendency to aggregate.
secondary assays were performed with full length dusp <dig> with erk <dig> as substrate.
dual-specificity phosphatase- <dig>  plays a central role in vascular development and disease.
we present a p-nitrophenol phosphate  based enzymatic assay to screen for inhibitors of the phosphatase domain of dusp <dig>
pnpp is a mimic of the phosphorylated tyrosine on the erk <dig> substrate  and binds the dusp <dig> phosphatase domain with a km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm.
while suramin appears to be a potent and competitive inhibitor , binding to the dusp <dig> phosphatase domain more tightly than the monomeric ligands of which it is comprised, it also aggregates.
the new dusp <dig> inhibitors we identify in this study typically have sulfonates 7 Å apart, likely positioning them where the two phosphates of the substrate peptide  bind, with one inhibitor also positioning a phenolic hydroxyl where the water nucleophile may reside.
