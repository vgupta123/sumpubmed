bioinformatic analysis of the genomes of a wide range of species suggests that the identity of xndr and trpc <dig> as distinct genes is conserved among vertebrates.
3'-located exons comprise bona fide trpc <dig> whilst 5'-located exons, previously identified as part of trpc <dig>  comprise a distinct gene, which we term xndr .
strong expression of trpc <dig> was detected only after about day  <dig> post-partum, suggesting that the vno may not be functional during early pouch life of the tammar.
both vrs have a common receptor activation cascade involving transient receptor potential channel, subfamily c, member  <dig> .
the former is widely expressed with a putative role in dna repair, while the latter shows vno-specific expression under the probable regulation of nhlh <dig>
the vomeronasal organ  detects pheromones via two large families of vomeronasal receptors: vomeronasal receptor  <dig>  and vomeronasal receptor  <dig> .
we characterised the trpc <dig> locus in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby , and identified two independently regulated genes not previously recognised as distinct.
