dna quality was assessed based on spectrophotometric measurements, dna detectability by pcr, and dna integrity by gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analyses.
several parameters were tested in a step-wise manner, including blood extraction, cell lysis, protein digestion, and dna precipitation, purification and elution.
neonatal dried blood spots  represent an inexpensive method for long-term biobanking worldwide and are considered gold mines for research for several human diseases, including those of metabolic, infectious, genetic and epigenetic origin.
this study may prove useful to meet the increased demand for research on prenatal, particularly epigenetic, origins of human diseases and for newborn screening programs, all of which are often based on dna extracted from dbs.
