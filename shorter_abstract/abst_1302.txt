this regime gave similarly good results on four additional plant genomes of very different gc and repeat contents.
we investigate if pooling bac clones and sequencing the pools can provide for more accurate assembly of genome sequences than the "whole genome shotgun"  approach.
bac pooling works better than wgs, however, both require a physical map to order the scaffolds.
our scoring measures can be used generally to evaluate and compare results of simulated genome assemblies.
bac pooling improved assembly scores over wgs assembly, coverage and redundancy scores improving the most.
standard measures of assembly quality focus on assembly size and fragmentation, which are desirable for large whole genome assemblies.
assuming the current roche/ <dig> titanium sequencing limitations, a  <dig> mbp region could be re-sequenced with a full plate of linear reads and a half plate of paired-end reads, yielding 15l-5p coverage after read pre-processing.
we propose additional measures enabling easy and visual comparison of assembly quality, such as rearrangements and redundant sequence content, relative to the known target sequence.
the best assembly quality scores were obtained using  <dig> coverage of 15× linear and 5× paired  reads  on arabidopsis.
