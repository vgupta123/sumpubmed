in vivo blockade of the il- <dig> receptor  with a neutralizing antibody resulted in a shorter time to death that was independent of parasite density and was particularly marked for normally avirulent clones.
here we studied the effects of immunopathology on infection-induced host mortality rate and lifetime transmission potential – key components of parasite fitness – using the rodent malaria model, plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi.
most theoretical models of virulence evolution assume that virulence arises as a direct consequence of host exploitation, the process whereby parasites convert host resources into transmission opportunities.
this is the first experimental study to demonstrate that infection-induced immunopathology and parasite genetic variability may together have the potential to shape virulence evolution.
despite the increased investment in transmission-stage parasites observed for some clones in response to il-10r blockade, experimental enhancement of immunopathology incurred a uniform fitness cost to all parasite clones by reducing lifetime transmission potential.
little is known about how immunopathology affects parasite fitness, or how it will affect the evolution of parasite virulence.
explaining parasite virulence  represents a major challenge for evolutionary and biomedical scientists alike.
this suggests that il- <dig> induction may provide a pathway to avirulence for p. c. chabaudi.
