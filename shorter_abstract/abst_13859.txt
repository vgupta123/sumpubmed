we also characterized five potentially pathogenic brain-reactive autoantibodies, as well as suggested possible brain targets.
we used the well-characterized mrl/lpr lupus animal model in two studies as a first step to develop and evaluate future studies in humans.
these results indicate that immunosignaturing could predict and diagnose lupus and its cns manifestations.
in study one we identified possible diagnostic peptides for both lupus and altered behavior in the forced swim test.
in this study we investigated whether serum autoantibody binding patterns on random-sequence peptide microarrays  can be used for diagnosing and predicting the onset of lupus and its central nervous system  manifestations.
when comparing the results of study one to that of study two , we further identified potential peptides that may be diagnostic and predictive of both lupus and altered behavior in the forced swim test.
an accurate method that can diagnose and predict lupus and its neuropsychiatric manifestations is essential since currently there are no reliable methods.
we also tested the techniques for identifying potentially pathogenic autoantibodies in cns-lupus.
it can also be used to characterize pathogenic autoantibodies, which may help to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cns-lupus.
