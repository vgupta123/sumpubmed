aria was extended with a series of graphical tools to facilitate a detailed analysis of the intermediate and final results of the aria protocol.
the graphical tools and outputs described here significantly extend the validation and analysis possibilities of noe assignments given by aria as well as the analysis of the quality of the final structure ensemble.
it is based on simultaneously calculating structures and assigning noe through an iterative protocol.
these additional features provide  an interactive contact map, serving as a tool for the analysis of assignments, and  graphical representations of structure quality scores and restraint statistics.
profiles of quality scores are plotted along the protein sequence, and contact maps provide information of the agreement with the data on a residue pair level.
the interactive contact map between residues can be clicked to obtain information about the restraints and their contributions.
the ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment  approach is widely used for nmr structure determination.
