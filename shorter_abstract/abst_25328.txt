they are responsible for the antigenic diversity detected with polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody raised against isotype i. ligand binding by recombinant fnbpb n <dig> isotypes was compared by elisa-based solid phase assays and surface plasmon resonance.
the variation in fnbpa and fnbpb occurs in human and bovine s. aureus strains and may act as an immune evasion mechanism.
here, fnbpb variation was examined in both human and bovine isolates and compared to that of fnbpa.
this raises the possibility that the a domain of fnbpb contains a novel fibronectin binding motif that binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism.
the phylogeny of fnbb alleles does not match the phylogeny of fnba alleles.
some fnbpa and fnbpb isotypes that are specified by human s. aureus strains are also found in bovine strains.
these results have implications for the development of vaccines or immunotherapeutics that target fnbpb
fibronectin binding proteins a and b  mediate adhesion of s. aureus to fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin.
each bound to immobilized fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin dose-dependently and saturably with similar affinities.
the seven fnbb allelic variants encode seven distinct isotypes of the fnbpb a domain that are  <dig> to 85% identical in amino acid sequence.
some strains that cluster by phylogenetic analysis contain different fnbb variants, whereas more divergent strains contain the same fnbb variant.
