g1 + hbp is a male sterile cybrid line with nuclear genome from hirado buntan pummelo   and mitochondrial genome from “guoqing no.1” , which provides a good opportunity to study male sterility and nuclear-cytoplasmic cross talk in citrus.
our study reveals the altered expression of mirnas and their target genes in a male sterile line of pummelo and highlights that mirna regulatory network may be involved in floral bud development and cytoplasmic male sterility in citrus.
high-throughput srna and degradome sequencing were applied to identify mirnas and their targets in g1 + hbp and its fertile type hbp during reproductive development.
based on the sequencing abundance,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas between sterile line g1 + hbp and fertile line hbp were identified.
eight target genes were confirmed to be sliced by corresponding mirnas using 5’ race technology.
a total of  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> target genes were identified.
differential expression of mirnas and their target genes between two lines was validated by quantitative rt-pcr, and reciprocal expression patterns between some mirnas and their targets were demonstrated.
the regulatory mechanism of mir167a was investigated by yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays that one dehydrate responsive element binding  transcription factor binds to mir167a promoter and transcriptionally repress mir <dig> expression.
some of the targets are transcription factors involved in floral development, such as auxin response factors , squamosa promoter binding protein box , myb, basic region-leucine zipper , apetala <dig>  and transport inhibitor response  <dig> .
