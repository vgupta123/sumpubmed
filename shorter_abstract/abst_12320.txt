in a boolean network, nodes represent biological entities such as genes, proteins or protein complexes, and edges indicate activating or inhibiting influences of one node towards another.
depending on the input of activators or inhibitors, boolean networks categorize nodes as either active or inactive.
a central aim of boolean network analysis is the determination of attractors .
we present lnet, a software package which, in fully asynchronous updating mode and without any network reduction, detects the fixed states of boolean networks with up to  <dig> nodes and a good part of any present cycles for networks with up to half the above number of nodes.
lnet is a software package that facilitates the analysis of large boolean networks.
importantly, inherent in cycle detection is a classification scheme based on the number of non-frozen nodes of the cycle member states, with cycles characterized by fewer non-frozen nodes being easier to detect.
it is further argued that these detectable cycles are also the biologically more important ones.
the algorithm goes through a complete enumeration of the states of appropriately selected subspaces of the entire network state space.
