although there were refinement artifacts in these structures, comparison with the electron-density maps allowed the placement of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen bonds.
despite the many libraries of sidechain rotamers that have been developed, a number of rotamers have been overlooked, due to the fact that they involve hydrogen atoms.
we identify new, well-populated rotamers that involve the hydroxyl-hydrogen atoms of ser, thr and tyr, and the sulfhydryl-hydrogen atom of cys, using high-resolution crystal structures .
similar rotamers are found in hydrogen atoms that were computationally placed with the reduce program from the richardson lab.
