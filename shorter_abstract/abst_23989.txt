the ascomycete fungus ophiostoma ulmi was responsible for the initial pandemic of the massively destructive dutch elm disease in europe and north america in early  <dig>  dutch elm disease has ravaged the elm tree population globally and is a major threat to the remaining elm population.
the quality of the predicted genes was validated using a variety of data sources consisting of est data, mrna-seq data and orthologs from related fungal species.
this genome sequence will be a useful resource for further research aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity by o. ulmi.
o. ulmi is also associated with valuable biomaterials applications.
it was recently discovered that proteins from o. ulmi can be used for efficient transformation of amylose in the production of bioplastics.
