several computational models have recently been developed to integrate gene features and used as alternatives to transfer gene essentiality annotations between organisms.
we first collected features that were widely used by previous predictive models and assessed the relationships between gene features and gene essentiality using a stepwise regression model.
we found two issues that could significantly reduce model accuracy:  the effect of multicollinearity among gene features and  the diverse and even contrasting correlations between gene features and gene essentiality existing within and among different species.

to address these issues, we developed a novel model called feature-based weighted na誰ve bayes model , which is based on na誰ve bayes classifiers, logistic regression, and genetic algorithm.
the performance of fwm was compared with other popular models, such as support vector machine, na誰ve bayes model, and logistic regression model, by applying fwm to reciprocally predict essential genes among and within  <dig> species.
determination of the minimum gene set for cellular life is one of the central goals in biology.
our results showed that fwm significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of essential gene prediction.
genome-wide essential gene identification has progressed rapidly in certain bacterial species; however, it remains difficult to achieve in most eukaryotic species.
fwm can remarkably improve the accuracy of essential gene prediction and may be used as an alternative method for other classification work.
