in the present study, we propose a kernel-based approach to efficiently identify core regulatory elements involved in specific biological processes using gene expression profiles.
we developed a framework that can detect correlations between gene expression profiles and the upstream sequences on the basis of the kernel canonical correlation analysis .
one of the major challenges in gene regulation studies is to identify regulators affecting the expression of their target genes in specific biological processes.
given expression profiles, our method was able to identify regulatory motifs involved in specific biological processes.
our results showed that the cell cycle-specific regulatory motifs could be found successfully based on the motif weights derived through kernel cca.
using a yeast cell cycle dataset, we demonstrated that upstream sequence patterns were closely related to gene expression profiles based on the canonical correlation scores obtained by measuring the correlation between them.
gene regulation is a key mechanism in higher eukaryotic cellular processes.
