overall, our results demonstrate the extent to which canine mammary carcinoma cells influence the macrophage phenotype and the relevance of a feedback loop between these cells, involving csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> as important mediators.
canine mammary carcinoma is the most common cancer in female dogs and is often fatal due to the development of distance metastasis.
tams express an activated phenotype, termed m <dig>  which sustains proliferation of cancer cells, and has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes in human cancer patients.
cancer cells themselves have been implicated in stimulating the conversion of macrophages to a tam with an m <dig> phenotype.
here we investigate the interplay between cancer cells and macrophages in the context of canine mammary carcinoma.
we show that cancer cells inhibit lipopolysaccharide -induced macrophage activation.
further, we show that macrophage associated proteins, colony-stimulating factor - <dig> and c-c motif ligand - <dig>  stimulate macrophages andÂ are responsible for the effects of cancer cells on macrophages.
we suggest the existence of a feedback loop between macrophages and cancer cells; while cancer cells influence the phenotype of the tams through csf- <dig> and ccl <dig>  the macrophages induce canine mammary cancer cells to upregulate their own expression of the receptors for csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> and increase the cancer cellular metabolic activity.
