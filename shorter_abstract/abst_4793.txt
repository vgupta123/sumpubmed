this work demonstrates the importance of studying network motifs in multi-cellular systems.
this was accomplished using a synthetic network expressed in the drosophila melanogaster embryo using the yeast proteins gal <dig>  and gal <dig> .
the capacity of a network motif to exhibit different phenotypes due to minor changes to the network in multi-cellular systems was shown.
we sought to understand the functionality of one of these network motifs, negative feedback, in a multi-cellular system.
mathematical modeling was used to demonstrate the capacity for negative feedback to produce these varying outputs.
