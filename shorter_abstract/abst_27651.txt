we have undertaken such an analysis of voltage-gated potassium channels, a transmembrane protein family whose members play indispensable roles in electrically excitable cells.
however, residues that vary can also be critically important if their variation is responsible for diversity of protein function and improved phenotypes.
if too few sequences are studied, the support for hypotheses on the role of a given residue will be weak, but analysis of large multiple alignments is too complex for simple inspection.
we applied different learning algorithms, combined in various implementations, to obtain a model that predicts the half activation voltage of a voltage-gated potassium channel based on its amino acid sequence.
machine learning analysis can identify new testable hypotheses about the structure/function relationship in the voltage-gated potassium channel family.
the predictor was validated by permutation test and evaluation of independent experimental data.
when a large body of sequence and functional data are available for a protein family, mature data mining tools, such as machine learning, can be applied to extract information more easily, sensitively and reliably.
the best result was obtained with a k-nearest neighbor classifier combined with a wrapper algorithm for feature selection, producing a mean absolute error of prediction of  <dig>  mv.
many functionally important residues of proteins can be identified because they are conserved during evolution.
studies of the structure-function relationship in proteins for which no 3d structure is available are often based on inspection of multiple sequence alignments.
