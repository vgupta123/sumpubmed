increased nucleotide diversity distinguished the human sdha gene from its chimpanzee ortholog and from the pgl genes.
two highly dissimilar sdha haplotype clusters were present in intermediate frequencies in both racial groups.
sequence analysis uncovered two common sdha missense variants and refuted the previous suggestions that these variants originate from different genetic loci.
empirically, the elevated values of the nucleotide diversity  and the tajima statistics  in the sdha gene were comparable with the most outstanding cases for balancing selection in the african american population.
the sdha variation pattern showed statistically significant deviations from neutrality by the tajima, fu and li, hudson-kreitman-aguad√©, and depaulis haplotype number tests.
the sdha variants that have increased in frequency during human evolution might, by influencing the regulation of cellular oxygen homeostasis, confer protection against certain environmental toxins or pathogens that are prevalent in africa.
in this report, we provide statistical and comparative genetic evidence suggesting that the sdha gene is under long-term balancing selection.
we also sequenced the sdha gene  in  <dig> chimpanzees.
the sdha gene has a strong signature of balancing selection.
in contrast, heterozygous mutations in sdhb, sdhc, and sdhd, the other sdh subunit genes, cause hereditary paraganglioma  tumors, which show constitutive activation of pathways induced by oxygen deprivation .
we sequenced the four sdh subunit genes  in  <dig> african american and  <dig> european american samples.
