similarity searches of the phage orfeome  against prokaryotic genomes shows that almost half of the phage orfs have prokaryotic homologs, suggesting the major role that horizontal transfer plays in bacterial evolution.
although the current sampling of viral genomes is extremely low, orfans and near-orfans are likely to continue to grow in number as more genomes are sequenced.
genome-wide studies have already shed light into the evolution and enormous diversity of the viral world.
like prokaryotic orfans, viral orfans are shorter and have a lower gc content than non-orfans.
nevertheless, a statistically significant lower gc content is found only on a minority of viruses.
surprisingly, the percentage of phage orfans with prokaryotic homologs is only  <dig> %.
this suggests that phage orfans play a lesser role in horizontal transfer to prokaryotes, but may be among the major players contributing to the vast phage diversity.
the abundance of phage orfans may be partially due to the expected vast viral diversity, and may be instrumental in understanding viral evolution.
recently, studies attempting to understand the origin and functions of bacterial orfans have been reported.
by focusing on phages, we find that  <dig> % of phage orfs have no homologs in other phages, and  <dig> % have no homologs neither in the viral nor in the prokaryotic world.
nevertheless, one of the unresolved mysteries in comparative genomics today is the abundance of orfans â€“ orfs with no detectable sequence similarity to any other orf in the databases.
the functions, origins and fates of the majority of viral orfans remain a mystery.
further computational and experimental studies are likely to shed light on the mechanisms that have given rise to so many bacterial and viral orfans.
here we present a first genome-wide identification and analysis of orfans in the viral world, with focus on bacteriophages.
