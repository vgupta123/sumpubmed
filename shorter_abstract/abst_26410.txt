besides the amazon ec <dig> cloud, we have started instances of cloud biolinux on a private eucalyptus cloud installed at the j. craig venter institute, and demonstrated access to the bioinformatic tools interface through a remote connection to ec <dig> instances from a local desktop computer.
documentation for using cloud biolinux on ec <dig> is available from our project website, while a eucalyptus cloud image and virtualbox appliance is also publicly available for download and use by researchers with access to private clouds.
users have instant access to a range of pre-configured command line and graphical software applications, including a full-featured desktop interface, documentation and over  <dig> bioinformatics packages for applications including sequence alignment, clustering, assembly, display, editing, and phylogeny.
cloud biolinux is a publicly accessible virtual machine  that enables scientists to quickly provision on-demand infrastructures for high-performance bioinformatics computing using cloud platforms.
cloud biolinux provides a platform for developing bioinformatics infrastructures on the cloud.
each tool's functionality is fully described in the documentation directly accessible from the graphical interface of the vm.
