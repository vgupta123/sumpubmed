transcription factors play an important role in orchestrating the regulation of gene expression.
the approach was validated by means of alternative statistical methods and biological validation.
as an illustrative example, we applied rlq methodology to analyze transcription factor activity associated with the time-course effect of steroids on the growth of primary human lung fibroblasts.
rlq could successfully predict transcription factor activity, and could integrate various other sources of external information in the main frame of the analysis.
rlq provides an efficient way of extracting and visualizing structures present in a gene expression dataset by directly modeling the link between experimental variables and gene annotations.
interpretation of gene expression microarray data in the light of external information on both columns and rows  facilitates the extraction of pertinent information hidden in these complex data.
their activity can be deduced by examining the presence of putative transcription factors binding sites in the gene promoter regions.
in this paper we present the multivariate statistical method rlq which aims to analyze microarray data where additional information is available on both genes and samples.
