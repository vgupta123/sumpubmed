based on this system, oric regions have been predicted for the bacterial genomes available in genbank currently.
output of the predicted results is exported to an html report, which offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats.
we have developed ori-finder, an online system for finding orics in bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the z-curve method, distribution of dnaa boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to orics.
therefore, the increasing availability of genome sequences calls for improved software to identify orics in newly sequenced and unannotated bacterial genomes.
it is hoped that ori-finder will become a useful tool for the identification and analysis of orics in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.
identification of replication origins  is necessary for almost all newly sequenced bacterial genomes.
a web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial genomes has been presented here.
