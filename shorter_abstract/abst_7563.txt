the multiplex hrm-qpcr allowed accurate analysis when the total gene copy number of targets was more than 1 ×  <dig> / g wet feces and the hrm curves were able to simultaneously distinguish fimbriae genes in the fecal samples.
five fimbriae expressed by etec were amplified in multiple hrm-qpcr reactions to allow simultaneous identification and quantification of five target genes.
the relative quantification of the most abundant f <dig> based on melting peak area was highly correlated  with that of individual qpcr result but the correlation for less abundant fimbriae was much lower.
diagnosis of enterotoxigenic e. coli  associated diarrhea is complicated by the diversity of e.coli virulence factors.
it correctly indicated the predominant fimbriae type and additionally provides information of presence/ absence of other fimbriae types and it could find broad applications for pathogen diagnosis.
the suitability of the method was evaluated using  <dig> samples from weaned pigs aged 6–7 weeks;  <dig> of these animals suffered from diarrhea in consequence of poor sanitary conditions.
this study developed a multiplex quantitative pcr assay based on high-resolution melting curves analysis  to identify and quantify genes encoding five etec fimbriae related to diarrhea in swine, i.e.
