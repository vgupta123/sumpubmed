the link between the synonymous substitution rate and clade size is consistent with a role for the mutation rate of chloroplasts driving the speed of reproductive isolation.
here, in order to investigate how widespread this phenomenon is, we investigate patterns of substitution in chloroplast genomes of the diverse angiosperm family proteaceae.
we show that the rate of molecular evolution in chloroplast genomes is correlated with net diversification rates in this large plant family.
we discuss the possible causes of this relationship, including molecular evolution driving diversification, speciation increasing the rate of substitutions, or a third factor causing an indirect link between molecular and diversification rates.
we find no significant differences in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions between lineages differing in net diversification rate, therefore we detect no signal of population size changes or alteration in selection pressures that might be causing this relationship.
using phylogenetically-independent sister pairs, we show that species-rich lineages of proteaceae tend to have significantly higher chloroplast substitution rates, for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions.
analysis of many molecular phylogenies has also revealed correlations between substitution rates and clade size, suggesting a link between rates of molecular evolution and the process of diversification.
many factors have been identified as correlates of the rate of molecular evolution, such as body size and generation length.
we used dna sequences from six chloroplast genes  to test for a correlation between diversification and the rate of substitutions.
