recent studies have suggested that passive viewing of emotion eliciting images results in postural adjustments, which become manifest as changes in body center of pressure  trajectories.
the results are consistent with current knowledge about the neuroanatomical organization of the emotion system and the neural control of behavior.
these subjects rated the unpleasant images as significantly less pleasant than neutral images, and the pleasant images as significantly more pleasant than neutral images.
the images were adopted from the international affective picture system .
the mean position of the cop was unaffected by emotion, but unipedal stance resulted in overall greater body sway than bipedal stance.
thirty-four healthy subjects passively viewed a series of emotion eliciting images, while standing either in a bipedal or unipedal stance on a force plate.
we found a modest effect of emotion on cop: viewing pictures of mutilation resulted in a smaller sway path, but only in unipedal stance.
we obtained valence and arousal ratings of the images with an independent sample of viewers.
