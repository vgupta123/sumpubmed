alu elements occupy about eleven percent of the human genome and are still growing in copy numbers.
a comparison of the alu sequence data, obtained by courtesy of dr. jerzy jurka, with our model shows that the distributions of alu sequences in the aluy family systematically deviate from the expected distribution derived from the branching process.
this observation suggests that alu sequences do not evolve neutrally and might be under selection.
since alu elements substantially impact the shape of our genome, there is a need for modeling the amplification, mutation and selection forces of these elements.
