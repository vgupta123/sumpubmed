all isolates resistant to clindamycin were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and were distributed in the capsular types iii and v. one isolate showed the constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b  phenotype and ten showed the inducible mlsb  phenotype.
all isolates harbored the gene hylb and at least one pilus variant, pi- <dig>  pi-2a or pi-2b.
our results indicate the potential virulence of commensal gbs isolates, reinforcing the need for continued screening for this bacterium to prevent infections.
a total of  <dig> multiple locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis  types were identified among the isolates, seven were singletons and eight were represented by more than four isolates.
the isolates displaying resistance only to erythromycin belonged to capsular type ia, and showed the m phenotype, which was mediated by the mefa/e gene.
capsular types ia , ii , iii  and v  were identified in most gbs.
this study aimed to characterize gbs isolates from women of reproductive age seen at university hospital of londrina, according to capsular typing, genetic relatedness, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and occurrence of virulence determinants.
streptococcus agalactiae or group b streptococci  have the ability to access various host sites, which reflects its adaptability to different environments during the course of infection.
one isolate each was classified as type ix and non-typeable.
this adaptation is due to the expression of virulence factors that are involved with survival, invasion and bacterial persistence in the host.
