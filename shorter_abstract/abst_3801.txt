in addition, native routes are also well characterized within pathways, suggesting that reasonable paths should not involve too many pathway switches.
the metabolic network is an aggregation of enzyme catalyzed reactions that converts one compound to another.
paths in a metabolic network are a sequence of enzymes that describe how a chemical compound of interest can be produced in a biological system.
we propose a path weighting method cmpf  to search for routes in a metabolic network which minimizes pathway switching.
this suggests that paths ranked by our method could be a way to predict paths that are likely to occur in biological systems.
in addition, we also show that native paths are recoverable and alternative paths deviates less from native paths compared to other methods.
