using a gfp reporter assay, it was demonstrated that brb cooperates with both brz and bat proteins to activate bop transcription under phototrophic growth conditions.
the translation activity of the start codon of the brb gene was confirmed by bgah reporter assays.
in vivo site-directed mutagenesis of the brb gene showed that the brb protein cooperates with brz in the regulation of bop expression.
the halophilic archaeon halobacterium salinarum expresses bacteriorhodopsin, a retinal-protein that allows photosynthetic growth.
a new gene was identified that is transcribed together with the brz gene that encodes a small basic protein designated as brb .
the activation of the bop promoter was shown to be dependent not only on two major factors, bat and brz, but is also tuned by the small basic protein, brb.
transcription of the bop  gene is controlled by two transcription factors, bat and brz that induce bop when cells are grown anaerobically and under light.
