for each spot we estimate the ratio of measured fluorescence intensities revealing differential gene expression or change in dna copy numbers between the test and control samples.
although dna microarray technologies are very powerful for the simultaneous quantitative characterization of thousands of genes, the quality of the obtained experimental data is often far from ideal.
it is assumed that unspoiled replicated spots must have very close ratios, whereas poor spots yield greater diversity in the obtained ratio estimates.
quality values assigned to each spot can be used either to eliminate spots or to weight contribution of each ratio estimate in follow-up analysis procedures.
spot quality control is an essential part of microarray image analysis, which must be carried out at the level of individual spot identification.
the problem is difficult to formalize due to the diversity of instrumental and biological factors that can influence the result.
we have developed a training procedure to evaluate the contribution of each individual characteristic in the overall quality.
we also define a set of quality characteristics and a model for combining these characteristics into an overall spot quality value.
