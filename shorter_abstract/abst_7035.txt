diversity of the scfvs constituting the library was limited due to the frequent presence, within the genes intended to be part of the library, of restriction sites utilized for its construction.
for the first time however, an igg  recently isolated by hybridoma technology and targeting the bont/a light chain , was shown to inhibit bont/a endopeptidase activity and protect in vivo against bont/a.
in the present study, a phage-displayed library was constructed from a macaque  hyper-immunized with bonta/l in order to isolate scfvs inhibiting bont/a endopeptidase activity for clinical use.
scfv 2h <dig> inhibited toxin endopeptidase activity in vitro and possessed human-like quality required for clinical development.
the sequence encoding 2h <dig> was 88% identical to human germline genes and its average g-score was - <dig> , quantifying the high human-like quality of 2h <dig>
more generally, the construction and screening of phage-displayed libraries built from hyper-immunized non-human primates is an efficient solution to isolate antibody fragments with therapeutic potential.
after screening with several rounds of increasing stringency, as is usual with phage technology, the library got overwhelmed by phagemids encoding incomplete scfvs.
several antibodies neutralizing bont/a by targeting its heavy chain  have been isolated in the past.
botulinum neurotoxin a , mainly represented by subtype a <dig>  is the most toxic substance known.
the screening was successfully re-performed with a single round of high stringency.
