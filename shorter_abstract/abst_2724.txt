in both models we observed a significant reduction of egfr expression at the protein but not mrna level.
we have investigated the effect on egfr levels after ablating the two catalytic subunits, cα and cβ in two different models.
our results suggest that pka may represent a target that when manipulated can maintain egfr protein levels at the single cell level as well as in intact animals.
the first model used targeted disruption of either cα or cβ in mice whereas the second model used cα and cβ rna interference in hela cells.
