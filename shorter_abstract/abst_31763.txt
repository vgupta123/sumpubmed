in this study, we integrated genomic, biochemical, and cellular studies to gain deep insight into carotenoid-related biological processes in citrus calli overexpressing crtb .
fortunella hindsii swingle  and malus hupehensis  calli were also utilized as supporting systems to investigate the effect of altered carotenoid accumulation on carotenoid-related biological processes.
transcriptomic analysis provided deep insight into the carotenoid-related biological processes of redox status, starch metabolism, and flavonoid/anthocyanin accumulation.
we also ascertained a decline in starch accumulation in carotenoid-rich calli.
in citrus, altered carotenoid accumulation resulted in dramatic effects on metabolic processes involved in redox modification, starch degradation, and flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis.
these findings provided new perspectives to understand the biological importance of carotenogenesis and of the developmental processes associated with the nutritional and sensory qualities of agricultural products that accumulate carotenoids.
by applying biochemical and cytological analyses, we determined that the altered redox status was associated with variations in o2- and h2o <dig> levels.
moreover, studying anthocyanin-rich malus hupehensis calli showed a negative effect of carotenoids on anthocyanin accumulation.
carotenoids are likely involved in other biological functions that have yet to be discovered.
furthermore, via an extensive cellular investigation of the newly constructed crtb overexpressing fortunella hindsii swingle, we demonstrated that starch level reducation occurred in parallel with significant carotenoid accumulation.
carotenoids are indispensable plant secondary metabolites that are involved in photosynthesis, antioxidation, and phytohormone biosynthesis.
