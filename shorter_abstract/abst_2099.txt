moreover, in addition to proving that in two-component systems three steady states are necessary for bistability , we also present a simple general method to design such systems: one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms .
we discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for bistability: two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable 'off' state, and the fourth reaction prevents explosions.
the minimal bistable system contains two reactants and four irreversible reactions .
the presented minimal bistable system finally clarifies the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for bistability.
this is important for modelling bistability with simple systems and for synthetically designing new bistable systems.
so far biologists identified two necessary conditions for bistability: positive feedback and ultrasensitivity.
the three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions.
according to our definition, it contains the minimal number of  reactants,  reactions, and  terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations .
