we established the transgenic xenopus laevis strain tom <dig> that expresses ubiquitously red fluorescence from the tdtomato gene through all larval stages and in the adult animal.
the blastema can regenerate ectopic tails marked by red fluorescence in the host animal.
fluorescent proteins such as the green fluorescent protein  have widely been used in transgenic animals as reporter genes.
surprisingly, we also found contribution of the host animal to form the regenerate.
we have established a useful new tool to label grafts in xenopus transplantation experiments.
to track more than one event in the same animal, fluorescent markers that clearly differ in their emission spectrum are needed.
this new tool was applied to track transplanted blastemas obtained after tail amputation.
