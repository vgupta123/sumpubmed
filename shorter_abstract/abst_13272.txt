although many statistical methods have been developed to improve either genotype calling or imputation of missing genotypes, treating the two steps independently can lead to loss of genetic information.
then the missing genotypes, i.e., no-calls caused by not perfectly separated signal clouds, are imputed based on the linkage disequilibrium  between multiple snps.
our studies also suggest that jointly analyzing multiple snps in ld provides more accurate estimation of haplotypes than haplotype reconstruction methods that only use called genotypes.
our study demonstrates that jointly analyzing signal intensities and ld structure of multiple snps is a better way to determine genotypes and estimate ld parameters.
the genotypes of snps are first determined one at a time from allele signal intensities.
in this framework, we consider the signal intensities and underlying ld structure of snps simultaneously by estimating both cluster parameters and haplotype frequencies.
genome-wide association studies with single nucleotide polymorphisms  show great promise to identify genetic determinants of complex human traits.
