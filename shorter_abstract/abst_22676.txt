in this work, we develop methods using mutual information  and its property, the data processing inequality , to help characterize associations that were generated based on use of natural language processing to encode clinical information in narrative patient records followed by statistical methods.
the availability of up-to-date, executable, evidence-based medical knowledge is essential for many clinical applications, such as pharmacovigilance, but executable knowledge is costly to obtain and update.
evaluation based on a random sample consisting of two drugs and two diseases indicates an overall precision of 81%.
the usefulness of the association knowledge is limited, however, due to the fact that the specific relationships between clinical entities remain unknown.
this preliminary study demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for helping to characterize phenotypic and environmental associations obtained from clinical reports.
