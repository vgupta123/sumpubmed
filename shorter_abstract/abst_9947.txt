on simulated data we show that statistical properties of the inferred scenarios are closer to the true ones than dcj only scenarios, i.e.
we give a polynomial-time algorithm that, given two genomes with arbitrary intergene size distributions, outputs a dcj scenario which optimizes on the number of dcjs, and given this optimal number of dcjs, optimizes on the total sum of the sizes of the indels.
we show that there is a valuable information in the intergene sizes concerning the rearrangement scenario itself.
scenarios which do not handle intergene sizes.
