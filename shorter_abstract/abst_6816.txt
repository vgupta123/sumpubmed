human cholinesterases can be used as a bioscavenger of organophosphate toxins used as pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents.
acetylcholinesterase accumulated to levels of up to  <dig> % of total soluble protein, ~ <dig> fold higher than the expression level observed in the parental plant.
our results support the feasibility of using plant organ cultures as a successful alternative to traditional transgenic plant and mammalian cell culture technologies.
as a promising alternative, we report the creation of "hairy root" organ cultures derived via agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation from human acetylcholinesterase-expressing transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants.
acetylcholinesterase-expressing hairy root cultures had a slower growth rate, reached to the stationary phase faster and grew to lower maximal densities as compared to wild type control cultures.
