over the last  <dig> years since the original publication in  <dig>  the c. elegans genome has been scrutinized and the last gaps were filled in november  <dig>  which present a unique opportunity for examining genome-wide segmental duplications.
here, we performed analysis of the c. elegans genome in search for segmental duplications using a new tool–orthocluster–we have recently developed.
in fact, only  <dig> strains carry this large segmental duplication, suggesting a very recent duplication event in the c. elegans genome.
the largest pair of duplicons,  <dig> kb in length located on the left arm of chromosome v, was further characterized.
they are nearly identical at the dna level  and each duplicon contains  <dig> putative protein coding genes.
genotyping of  <dig> wild-type strains obtained from different labs in the c. elegans community revealed that not all strains contain this duplication.
