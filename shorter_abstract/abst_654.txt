mtt conversion was greater in bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs after  <dig> and 21Â days of differentiation; alp activity was greater in differentiated ad-mscs on day 7; collagen synthesis was greater in bm-mscs on days  <dig> and 21; the percentage of mineralized area per field was greater in bm-mscs compared to ad-mscs; osterix expression was greater in bm-mscs in days  <dig> and  <dig>  and bsp and oc expression levels were greater in bm-mscs at all the investigation time-points.
the aim of the present study was to compare the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells extracted from the bone marrow  and adipose tissue  of young dogs.
it was concluded that the osteogenic potential was greater in bm-mscs than ad-mscs when extracted from young dogs.
