this section includes an annotation pipeline for uploaded viral contigs  and an extensive comparison between contigs and reference genomes.
first, all metavir tools have been adapted to support comparative analysis of viromes in order to improve the analysis of multiple datasets.
following recent advances in sequencing technologies, new challenges arise for existing bioinformatic tools dedicated to viral metagenome  analysis as  the number of viromes is rapidly growing and  large genomic fragments can now be obtained by assembling the huge amount of sequence data generated for each metagenome.
to face these challenges, a new version of metavir was developed.
in addition to the sequence comparison previously provided, viromes can now be compared through their k-mer frequencies, their taxonomic compositions, recruitment plots and phylogenetic trees containing sequences from different datasets.
second, a new section has been specifically designed to handle assembled viromes made of thousands of large genomic fragments .
metagenomics, based on culture-independent sequencing, is a well-fitted approach to provide insights into the composition, structure and dynamics of environmental viral communities.
