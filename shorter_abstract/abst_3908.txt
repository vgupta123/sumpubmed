although biochemical studies have demonstrated selectivity of are-bps for individual rnas, less certain is the in vivo composition of rna-bp multiprotein complexes and how their composition is affected by signaling events and intracellular localization.
in the current study, we use immuno-fret of endogenous proteins to examine the intracellular localization and interactions of hur and auf <dig> as well as ksrp, tia- <dig>  and hedls.
to this point, using fret and immuno-fret, we have demonstrated that rna-bps can visually colocalize without producing a fret signal.
to explore the physical interactions of rna-bps with are containing rnas, in vitro transcribed cy3-labeled rna was transfected into cells.
these results were compared to those obtained with their exogenously expressed, fluorescently labeled counterparts.
a number of rna binding proteins  bind to a+u rich elements , commonly present within 3'utrs of highly regulated rnas.
