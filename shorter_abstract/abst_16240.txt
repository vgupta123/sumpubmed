the pch prp <dig> mini-intein of penicillium chrysogenum was modified to include: 1) aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; 2) imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase, his <dig> from s. pombe ; 3) hygromycin b phosphotransferase; and 4) the transcriptional activator lexa-vp <dig>  the proteins were inserted at the site of the lost endonuclease.
in addition the inteins conferred either g <dig> or hygromycin resistance, or histidine or leucine prototropy, depending on the inserted marker and the yeast genetic background.
when expressed in e. coli, all of the modified inteins spliced at high efficiency.
we have coupled such a genetically marked intein with gfp as the n-terminal extein to create a cassette to introduce gfp within the interior of a targeted protein.
we have shown that a genetically marked intein can be used to insert gfp in one-step within a target protein in vivo.
dna encoding the marked inteins coupled to gfp as the n-terminal extein was pcr amplified with ends homologous to an internal site in the yeast calmodulin gene cmd <dig>  the dna was transformed into yeast and integrants obtained by direct selection for the intein's marker.
we show here that other biochemical activities can be incorporated into an intein in place of the endonuclease without affecting splicing and that these activities can provide genetic selection for the intein.
inteins continue to show their flexibility as tools in molecular biology.
splicing efficiency was also greater than 96% when expressed from a plasmid in s. cerevisiae.
the pch prp <dig> intein can successfully tolerate a variety of genetic markers and still retain high splicing efficiency.
