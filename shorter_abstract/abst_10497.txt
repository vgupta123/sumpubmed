the increases in intracellular calcium produced by poly-aps showed temperature sensitivity with greater responses being observed at 12°c compared to 21°c.
dna condensation was evaluated and hek  <dig> and htta hela cells were used to investigate pore formation and intracellular delivery of cdna, sirna and lucifer yellow.
the aim of this study was to investigate the delivery of dna, sirna and lucifer yellow into cells mediated by poly-aps and its potential mechanisms as compared with other lipofection systems ).
poly-aps mediated pore formation is critical to its activity as a transfection reagent, but lipofection systems utilise distinct mechanisms to enable delivery of dna and sirna into cells.
intracellular delivery of sirna was achieved with knockdown in beta-actin expression when lipofectamine and lipogen were used as transfection reagents.
however, intracellular delivery of sirna was not achieved with poly-aps.
transfection with cdna encoding for the expression enhanced green fluorescent protein was also evaluated at 12°c with poly-aps, lipofectamine and lipogen.
haplosclerid marine sponges produce pore forming polyalkylpyridinium salts , which can be used to deliver macromolecules into cells.
poly-aps and lipogen were both found to be highly efficient dna condensing agents.
