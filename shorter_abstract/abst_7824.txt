principal component analysis, frequently implemented as a singular value decomposition, is a popular technique in this respect.
this yields known sparse approaches as the lasso, the ridge penalty, the elastic net, the group lasso, sparse group lasso, and elitist lasso.
several penalties can be tuned that account in different ways for the block structure present in the integrated data.
the approach offered is flexible and allows to take the block structure in different ways into account.
in addition, the algorithmic results can be easily transposed to the context of regression.
sparse simultaneous component analysis is a useful method for data integration: first, simultaneous analyses of multiple blocks offer advantages over sequential and separate analyses and second, interpretation of the results is highly facilitated by their sparseness.
it includes principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, and ordinary simultaneous component analysis as special cases.
nowadays often the challenge is to reveal structure in several sources of information  that are available for the same biological entities under study.
as such, structures can be found that are exclusively tied to one data platform  as well as structures that involve all data platforms .
simultaneous component methods are most promising in this respect.
we propose a sparse simultaneous component method that makes many of the parameters redundant by shrinking them to zero.
the additional file contains a matlab implementation of the sparse simultaneous component method.
metabolomics data obtained with two measurement platforms for the same set of escherichia coli samples are used to illustrate the proposed methodology and the properties of different penalties with respect to sparseness across and within data blocks.
