using a custom snp microarray we validated  <dig> spgs in a cohort of  <dig> individuals, with every individual genome averaging  <dig> disrupted sequence variations,  <dig> in homozygote form.
we further identified  <dig> or segregating pseudogenes , loci showing both intact and pseudogene forms in the population, twenty-six of which are annotatively “resurrected” from a pseudogene status in the reference genome.
each individual is found to harbor as many as  <dig> or allelic variants, ~50% higher than the locus count.
by performing data-mining from public and private sources we scored genetic variations in  <dig> intact or loci, for which one or more individuals had an intact open reading frame.
because or neuronal expression is allelically excluded, this has direct effect on smell perception diversity of the species.
these results portray a case of unusually high genetic diversity, and suggest that individual humans have a highly personalized inventory of functional olfactory receptors, a conclusion that might apply to other receptor multigene families.
information on nucleotide diversity along completely sequenced human genomes has increased tremendously over the last few years.
