the test showed the effectiveness of the tool in identifying significant relationships between cis-element candidates and related sets of genes.
the tool first lists cis-element candidates by motif searching based on the supposition that if there are cis-elements playing important roles in the regulation of a given set of genes, they will be statistically overrepresented and will be conserved.
this strategy depends on the idea that motifs overrepresented in the promoter region could play specific roles in the regulation of expression of these genes.
then it evaluates the likelihood scores of the listed candidate motifs by association rule analysis.
we evaluated the accuracy and utility of the tool by using a dataset of auxin-inducible genes that have well-studied cis-elements.
we have developed a novel tool that searches for cis-element candidates in the upstream, downstream, or coding regions of differentially regulated genes.
