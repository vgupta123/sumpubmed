the genomic admixture with m. m. musculus genetic material may have contributed to the genomic distinction of the heligoland mice.
here we investigate the origin and colonization history of the house mouse inhabiting the small island of heligoland on the german bight - mus musculus helgolandicus.
geometric morphometric analysis of mandible shapes including skull samples from two time points during the last century suggest specific adaptations to a more carnivorous diet.
mutation frequencies in complete mitochondrial genome sequences date the colonization age to approximately 400 years ago.
it shows a remarkable resilience against genetic mixture with mainland populations of m. m. domesticus despite major disturbances in the past century and a high ship traffic.
structure analysis based on  <dig> microsatellite markers assigns heligoland mice to a distinct population and d-loop network analysis suggests that they are derived from a single colonization event.
it was first described by zimmermann in  <dig>  based on morphological descriptions which were considered to be a mosaic between the subspecies m. m. domesticus and m. m. musculus.
the molecular data show that the mice from heligoland are derived from m. m. domesticus based on mitochondrial d-loop sequences as well as on four nuclear diagnostic markers, including one each from the sex-chromosomes.
in spite of its young age, m. m. helgolandicus may thus be considered as a true subspecies of mus, whose evolution was triggered through fast divergence on a small island.
populations and subspecies of the house mouse mus musculus were able to invade new regions worldwide in the wake of human expansion.
the molecular and morphological analyses confirm that m. m. helgolandicus consists of a distinct evolutionary lineage with specific adaptations.
complete genome sequences from three animals revealed a genomic admixture with m. m. musculus genomic regions with at least  <dig>  % of the genome affected.
