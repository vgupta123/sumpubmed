furthermore, var2go offers a complete pipeline that, starting from the raw vcf file, allows to annotate both variants and associated genes and supports the extraction of relevant biological knowledge.
the raw data undergo a preliminary step of variants annotation, using the snpeff tool, and are converted to a table format.
as a consequence, the initial gene list is often reduced exploiting the knowledge of variants effect, novelty and genotype, with the potential risk of losing meaningful pieces of information.
using the web interface it is then possible to filter and extract, from the whole list, genes having annotations in the domain of interest, by simply specifying filtering parameters and one or more keywords.
its main purpose is to support non-bioinformaticians in handling and processing raw variant calling data through an intuitive web interface.
