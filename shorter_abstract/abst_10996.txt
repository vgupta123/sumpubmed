the yeast meyerozyma guilliermondii secretes a compound with anticoccidial activity and also has a compound of protein nature that damages the resistant structure of oocyst, showing the potential of this yeast and its products as a feasible method of coccidiosis control.
this disease affects chickens development and production, that most of times is controlled with anticoccidial drugs.
the yeast was molecularly identified as meyerozyma guilliermondii, and its anticoccidial activity against eimeria tenella oocysts was assessed.
here, we report the damage to oocysts walls caused by m. guilliermondii culture, supernatant, supernatant extract and intracellular proteins.
in this work, we assessed in vitro anticoccidial activity of a compound secreted by yeast isolated in oocysts suspension from infected chickens.
avian coccidiosis is a disease caused worldwide by several species of parasite eimeria that causes significant economic losses.
