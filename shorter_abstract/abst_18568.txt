this analysis provides examples of temporal, spatial, and functional processes revealed by the isomap algorithm.
in a spinal cord injury data set, isomap discovers the three main modalities of the experiment â€“ location and severity of the injury and the time elapsed after the injury.
in a high-throughput drug screening data set, isomap discovers the monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cells and maps several chemical compounds on the two-dimensional model.
finally, isomap is a promising new algorithm for class discovery and class prediction in high-density oligonucleotide data sets.
microarray data is one representation of the nonlinear interactions among genes and genes and environmental factors.
in this study, we apply isomap, a nonlinear method of dimensionality reduction, to analyze three independent large affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray data sets.
isomap discovered low-dimensional structures embedded in the affymetrix microarray data sets.
visualization of isomap models provides useful tools for exploratory analysis of microarray data sets.
in most instances, isomap models explain more of the variance present in the microarray data than pca or mds.
in a multiple tissue data set, isomap discovers a low-dimensional structure that corresponds to anatomical locations of the source tissues.
still most microarray studies use linear methods for the interpretation of nonlinear data.
these structures correspond to and help to interpret biological phenomena present in the data.
