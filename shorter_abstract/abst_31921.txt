mutations as sources of evolution have long been the focus of attention in the biomedical literature.
however, manually curating the rich and fast growing repository of biomedical literature is expensive and time-consuming.
we present open mutation miner , the first comprehensive, fully open-source approach to automatically extract impacts and related relevant information from the biomedical literature.
accessing the mutational information and their impacts on protein properties facilitates research in various domains, such as enzymology and pharmacology.
while the detection of single-point mutations is well covered by existing systems, challenges still exist in grounding impacts to their respective mutations and recognizing the affected protein properties, in particular kinetic and stability properties together with physical quantities.
it also extracts the affected protein properties, in particular kinetic and stability properties, as well as the magnitude of the effects and validates these relations against the domain ontology.
the output of our system can be provided in various formats, in particular by populating an owl-dl ontology, which can then be queried to provide structured information.
we assessed the performance of our work on manually annotated corpora and the results show the reliability of our approach.
furthermore, access to the analysis results is provided through multiple interfaces, including web services for automated data integration and desktop-based solutions for end user interactions.
we present an ontology model for mutation impacts, together with a comprehensive text mining system for extracting and analysing mutation impact information from full-text articles.
