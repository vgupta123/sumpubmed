in this study,  <dig> a. pleuropneumoniae genomes were used to carry out a phylogenomic analyses.
based on the analyses of four recombination tests, 23% of the core genome of a. pleuropneumoniae showed strong signals for intragenic homologous recombination.
overall, substantial genetic evidence was shown to indicate that recombination and positive selection indeed play a crucial role in the adaptive evolution of a. pleuropneumoniae.
the genome-wide profile of positively selected genes and/or amino acid residues will provide valuable targets for further research into the mechanisms of immune evasion and host-pathogen interactions for this serious swine pathogen.
we identified  <dig>  orthologous core genes as an initial data set for the estimation of genetic recombination and positive selection.
furthermore, the selection analyses indicated that  <dig> genes were undergoing significant positive selection.
currently, the molecular evolutionary trajectories for this pathogenic bacterium remain to require a better elucidation under the help of comparative genomics data.
for this reason, we employed a comparative phylogenomic approach to obtain a comprehensive understanding of roles of natural selective pressure and homologous recombination during adaptation of this pathogen to its swine host.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an economically important animal pathogen that causes contagious pleuropneumonia in pigs.
