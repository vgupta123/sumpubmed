none of these eight phages infected any of mycobacterial strains isolated from the same materials.
we predict that composting systems such as those used to obtain these mycobacteriophages will be a rich source for the isolation of additional phages that will expand our view of bacteriophage diversity and evolution.
the phage isolates span considerable genomic diversity, including two phages  related to subcluster a <dig> phages, two cluster b phages , three subcluster f <dig> phages , and madruga, a relative of phage patience with which it constitutes the new cluster u. interestingly, the two subcluster a <dig> phages and the three subcluster f <dig> phages have genomic relationships indicating relatively recent evolution within a geographically isolated niche in the composting system.
