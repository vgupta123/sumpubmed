the adoption of grid portals extended with robot certificates, can really contribute to creating transparent access to computational resources of grid infrastructures, enhancing the spread of this new paradigm in researchers' working life to address new global scientific challenges.
a first step to make grids more appealing for new users has recently been achieved with the adoption of robot certificates.
grid technology is the computing model which allows users to share a wide pletora of distributed computational resources regardless of their geographical location.
the valuable benefits introduced by robot certificates in e-science can so be extended to users belonging to several scientific domains, providing an asset in raising grid awareness to a wide number of potential users.
robot certificates can be installed on a smart card and used behind a portal by everyone interested in running the related applications in a grid environment using a user-friendly graphic interface.
robot certificates have recently been introduced to perform automated tasks on grids on behalf of users.
in this work, the genius grid portal, powered by enginframe, has been extended in order to support the new authentication based on the adoption of these robot certificates.
