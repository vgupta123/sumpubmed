though s/mars have been studied in yeast and higher eukaryotes and they have been found to be associated with gene organization and regulation of gene expression, they have not been reported in protists like giardia.
here, we have analysed the giardia genome for the probable s/mars predicted by the available computational tools; and then shown these sequences to be physically associated with the nuclear matrix.
this is the first report of s/mar elements from the protozoan parasite giardia lamblia.
this initial work is expected to lay a framework for future studies relating to genome organization as well as gene regulatory elements in this parasite.
