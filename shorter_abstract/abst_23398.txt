the aim of this study is to provide an atlas of matched anatomical cross-sections and contrast-enhanced ct images of the coelomic cavity in three highly diffused psittacine species.
the results provide an atlas of matched anatomical cross-sections and contrast-enhanced ct images of the coelomic cavity in three highly diffused psittacine species.
pre- and post-contrast attenuation reference values for the main coelomic organs are reported in hounsfield units .
both pre- and post-contrast scans were acquired.
contrast-enhanced computed tomographic studies of the coelomic cavity were performed in  <dig> blue-and-gold macaws,  <dig> african grey parrots and  <dig> monk parakeets by means of a 4-multidetector-row ct scanner.
