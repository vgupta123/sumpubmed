here we show that the pim kinases are constitutively active when expressed in hek- <dig> cells and are able to phosphorylate the bcl- <dig> family member bad on three residues, ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig> in vitro and in cells.
mutation of ser <dig> to alanine prevented the phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig> by pim kinases in hek- <dig> cells, suggesting that this site must be phosphorylated first in order to make the other sites accessible.
this would be consistent with the proposed function of pim kinases in promoting cell proliferation and preventing cell death.
over-expression of pim- <dig> and pim- <dig> in mice promotes the development of lymphomas, and up-regulation of pim expression has been observed in several human cancers.
