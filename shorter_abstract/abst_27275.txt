however, it is likely that the set of known tf dimers is highly incomplete, given that they were discovered using ad hoc approaches, or through computational analyses of limited datasets.
here, we present taco , a general-purpose standalone software tool that takes as input any genome-wide set of regulatory elements and predicts cell-typeâ€“specific tf dimers based on enrichment of motif complexes.
taco is the first tool that can accommodate motif complexes composed of overlapping motifs, a characteristic feature of many known tf dimers.
based on these results, we uncover a general principle governing the structure of tf-tf-dna ternary complexes, namely that the flexibility of the complex is correlated with, and most likely a consequence of, inter-motif spacing.
