the close packing of residues is the hallmark of protein interior and protein-protein interaction sites.
contplot would provide a handy tool to assess the importance of a residue in the protein structure or interaction site.
this would be useful to visually identify residues that are densely packed, or those involved in protein-protein interactions.
the average values of accessible surface area  and partner number  of different residues have been determined and a webserver, contplot has been designed to display these values  along the protein sequence.
the average values of asa and pn associated with each residue should be useful in protein structure prediction or fold-recognition algorithm.
the variation of asa with pn can be analytically expressed in terms of a cubic equation.
these equations  can be used to estimate the asa of a polypeptide chain using the pns of the individual residues in the structure.
depending on chemical features residues have preferred locations – interior or exterior – in protein structures, which also determine how many other residues are found around them.
the skewness observed in the distribution of pns is indicative of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the residue.
