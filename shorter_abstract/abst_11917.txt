to address this problem, we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to select functional genes from public databases.
we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm bombyx mori .
we identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of dry and wet bench processes in the silkworm b. mori.
first, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a hidden markov model  search, and then through cdna cloning, northern blotting, and rna-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in b. mori: bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc.
however, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses.
in contrast, bmeno <dig> was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion.
our strategy could be helpful for the detection of minor genes and functional genes in non-model organisms from public databases.
quantitative rt-pcr showed that the mrna expression of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc correlated with testis development; thus, bmeno <dig> and bmenoc may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis.
phylogenetic analysis showed that bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were distinct from bmeno <dig> and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters.
in addition, we determined that bmeno <dig> and bmenoc had species-specific functions.
