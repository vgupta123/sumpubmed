the crystal structure of the conserved domain of human dc-lamp was solved.
the conserved luminal domain of lysosome-associated membrane proteins forms a previously unknown β-prism fold.
the models correspond to the thickness of the lysosomal glycoprotein coat of only  <dig> to  <dig> nm, according to electron microscopy.
insights into the structure of the lysosomal glycoprotein coat were obtained by computational models of the lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> luminal regions.
the lamp family is characterized by a conserved domain of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids with two disulfide bonds.
the structure represents a novel β-prism fold formed by two β-sheets bent by β-bulges and connected by a disulfide bond.
flexible loops and a hydrophobic pocket represent possible sites of molecular interaction.
the abundant proteins lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> are major constituents of the glycoconjugate coat present on the inside of the lysosomal membrane, the 'lysosomal glycocalyx'.
it is the first high-resolution structure of a heavily glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein.
computational models of the glycosylated luminal regions of lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> indicate that the proteins adopt a compact conformation in close proximity to the lysosomal membrane.
