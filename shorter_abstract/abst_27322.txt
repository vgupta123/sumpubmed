in this report, we isolated a novel melaka-like reovirus  from intestinal content samples of one fruit bat residing in chinaâ€™s yunnan province.
phylogenetic analysis of the whole cangyuan virus genome sequences of segments l, m and s demonstrated the genetic diversity of the cangyuan virus.
in contrast to the l and m segments, the phylogenetic trees for the s segments of cangyuan virus demonstrated a greater degree of heterogeneity.
the causative pathogens were classified as pteropine orthoreoviruses with a strong phylogenetic relationship to orthoreoviruses of bat origin.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the cangyuan virus was a novel orthoreovirus and substantially different from currently known members of pteropine orthoreovirus  species group.
