however, previous implementations of nea involved multiple runs of network randomization and were therefore slow.
that requires, firstly, increasing statistical power and biological relevance via a network enrichment analysis  and, secondly, a fast and convenient procedure for rendering the original data into a space of pathway scores.
further, we compare estimates from these two alternative procedures and demonstrate that the summarization of individual genes to pathways increases the statistical power compared to both the default differential expression analysis on individual genes and the state-of-the-art gene set enrichment analysis.
here, we present a new r package nearender which can transform raw 'omics' features of experimental or clinical samples into matrices describing the same samples with many fewer nea-based pathway scores.
the package nearender is complementary to the online nea tool evinet  and, unlike of the latter, enables high performance of computations off-line.
the r package nearender version  <dig>  is available at cran repository
however, pathway scores can also be used as predictive features in machine learning.
this is done via a parametric estimation of the null binomial distribution and is thus much faster and less biased than randomization procedures.
of gene profiles' confluence to the pathway level, allows exploring molecular landscapes using functionally annotated gene sets.
the package also contains functions for preparing input, modeling null distributions, and evaluating alternative versions of the global network.
