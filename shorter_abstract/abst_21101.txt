regulation of co-repressor expression and the consequent alterations in transcriptional silencing play an important role in the regulation of differentiation.
the effectors of repression are large multimeric complexes which contain both the repressor proteins that bind to transcription factors and a number of co-repressors that actually mediate transcriptional silencing either by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery or by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes.
co-transfection of tblr <dig> and smrt results in increased expression of smrt.
transient over expression of tblr <dig> produces growth arrest.
although the orf of the predominant form contains only  <dig> bp, the human gene occupies ~ <dig> kb of genomic dna on chromosome 3q and contains  <dig> exons.
tblr <dig> co-precipitates with smrt, a co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors, and co-precipitates in complexes immunoprecipitated by antiserum to hdac <dig>  cells engineered to over express either tblr <dig> or n- and c-terminal deletion variants, have elevated levels of endogenous n-cor.
a single highly conserved gene encodes a small family of protein molecules.
