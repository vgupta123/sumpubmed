in hairy roots, a trv vector capable of systemic movement increased gus accumulation by 150-fold relative to the analogous pvx vector.
histochemical staining for gus in trv-infected hairy roots revealed the capacity for achieving even higher productivity per unit biomass.
a replicating trv vector achieved transient gus expression levels in hairy roots more than an order of magnitude higher than the highest level previously reported with a viral vector delivered by a. tumefaciens.

replicating vectors derived from potato virus x  and tobacco rattle virus  were modified to contain the reporter gene Î²-glucuronidase  with a plant intron to prevent bacterial expression.
a non-replicating vector containing a leader sequence from cowpea mosaic virus  modified for enhanced translation led to 70% higher transient gus expression than a control treatment.
the objective of this work was to overcome this limitation by harnessing a. tumefaciens to deliver replicating and non-replicating rna viral vectors in plant tissue co-cultures.
transient co-expression of the minimal pvx vector with p <dig> of tomato bushy stunt virus or hc-pro of tobacco etch virus to suppress post-transcriptional gene silencing increased gus expression by  <dig> and 83%, respectively.
low protein product titers have thus far limited the application of transient protein expression in these hosts.
in cell suspensions, a minimal pvx vector retaining only the viral rna polymerase gene yielded  <dig> -fold more gus than an analogous full-length pvx vector.
plant cell suspensions and hairy root cultures represent scalable protein expression platforms.
for the first time, replicating pvx vectors and a non-replicating cpmv-ht vector were successfully applied toward transient heterologous protein expression in cell suspensions.
