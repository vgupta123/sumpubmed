more tgfβ3-positive cells are observed in the endocardial monolayer following mbnl <dig> knockdown.
we previously demonstrated that the rna binding protein muscleblind-like  <dig>  is expressed specifically in the cushion endocardium, and knockdown of mbnl <dig> in stage  <dig> embryonic chicken avc explants enhances tgfβ-dependent endocardial cell invasion.
tgfβ <dig>  but not tgfβ <dig>  levels are elevated in medium conditioned by mbnl1-depleted avc explants.
addition of exogenous tgfβ <dig> to avc explants recapitulates the effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown.
the stimulatory effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown on invasion are lost in stage  <dig> avc explants.
mbnl <dig> expression precedes tgfβ <dig> in the avc endocardium, consistent with a role in preventing precocious autocrine tgfβ <dig> signaling.
valvulogenesis and septation in the developing heart depend on the formation and remodeling of endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal  and outflow tract .
these cushions are invaded by a subpopulation of endocardial cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in response to paracrine and autocrine transforming growth factor β  signals.

knockdown of mbnl <dig> in oft explants similarly enhances cell invasion, but not activation.
in this study, we demonstrate that the effect of mbnl <dig> knockdown on invasion remains dependent on tgfβ <dig> after it is no longer required to induce basal levels of invasion.
taken together, these data support a model in which mbnl <dig> negatively regulates cell invasion in the endocardial cushions by restricting the magnitude and timing of endocardial-derived tgfβ <dig> production.
