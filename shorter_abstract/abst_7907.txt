the application of mechanical insults to the spinal cord results in profound cellular and molecular changes, including the induction of neuronal cell death and altered gene expression profiles.
kegg analysis identified changes in the expression levels of  <dig> genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway, which were confirmed to be upregulated by rt-pcr analysis.
therefore, we have investigated the effect of cyclic tensile stresses on cultured spinal cord cells from e <dig> sprague-dawley rats, using the fx3000® flexercell strain unit.
we have demonstrated that spinal cord cells undergo cell death in response to cyclic tensile stresses, which were dose- and time-dependent.
previous studies have described alterations in gene expression following spinal cord injury, but the specificity of this response to mechanical stimuli is difficult to investigate in vivo.
these data may prove useful, as the accurate knowledge of neuronal gene expression in response to cyclic tensile stress will help in the development of molecular-based therapies for spinal cord injury.
there was no clear evidence of additive effects of strain level with strain rate.
microarray analysis of gene expression was performed using the affymetrix genechip system®, where categorization of identified genes was performed using the gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  systems.
the application of cyclic tensile stress reduced the viability of cultured spinal cord cells significantly in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
in addition, we have identified the up regulation of various genes, in particular of the mapk pathway, which may be involved in this cellular response.
increasing either the strain or the strain rate independently was associated with significant decreases in spinal cord cell survival.
