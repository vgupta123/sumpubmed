abundant zas <dig> expression is found in the trigeminal ganglion, hippocampal formation, dorsal root ganglia, and motoneurons.
together with results of western blot analyses, the data suggest that zas <dig> protein isoforms with differential cellular distribution are produced in a cell-specific manner.
the purpose of this study is to characterize zas <dig> proteins in nervous tissues and to use spinal nerve ligation, a neuropathic pain model, to demonstrate a functional relationship between zas <dig> and nf-κb.
further, neuropathic pain confirmed by persistent mechanical allodynia was manifested in rats seven days after l <dig> and l <dig> lumbar spinal nerve ligation.
we propose that reciprocal changes in the expression of zas <dig> and nf-κb might generate neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury.
low levels of zas <dig> expressions are also found in the cerebral cortex and in the grey matter of the spinal cord.
in addition to competition for common dna sites, in vitro experiments have shown that zas <dig> can inhibit nf-κb via the association with traf <dig> to inhibit the nuclear translocation of nf-κb.
nf-κb binds to the κb motif to regulate transcription of genes involved in growth, immunity and inflammation, and plays a pivotal role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after nerve injuries.
immunohistochemical experiments show that zas <dig> is expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous system.
in those nervous tissues, zas <dig> is expressed mainly in the cell bodies of neurons and astrocytes.
zas <dig> is expressed in nervous tissues involved in cognitive function and pain modulation.
the down-regulation of zas <dig> after peripheral nerve injury may lead to activation of nf-κb, allowing wallerian regeneration and induction of nf-κb-dependent gene expression, including pro-inflammatory cytokines.
