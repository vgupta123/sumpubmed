comparison with σ-factor binding in klebsiella pneumoniae showed that transcriptional regulation of conserved genes in closely related species is unexpectedly divergent.

using multiple genome-scale measurements, we elucidated the network of σ-factor and promoter interactions in escherichia coli.
at the beginning of the transcription process, the rna polymerase  core enzyme requires a σ-factor to recognize the genomic location at which the process initiates.
the reconstructed network reveals the regulatory complexity of the promoter architecture in prokaryotic genomes, and opens a path to the direct determination of the systems biology of their transcriptional regulatory networks.
