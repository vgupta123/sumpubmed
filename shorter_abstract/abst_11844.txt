it is believed that the proteolysis of mcm <dig> during mitosis is a vital mechanism to prevent aberrant initiation of replication and the present study describes the regulation of mcm <dig> during this phase of the cell-cycle.
further, the proteolysis in m-phase can be independently mediated by non-overlapping regions of mcm <dig>  apparently employing a redundant mechanism to ensure downregulation.
