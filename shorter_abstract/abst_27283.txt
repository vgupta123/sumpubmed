although a number of mirnas were identified in maize, the function of mirna in seed development was merely discussed.
in summary, our results indicated the distinct expression of mirnas during seed development.
in addition to deep-sequencing, mirna microarray study confirmed the higher expression of several mirnas in seeds.
micrornas  are approximately 20- <dig> nt non-coding rnas that play key roles in many biological processes in both animals and plants.
potential targets of all novel mirnas were predicted based on our strict criteria.
<dig> novel mirnas were identified and they were not reported in other plants.
additionally, some mirna*s of these novel mirnas were detected.
we had identified  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas from seeds and leaves in maize, and a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were discovered.
