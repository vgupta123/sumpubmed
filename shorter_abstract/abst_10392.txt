when a limited number of arrays are available, or when arrays are run in different batches, technical effects have a large influence on the measured expression of genes.
next to this, we propose a novel way of handling background correction, enabling the use of background information to weight probes during summarization.
frequently, we encounter datasets with significant technical effects that currently available methods are not able to correct.
oligonucleotide arrays have become one of the most widely used high-throughput tools in biology.
we show that a detailed modelling and correction of these technical effects allows for an improved analysis in these situations.
due to their sensitivity to experimental conditions, normalization is a crucial step when comparing measurements from these arrays.
testing of the proposed method shows a much improved detection of differentially expressed genes over earlier proposed methods, even when tested on  spike-in datasets.
we show that by a careful decomposition of probe specific amplification, hybridization and array location effects, a normalization can be performed that allows for a much improved analysis of these data.
