gene essentiality and hydrogen production potential have also been assessed.
pcc <dig>  it is of importance to develop tools for uncovering stoichiometric and regulatory principles in the synechocystis metabolic network.
pcc <dig>  and through in silico metabolic engineering simulations that allowed identification of a set of gene knock-out candidates towards enhanced succinate production.
the model includes a detailed biomass equation which encompasses elementary building blocks that are needed for cell growth, as well as a detailed stoichiometric representation of photosynthesis.
in order to enable efficient use of metabolic potential of synechocystis sp.
we report the most comprehensive metabolic model of synechocystis sp.
we demonstrate applicability of isyn <dig> for stoichiometric analysis by simulating three physiologically relevant growth conditions of synechocystis sp.
