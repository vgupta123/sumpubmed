blancal possess recessive alleles of both vrn-a <dig> and vrn-b <dig> genes.
<dig> and vrn-b1dic alleles is a predicted cause of the spring growth habit of studied accessions of tetraploid species.
allelic variation between the vrn- <dig> and vrn- <dig> alleles relies on mutations in the promoter region or the first intron.
in di-, tetra- and hexaploid wheats the presence of a dominant allele of at least one vrn <dig> gene homologue  determines the spring growth habit.
the origin and variability of the dominant vrn <dig> alleles, determining the spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat species have been poorly studied.
the spring growth habit of most studied spring accessions was determined by previously identified dominant alleles of vrn <dig> genes.
further investigations are required to determine the source of spring growth habit of these accessions.
we analyzed the promoter and first intron regions of vrn <dig> genes in  <dig> spring accessions of tetraploid wheats.
new allelic variants of the vrn-a <dig> and vrn-b <dig> genes were identified in spring accessions of tetraploid wheats.
here we analyzed the growth habit of  <dig> tetraploid wheat species accessions and 25 % of them were spring type.

three spring accessions t. aethiopicum k- <dig>  t. turanicum k- <dig> and t. turgidum cv.
<dig> had deletions of 20 bp located 137 bp upstream of the start codon and mutations within the vrn-box when compared to the recessive allele of vrn-a <dig>  so far the vrn-a1d allele was identified only in spring accessions of the t. dicoccoides and t. turgidum species.
the origin and evolution of vrn-a <dig> alleles in di- and tetraploid wheat species was discussed.
genetic experiments proof the dominant inheritance of vrn-a1d allele which was widely distributed across the accessions of triticum dicoccoides.
vernalization genes vrn <dig> play a major role in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in wheat.
vrn-b1dic was identified in t. dicoccoides ig <dig> and had 11 % sequence dissimilarity in comparison to the promoter of vrn-b <dig>  the presence of vrn-a1b.
