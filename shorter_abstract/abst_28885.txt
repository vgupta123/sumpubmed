the 5' ends of antisense strands of efficient sirnas are u-rich and possess a content similarity to the pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides interacting with the polypurine rna tracks that are recognized by rnase h. the advantage of our method over similar methods is the small number of parameters.
among other features, a dinucleotide content index and the frequency of potential targets for sirna in the mrna added predictive power to our model .
as a result, our method requires a much smaller training set to produce consistent results.
most importantly, we derived an sirna position-dependent consensus, and optimized the free-energy difference of the 5' and 3' terminal dinucleotides of the sirna antisense strand.
the position-dependent consensus is based on correlation and t-test analyses of the training set, and accounts for both significantly preferred and avoided nucleotides in all sequence positions.
we demonstrated that the properties of the sirnas themselves are essential for efficient rna interference.
on this validation set, the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed efficiency was  <dig> .
we optimized a neural network model on our training set using three parameters characterizing the sirna sequence, and predicted efficiencies for the test sirna dataset recently published by novartis.
using the same model, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of optimal sirna targets for  <dig>  human mrnas.
some of these parameters characterize only the sirna sequence, while others involve the whole mrna.
