in order to determine immunogenic epitopes of hbv recognized by hbv-specific t cells, previous studies focused on previously confirmed hbv epitopes and assessed the t cell response by the number of hbv-specific t cells by ifn-γ elispot.
the frequency of hbv-specific t cells producing ifn-γ after stimulation with hbv epitopes was similar in chb and rhb patients.
we found  <dig> immunogenic epitopes not described previously.
chb patients had a higher mss si than rhb patients.
patients not carrying the hla-a <dig> genotype had higher sfc si and mss si.
patients with hla-a <dig> had higher mss si compared to non- hla-a <dig> allele patients.
hbeag-positive patients had a lower mss si, and none of the hbeag positive patients had the hla-a <dig> genotype.
this experimental measure showed the in silico analysis for epitope prediction to be a valuable tool in future studies on hla genotypes and hbv epitopes.
these were evaluated for immunogenicity by use of synthetic peptides representing the epitopes through exposure to pbmcs from patients with chb or rhb by ifn-γ elispot.
ifn-γ elispot-determined mss is an efficient marker for t cell recognition of epitopes.
patients with chronic hepatitis b virus infection  usually mount a modest t cell response against hbv epitopes.
the number of ifn-γ producing cells , mean spot size  and stimulation index  were recorded.
<dig> chronic chb patients and  <dig> patients with resolved hbv  were included in the study.
we studied t cell functionality by combined in silico methods predicting hbv-specific epitopes and experimental investigations on the recognition of these epitopes.
