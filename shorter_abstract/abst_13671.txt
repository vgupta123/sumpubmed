we find that when negative auto-regulation is disrupted by placing the regulator arac under constitutive expression, the input dynamic range of the arabinose system is reduced by 10-fold.
this function may contribute to explaining the common occurrence of negative auto-regulation in biological systems.
to address this, we studied the negative auto-regulation motif in the arabinose utilization system of escherichia coli, in which negative auto-regulation is part of a complex regulatory network.
here we ask whether negative auto-regulation preserves this function also in the context of a natural system, where it is embedded within many additional interactions.
here we demonstrate that the negative auto-regulation motif in the native arabinose system of escherichia coli increases the range of arabinose signals over which the system can respond.
gene regulation networks are made of recurring regulatory patterns, called network motifs.
negative auto-regulation has several potential functions: it can shorten the response time , stabilize expression against noise, and linearize the gene's input-output response curve.
one of the most common network motifs is negative auto-regulation, in which a transcription factor represses its own production.
this latter function of negative auto-regulation, which increases the range of input signals over which downstream genes respond, has been studied by theory and synthetic gene circuits.
we present a mathematical model that describes how negative auto-regulation can increase input dynamic-range, by coupling the transcription factor protein level to the input signal.
in this way, negative auto-regulation may help to increase the input dynamic-range while maintaining the specificity of cooperative regulatory systems.
the apparent hill coefficient of the induction curve changes from about n =  <dig> with negative auto-regulation, to about n =  <dig> when it is disrupted.
