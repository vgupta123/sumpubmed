the use of systemic antimicrobials leads to changes in the intestinal microbiota, with different and specific responses to different antimicrobials.
all antimicrobials tested here had some impact on the microbiota, but tms significantly reduced bacterial species richness and diversity and had the greatest apparent impact on population structure, specifically targeting members of the verrucomicrobia phylum.
treatment was given for  <dig> consecutive days and fecal samples were collected before drug administration , at the end of treatment , and on days  <dig> and  <dig> of the trial.
this study aimed to characterize changes in the fecal bacterial populations of healthy horses associated with the administration of frequently used antimicrobial drugs.
several factors can cause disruption of the normal intestinal microbiota, including antimicrobial therapy, which is an important cause of diarrhea in horses.

significant changes of population structure and community membership were observed after the use of all drugs.
tms caused the most marked changes on fecal microbiota even at higher taxonomic levels including a significant decrease of richness and diversity.
twenty-five days after the end of treatment, bacterial profiles were more similar to pre-treatment patterns indicating a recovery from changes caused by antimicrobial administration, but differences were still evident, especially regarding community membership.
changes in structure and membership caused by antimicrobial administration were specific for each drug and may be predictable.
high throughput sequencing of the v <dig> region of the 16s rrna gene was performed using an illumina miseq sequencer.
the intestinal tract is a rich and complex environment and its microbiota has been shown to have an important role in health and disease in the host.
twenty-four adult mares were assigned to receive procaine penicillin intramuscularly , ceftiofur sodium im, trimethoprim sulfadiazine  orally or to a control group.
