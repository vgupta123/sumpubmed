transgenic lines of e. ulmoides overexpressing euipi showed increased euipi expression  and a 3- to 4-fold increase in the total content of trans-polyisoprenes, compared with the wild-type  control.
our results demonstrated that regulation of ipi expression is a key target for efficient production of trans-polyisoprene in e. ulmoides.
euipi shared high identity with other plant ipis, and the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli showed ipi enzymatic activity in vitro.
ipi catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, including polyisoprene.
a full-length cdna  encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase  was isolated from e. ulmoides.

to develop a plant-based system suitable for large-scale production of trans-polyisoprene, we selected a trans-polyisoprene-producing plant, eucommia ulmoides oliver, as the target for genetic transformation.
hevea brasiliensis  produces cis-polyisoprene, and is the key source of commercial rubber.
euipi consisted of  <dig> bp with a 675-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acid residues.
increasing the expression level of euipi by overexpression increased accumulation of trans-polyisoprenes in transgenic e. ulmoides.
natural rubber produced by plants, known as polyisoprene, is the most widely used isoprenoid polymer.
euipi was introduced into e. ulmoides via agrobacterium-mediated transformation.
plant polyisoprenes can be classified into two types; cis-polyisoprene and trans-polyisoprene, depending on the type of polymerization of the isoprene unit.
in contrast, relatively few plant species produce trans-polyisoprene.
currently, trans-polyisoprene is mainly produced synthetically, and no plant species is used for its commercial production.
