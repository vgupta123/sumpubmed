using known interaction partners and by screening  <dig> different combinations of prey and bait proteins associated with the human androgen receptor we demonstrate that this assay allows the quantitative detection of specific protein interactions in different types of mammalian cells and under the influence of different compounds.
the high number of preys that can be tested per slide together with the flexibility to interrogate any bait of interest and the small amounts of reagents that are required makes this assay currently one of the most economical high-throughput detection assays for protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells.
investigation of protein-protein interactions  is therefore essential for understanding of cellular functions.
we here describe a new and cost-effective method for the high-throughput detection of protein-protein interactions in mammalian cells that combines the advantages of mammalian two-hybrid systems with those of dna microarrays.
in this cell array protein-protein interaction assay , mixtures of bait and prey expression plasmids together with an auto-fluorescent reporter are immobilized on glass slides in defined array formats.
most of the biological processes rely on the formation of protein complexes.
we demonstrate that the cappia assay allows the quantitative detection of specific protein interactions in different types of mammalian cells and under the influence of different compounds.
it is advantageous to perform mammalian ppi analysis in mammalian cells because the expressed proteins can then be subjected to essential post-translational modifications.
until now mammalian two-hybrid assays have been performed on individual gene scale.
