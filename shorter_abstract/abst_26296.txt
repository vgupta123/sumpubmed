twenty abundant unigenes had matches to skeletal muscle-related genes including actin, myosin, tropomyosin, troponin-i, t and c, paramyosin, muscle lim protein, muscle protein  <dig>  a-actinin and tandem ig/fn motifs .
we constructed a cdna library from aphonopelma sp.
this may be related to a mix of muscle fiber types.
these results support the existence of both actin-linked and myosin-linked regulation in tarantula skeletal muscle.
the present study serves as a basis for defining the transcriptome of tarantula skeletal muscle, for future in vitro expression of tarantula proteins, and for interpreting structural and functional observations in this model species.
we have predicted full-length as well as partial cdna sequences both experimentally and computationally for myosin heavy and light chains, actin, tropomyosin, and troponin-i, t and c, and have deduced the putative peptides.
tarantula has been used as a model system for studying skeletal muscle structure and function, yet data on the genes expressed in tarantula muscle are lacking.
skeletal muscle and got  <dig> high-quality 5'ests  from randomly picked clones.
sequence similarities suggested multiple isoforms of most myofibrillar proteins, supporting the generality of multiple isoforms known from previous muscle sequence studies.
matches to myosin light chain kinase and calponin were also identified.
a preliminary analysis of the structural and functional properties was also carried out.
