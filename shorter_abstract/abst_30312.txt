it has an intact calvin cycle with two forms of rubisco, as well as a gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  for mixotrophic co <dig> fixation.
r. centenum contains a singular circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs in size harboring  <dig>  genes.
among numerous newly identified signal transduction proteins, of particular interest is a putative bacteriophytochrome that is phylogenetically distinct from a previously characterized r. centenum phytochrome, ppr.
remarkable metabolic versatility and a superior capability for photoautotrophic carbon assimilation is evident in r. centenum.
enzymatic reactions associated with arsenate and mercuric detoxification are rare or unique compared to other purple bacteria.
it is emerging as a genetically amenable model organism for molecular genetic analysis of cyst formation, photosynthesis, phototaxis, and cellular development.
rhodospirillum centenum is a photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium that favors growth in an anoxygenic, photosynthetic n2-fixing environment.
