sk-n-mc neuroblastoma cells were infected with the respiratory strain of c. pneumoniae, ar <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  following infection, the cells were either untreated or treated with staurosporine and then examined for apoptosis by labeling for nuclear fragmentation, caspase activity, and membrane inversion as indicated by annexin v staining.
chronic and/or persistent infection of neuronal cells with c. pneumoniae in the ad brain may affect apoptosis in cells containing chlamydial inclusions.
depending on the cell type of the host, infection by c. pneumoniae has been shown to influence apoptotic pathways in both pro- and anti-apoptotic fashions.
c. pneumoniae infection was maintained through  <dig> days post-infection.
these data suggest that c. pneumoniae can sustain a chronic infection in neuronal cells by interfering with apoptosis, which may contribute to chronic inflammation in the ad brain.
at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection, the infected cell cultures appeared to inhibit or were resistant to the apoptotic process when induced by staurosporine.
