the main motivation of our work is to exploit the huge computational power of commonly available graphic cards, to develop high performance solutions for sequence alignment.
the results show that graphic cards are now sufficiently advanced to be used as efficient hardware accelerators for sequence alignment.
for these reasons heuristic approaches such as those implemented in fasta and blast tend to be preferred, allowing faster execution times at the cost of reduced sensitivity.
the solution presented in this paper allows large scale alignments to be performed at low cost, using the exact smith-waterman algorithm instead of the largely adopted heuristic approaches.
the smith-waterman algorithm has been available for more than  <dig> years.
furthermore, the exponential growth of protein and dna databases makes the smith-waterman algorithm unrealistic for searching similarities in large sets of sequences.
in this paper we present what we believe is the fastest solution of the exact smith-waterman algorithm running on commodity hardware.
exhaustive tests have been done to compare our implementation to ssearch and blast, running on a  <dig> ghz intel pentium iv processor.
cuda allows direct access to the hardware primitives of the last-generation graphics processing units  g <dig>  speeds of more than  <dig>  gcups  are achieved on a workstation running two geforce  <dig> gtx.
these tests show that our implementation performs from  <dig> to  <dig> times faster than any other previous attempt available on commodity hardware.
their performance is better than any alternative available on commodity hardware platforms.
unfortunately, the computational cost is very high, requiring a number of operations proportional to the product of the length of two sequences.
it is based on a dynamic programming approach that explores all the possible alignments between two sequences; as a result it returns the optimal local alignment.
