using forward simulation of a wright-fisher process, we show that hitch-hiking of deleterious mutations with advantageous mutations can lead to overestimation of the number of adaptive substitutions, while background selection and clonal interference can distort the site frequency spectrum to obscure the signal for positive selection.
the extent of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference can be evaluated using the diagnostic statistics presented here.
a major goal of molecular evolution is to determine how natural selection has shaped the evolution of a gene.
the diagnostics can also be used to determine how well we expect the mk statistics to perform and whether one form of the statistic may be preferable to another.
various forms of linked selection have characteristic effects on mk-type statistics.
we demonstrate that linkage between sites can bias measures of selection based on synonymous and non-synonymous changes.
