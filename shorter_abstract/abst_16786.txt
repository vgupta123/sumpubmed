we also examined the numbers of submucosal eosinophils and the basement membrane-to-crypt and crypt-to-crypt distance to evaluate edema in the colon submucosa at onset and remission in egpa and at onset in cep.
chronic eosinophilic pneumonia  or eosinophilic gastroenteritis , or both, with asthma precede the onset of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis  in half of all egpa patients.

nine of  <dig>  cep patients had symptoms or endoscopic findings.
in egpa, peripheral blood th <dig> cells  were significantly correlated with serum icam- <dig> level, colonic submucosal eosinophil count, and degree of edematous change; inversely correlated with serum vegf level; but not correlated with vcam- <dig> level.
the mechanism of vasculitis in egpa appears related to increases in serum th <dig> cell numbers and icam- <dig> levels and decreases in vegf levels.
we studied  <dig> egpa patients and  <dig> patients with cep but without egpa.
