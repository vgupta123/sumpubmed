orthologues are genes in different species that are related through divergent evolution from a common ancestor and are expected to have similar functions.
functional similarity was higher within than between transcript-based sub-clusters of a defined orthologous group.
however, alternative splicing  is usually disregarded in the determination of orthologue groups and the functional consequences of alternative splicing have not been considered.
extending the definition of orthologue groups to take account of alternate splicing and the functional differences it causes requires further examination.
each orthologue group was divided into sub-clusters, at the transcript level, using a method based on the sequence similarity of the isoforms.
predictions of intrinsic disorder in protein regions were also correlated with the isoform sub-clusters within an orthologue group.
sub-clustering of orthologue groups at the transcript level is an important step to more accurately define functionally equivalent orthologue groups.

a subset of the orthologous gene groups between human and mouse was selected from the inparanoid database for this study.
further investigation and refinement of the methodology to classify and verify isoform sub-clusters is needed, particularly to extend the technique to more distantly related species.
