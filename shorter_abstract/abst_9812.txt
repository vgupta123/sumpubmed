our results provide evidence that bovine sera and exosomes mirnaomes are different with regarding to the mirna numbers, types and expressions.
the profile of total detected mirnas in sera and exosomes was different, while exosomes represented about 78Â % of total mirnas expressed in sera, suggesting that exosomes are the major mirnas carriers in bovine sera.
moreover, functional analysis showed that uniquely and highly expressed mirnas in sera were mainly related to diseases and disorders, while the predicted functions of those in exosomes were enriched in tissue development and lipid metabolism.
the functional analysis suggest that sera may be preferable for the purpose of detecting inflammation in cattle, while exosomes may be a better choice for monitoring the status of muscle development and lipid metabolism.
the mirna profiles were then generated using rna-seq.
in addition,  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between sera and exosomes , with the expression of four of them being further validated by stem-loop rt-qpcr.
in this study we aimed to investigate the mirnas from bovine sera and exosomes, and to provide insights into their future applications.
based on their distinct profiles, mirnas from sera and exosomes may reflect different aspects of physiological and pathological conditions in cattle.
