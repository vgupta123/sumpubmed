in the present study, we investigated the function of ossec <dig> in rice and found that ossec <dig> complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast.
overexpression of ossec <dig> in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies.
our results revealed that the ossec <dig> regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the ossec <dig> interacts with p <dig> complex in rice endosperm cell.
further examination revealed that ossec <dig> presented as a 290-kda complex in rice endosperm cells.
moreover, os60sp <dig> was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the ossec <dig> complex contains another complex of p <dig> in rice endosperm cells.
sec18p/n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  is a conserved eukaryotic atpase, which primarily functions in vesicle membrane fusion from yeast to human.
