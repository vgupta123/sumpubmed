a protein profile analysis of more than  <dig> proteins corroborated several signature pathways uncovered by abundant ests.
we took a multiparallel approach that combines ests, protein profiling and microarray analyses to look into the gene expression landscape in the endosperm of the oilseed crop brassica napus.
in species with exalbuminous seeds, the endosperm is eventually consumed and its space occupied by the embryo during seed development.
however, the main constituent of the early developing seed is the liquid endosperm, and a significant portion of the carbon resources for the ensuing stages of seed development arrive at the embryo through the endosperm.
our findings on the featured metabolic processes and the lec <dig> regulatory cascade offer new angles for investigation on the integration of endosperm gene expression with embryo development and storage product deposition in seed development.
an est collection of over  <dig>  entries allowed us to detect close to  <dig>  unisequences expressed in the endosperm.
the endosperm est collection and the microarray dataset provide a basic genomic resource for dissecting metabolic and developmental events important for oilseed improvement.
these complementary analyses provided insight on several prominent metabolic pathways in the endosperm.
using microarray analyses, we identified genes that are differentially or highly expressed across all developmental stages.
