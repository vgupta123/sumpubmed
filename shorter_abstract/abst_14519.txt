bony fish present an immunological system, which evolved independently from those of animals that migrated to land  <dig> million years ago.
the identified igd-ests only present membrane transcripts, with cμ <dig> and five cδ exons.
a scan of the medaka genome using transcripts and genomic short reads resulted in five zones within a region on chromosome  <dig> with cμ and cδ exons.
our results suggest that the igh locus duplication is very common among teleosts, wherein the existence of a recombination process explains the sequence homology between them.
furthermore, there are ests with sequences that do not have any vh which disrupt open reading frames.
the publication of whole genome sequences and the availability of several cdna libraries for medaka  permitted us to perform a thorough analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chains present in this teleost.
we identified igm and igd coding ests, mainly in spleen, kidney and gills using published cdna libraries but we did not find any sequence that coded for igt or other heavy chain isotypes described in fish.
some of these exons do not form part of antibodies and were at times interspersed, suggesting a recombination process between zones.
