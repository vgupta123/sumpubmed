measured rna expression datasets from microarray analysis were integrated with a detailed stoichiometric reconstruction of starch metabolism in o. tauri in order to predict the optimal flux distribution and the dynamics of the starch content in the light/dark cycle.
our model and method demonstrate the utility of a quasi-steady-state approach for inferring dynamic metabolic information in o. tauri directly from time-series gene expression data.
unicellular phytoplankton retains the complexity of plant carbohydrate metabolism, and recent transcriptomic profiling suggests a major input of transcriptional regulation.
their temporal rna expression profiles, however, do not predict the dynamics of metabolite levels, due to the divergence of enzyme activity from the rna profiles.
we developed a detailed reaction model of starch metabolism, which, to our knowledge, is the first attempt to describe this polysaccharide polymerization while preserving the mass balance relationships.
the predicted starch profile was validated by experimental data over the  <dig> h cycle.
we used a quasi-steady-state, constraint-based modelling approach to infer the dynamics of starch content during the  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark cycle in the model alga ostreococcus tauri.
a single-reaction description of starch production is not able to account for the observed variability of diurnal activity profiles of starch-related enzymes.
