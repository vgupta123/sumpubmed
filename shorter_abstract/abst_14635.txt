however, most feature selection approaches developed for microarray data cannot handle multivariate temporal data without previous data flattening, which results in loss of temporal information.
obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms alternatives widely used in gene expression studies.
in the proposed approach we compute relevance of a gene by averaging f-statistic values calculated across individual time steps, and we compute redundancy between genes by using a dynamical time warping approach.
the proposed method is evaluated on three temporal gene expression datasets from human viral challenge studies.
we propose a temporal minimum redundancy - maximum relevance  feature selection approach, which is able to handle multivariate temporal data without previous data flattening.
as evident in our experiments, incorporating the temporal information into the feature selection process leads to selection of more discriminative features.
we developed a filter-based feature selection method for temporal gene expression data based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy criteria.
the proposed method incorporates temporal information by combining relevance, which is calculated as an average f-statistic value across different time steps, with redundancy, which is calculated by employing dynamical time warping approach.
in gene expression studies this is not a trivial task for several reasons, including potential temporal character of data.
