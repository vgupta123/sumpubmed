therefore, revealing the underlying regulatory mechanisms of transcripts becomes imperative.
however, for a complete understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we need to identify the regions in which they are found.
we will call these transcriptional regulation regions, or trrs, which can be considered functional regions containing a cluster of regulatory elements that cooperatively recruit transcriptional factors for binding and then regulating the expression of transcripts.
our findings indicate that 1) the hsl model can be used to accurately predict core trrs of transcripts across species and 2) identified core trrs by hsl are proper candidates for the further scrutiny of specific regulatory elements and mechanisms.
the hsl model trained based on yeast achieved comparable accuracy in predicting trrs in other species, e.g., fruit fly, human, and rice, thus demonstrating the conservation of trrs across species.
the hsl model was also used to identify the trrs of genes, such as p <dig> or osalyl <dig>  as well as micrornas.
we constructed a hierarchical stochastic language  model for the identification of core trrs in yeast based on regulatory cooperation among trr elements.
increasing evidence shows that whole genomes of eukaryotes are almost entirely transcribed into both protein coding genes and an enormous number of non-protein-coding rnas .
in addition, the encode regions were examined by hsl, and trrs were found to pervasively locate in the genomes.
