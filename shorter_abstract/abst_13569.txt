the resulting ssu rdna sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses using complex evolutionary models .
this simple structure falsely points to a low genetic diversity: spirogyra is commonly excluded from phylogenetic analyses because the genus is known as a long-branch taxon caused by a high evolutionary rate.
we focused on this genetic diversity and sequenced  <dig> spirogyra small subunit nuclear ribosomal dna  strands of different origin.
this emphasizes the high genetic diversity of this genus and the distance to the remaining zygnematophyceae.
a large number of non-homoplasious synapomorphies  was found for spirogyra  and for each clade .
sequence comparisons revealed  <dig> individual clones, but our results still support monophyly of the genus.
the genetic distance within the genus spirogyra exceeded the distances measured within any other genus of the remaining zygnemataceae included in this study.
the unbranched filamentous green alga spirogyra  is easily recognizable based on its vegetative morphology, which shows one to several spiral chloroplasts.
overall, we define eight distinct clades of spirogyra, one of them including the genus sirogonium.
the phylogenetic relationship to the genus spirotaenia was not resolved satisfactorily.
out of  <dig> accessions analyzed,  <dig> showed a secondary loss of the  <dig> group i intron, which formed a long-branched group within the genus.
