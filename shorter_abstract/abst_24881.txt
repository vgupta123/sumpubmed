we found a highly significant enrichment for several transcription factor binding sites  leading to the prediction that corresponding transcription factors, such as sp <dig>  tcfap <dig>  e2f, myc and egr, are regulated by rage signaling.
next, we used a data set of differentially expressed genes between tpa-treated wt and rage-deficient skin and performed computational analysis of their proximal promoter regions.
in summary, our data support the model that engagement of rage converts a transient cellular stimulation into sustained cellular dysfunction and highlight a novel role of the rb-e2f pathway in rage-dependent inflammation during pathological conditions.
ranking of tpa-regulated genes according to their time average mean and peak expression and superimposition of data sets from wild-type  and rage-deficient mice revealed that rage signaling is not essential for initial changes in tpa-induced transcription, but absolutely required for sustained alterations in transcript levels.
accordingly, we could confirm aberrant expression and regulation of members of the e2f protein family in epidermal keratinocytes of rage-deficient mice.
in order to decipher the mode of rage function on gene transcription levels during inflammation, we applied global gene expression profiling on time-resolved samples of mouse back skin, which had been treated with the phorbol ester tpa, a potent inducer of skin inflammation.
recently, we provided genetic evidence that signaling via the receptor for advanced glycation end products  drives the strength and maintenance of an inflammatory reaction.
in the past, molecular mechanisms that drive the initiation of an inflammatory response have been studied intensively.
