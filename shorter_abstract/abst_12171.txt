in order to study the downstream effectors of age-1/pi3k signaling in c. elegans, we conducted a genetic screen for mutations that suppress the constitutive dauer arrest phenotype of age- <dig> animals.
age- <dig>  a homolog of the p <dig> catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinases  comprises the major known effector pathway downstream of the insulin receptor, daf- <dig>  phospholipid products of age-1/pi3k activate akt/pkb kinase signaling via pdk- <dig>  akt/pkb signaling antagonizes nuclear translocation of the daf-16/foxo transcription factor.
a fifth mutation, mg <dig>  located on chromosome x, did not correspond to any known dauer genes, suggesting that mg <dig> may represent a new component of the insulin pathway.
in the nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, a conserved insulin-like signaling pathway controls larval development, stress resistance and adult lifespan.
in contrast, akt- <dig> and pdk- <dig> did not affect lifespan or stress resistance, while both daf- <dig> alleles fully suppressed these phenotypes.
reduced age-1/pi3k signaling permits daf- <dig> to direct dauer larval arrest and promote long lifespan in adult animals.
genetic epistasis analysis by rnai showed that reproductive development in age-1;akt- <dig> animals was dependent on the presence of pdk- <dig>  similarly, reproductive development in age-1;pdk- <dig> animals was dependent on akt- <dig>  however, reproductive development in age-1; mg <dig> animals required only akt- <dig>  and pdk- <dig> activity was dispensable in this background.
this report describes mutations recovered in a screen for suppressors of the constitutive dauer arrest  phenotype of age- <dig>  two mutations corresponded to alleles of daf- <dig>  two mutations were gain-of-function alleles in the genes, akt- <dig> and pdk- <dig>  encoding phosphoinositide-dependent serine/threonine kinases.
interestingly, while mg <dig> suppressed dauer arrest in age- <dig> animals, it enhanced the long lifespan phenotype.
phenotypic analysis of these alleles shows that the larval and adult outputs of age-1/pi3k are fully separable in these mutants.
