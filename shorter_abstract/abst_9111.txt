<dig> pyrosequencing of a p. hexandrum cell culture normalized cdna library generated  <dig> , <dig> raw reads and  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads, with an average read length of 138 bp.
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis using kegg automatic annotation server  combined with domain analysis of the assembled transcripts revealed putative members of secondary metabolism pathways that may be involved in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis.
a proposed schematic pathway for phenylpropanoids and podophyllotoxin biosynthesis was generated.
the present data will help the identification of the potential genes and transcription factors involved in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis in p. hexandrum.
the optimized parameter generated  <dig>   <dig> assembled sequences, comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets which resulted in better assembly as compared to default parameters.
blastx analysis resulted in the annotation of  <dig>  contigs/singlet using a cut-off value of ≤1e- <dig>  high similarity to medicago truncatula using optimized parameters and to populus trichocarpa using default parameters was noted.
<dig> simple sequence repeats were predicted in the p. hexandrum sequences.
high throughput transcriptome sequences or genomic sequence data from the indian mayapple are essential for further understanding of the podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway.
a comparative qrt-pcr analysis of phenylpropanoid pathway genes identified in the present data was performed to analyze their expression patterns in 12-day cell culture, callus and rhizome.
