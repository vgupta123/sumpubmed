target plasmid dna was co-transfected with sirna expression vector dna into helas <dig> cells, and fluorescence or luminescence was measured.
before an in vivo study, optimal conditions for knocking down bprnp were determined in cultured mammalian cell systems.
four sirna expression plasmid vectors, six target sites of bprnp, and various lengths of sirnas from  <dig> mer to  <dig> mer were examined to establish optimal conditions for knocking down of bprnp in vitro.
hence, attempts were made to produce bovine prnp  that could be knocked down by rna interference  technology.
six target sites of bovine prnp were designed using an algorithm.
factors examined included sirna  expression plasmid vectors, target sites of prnp, and lengths of sirnas.
the activities of sirnas varied widely depending on the target sites, length of the sirnas, and vectors used.
as targets of sirna, the entire bprnp coding sequence was connected to the reporter gene of the fluorescent egfp, or of firefly luciferase or renilla luciferase.
although  <dig> mer ggggagaacttcaccgaaact expressed by a hu6-driven plasmid with a bsp mi cloning site was best under the present experimental conditions, the corresponding trna promoter-driven plasmid was almost equally useful.
four sirna expression plasmid vectors were used: three harboring different cloning sites were driven by the human u <dig> promoter , and one by the human trnaval promoter.
