the power of this method was demonstrated using recombinant proteins from the escherichia coli k <dig> strain.
the novel hybrid method described in this study will be useful for the large-scale experimental confirmation of genome coding sequences, without the need for transcriptome-level expression analysis or costly ms database searching.
moreover, the alternative approach of de novo sequencing requires costly equipment and the interpretation of complex ms/ms spectra.
the current study used standard lc-ms/ms data to query an in silico-generated six-reading-frame translation and the enzymatic digest of an entire genome.
used in conjunction with precursor/product ion-mass searching, the lc-ets increased confidence in the peptide-identification process and reduced the number of false-positive matches.
however, these methods cannot identify proteins that are not already listed in existing databases.
here, we present a hybrid method for genome-fingerprint scanning, known as hybgfs.
the hybrid method allows the simultaneous identification and mapping of proteins without a priori information about their coding sequences.
protein identification based on mass spectrometry  has previously been performed using peptide mass fingerprinting  or tandem ms  database searching.
thus, there is a need for novel high-throughput protein-identification methods that are independent of existing predefined protein databases.
