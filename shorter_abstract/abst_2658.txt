comparing zona-intact and zona-free eggs in fusion tests, we showed that the removal of the zona pellucida by acid treatment bypasses fertilizing oocyte alpha6beta <dig> integrin's function in the adhesion/fusion process.
these results and previous reports, about fertilization of alpha <dig> or beta <dig> integrin subunits deleted oocytes by wild type sperm, suggest that the presence of alpha6beta <dig> integrin on one of the two gamete membranes can rescue the fertilization process.
using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, we showed that the mouse sperm expresses the alpha6beta <dig> integrin.
