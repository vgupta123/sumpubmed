the processing and statistical analysis of such high-throughput data poses new challenges; currently a fair proportion of the tags are routinely discarded due to an inability to match them to a reference sequence, thereby reducing the effective throughput of the technology.
we propose a novel base calling algorithm using model-based clustering and probability theory to identify ambiguous bases and code them with iupac symbols.
we also select optimal sub-tags using a score based on information content to remove uncertain bases towards the ends of the reads.
