conventional laboratory culture showed positive growth from only 55 % of the patients, whereas 16s as was positive for 75 % of the patients .
the aim of this study was to characterise the microbiome of new and recurrent diabetic foot ulcers using 16s amplicon sequencing , allowing the identification of a wider range of bacterial species that may be important in the development of chronicity in these debilitating wounds.
the majority of otu’s residing in both new and recurrent ulcers  were identified as facultative or strict anaerobic gram-positive organisms.
the abundance of anaerobic bacteria has important implications for treatment as it suggests that the microbiome of each ulcer “starts afresh” and that, although diverse, are not distinctly different from one another with respect to new or recurrent ulcers.
therefore, when considering antibiotic therapy the duration of current ulceration may be a more important consideration than a history of healed ulcer.
principal component analysis  showed no difference in clustering between the two groups .

s. aureus was isolated in 72 % of culture-positive samples, whereas the most commonly detected bacteria in all ulcers were peptoniphilus spp., anaerococcus spp.
