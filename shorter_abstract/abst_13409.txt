previous approaches to resolving this problem have made use of various sources of information including linguistic features of the context in which the ambiguous term is used and domain-specific resources, such as umls.
like text in other domains, biomedical documents contain a range of terms with more than one possible meaning.
we compare various sources of information including ones which have been previously used and a novel one: mesh terms.
the best performance is obtained using a combination of linguistic features and mesh terms.
in particular, mesh terms have proved to be useful and should be used if available.
performance of our system exceeds previously published results for systems evaluated using the same data set.
these ambiguities form a significant obstacle to the automatic processing of biomedical texts.
