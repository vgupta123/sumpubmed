we examined the spatial and temporal gene expression patterns of the tc-mybpa gene and found it to be developmentally expressed in a manner consistent with its involvement in pas and anthocyanin synthesis.
interestingly, in addition to pa accumulation in seeds of the tc-mybpa expressing plants, we also observed an obvious increase of anthocyanidin accumulation in hypocotyls.
we observed that overexpression of the tc-mybpa gene resulted in increased expression of several key genes encoding the major structural enzymes of the pa and anthocyanidin pathway, including dfr , ldox  and ban .
we conclude that the tc-mybpa gene that encodes an r2r <dig> type myb transcription factor is an arabidopsis tt <dig> like transcription factor, and may be involved in the regulation of both anthocyanin and pa synthesis in cacao.
to explore the transcriptional regulation of the pa synthesis pathway in cacao, we isolated and characterized an r2r <dig> type myb transcription factor mybpa from cacao.
they also play important roles in pest and disease defense throughout the plant.
