it provides an accurate way to detect snvs using known software packages, and a novel methodology for detection of cnvs, though it does not currently support detection of small indels.
we present methods for the analysis of small eukaryotic genomes, including a streamlined system  for finding single nucleotide and copy number variants as well as recombination events.
we also identify  <dig> copy number variants with contributions to resistance, and report for the first time that all analyzed amplification events are in tandem.
the platypus pipeline provides malaria researchers with a powerful tool to analyze short read sequencing data.
we have validated that the pipeline detects known snvs in a variety of samples while filtering out spurious data.
we have validated our pipeline using four sets of plasmodium falciparum drug resistant data containing  <dig> clones from 3d <dig> and dd <dig> background strains, identifying an average of  <dig> single nucleotide variants per clone.
