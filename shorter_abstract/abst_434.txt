using a quantitative pcr based methodology, y-chromosomes can be reliably detected in the females with male fraternal twins allowing for a relative quantification of chimerism levels between individuals and tissues.
chimerism levels were significantly higher in tissues primarily derived from the hematopoietic lineage, while they were lower, though still detectable, in tissues with other origins.
with this approach in common marmosets  and cotton-top tamarins , chimerism was detected across a broad array of tissues.
the new world monkey family callitrichidae, containing both marmoset and tamarin species, typically produces dizygotic twins that show chimerism in the blood and other cells from the hematopoietic lineage.
using molecular methods to detect chimerism in a tissue sample seems to have allowed a substantial increase in the ability to detect these minor cell populations.
recently, a study extended these findings to identify chimerism in many tissues, including somatic tissues from other lineages and germ cells.
the chimerism detected in other tissues is likely the result of blood or lymphocytic infiltration.
fibroblast cell lines from chimeric individuals, however, are not found to be chimeric themselves.
while their unique biology can be exploited to provide insights into disease and function, it is also important that researchers are aware of the differences that exist between marmosets and other species.
