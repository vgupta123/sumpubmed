gsqua genes showed specific expression profiles.
based on expression patterns, none of the gerbera squa-like genes are likely to control flower organ identity in the sense of the floral a function.
however, our data shows that the ful-like gene gsqua <dig> plays a vital role in meristem transition.
in this paper we describe six gerbera genes related to the squamosa/apetala1/fruitfull genes of snapdragon and arabidopsis.
to understand how such a complex inflorescence structure is achieved at the molecular level, we have characterized the array of gerbera mads box genes.
the high number of squamosa-like genes in gerbera compared to other model species raised the question as to whether they may relate to gerbera's complex inflorescence structure and whether or not a homeotic a function is present.
the flowering process in plants proceeds through the induction of an inflorescence meristem triggered by several pathways.
the roles of other gsqua-genes in gerbera floral development are intriguing, but require still further study.
gerbera, a member of the sunflower family, asteraceae, bears compressed inflorescence heads  with three different flower types characterized by differences in both sexuality and floral symmetry.
based on phylogenetic analysis of the entire gene lineage, our data indicates that gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are members of the squa/ap <dig> clade, while gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are co-orthologs of the arabidopsis ful gene.
