this genomic position is not syntenic with fri in a. thaliana and comparative analysis revealed a recombination event within the a. thaliana fri promoter.
these show extensive amino acid conservation in the central and c-terminal regions to fri from other brassicaceae, including a. thaliana, but have a diverged n-terminus.
we identify the two brassica oleracea fri genes, one of which we show through a. thaliana complementation experiments is functional, and show their genomic location is not syntenic with a. thaliana fri due to an ancient recombination event.
this relocated a. thaliana fri to chromosome  <dig>  very close to the nucleolar organizer region, leaving a fragment of fri in the syntenic location on a. thaliana chromosome  <dig>  our data show this rearrangement occurred after the divergence from a. lyrata.
we explored the allelic variation at bolc.fri.a within cultivated b. oleracea germplasm and identified two major alleles, which appear equally functional both to each other and a. thaliana fri, when expressed as fusions in a. thaliana.
in arabidopsis thaliana frigida  confers a vernalization requirement and thus winter annual habit by increasing the expression of the mads box transcriptional repressor flowering locus c .
variation at fri plays a major role in a. thaliana life history strategy, as independent loss-of-function alleles that result in a rapid-cycling habit in different accessions, appear to have evolved many times.
the genes map to two of the three regions of b. oleracea chromosomes syntenic to part of a. thaliana chromosome  <dig> suggesting that one of the fri copies has been lost since the ancient triplication event that formed the b. oleracea genome.
