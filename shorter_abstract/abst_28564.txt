through simulations and case studies, we observe that our method performs better than gsea and gsa, especially when the number of prognostic gene sets is large.
a key objective in many microarray association studies is the identification of individual genes associated with clinical outcome.
in this paper, we propose a general permutation-based framework for gene set testing that controls the false discovery rate  while accounting for the dependency among the genes within and across each gene set.
