there has been an explosion in the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  within public databases.
in this study we focused on non-synonymous protein coding single nucleotide polymorphisms , some associated with disease and others which are thought to be neutral.
the performance as measured by the matthews correlation coefficient  varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  depending on the imbalance.
we describe the distribution of both types of nssnps using structural and sequence based features and assess the relative value of these attributes as predictors of function using machine learning methods.
we also address the common problem of balance within machine learning methods and show the effect of imbalance on nssnp function prediction.
