several procedures and companion software have been proposed to find the most stable genes.
differences among the expression values of normalized targets for each statistical approach were also found.
accurate selection of reference genes has a direct impact over the normalized expression values of a given target gene.
in the present work a statistical approach based in maximum likelihood estimation under mixed models was tested and compared with normfinder and genorm softwares.
this may be critical when the aim of the study is to compare expression rate differences among samples under different environmental conditions, tissues, cell types or genotypes.
reference genes with stable expression are required to normalize expression differences of target genes in qpcr experiments.
under the method here proposed sdha/mdh <dig> have arisen as the best set of reference genes to be used in qpcr assays to study heat shock in ovine blood samples.
sixteen candidate genes were tested in whole blood samples from control and heat stressed sheep.
mean square error obtained under the selected model was used as indicator of gene expression stability.
optimal statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation joined to mixed model flexibility allow for more accurate estimation of expression stability of genes under many different situations.
a model including gene and treatment as fixed effects, sample , gene by treatment, gene by sample and treatment by sample interactions as random effects with heteroskedastic residual variance in gene by treatment levels was selected using goodness of fit and predictive ability criteria among a variety of models.
to select reference genes not only statistical but also functional and biological criteria should be considered.
model based procedures are attractive because they provide a solid statistical framework.
