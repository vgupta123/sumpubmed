here we aim to assess the performance of the questionnaire using data from the first three years in relation to some descriptive and disease variables.
we propose that the descriptive variables and the disease variables be used as such when we generate hypotheses from the dogrisk data.
reliability against an official register of gender, season of birth, breed, and results of hip radiography was tested and cohen’s kappa was between  <dig> – <dig> .
we used associated questions, official register records, test-retest repeatability, and email/mail contact with questionnaire respondents.
test-retest repeatability of ten variables among  <dig> participants was analyzed.
the dogrisk questionnaire is an internet-based ongoing study of canine nutrition, living environment, and disease.
gender, season of birth, and born in owner family had cohen’s kappa >  <dig> , color of coat, vaccination status as an adult, other dogs in household, and vaccination status as a puppy had cohen’s kappa between  <dig> – <dig> , and body condition score under two months of age and tidiness of household, had cohen’s kappa of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
of the owners contacted by email/mail to confirm their dog’s atopy/allergy ,  <dig>  % reported that they had given an incorrect answer , but only 69 % of all reaffirmed positive answers had a diagnosis set by a veterinarian.
our study showed that owners were diligent with basic information and with the status of three diseases.
