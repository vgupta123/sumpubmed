up to 20 s-alleles, including  <dig> new ones, were detected and sequence analysis revealed interesting synonymies and homonymies in particular with s-alleles found in chinese cultivars.
according to apricot germplasm s-genotyping, a loss of genetic diversity affecting the s-locus has been produced probably due to crop dissemination.
<dig>  genotyping results showed that four cultivars classified as self-compatible do not have neither the s
lastly, other mutants putatively carrying new mutations conferring sc have also been identified deserving future research.
a set of  <dig> cultivars/accessions with different geographic origins were analyzed by pcr-screening of the s- and m-loci genotypes, contrasting results with the available phenotype data.
its origin is still unknown but phylogenetic analysis supports that m
c-haplotype carrying an insertion in the s-locus f-box gene that leads to a truncated protein.
0-haplotype is tightly associated with sc in apricot germplasm being quite frequent in europe and north-america.
this work was aimed to explore whether other additional mutations might explain sc in apricot as well.
c in terms of frequency and geographic distribution.
structures of  <dig> additional m-haplotypes were inferred and analyzed to depict phylogenetic relationships and m
however, two s-locus unlinked pollen-part mutations  termed m and m’ have also been reported to confer self-compatibility  in the apricot cultivars ‘canino’ and ‘katy’, respectively.
