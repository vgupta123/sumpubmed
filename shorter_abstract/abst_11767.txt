we show that soaking developing freshwater sponges in double-stranded rna and/or feeding marine and freshwater sponges bacteria expressing double-stranded rna can lead to rna interference and reduction of targeted transcript levels.
the marine sponge tethya wilhelma and the freshwater sponge ephydatia muelleri are emerging model organisms to study evolution, gene regulation, development, and physiology in non-bilaterian animal systems.
