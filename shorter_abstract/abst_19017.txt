the results of this study have shown that  <dig> subab-pcr positive stec strains contain complete subab open reading frames.
the open reading frames of subab genes and their flanking regions of  <dig> food-borne shiga toxin-producing e. coli  strains were analyzed.
a new chromosomal subab <dig> variant, designated subab2- <dig> was detected in  <dig> strains and was linked to a chromosomal gene hypothetically encoding an outer membrane efflux protein .
the subab <dig> genes of nine stec strains were located on large plasmids.
all but one subab open reading frames  were complete in all stec strains.

the subab <dig> allele , which was recently described by others to be present in the subtilase-encoding pai  was found in  <dig> stec strains.
three stec strains contained both subab <dig> variants.
