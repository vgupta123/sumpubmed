in the dcx-creert <dig> transgenic mice, expression of creert <dig> was restricted to dcx+ cells.
four weeks after recombination, the vast majority of reporter-expressing cells were found to co-express neun, revealing the neuronal fate of dcx+ cells upon maturation.
lack of appropriate tools and techniques to study fate and functional integration of newly generated neurons has so far hindered understanding of neurogenesis' relevance under physiological and pathological conditions.
here, we report a transgenic mouse model  for time-resolved fate analysis of newly generated neurons.
this first validation demonstrates that our new dcx-creert <dig> transgenic mouse model constitutes a powerful tool to investigate neurogenesis, migration and their long-term fate of neuronal precursors.
moreover, it allows for a targeted activation or deletion of specific genes in neuronal precursors and will thereby contribute to unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis.
in the adult cns, neurogenic regions were the primary sites of tamoxifen-induced reporter gene activation.
in addition, reporter expression could also be detected outside of neurogenic regions in cells physiologically expressing dcx .
