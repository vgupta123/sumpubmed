in b. pinnipedialis and b. ceti , manbo-ag carried an is <dig>  confirming its dispensability for perosamine synthesis.
the results define species and biovar markers, confirm the dispensability of manbo-ag for o-polysaccharide synthesis and contribute to explain the lipopolysaccharide structure of rough and smooth brucella species.
b. ovis wbkf carried a frame-shift and b. canis had a long deletion partially encompassing both genes.
b. ovis and b. canis  lack the o-polysaccharide.
