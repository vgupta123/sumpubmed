increasing evidence suggests that overlapping genes are much more common in eukaryotic genomes than previously thought.
about 10% of the genes under study are overlapping genes, the majority of which are different-strand overlaps.
the majority of the same-strand overlaps are embedded forms, whereas most different-strand overlaps are not embedded and in the convergent transcription orientation.
more than 96% of the same-strand and different-strand overlaps that are not shared between human and mouse have both genes located on the same chromosomes in the species that does not show the overlap.
most of the same-strand overlapping gene pairs show at least a tenfold difference in length, much larger than the length difference between non-overlapping neighboring gene pairs.
