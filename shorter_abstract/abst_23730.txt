the isolation of cd144+ cells during es cell differentiation from embryoid bodies provides an excellent model system and method for identifying genes that are expressed during endothelial differentiation and that are distinct from hematopoiesis.
by flow cytometry a population of vegf-r <dig> positive cells was identified as early as  <dig>  days after differentiation of es cells, and a subset of vegf-r2+ cells, that were cd <dig> positive at  <dig>  days.
a separate population of vegf-r2+ stem cells expressing the endothelial-specific marker cd <dig>  was also identified at this same time point.
all microarray experiments were performed in duplicate using rna obtained from independent experiments, for each subset of cells.
the molecular mechanisms of endothelial differentiation remain incompletely understood.
mouse embryonic stem  cells were used to further define the molecular mechanisms of endothelial differentiation.
channels lined by ve-cadherin positive cells developed within the embryoid bodies  formed by differentiating es cells.
ve-cadherin and cd <dig> expressing cells differentiate in close proximity to each other within the ebs, supporting the concept of a common origin for cells of hematopoietic and endothelial lineages.
endothelial differentiation occurs during normal vascular development in the developing embryo.
novel approaches are needed to identify the factors that regulate endothelial differentiation.
expression profiling confirmed the role of several genes involved in hematopoiesis, and identified several putative genes involved in endothelial differentiation.
microarray analysis of > <dig>  transcripts was performed on rna obtained from cells expressing vegf-r2+, cd41+, and cd144+ and vegf-r2-, cd41-, and cd144-.
