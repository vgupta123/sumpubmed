furthermore, new features of effectors were revealed: non-optimal codon usage and instability of the n-terminal region.
these discrimination features suggested that the following characteristics of effectors had been uncovered: unstable n-terminus, non-optimal codon usage, hydrophilic, and less aliphathic.
removal of the n-terminal instability, codon adaptation index and protparam indices decreased the score to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
many pathogens use a type iii secretion system to translocate virulence proteins  in order to adapt to the host environment.
this consists of a support vector machine-based discriminant analysis followed by a simple criteria-based filtering.
the accuracy was assessed by estimating the average number of true positives in the top- <dig> ranking in the genome-wide screening.
the secondary filtering process represented by coexpression analysis and domain distribution analysis further refined the average true positive counts to  <dig> .
in the validation,  <dig> sets of  <dig> training and  <dig> testing examples were randomly selected from  <dig> known effectors of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt <dig>  on average, the svm portion of our system predicted  <dig>  true positives from  <dig> testing examples in the top- <dig> of the prediction.
however, these tools are insufficiently accurate for producing a list of putative effectors that can be applied directly for labor-intensive experimental verification.
the level of accuracy was sufficient to yield candidates for gene-directed experimental verification.
to date, many prediction tools for effector identification have been developed.
in this study, we have constructed an accurate approach to predicting secreted virulence effectors from gram-negative bacteria.
from these findings, a new working hypothesis is proposed regarding mechanisms controlling the translocation of virulence effectors and determining the substrate specificity encoded in the secretion system.
we confirmed the accuracy of our system by external validation using known effectors of salmonella and obtained the accurate list of putative effectors of the organism.
