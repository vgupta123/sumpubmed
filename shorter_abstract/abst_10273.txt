further, these findings support that recombinant l.lactis/pnz2103-na can be used to perform mass vaccination in poultry during a/h5n <dig> pandemic.
the data obtained in the present study indicate that recombinant l.lactis/pnz2103-na in the absence of adjuvant can be considered an effective mucosal vaccine against h5n <dig> infection in chickens via oral administration.
most importantly, the results revealed that chickens administered orally with l.lactis/pnz2103-na were completely protected from a lethal h5n <dig> virus challenge.
however, neuraminidase , the other major glycoprotein on the surface of the influenza virus, has historically served as the target for antiviral drug therapy and is much less studied in the context of humoral immunity.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective immunity of na based on lactococcus lactis  expression system against homologous h5n <dig> virus challenge in a chicken model.
