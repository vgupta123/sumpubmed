phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> whole genome strains  indicated that our mlst scheme could clearly separate three closely related species within the salivarius group and is suitable for analyzing the population structure of the other two species in the salivarius group.
our newly developed mlst scheme improved the understanding on the genetic diversity and population structure of the s. thermophilus, as well as provided useful information for further studies on the genotyping and evolutionary research for s. thermophilus strains with global diversity.
streptococcus thermophilus is a major dairy starter used for manufacturing of dairy products.
phylogenetic trees indicated that there were five lineages in the s. thermophilus isolates used in our study.
sequences of  <dig> housekeeping genes  were obtained for 239 s. thermophilus strains, which were isolated from home-made fermented dairy foods in  <dig> different regions of mongolia and china.
the 239 s. thermophilus isolates and  <dig> reference strains could be assigned into  <dig> different sts, which could be further separated into  <dig> clonal complexes  and  <dig> singletons.
all  <dig> genes of s. thermophilus were sequenced, aligned, and defined sequence types  using the bionumerics software.
mstree and clonalframe tree analyses suggest that the evolution of s. thermophilus isolates have little relationship with geographic locality, but revealed no association with the types of fermented dairy product.

the population structure, phylogenetic relationships and the role of recombination were inferred using clonalframe v <dig> , splitstree  <dig>  and structure v <dig> .
in the present study, we developed a multilocus sequence typing  scheme for this important food bacterium.
the nucleotide diversity was calculated by start v <dig> .
