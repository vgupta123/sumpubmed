we show that knockdown of the ip3r, either in all neurons or in peptidergic neurons alone, mimics known itpr mutant phenotypes.
thus, the focus of observed itpr mutant phenotypes of starvation resistance, increased body weight, elevated lipid storage and hyperphagia derive primarily from peptidergic neurons.
the inositol  <dig> , <dig> trisphosphate receptor  is a ligand gated calcium channel present on the membranes of endoplasmic reticular stores.
while the phenotype manifests in cells of the fat body, genetic studies suggest dysregulation of a neurohormonal axis.
the present study shows that itpr function in peptidergic neurons is not only necessary but also sufficient for maintaining normal lipid metabolism in drosophila.
the peptidergic neuron domain includes, but is not restricted to, the medial neurosecretory cells as well as the stomatogastric nervous system.
our results suggest that intracellular calcium signaling in peptidergic neurons affects lipid metabolism by both cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.
cdna in the same set of peptidergic neurons rescues metabolic defects of itpr
transcript levels of a gene encoding a gastric lipase cg <dig> , which is known to regulate triacylglyceride storage, can be regulated by itpr knockdown and over-expression in peptidergic neurons.
