here we present evidence for the existence of functional pi3k intracellular signalling pathways in g. intestinalis.
g. intestinalis encodes and expresses two putative pi3ks, at least one of which appears to be required during normal parasite proliferation.
the identification of class i and class iii but not class ii isoforms suggests that both extracellularly-initiated signalling  and intracellular vesicle trafficking  might be controlled by pi3ks in g. intestinalis.
the presence of genes encoding putative homologues of phosphoinositide-metabolising enzymes and downstream effectors in the g. intestinalis genome further suggests that the overall architecture of pi3k signalling may be comparable with pathways present in other better-studied organisms.
phylogenetic analysis supports the identity of gipi3k <dig> as a class i isoform and gipi3k <dig> as a class iii isoform.
compared with twenty-six pi3ks from other organisms, gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> are unique in that they contain large insertions within their highly conserved kinase domains.
phosphoinositide- <dig> kinase  signalling pathways have a central involvement in many vital eukaryotic processes, such as regulation of cell growth, intracellular membrane trafficking and cell motility.
in addition, giardial genes encoding putative homologues of phosphoinositide-metabolising enzymes such as pten, mtm, pipkin and pi 5-phosphatase as well as downstream effectors with phosphoinositide-binding domains have been identified, placing gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig> in a broader signalling context.
we have identified and characterised two genes, gipi3k <dig> and gipi3k <dig>  which encode putative pi3ks.
the inhibitory effect of the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> on trophozoite proliferation also supports their functionality.
