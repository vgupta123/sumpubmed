however, it is likely that several horizontal gene transfers  also occurred in eukaryotic microorganisms and, even more surprisingly, in bacteria.
there are several contradictory classifications of chs isoenzymes and, as regards their evolutionary history, their origin and diversity is still a matter of debate.
this allowed us to revise and unify the fungal chs classification and to study the evolutionary history of the chs multigenic family.
concerning the evolutionary history of chs, this family has mainly evolved via duplications and losses.
it also highlights the importance of hgt in the evolutionary history of chs and describes bacterial chs genes for the first time.
phylogenetic analyses were performed with special care to avoid any pitfalls associated with the peculiarities of these sequences .
this polysaccharide is produced by type  <dig> glycosyltransferases, called chitin synthases .
a genome-wide analysis resulted in the detection of more than eight hundred putative chitin synthases in proteomes associated with about  <dig> genomes.
many of the bacteria that have acquired a chitin synthase are plant pathogens .

this comprehensive multi-species analysis contributes to the classification of fungal chs, in particular by optimizing its robustness, consensuality and accessibility.
