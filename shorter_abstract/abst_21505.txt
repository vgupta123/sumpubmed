at clinically relevant and equi-effective concentrations, presynaptic and postsynaptic anesthetic actions were evident at glutamate-mediated excitatory synapses and at gaba-mediated inhibitory synapses.
the present study compared and contrasted effects produced by five general anesthetics on synaptic circuitry in the ca <dig> region of hippocampal slices.
for example, most of propofol's depressant effect  was reversed with a gaba antagonist, but only a minor portion of isoflurane's depression was reversed .
these results, in as much as they may be relevant to anesthesia, indicate that general anesthetics act at several discrete sites, supporting a multi-site, agent specific theory for anesthetic actions.
