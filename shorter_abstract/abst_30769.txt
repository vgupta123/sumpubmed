trait mapping by allele association requires a high-density map, which could be obtained by the addition of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and short insertion and/or deletions  to ssr and aflp genetic maps.
a set of  <dig> candidate genes related to biotic and abiotic stresses were studied in  <dig> sunflower inbred lines.
the mean nucleotide polymorphism was moderate , as expected for inbred materials.
this includes the estimation of nucleotide diversity, the assessment of linkage disequilibrium structure  and the evaluation of selection processes.
consistent with the absence of population sub-structuring, ld for g <dig> decayed more rapidly  than the ld trend line for the entire set of  <dig> individuals .
in average,  <dig> snp was found per  <dig> nucleotides and  <dig> indels were identified in the complete data set.
knowledge about the patterns of diversity and the genetic relationships between breeding materials could be an invaluable aid in crop improvement strategies.
nucleotide diversity analysis of randomly selected candidate regions is a promising approach for the success of association analysis and fine mapping in the sunflower genome.
model-based population structure analysis allowed detection of admixed individuals within the set of accessions examined.
association analysis is a powerful tool to identify gene loci that may contribute to phenotypic variation.
moreover, knowledge of the distance over which ld persists, in agronomically meaningful sunflower accessions, is important to establish the density of markers and the experimental design for association analysis.
the relatively high frequency of snps within the elite inbred lines studied here, along with the predicted extent of ld over distances of  <dig> kbp  suggest that high resolution association mapping in sunflower could be achieved with marker densities lower than those usually reported in the literature.
