the gene ontology categories of the differentially expressed genes  and identified proteins  indicated that the tomato response is characterized by an increased oxidative stress accompanied by the production of proteins involved in the detoxification of oxygen radicals.
furthermore, tomato response is characterized by a reduced accumulation of photosynthetic proteins and a modification of the expression of various cell wall related genes.
aphids elicit a defense reaction based on the cross-communication of different hormone-related signaling pathways such as those related to the salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene and brassinosteroids.
our work allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the signaling events and the defense dynamics of the tomato response to aphids in a compatible interaction and, based on experimental data, a model of the tomatoâ€“aphid molecular interaction was proposed.
several biological functions were affected and genes related to the stress and defence response were the most represented.
we carried out a transcriptomic and proteomic study to get insights into the molecular mechanisms and dynamics of the tomato response to the macrosyphum euphorbiae aphid.
among them, the sa-signaling pathway and stress-responsive sa-dependent genes play a dominant role.
the time course analysis of aphid infestation indicated a complex, dynamic pattern of gene expression.
