the human genome sequence and expression profiles of transcripts in the inner ear have aided positional cloning approaches.
we have employed a bioinformatic approach to assemble the genes encoded by genomic regions that harbor various deafness loci.
we have established a list of strong candidate genes encoded by the regions linked to various nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss phenotypes by using a novel bioinformatic approach.
the advantages and shortcomings of this bioinformatic approach are discussed.
the candidates presented here provide a starting point for mutational analysis in well-characterized families along with genetic linkage to refine the loci.
such analyses have narrowed a list of  <dig> genes from suspected regions of the genome to a manageable number of about  <dig> for further analysis.
the knowledge of protein interactions offers additional advantages in selecting candidate genes within a mapped region.
