especially, combing binding-site information obtained from different pdb structures requires tedious work to align protein sequences.
for an input protein, tcbrp can quickly find all binding-site residues on the protein by automatically combining the information obtained from all pdb structures that consist of the protein of interest.
in the research on protein functional sites, researchers often need to identify binding-site residues on a protein.
the process becomes overwhelmingly difficult when researchers have a large set of proteins to analyze, which is usually the case in practice.
additionally, tcbrp presents the binding-site residues in different categories according to the interaction type.
a commonly used strategy is to find a complex structure from the protein data bank  that consists of the protein of interest and its interacting partner and calculate binding-site residues based on the complex structure.
however, since a protein may participate in multiple interactions, the binding-site residues calculated based on one complex structure usually do not reveal all binding sites on a protein.
in this study, we have developed a tool for calculating binding-site residues on proteins, tcbrp .
tcbrp also allows researchers to set the definition of binding-site residues.
thus, this requires researchers to find all pdb complexes that contain the protein of interest and combine the binding-site information gleaned from them.
