in the presence of np4p, some membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptides  killed microbes at lower concentration , whereas np4p itself was not bactericidal and did not interfere with bacterial growth at ≤  <dig> μg/ml.
np4p selectively enhanced the bactericidal activities of membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptides by increasing the efficacy of membrane disruption against the cytoplasmic membrane.
np4p is a synthetic peptide derived from a natural, non-antimicrobial peptide fragment  by substitution of all acidic amino acid residues with amides .
in contrast, the activities of antimicrobial agents with a distinct mode of action  were unaffected.
