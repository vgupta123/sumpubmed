these data show that unitary conductance can be bi-directionally modified by synaptic activity.
in the present study we have used whole-cell dendritic recording, failures analysis and non-stationary fluctuation analysis to investigate the mechanism of depotentiation of ltp.
in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus, it has been shown that ltp often involves a rapid increase in the unitary conductance of ampa receptor channels.
furthermore, there are at least two distinct mechanisms to restore synaptic strength from a potentiated state, which depend upon the mechanism of the previous potentiation.
