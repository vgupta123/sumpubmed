a large portion of the differentially expressed mirnas have roles in angiogenesis, with an additional group of mirnas being dysregulated in vascular disease processes.
findings of this study confirm the hypothesis that mirna expression profiles are different between canine splenic hemangiosarcoma, nodular hyperplasia, and normal spleens.
this study shows that mirna dysregulation is a potential player in the pathogenesis of canine splenic hemangiosarcoma.
micrornas  are short, non-coding rnas that play a role in post-transcriptional regulation, and differential expression of mirnas between normal and tumor tissue has been used to diagnose neoplastic diseases.
splenic masses are common in older dogs; yet diagnosis preceding splenectomy and histopathology remains elusive.
the objective of this study was to determine differential expression of mirnas by use of rna-sequencing in canine spleens that were histologically confirmed as hemangiosarcoma, nodular hyperplasia, or normal.
two other mirnas have been implicated in cancer pathways such as pten and cell cycle checkpoints.
twenty-two mirnas were found to be differentially expressed in hemangiosarcoma samples .
the finding of multiple mirnas with roles in angiogenesis and vascular disease is important, as hemangiosarcoma is a tumor of endothelial cells, which are driven by angiogenic stimuli.
