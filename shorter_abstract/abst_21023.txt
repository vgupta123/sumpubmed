the pathological effects of prion diseases in the brain are morphologically well defined, such as gliosis, vacuolation, and the accumulation of disease-specific protease-resistant prion protein .
gene ontology analysis assigned many of the up-regulated genes to functional groups associated with one of the primary neuropathological features of prion diseases, astrocytosis and gliosis; protein synthesis, inflammation, cell proliferation and lipid metabolism.
extensive data was collected and analyzed, from which we identified a core group of  <dig> prion-related genes  that consistently showed altered expression in mouse models.
these data provides a comprehensive list of genes that are consistently differentially expressed in multiple scrapie infected mouse models.
prion infection results in progressive neurodegeneration of the central nervous system invariably resulting in death.
the regulatory cytokine tgfb <dig>  involved in modulating the inflammatory response, was identified as the outstanding interaction partner for many of the prgs.
however, the underlying molecular events that lead to the death of neurons are poorly characterised.
using a computational tool, ingenuity pathway analysis , we were able to build networks of interacting genes from the prg list.
