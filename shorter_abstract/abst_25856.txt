the graphle web site currently includes several hundred biological networks representing predicted functional relationships from three heterogeneous data integration systems: s. cerevisiae data from biopixie, e. coli data using mefit, and h. sapiens data from hefalmp.
graphle serves as a search and visualization engine for biological networks, which can be managed locally  and investigated remotely.
investigators often wish to explore specific portions of such networks from a detailed, gene-specific perspective, and balancing this requirement with the networks' large size, complex structure, and rich metadata is a substantial computational challenge.
a wide variety of biological data can be modeled as network structures, including experimental results , computational predictions , or curated structures .
this neighborhood can then be refined and modified interactively, and the results can be saved either as publication-quality images or as raw data for further analysis.
