long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons , line and sine were more methylated in sperm dna, as were low-complexity repetitive elements in blastocysts.
the hypermethylation of bovine sperm dna compared to the embryo genome was confirmed.
bovine sperm and blastocysts were compared as a test of platform capability.
differentially methylated regions were distributed across various classes of bovine sperm genomic feature including primarily promoter, intronic and exonic regions, non-cpg-island regions  and cpg islands with low-to-intermediate cpg density.
such platforms should improve the study of the potential epigenetic risks of assisted reproductive technologies , the establishment sequence of embryonic cell lines and potential deviations in both gene expression and dna methylation capable of having long-term impact.
the blastocyst genome bore more methylation marks than sperm dna only in cpg islands with high cpg density.
this paper describes a novel platform dedicated to the genome-wide study of bovine dna methylation, including a complete pipeline for data analysis and visualization.
the platform allows processing and integrating of dna methylome and transcriptome data from the same sample.

the study of the embryo epigenome, in particular the dna methylome, has been made accessible thanks to the possibility of amplifying specific sequences according to their initial methylation status.
