multiple alignment methods strive to achieve ever increasing levels of average accuracy on benchmark sets while the accuracy of individual alignments is often overlooked.
this was achieved by a per-residue comparison between alternate alignments of the same sequences.
high quality multiple alignments are crucial in the transfer of annotation from one genome to another.
we have previously developed a method to automatically assess the accuracy and overall difficulty of multiple alignments.
