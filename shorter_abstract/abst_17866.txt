extensive tests on chemical compounds, biological networks and synthetic graphs show that the proposed system outperforms the most popular systems in query time over databases of medium and large graphs.
finding the subgraphs of a graph database that are isomorphic to a given query graph has practical applications in several fields, from cheminformatics to image understanding.
the applicability of such systems is limited to databases of small graphs, because their filtering power degrades on large graphs.
since subgraph isomorphism is a computationally hard problem, indexing techniques have been intensively exploited to speed up the process.
such systems filter out those graphs which cannot contain the query, and apply a subgraph isomorphism algorithm to each residual candidate graph.
this idea is used to both improve the filtering performance and speed up the subgraph isomorphism task.
in this paper, sing , a novel indexing system able to cope with large graphs, is presented.
other specific tests show that the proposed system is effective for single large graphs.
the key point is to make use of feature locality information.
