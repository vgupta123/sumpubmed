about  <dig>  million predicted proteins from the global ocean sampling expedition metagenome project were distributed into classes based either on homology to existing hidden markov models  of known families, or de novo by assessment of pairwise similarity.
for each family, we then selected a representative protein, which showed the closest homology to all other proteins in this family.
