two in vitro assays were developed which allow the measurement of phac and phaz activities in crude cell extracts of pseudomonas putida u. using the assays, it was demonstrated that the activity of phac decreased 5-fold upon exponential growth on nitrogen limited medium and octanoate.
it was found that in p. putida phac and phaz are concomitantly active, resulting in parallel synthesis and degradation of pha.
it has been suggested that overall pha metabolism is regulated by the Î²-oxidation pathway of which the flux is governed by intracellular ratios of / and /.
the key enzymes for pha metabolism are pha polymerase  and depolymerase .
moreover phac activity was found to be decreased, whereas phaz activity increased during growth.
sds-page analysis of isolated pha granules demonstrated that during growth, the ratio of / decreased.
using the assays developed in this study, we followed the enzymatic activities of phac and phaz during growth and correlated them to the amount of phasins on the pha granules.
availability of phasins on pha granules affected the activity of phac.
one reason for the changes in the enzymatic activity of phac and phaz could relate to a change in interaction with the phasin surface proteins on the pha granule.
little is known of how mcl-pha accumulation and degradation are controlled.
in order to investigate the latter, assays for in vitro activity measurements of phac and phaz in crude cell extracts are necessary.
