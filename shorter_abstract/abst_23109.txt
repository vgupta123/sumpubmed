we identified  <dig> gene paralogues  and  <dig> splice variants, of which  <dig> had functional domains missing that were likely to affect their biological function.
physiological status affected the number of reads that mapped to isotigs, reflecting changes in gene expression between treatments.
many key transcription factors, signaling molecules and structural proteins necessary for myogenesis and muscle growth have been identified.
the average coverage of the annotated isotigs was x <dig> containing  <dig> unique gene ids and  <dig> full-length cdnas coding for proteins containing 58â€“ <dig> amino acids.
an annotated transcriptome of the skeletal muscle will facilitate understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of traits linked to production in this economically important species.
here we present a de novo assembly of the fast skeletal muscle transcriptome of gilthead sea bream using  <dig> reads and identify gene paralogues, splice variants and microsatellite repeats.
around  <dig>  million reads of mrna sequence data were generated from the fast myotomal of adult fish  and juvenile fish  that had been either fed to satiation, fasted for 3-5d or transferred to low  or high  temperatures for 3-5d.
we have produced a comprehensive fast skeletal muscle transcriptome for the gilthead sea bream, which will provide a resource for snp discovery in genes with a large effect on production traits of commercial interest and for expression studies of growth and adaptation.
the gilthead sea bream  occurs around the mediterranean and along eastern atlantic coasts from great britain to senegal.
gilthead sea bream are extensively cultivated in the mediterranean with an annual production of  <dig>  metric tonnes.
