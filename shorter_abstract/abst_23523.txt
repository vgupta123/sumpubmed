the study of nematode cell wall degrading enzymes not only enhance our understanding of the interaction between nematodes and their host, but also provides information on a novel source of enzymes for their potential use in biomass based biofuel/bioproduct industries.
the outcomes of this study will help in developing better strategies to curtail the nematode infection, as well as help in identification of novel cell wall degrading enzymes for biofuel/bioproduct industries.
although there is comprehensive information available on genome wide analysis of cwdes for bacteria, fungi, termites and plants, but no comprehensive information available for plant pathogenic nematodes.
the plant cell wall serves as a primary barrier against pathogen invasion.
additionally, we have also developed a nematodeâ€™s plant cell wall degrading enzyme  database as a platform to provide a comprehensive outcome of the present study.
during the infection process, plant parasitic nematodes secrete cell wall degrading enzymes  apart from piercing with their stylet, a sharp and hard mouthpart used for successful infection.
using the hidden markov models  conserved domain profiles of the respective gene families, we have identified  <dig> genes encoding cwdes that are distributed among  <dig> gene families of glycoside hydrolases  and polysaccharide lyases .
our study provides collective information about different families of cwdes from five different sequenced plant pathogenic nematode species.
herein we have performed a genome wide analysis of cwdes from the genome sequenced phyto pathogenic nematode species and developed a comprehensive publicly available database.
in the present study, we have performed a genome wide analysis for the presence of cwdes from five plant parasitic nematode species with fully sequenced genomes covering three genera viz.
furthermore, expression profiles of these genes were analyzed across the life cycle of a potato cyst nematode.
