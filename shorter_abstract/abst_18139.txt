the  <dig> tag clusters comprised narrow promoters , broad with peak promoters  and broad without peak promoters .
gene ontology terms associated with developmental processes were overrepresented in the narrow and broad with peak promoters.
two-way motif co-occurrence analysis showed that the mte-dpe pair is over-represented in broad core promoters.
the increasing availability of tss seq data allows for revision of existing gene annotation datasets with the potential of identifying new transcriptional units.
the study has identified different motif combinations associated with broad promoters in a blood-feeding insect.
the −1/+ <dig> and 1/+ <dig> positions in d. melanogaster, and g. m. morsitans had propensity for ca and aa dinucleotides respectively.
there were  <dig> tag clusters among which  <dig>  %  of the tag clusters mapped to first coding exons or their proximal predicted 5′utr regions and  <dig>  %  tag clusters mapping to transposons, within a threshold of  <dig> tags per cluster.
promoters without the tata motif had higher frequency of the mte and inr motifs than those observed in drosophila, where the dpe motif occur more frequently in promoters without tata motif.
morsitans uses the mte to compensate for the lack of a tata motif.
in the case of tata-less core promoters, g.m.
the frequently occurring triplet motifs in all promoter classes are the inr-mte-dpe, tata-mte-dpe and tata-inr-dpe.
these  <dig> non transposon-derived core promoters had propensity for at nucleotides.

to this end, the genome scale analysis of core promoter architecture in insects has been confined to drosophila.
a computational method for identification of tss in newly sequenced tsetse fly genome was evaluated, using tss seq tags sampled from two developmental stages namely; larvae and pupae.
