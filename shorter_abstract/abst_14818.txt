however, biological interpretation of such results can be rather tedious.
mapman is a software tool that displays large datasets  onto diagrams of metabolic pathways or other processes and thus enables easier interpretation of results.
we here also present results on transcriptional profiling of grape plantlets after exposal to the fungal pathogen eutypa lata using operon microarrays including visualization of results with mapman.
mapman was first validated on an already published dataset and later used to obtain an overview of transcriptional changes in a susceptible grapevine â€“ eutypa lata interaction at the time of symptoms development, where we showed that the responsive genes belong to families known to be involved in the plant defence towards fungal infection .
to enable easy and effective visualization of those and further experiments, annotation of vitis vinifera gene index  to mapman ontology was set up.
the extension of mapman ontology to grapevine together with the newly constructed pictorial representations for carotenoid, terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism provide an alternative approach to the analysis of grapevine gene expression experiments performed with affymetrix or operon microarrays.
due to specificities of grape physiology, we have created new pictorial representations focusing on three selected pathways: carotenoid pathway, terpenoid pathway and phenylpropanoid pathway, the products of these pathways being important for wine aroma, flavour and colour, as well as plant defence against pathogens.
two microarray platforms were designed based on the tigr gene index database and used in several physiological studies.
the data show that the genes induced in infected plants, encode pathogenesis related proteins and enzymes of the flavonoid metabolism, which are well known as being responsive to fungal infection.
