the present study revealed that ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> mrnas are elevated in the spleen, iliac lymph nodes , and genital mucosa following chlamydia muriduram challenge.
following genital chlamydial infection, an early t helper type  <dig> -associated immune response precedes the activation and recruitment of specific th <dig> cells bearing distinct chemokine receptors, subsequently leading to the clearance of chlamydia.
antibody -mediated inhibition of ccl <dig> during genital chlamydial infection suppressed humoral and th <dig> > th <dig> cellular responses by splenic-, iln-, and genital mucosa-derived lymphocytes.
the suppression of these responses correlated with delayed clearance of c. muriduram, which indicate chlamydial immunity is mediated by th <dig> immune responses driven in part by ccl <dig>  taken together with other studies, the data show that ccl <dig> mediates the temporal recruitment and activation of leukocytes to mitigate chlamydial infection through enhancing adaptive mucosal humoral and cellular immunity.
antigen -specific proliferative responses of cd4+ t cells from spleen, ilns, and genital organs also declined after ccl <dig> inhibition.
we have shown that ccr <dig>  a receptor for ccl <dig>  is crucial for protective chlamydial immunity.
these findings suggest the ccr5-ccl <dig> axis is necessary for optimal chlamydial immunity.
