the observed effect of pa and sn on rin cell viability was mediated by p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase -signaling and was achieved through auto-destructive nitric oxide  production.
it is well known that both saturated fatty acids and various products of immune cells can contribute to the reduction of beta cell viability and functionality during diabetes pathogenesis.
therefore, we explored the possibility that leukocytes and saturated fatty acids cooperate in beta cell destruction.
these results imply that stimulated t cells produce cytokines that cooperate with saturated free fatty acids in beta cell destruction during diabetes pathogenesis.
rat pancreatic islets or insulinoma cells  were co-cultivated with concanavalin a -stimulated rat lymph node cells , or they were treated with cell-free supernatants  obtained from cona-stimulated spleen cells or from activated cd3+ cells, in the absence or presence of palmitic acid .
diabetes is characterized by progressive failure of insulin producing beta cells.
however, their joint action on beta cells has not been investigated, so far.
the cooperative effect of sn was mimicked with the combination of interleukin-1β, interleukin- <dig>  interleukin- <dig>  interleukin- <dig>  interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α.
