a pharmacophore model consists of a group of chemical features arranged in three-dimensional space that can be used to represent the biological activities of the described molecules.
however, efficient clustering of pharmacophore models in three-dimensional space is currently a challenge.
we apply our three-dimensional pharmacophore clustering method to two sets of experimental data, including  <dig> globulin-binding steroids and  <dig> groups of selected antibody-antigen complexes.
results are translated from distance matrices to newick format and visualised using dendrograms.
the implementation of the method takes pharmacophore files as input and produces distance matrices.
