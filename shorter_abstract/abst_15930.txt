the hop bush, dodonaea viscosa, is a trans-oceanic species distributed oversix continents.
limited genomic resources are currently available for this species, thus our understanding of its evolutionary history and ecological adaptation is restricted.
the subspecies comparison identified  <dig>  fixed snp differences across  <dig>  contiguous sequences, indicating a level of genetic differentiation between them.
we performed illumina sequencing of cdna prepared from leaf tissue collected from seven populations of d. viscosa ssp.
we have established a significant genomic data resource for d. viscosa,providing a comprehensive transcriptomic reference.
a wide range of putative gene regions were identified along with a large set of variable snp markers, providing a basis for studies into the evolution and ecological adaptation of d. viscosa.
gene ontology terms were assigned to  <dig>  contigs and kegg analysis identified  <dig> pathways that the gene products from  <dig>  contigs are potentially involved in.
it evolved in australia where it is found over a wide range of habitat types and is an ecologically important species.
angustissima and spatulata distributed along an environmental gradient in south australia.

contiguous sequences  were annotated using blast searches against the ncbi non-redundant database and gene ontology definitions were assigned.
