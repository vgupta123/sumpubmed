further, to understand the different cellular functions that these domains may be involved in, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of additional domains that associate with fyve and px.
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is involved in regulation of several key cellular processes, mainly endocytosis, signaling, nuclear processes, cytoskeletal remodelling, cell survival, membrane trafficking, phagosome maturation and autophagy.
higher numbers of taxonomic group specific domains co-occur with the more abundant domain  indicating that group-specific rare domain architectures might have emerged to accomplish certain group-specific functions.
excess of fyve in streptophytes results from proteins containing rcc1and dzc domains and fyve domains in these proteins have a non-canonical ligand-binding site.
also, while certain associated domains are present in all taxonomic groups, most of them are unique to a specific group indicating that while certain common functions are discharged by these domains in all taxonomic groups, some functions appear to be group specific.
there is selectivity for either fyve or px in individual genomes where both domains are present.
within a taxonomic group the selected domain associates with a higher number of other domains and is thus expected to discharge a larger number of cellular functions.
in most cases effector proteins bind to this lipid, using either fyve or px domain.
