lip <dig> exhibits a broad temperature stability range and tolerates the presence of dtt, edta, pmsf, Î²-mercaptoethanol and high concentrations of salt.
the 3d model highlighted the presence of a one-helix lid able to regulate the access of the substrate to the active site when the enzyme binds a hydrophobic interface.
moreover an analysis of the external surface of lip <dig> model showed that the majority of the surface regions were hydrophobic  compared with homologous lipases  used as templates.
taken together, these results suggest that this esterase could be a highly valuable candidate for biotechnological applications such as organic synthesis reactions and cheese ripening processes.
the catalytic triad of lip <dig> was predicted to be asp <dig>  his <dig> and the catalytic nucleophile ser <dig> in a conserved pentapeptide .
the recombinant lip <dig> esterase, expressed and purified from escherichia coli, preferentially hydrolyzed short and medium length p-nitrophenyl esters with the best substrate being p-nitrophenyl acetate.
here we present a novel esterase gene  identified by functional screening of three fosmid metagenomic libraries, constructed from three marine sediment samples.
