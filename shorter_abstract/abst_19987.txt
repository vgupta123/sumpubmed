functional enrichment analysis showed that as genes are involved in most known biological functions and enriched in atp biosynthesis, sexual/asexual reproduction, morphogenesis, signal transduction etc., predicting that the as regulation modulates mrna isoform output and shapes the v. dahliae proteome plasticity of the pathogen in response to the environmental and developmental changes.
hundreds of novel intron types involving a pair of new splice sites were identified in the v. dahliae genome.
we identified alternatively spliced mrna isoforms in over a half of the multi-exonic fungal genes.
we showed that one verticillium gene could use four different 5′ splice sites and two different 3′ donor sites to produce up to five mature mrnas, representing one of the most sophisticated alternative splicing model in eukaryotes other than animals.
over one-thousand isoforms involve tophat novel splice junction; multiple types of combinatory alternative splicing patterns were identified.
