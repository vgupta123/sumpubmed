we addressed this issue by de novo sequencing transcriptome libraries of representatives of all orders of holometabolan insects  and by using a previously published extensive morphological dataset.
by maximum parsimony-based mapping of the morphological data on the phylogenetic relationships we traced evolutionary transformations at the phenotypic level and reconstructed the groundplan of holometabola and of selected subgroups.
the monophyly of coleopterida  remains ambiguous in the analyses of the transcriptome data, but appears likely based on the morphological data.
we show that the combination of well-resolved phylogenies obtained by phylogenomic analyses and well-documented extensive morphological datasets is an appropriate basis for reconstructing complex morphological transformations and for the inference of evolutionary histories.
our phylogenetic results imply that an orthognathous larva belongs to the groundplan of holometabola, with compound eyes and well-developed thoracic legs, externally feeding on plants or fungi.
we tested competing phylogenetic hypotheses by analyzing various specifically designed sets of amino acid sequence data, using maximum likelihood  based tree inference and four-cluster likelihood mapping .
ml tree inference and fclm yielded largely congruent results.
in our analysis of the amino acid sequence data of  <dig>  single-copy orthologous genes, hymenoptera are placed as sister group to all remaining holometabolan orders, i.e., to a clade aparaglossata, comprising two monophyletic subunits mecopterida  and neuropteroidea .
however, fclm, which was applied here for the first time to large phylogenomic supermatrices, displayed additional signal in the datasets that was not identified in the ml trees.
