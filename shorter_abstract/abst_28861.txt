western blot analyses showed that elevated hmga1a-egfp levels affected chromatin composition through either down-regulation of histone h <dig> or premature expression of mecp <dig>  rt-pcr analyses further revealed that sustained hmga1a expression also affected myogenic gene expression and caused either down-regulation of genes such as myod, myogenin, igf <dig>  igf <dig>  igfbp1- <dig> or up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor msx <dig>  interestingly, sirna experiments demonstrated that knock-down of hmga1a was required and sufficient to reactivate the myogenic program in induced hmga1a over-expressing cells.
this may be due to specific gene regulation and/or global effects on chromatin.
our data demonstrate that hmga <dig> down-regulation after induction is required to initiate the myogenic program in c2c <dig> cells.
thus, hmga <dig> is able to establish a specific chromatin composition.
here we used mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts and c2c <dig> cells stably over-expressing hmga1a-egfp to study the impact of deregulated hmga <dig> expression levels on cellular differentiation.
this work contributes to the understanding of how differential hmga <dig> expression is involved in chromatin organization during cellular differentiation processes and it may help to comprehend effects of hmga <dig> over-expression occurring in malign or benign tumours.
we found that induction of the myogenic or osteogenic program of c2c <dig> cells caused an immediate down-regulation of hmga <dig>  in contrast to wild type c2c <dig> cells, an engineered cell line with stable over-expression of hmga1a-egfp failed to differentiate into myotubes.
sustained hmga1a expression after induction prevents expression of key myogenic factors.
immunolocalization studies demonstrated that sustained hmga1a-egfp expression prevented myotube formation and chromatin reorganization that normally accompanies differentiation.
our data further corroborate that altered hmga <dig> levels influence the expression of other chromatin proteins.
differential expression of hmga variants has been found to be important for distinct differentiation processes and deregulated expression was linked to several disorders.
