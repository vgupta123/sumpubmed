previously uncharacterized phosphorylation sites at serines 46/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified by manual edman degradation and phosphoamino acid analysis and confirmed by mutagenesis and phospho-specific antibodies.
additionally protein kinase ck <dig> was identified as a kinase that phosphorylated erα at s <dig> and s <dig> using motif analysis, in vitro kinase assays, and incubation of cells with ck <dig> kinase inhibitor.
mutation of ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> to alanine  resulted in ligand independent activation of erα as determined by both ere-driven reporter gene assays and endogenous ps <dig> gene expression in transiently transfected hela cells.
to determine if additional erα phosphorylation sites exist, cos- <dig> cells expressing human erα were labeled with h3po <dig> in vivo and erα tryptic phosphopeptides were isolated to identify phosphorylation sites.
these novel erα phosphorylation sites represent new means for modulation of erα activity.
estrogen receptor α  phosphorylation is important for estrogen-dependent transcription of er-dependent genes, ligand-independent receptor activation and endocrine therapy response in breast cancer.
s <dig> represents the first phosphorylation site identified in the extreme c-terminus  of a steroid receptor.
however erα phosphorylation at the previously identified sites does not fully account for these receptor functions.
antibodies detected phosphorylation of endogenous erα in mcf- <dig>  mcf-7-lcc <dig>  and ishikawa cancer cell lines by immunoblot.
