network visualizations -- molecular maps -- created from an open-ended programming environment rich in statistical power and data-handling facilities, such as rcytoscape, will play an essential role in this progression.
progress in bioinformatics and computational biology depends upon exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, upon inference, and upon modeling.
