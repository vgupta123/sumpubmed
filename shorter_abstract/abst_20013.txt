the platform is available at http://crowd.bioops.info/, and the source code can be openly accessed at https://github.com/bioops/crowdnodnet under mit license.
the platform could also be used for other biological processes, and thus has great potential for integrating and advancing our understanding of the functional genomics and systems biology of any process for any species.
in addition, all the gene information is written on mediawiki pages, enabling users to edit and contribute to the network curation.
gene lists, gene interactions and gene functional annotations.
the legumes  are an economically and ecologically important group of plant species with the conspicuous capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules, specialized plant organs containing symbiotic microbes.
in order to accurately and efficiently reconstruct nodulation gene network, a crowdsourcing platform, crowdnodnet, was created.
the platform implements the jquery and vis.js javascript libraries, so that users are able to interactively visualize and edit the gene network, and easily access the information about the network, e.g.
