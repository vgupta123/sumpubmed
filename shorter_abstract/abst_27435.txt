it was suggested that the genes encoding α-hemolysin  which can be found on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through horizontal gene transfer.
transcription of the hlya gene was higher than the housekeeping icda gene in all strains .
we have investigated  <dig> α-hly plasmids from animal and human etec, stec and epec strains.
nucleotide sequence analysis of a chromosomally located α-hly determinant in enterobacter cloacae strain indicates that it originates from an e. coli α-hly plasmid.
conjugative plasmids could contribute to the spread of the α-hly determinant to enterobacter cloacae.
alpha -hemolysin is a pore forming cytolysin and serves as a virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli.
plasmid-encoded α-hly is associated with certain enterotoxigenic , shigatoxigenic  and enteropathogenic e. coli  strains.
in uropathogenic e. coli , the α-hly genes are located on chromosomal pathogenicity islands.
our data indicate that plasmids encoding α-hly in e. coli descended from a common ancestor independent of the plasmid size and the origin of the strains.
the plasmid-encoded α-hly genes could be further divided into three groups based on the insertion of is <dig> and is <dig> in the regulatory region upstream of the α-hly operon.
the dna sequence of hlyc and hlya divided the plasmid- and chromosomally-encoded α-hemolysins into two clusters.
