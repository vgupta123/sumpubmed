the phylogenetic tree of the coronin domains based on the bayesian method is in accordance with the most recent grouping of the major kingdoms of the eukaryotes and also with the grouping of more recently separated branches.
two major types of coronins are known: first, the short coronins consisting of an n-terminal coronin domain, a unique region and a short coiled-coil region, and secondly the tandem coronins comprising two coronin domains.
based on this "holistic" approach the coronins group into four classes: class- <dig>  and class- <dig>  are metazoan/choanoflagellate specific classes, class- <dig> contains the tandem-coronins , and the new class- <dig> represents the coronins fused to villin .
the most ancient short coronin already contained the trimerization motif in the coiled-coil domain.
coronins belong to the superfamily of the eukaryotic-specific wd40-repeat proteins and play a role in several actin-dependent processes like cytokinesis, cell motility, phagocytosis, and vesicular trafficking.
the organisms analyzed represent most eukaryotic kingdoms but also cover every taxon several times to provide a better statistical sampling.
short coronins from non-metazoans are equally related to class- <dig> and class- <dig> coronins and thus remain unclassified.
