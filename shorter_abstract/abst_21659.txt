our results demonstrate that it is possible to reroute the intracellular trafficking of vesicles by changing the localisation of snare molecules, this approach can be used in in vivo biological studies to clarify the different control mechanisms regulating intracellular membrane trafficking.
therefore a novel secretion pathway for intracellular proteins was developed, using peroxisomes as secretion vesicles.
intracellular proteins were transported into the peroxisomes by adding a peroxisomal import signal .
in addition we demonstrate peroxicretion of a diverse set of intracellular proteins.
therefore, we anticipate that the concept of peroxicretion may revolutionize the production of intracellular proteins from fungi and other microbial cells, as well as from mammalian cells.
this allowed the peroxisomes to fuse with the plasma membrane.
