although the clinical results of autologous chondrocyte implantation for articular cartilage defects have recently improved as a result of advanced techniques based on tissue engineering procedures, problems with cell handling and scaffold imperfections remain to be solved.
chondrocyte sheets applicable to cartilage regeneration can be prepared with this cell-sheet technique using temperature-responsive culture dishes.
the expression of sox  <dig>  collagen type  <dig>   <dig>  integrin α <dig>  and fibronectin genes in triple-layered chondrocyte sheets was significantly increased in comparison to those in conventional monolayer culture and in a single chondrocyte sheet, implying a nature similar to ordinary cartilage.
in addition, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that collagen type ii, fibronectin, and integrin α <dig> were present in the triple-layered chondrocyte sheets.
the results of this study indicate that these chondrocyte sheets with a consistent cartilaginous phenotype and adhesive properties may lead to a new strategy for cartilage regeneration.
a new cell-sheet technique has been developed, and is potentially able to overcome these obstacles.
