sites showing highest pkc系 expression were heart at ealier stages, and ganglia in older embryos.
the seemingly strong expression of pkc系 in heart and ganglia shown in this study suggests a important role of this isoform in the vascular and nervous systems during mouse development.
other stained domains included somites, bone, stomach, kidney, and blood vessels.
in this study, we contribute to expand the knowledge on pkc系 by reporting its expression pattern during murine midgestation using the lacz reporter gene and immunostaining procedures.
however, functional redundancy with other pkcs during midgestation within these domains and others reported here possibly exists since pkc系 deficient mice do not display obvious embryonic developmental defects.
