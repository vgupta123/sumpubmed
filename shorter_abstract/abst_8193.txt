after magnetic separation, complexes of mnb-sdab-virus were detected with either a sandwich elisa or qds-c <dig> probe under a fluorescence microscope, and the complexes were used as templates for extraction of total rna for amplification of the vp <dig> or 3d gene fragments using rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr.
moreover, this method has been successfully used to capture asia  <dig> antigen in synthetic samples.
