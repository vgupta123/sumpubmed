the data is available for interactive exploration at http://histo.ucsf.edu.
to further enrich our analysis, we incorporated expression data from whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays.
a functional interrogation of the histoplasma genome provides critical support for continued investigation into the biology and pathogenesis of h. capsulatum and related fungi.
we employed a three-pronged approach to provide a functional annotation for the h. capsulatum g217b strain.
these analyses yielded a high confidence set of validated gene predictions for h. capsulatum.
these expression data included profiling under growth conditions that were not represented in the tiling experiment, and validated an additional  <dig>  gene predictions.
these data defined  <dig>  transcriptionally active regions , providing validation of  <dig>  gene predictions.
additionally, we detected transcription of  <dig> novel genes not present in the original gene predictions.
finally, we compared the g217b gene predictions to other available fungal genomes, and observed that an additional  <dig> gene predictions had an ortholog in a different fungal species, suggesting that they represent genuine coding sequences.
