pgc movements are well studied, but much less is known of the migratory events and other interactions undergone by their somatic partners.
gonads of drosophila are formed from three distinct cell types: primordial germ cells , somatic gonadal precursors , and in males, male-specific somatic gonadal precursors .
our data suggest that the initial association of sgp clusters is under distinct control from the movements that drive gonad compaction.
our work establishes the drosophila gonad as a model system for the analysis of coordinated cell migrations and morphogenesis using live imaging and demonstrates that six <dig> is a key regulator of somatic cell function during gonadogenesis.
six <dig> affects mssgp migration by a different pathway as these move normally in hmgcr mutant embryos.
we have used time-lapse fluorescence imaging to characterise gonadal cell behaviour in wild type and mutant embryos.
both modes of migration occur during drosophila embryonic gonad development, which therefore provides a paradigm for understanding the contribution of these processes to organ morphogenesis.
