in this study, clustering was performed using a bitmap representation of hiv reverse transcriptase and protease sequences, to produce an unsupervised classification of hiv sequences.
a new cluster representation was proposed using an image inspired by microarray data, such that the rows in the image represented the protein sequences from the genotype data and the columns represented presence or absence of mutations in each protein position.the visualization of the clusters showed that some mutations frequently occur together and are probably related to an epistatic phenomenon.
the classification will aid our understanding of the interactions between mutations and drug resistance.
we described a methodology based on the application of a pattern recognition algorithm using binary data to suggest clusters of mutations that can easily be discriminated by cluster viewing schemes.
