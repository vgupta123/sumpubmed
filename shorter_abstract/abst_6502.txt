further, evidence for branch and site heterogeneity in selection pressures, as well as divergent selection pressures between ucp <dig> and its paralogs  is observed.
as such, this study aims to determine the evolutionary mode of ucp <dig> in eutherians, where there is clear evidence of ucp1-dependent nst in bat.
ucp <dig> orthologs have been identified in non-eutherian mammals, fish and amphibians.
an increase in the rate of amino acid substitutions on the branch leading to eutherians is observed, but is best explained by relaxed constraints, not positive selection.
we propose that the unique thermogenic function of ucp <dig> in eutherians may be best explained by neutral processes.
uncoupling protein  <dig>  is a mitochondrial anion carrier, expressed in brown adipose tissue  of eutherians.
models of adaptive evolution through phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences by maximum likelihood were implemented to determine the mode of ucp <dig> protein evolution in eutherians.
