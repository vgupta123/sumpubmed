the availability of genome sequences for both human and mosquito host greatly facilitates genome-wide studies of denv-host interactions.
putative denv-associated proteins were further selected for validation by rnai-mediated gene silencing, and dengue viral titer in mosquito midguts was significantly reduced for five out of ten  randomly selected genes.
using three datasets based on physical interaction assays, genome-wide rna interference  screens and microarray assays, we identified  <dig> putative denv-associated mosquito proteins.
our results indicate the presence of common host requirements for denv in mosquitoes and humans.
we developed the first draft of the mosquito protein interaction network using a computational approach.
we discuss the significance of our findings for pharmacological intervention and genetic modification of mosquitoes for blocking dengue transmission.
we demonstrated the application of this network for the further annotation of mosquito proteins and dissection of pathway crosstalk.
