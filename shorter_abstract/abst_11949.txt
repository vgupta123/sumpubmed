finally, an interactome of these proteins based either on in silico or on 2-yeast-hybrid experimental approaches is discussed.
a comprehensive directory of proteins reported to be potentially involved in plasmodium transcriptional machinery was built from all in silico reports and databanks.
this is the first attempt to build a comprehensive directory of potential transcription-associated proteins in plasmodium.
the transcription-associated proteins were clustered in three main sets of factors: general transcription factors, chromatin-related proteins , and specific transcription factors.
furthermore, from transcriptome and proteome data we modelled expression patterns of transcripts and corresponding proteins during the intra-erythrocytic cycle.
during its complex life cycle in the anopheles vector and human host, the parasite requires the coordinated and modulated expression of diverse sets of genes involved in epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
in addition, all complete transcriptome, proteome and interactome raw data were re-analysed, compared and discussed for a better comprehension of the complex biological processes of plasmodium falciparum transcriptional regulation during the erythrocytic development.
