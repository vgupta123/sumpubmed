in contrast, deletions in chromosome arms carrying the nucleolar organizing region did not change recombination frequencies in the remainder of those chromosomes.
interestingly, two independent cases of induced structural changes in the same chromosomal interval were found on both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in both cases, compensatory increases in recombination frequencies were of similar strength and took place in the same chromosome region.
we have introduced large structural changes into arabidopsis chromosomes and report their effects on crossover positioning.
however, the similarity in reaction observed when looking at chromosomes carrying similar changes suggests a direct causal relation between induced change and observed reaction.
moreover, different reactions to induced structural changes are observed between and within chromosomes.
the introduction of large deletions and putative inversions silenced recombination over the length of the structural change.
when taken together, these observations show that changes in the physical structure of the chromosome can have large effects on the positioning of cos within that chromosome.
crossing over assures the correct segregation of the homologous chromosomes to both poles of the dividing meiocyte.
the loss of crossovers at the sites of structural change was compensated for by increases in recombination frequencies elsewhere on the chromosomes, mostly in single intervals of one to three megabases in size.
