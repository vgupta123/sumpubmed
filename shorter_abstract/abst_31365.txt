flow cytometric  and ovarian section analyses showed lacz+ cells constitute approximately 20% of ose in postnatal  mice which fell to 8% in  <dig> day-old animals while in prepubertal and adult mice this accounted for only  <dig> % of ose.
the study raises the possibility that wnt/β-catenin-signaling cells constitute a progenitor cell population and could underlie the pronounced histopathology observed for human ovarian cancer.
we investigated the spatio-temporal pattern of β-catenin/tcf expression in the ose using responsive transgenic  mice.
the generated β-galactosidase response  identified the cell population that overlies the medio-lateral surface of the indifferent gonad at embryonic day   <dig> .
from e <dig>  onwards, lacz expression disappeared in cells covering the testis but remained with ovary development.
facs analysis revealed lacz+ cells exhibit cytoprotective mechanisms as indicated by enrichment within the sp.
the best studied, the wnt/β-catenin pathway, leads to an increase in intracellular β-catenin which acts as a co-transcription factor with members of the tcf/lef family.
lacz+ ose cells were present throughout embryonic and postnatal ovarian development but demonstrated an age-dependent decrease to a small proportion when animals were weaned and remained at this proportion with aging.
the dna-binding dye dyecycle violet was used to set up the side population  assay aimed at identifying subpopulations of ose cells with chemoresistance phenotype associated with abcg <dig> transporter activity.
wnts are a family of secreted signaling molecules involved in a number of developmental processes including the establishment of cell fate, polarity and proliferation.
it appeared that lacz+ cells give rise to lacz- cells and this was confirmed in cell cultures.
