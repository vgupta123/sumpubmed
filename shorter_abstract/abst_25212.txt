therefore, without modification, following neonatal hi injury there is only a narrow period of time for endogenous sdf- <dig> mediated chemotaxis and recruitment of reparative cells, including exogenously administered stem/progenitor cells.
we hypothesized that sdf- <dig> would be expressed in similar temporal and spatial patterns following hypoxic-ischemic  injury in neonatal brain.
sdf- <dig> expression was up regulated up to  <dig> days after the injury but not at the later time points.
it functions in brain embryonic development and in response to ischemic injury in helping guide neuroblast migration and vasculogenesis.
the localization of sdf- <dig> along blood vessels in the hi injury zone suggests that these perivascular areas are where chemotaxic signaling for cellular recruitment originates and that reactive astrocytes are major mediators of this process.
the chief sites of sdf- <dig> up regulation were astrocytes, their foot processes along blood vessels and endothelial cells.
