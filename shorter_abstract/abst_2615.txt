blastx comparison of these contigs with protein sets of organisms representing distinct phylogenetic clades revealed a total of  <dig>  contigs that apis mellifera shares with different taxa.
applying a correction factor deduced from a parallel analysis performed with drosophila melanogaster orestes, we estimate that approximately half of these no-match ests contigs  should represent apis-specific genes.
the ongoing efforts to sequence the honey bee genome require additional initiatives to define its transcriptome.
the analysis of the remaining sequences defined a set of putative orthologs whose majority had their best-match hits with anopheles and drosophila genes.
of the  <dig>  orestes,  <dig> % matched with previously deposited apis ests.
cap <dig> assembly of the apis orestes with the already existing  <dig>  apis ests generated  <dig>  contigs.
a set of  <dig> putative genes presented a best match with human genes, many of which encode factors related to cell signaling/signal transduction.
