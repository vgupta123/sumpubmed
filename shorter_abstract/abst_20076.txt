using resampling techniques it is also possible to assess variability of different performance indicators.
the effect of correlation between gene expression levels on the performance of multiple testing procedures is studied by computer simulations.
we have conducted studies to assess stability and some other properties of several gene selection procedures with biological and simulated data.
stability properties of several multiple testing procedures are described at length in the present paper.
