included were the development of a necrotic core surrounded by quiescent and proliferating cells, and growth data at two distinct levels of nutrient.
emt <dig> spheroids display consistent and predictable growth characteristics, implying that individual cell behaviors are tightly controlled and regulated.
an approach to understanding how individual cell behaviors contribute to system behaviors is to discover a set of principles that enable abstract agents to exhibit closely analogous behaviors using only information available in an agent's immediate environment.
