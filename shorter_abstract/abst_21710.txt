does a network approach, combining information about the linear organization of genomic markers with correlative information on these markers in a bayesian formulation, lead to an analytic method with higher power for detecting quantitative trait loci?
the method has a monotonically decreasing false discovery rate as a function of effect size, unlike interval mapping.
block network mapping, combining similarity network fusion  with a bayesian locus likelihood evaluation, leads to large improvements in area under the receiver operating characteristic and power over interval mapping with expectation maximization.
block network mapping provides an alternative data-driven approach to mapping quantitative trait loci that leverages correlations in the sampled genotypes.
