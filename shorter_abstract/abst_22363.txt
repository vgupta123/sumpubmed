progressive diversification of paralogs after gene expansion is essential to increase their functional specialization.
our findings show that  molecular evolution of paralogs correlates with their expression pattern;  gene diversification is obtained through massive genomic rearrangements; and  splicing modification contributes to the functional specialization of novel genes.
here we report the comparative analysis of prdm genes, a family of putative transcriptional regulators involved in human tumorigenesis.
through internal duplication and activation of a non-canonical splice site , prdm <dig> can acquire a novel intron.
our analysis assessed that the prdm genes originated in metazoans, expanded in vertebrates and further duplicated in primates.
