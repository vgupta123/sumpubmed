the brown planthopper , nilaparvata lugens , is a serious insect pests of rice plants.
an est database is available at our web site.
the actin gene was highly expressed in bph, especially in the thorax.
the est library will provide useful information for transcriptional analyses, proteomic analyses, and gene functional analyses of bph.
expressed sequence tag  analysis and related applications are useful to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance and virulence and to reveal physiological aspects of this non-model insect, with its poorly understood genetic background.
moreover, specific genes for hemimetabolous insects will be identified.
among the top ten most abundantly expressed genes, three are unique and show no homology in blast searches.
