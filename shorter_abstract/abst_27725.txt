of these,  <dig> as level-altered genes that are involved in transcriptional regulation and in stress responses are located in regions that have been targets of selection during maize improvement.
importantly, a subset of as level-increased genes that encode transcription factors and stress-responsive proteins may have been selected during maize improvement.
this indicates that te insertion might be an important mechanism for intron retention in maize.
in this study, six teosinte and ten maize transcriptomes were sequenced to analyze as changes and signatures of selection in maize domestication and improvement.
a substantial amount of evidence has demonstrated that as complexity is relevant to eukaryotic evolution, development, adaptation, and complexity.
