phostryp achieved a 17% improvement in prediction performance compared with netphos, a non organism-specific predictor.
finally, in order to maximize the usefulness of phostryp, we trained a predictor combining all the peptides from l. infantum, t. brucei and t. cruzi.
here we present phostryp, a phosphorylation site predictor specific for trypansomatids.
more specifically our results show that leishmania kinases have sequence specificities which are different from their counterparts in higher eukaryotes.
our work demonstrates that training on organism-specific data results in an improvement that extends to related species.
experimental identification of phosphorylation sites is a time-consuming task.
moreover some sites could be missed due to the highly dynamic nature of this process or to difficulties in phospho-peptide enrichment.
