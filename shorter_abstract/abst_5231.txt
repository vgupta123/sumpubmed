−/− mice also present with premature collagen deposition and osteoblast alignment at the sutures, and the physical interaction between the developing skull, and outermost covering of the brain , as well as the overlying dermis and subcutaneous tissue, appears compromised in embryos lacking grhl <dig>  although grhl3
we found that these adult mice also present with a smaller cranial cavity, suggestive of post-natal haploinsufficiency in the context of cranial development.
using advanced imaging techniques and quantitative measurement, we show that genetic deletion of the highly-conserved transcription factor grainyhead-like  <dig>  in mice  leads to decreased skull size, aberrant skull morphology and premature apposition of the coronal sutures during embryogenesis.
human craniosynostosis is a prevalent, and often serious embryological and neonatal pathology.
−/− mice die at birth, we investigated skull morphology and size in adult animals lacking one grhl <dig> allele , which are viable and fertile.
increased apposition of the frontal and parietal bones of the skull during embryogenesis may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of premature skull fusion, or craniosynostosis.
our findings show that our grhl <dig> mice present with increased apposition of the frontal and parietal bones, suggesting that grhl <dig> may be involved in the developmental pathogenesis of craniosynostosis.
