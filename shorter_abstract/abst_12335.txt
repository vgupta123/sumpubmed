comparison with our previous studies, we identified two putative novel pathways important in prostate cancer.
the two novel pathways are 1) ligand-independent activation of esr <dig> and esr <dig> and 2) membrane-bound esr1: interaction with growth factors signalling.
nevertheless, the mirnas expression signatures identified for a same cancer differs among laboratories due to the cancer heterogeneity.
we proved that expression signatures of at the pathway level well address the cancer heterogeneity and are more consistent than at the mirna/gene levels.
in addition, how the deregulated mirnas coordinately contribute to the tumourigenic process of prostate cancer remains elusive.
ort was selected as the best method and applied to four prostate cancer associated microrna expression datasets.
after microrna target prediction and pathway enrichment mapping,  <dig> gene ontology terms,  <dig> kegg pathways and  <dig> genego pathways are found putative prostate cancer associated.
based on this observation, we identified putative novel microrna regulatory pathways which will help us to elucidate the cooperative function of different micrornas in prostate cancer.
