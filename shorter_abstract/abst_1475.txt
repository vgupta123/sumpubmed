rna inverse folding is the problem of finding one or more sequences that fold into a user-specified target structure s
∗, defined as the sum of boltzmann factors exp/rt) of all rna nucleotide sequences a compatible with target structure s
we show that c. elegans precursor microrna  is significantly non-robust with respect to mutations, by comparing the robustness of each wild type pre-mirna sequence with  <dig>  sequences of the same gc-content generated by rnadualpf, which approximately  fold into the wild type target structure.
∗ and samples sequences having low energy with respect to a target structure, allowing sequence constraints and specified gc-content.
we confirm and strengthen earlier findings that precursor micrornas and bacterial small noncoding rnas display plasticity, a measure of structural diversity.

<dig>  using rnadualpf, we efficiently sample rna sequences that approximately fold into s
∗〉, and use it to show that natural rnas from the rfam  <dig>  database have higher minimum free energy than expected, thus suggesting that functional rnas are under evolutionary pressure to be only marginally thermodynamically stable.
<dig>  here we consider the ensemble of all rna sequences that have low free energy with respect to a given target s
whose minimum free energy secondary structure is identical to the target s

∗ over all sequences having gc-content k, the user can require that all sampled sequences have a precise, specified gc-content.
using different inverse folding software, another group had earlier shown that pre-mirna is mutationally robust, even controlling for compositional bias.
