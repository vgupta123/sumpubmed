vibrio harveyi, one of the best studied model organisms for qs, was used to explore effects of the synthetic cannabinoid hu- <dig> on qs and different qs-regulated physiological processes in bacteria.
furthermore, qs-mediated biofilm formation and swimming motility in the mutant strain bb <dig>  were significantly reduced in the presence of hu- <dig>  hu- <dig> inhibited qs-mediated virulence factor production without any inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.
analysis of qs-regulated bioluminescence in wild-type and mutant strains of v. harveyi revealed that hu- <dig> affects the autoinducer- <dig>  pathway, one of three known qs cascades of v. harveyi.
the effect of hu- <dig> was specific to the ai- <dig> cascade in v. harveyi.
ai- <dig> is known as a "universal autoinducer" and interference with its activity opens a broad spectrum of applications for synthetic cannabinoids in future research as a potential anti-qs agent.
