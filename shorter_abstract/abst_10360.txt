however, clear differences in the performance of the recombination protocols were observed when applied to homologous genes of varying dna identities.
lastly, only rd-pcr yielded chimeras in the low homology situation of gfp/mrfp .
an assay based on the reactivation of Î²-lactamase was developed to simulate the recombination of point mutations.
in comparison, dna shuffling can produce higher crossover numbers, while the recombination-dependent pcr frequently results in one crossover.
most importantly, the recombination-dependent pcr showed a less pronounced bias of the crossovers in regions with high sequence identity.
