as expected, when sequences in the datasets were successively truncated to the intervals ,  and , positional information aided motif prediction less and less, but never hurt it significantly.
for example, many known transcription factor binding sites  occur within an interval  bases upstream of a transcription start site .
biologically active sequence motifs often have positional preferences with respect to a genomic landmark.
although sequence truncation is a viable strategy when searching for biologically active motifs with a positional preference, a probabilistic model  generally provides a superior and more robust strategy, particularly when the sequence motifs' positional preferences are not well characterized.
although some programs for identifying sequence motifs exploit positional information, most of them model it only implicitly and with ad hoc methods, making them unsuitable for general motif searches.
a-glam, a user-friendly computer program for identifying sequence motifs, now incorporates a bayesian model systematically combining sequence and positional information.
a rigorous statistical analysis showed that positional information significantly improved the prediction of sequence motifs, and an extensive cross-validation study showed that a-glam's model was robust against mild misspecification of its parameters.
a-glam's predictions with and without positional information were compared on two human tfbs datasets, each containing sequences corresponding to the interval  bases upstream of a known tss.
