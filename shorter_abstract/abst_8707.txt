phylomap is implemented in java, and the source code is freely available at http://www.biochem.uni-luebeck.de/public/software/phylomap.html
the use of phylomap on influenza a virus genome sequences reveals the phylogenetic relationships of the internal genes that cannot be seen when only a subset of sequences are analyzed.
here we present a new algorithm, "phylomap", which combines ordination, vector quantization, and phylogenetic tree construction to give an elegant representation of a large sequence data set.
it utilizes the entire data set, minimizes bias, and provides intuitive visualization.
currently, there are more than  <dig> influenza a virus genomes in the database.
the application of phylomap to influenza a virus genome data shows that it is a robust algorithm for analyzing large sequence data sets.
results of phylogenetic analysis are often visualized as phylogenetic trees.
when more than a few thousand sequences are to be included, analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among them becomes a challenging task.
