our results give new insights in the development of novelty processing as they  reveal that task-irrelevant novel sounds can result in contrary effects on the performance in a visual primary task in children and adults,  show a positive erp deflection to novels rather than an mmn in children, and  reveal effects of auditory novels on visual target processing.
each sound was followed by a visual target.
finally, the p3b elicited by the visual target stimuli was reduced in both age groups when the preceding sound was a novel.
the attention switch towards the task irrelevant novel  was comparable between the age groups.
environmental sounds  were embedded amongst frequently presented standard sounds in an auditory-visual distraction paradigm.
processing of novel sounds were measured with reaction times, hit rates and the auditory event-related brain potentials  mismatch negativity , p3a, reorienting negativity  and visual p3b.
in two conditions, participants evaluated the position of a visual stimulus  or compared the position of the current stimulus with the one two trials before .
in both memory load conditions novels impaired task performance in adults whereas they improved performance in children.
adults showed more efficient reallocation of attention  under load condition than children.
we investigated the processing of task-irrelevant and unexpected novel sounds and its modulation by working-memory load in children aged 9- <dig> and in adults.
