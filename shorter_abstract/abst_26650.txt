through targeted ectopic expression experiments in which we assay the ability of full-length, truncated, and chimeric proteins to support cell differentiation, we find evidence that  the c-terminal domain of pyr is retained inside the cell and does not seem to be required for receptor activation and  the c-terminal domain of ths is secreted and, while also not required for receptor activation, this domain does plays a role in limiting the activity of ths when present.
in this work, we conducted an analysis of the functional domains of two drosophila proteins, thisbe  and pyramus , which share homology with the fgf <dig> subfamily of ligands in vertebrates.
fgfs are known to play diverse roles in many processes, including mesoderm induction, branching morphogenesis, organ formation, wound healing and malignant transformation; yet much more remains to be learned about the mechanisms of regulation used to control fgf activity.
ths and pyr proteins are secreted from drosophila schneider cells  as smaller n-terminal fragments presumably as a result of intracellular proteolytic cleavage.
cleaved forms of ths and pyr can be detected in embryonic extracts as well.
