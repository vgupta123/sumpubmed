this study was undertaken to investigate surface antigenic determinants in cronobacter spp.
further, none of the mabs recognized purified lps from cronobacter spp.
most of the proteins recognized by the mabs were identified by maldi-tof peptide sequencing and appeared to be heterogeneous with the identities of some of them are still unknown.
results obtained in this study highlight the immunological cross-reactivity among cronobacter omps and their enterobacteriaceae counterparts.
all mabs recognized the same epitope as determined by an additive index elisa with their epitopes appeared to be conformational rather than sequential.
using monoclonal antibodies  and maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
spleenocytes from mice that were immunized with heat-killed  cronobacter cells were fused with sp <dig> myeloma cells.
all mabs recognized proteins with molecular weight ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> kda except for one isolate  in which no omps were detected.
