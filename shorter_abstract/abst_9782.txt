however, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one.
sixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure  during saline infusion .
for isovolumetric trials in two experiments  hmax was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and hmean was  <dig>  ±  <dig> .
for saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and mean hysteresis ratio  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .
mechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises.
a comprehensive state model that integrates these hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon existing neuroprostheses for bladder control.
firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system.
