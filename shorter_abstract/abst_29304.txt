our study demonstrates the presence of two putative nls motifs in h-twist and suggests that these nls sequences are functional.
the interaction of twist with tcf- <dig> confirmed using nls rescue assays, where nuclear expression of mutant twistnls <dig> with co-transfixed tcf- <dig> was observed.
twist is a nuclear protein that regulates a variety of cellular functions controlled by protein-protein interactions and gene transcription events.
using site-specific mutagenesis and immunofluorescences, we observed that altered twistnls <dig> k38r, twistnls <dig> k73r and k77r constructs inhibit nuclear accumulation of h-twist in mammalian cells, while twistnls <dig> k76r expression was un-affected and retained to the nucleus.
the focus of this study was to characterize putative nuclear localization signals  37rkrr <dig> and 73krgkk <dig> in the human twist  protein.
subsequently, co-transfection of twist mutants k38r, k73r and k77r with e <dig> formed heterodimers and restored nuclear localization despite the nlss mutations.
