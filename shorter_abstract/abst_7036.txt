this complexity and high interconnectedness call for automated techniques that can identify smaller targeted subnetworks specific to a given research context .
however, these networks usually lack both, context specificity in time and space as well as the distinctive borders, which are usually assigned in the classical pathway view of molecular events .
specifically, we recreated skeletal muscle specific signaling networks in healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  contexts.
chainrank provides a framework, which can integrate several user-defined scores and evaluate their combined effect on ranking interaction chains linking input data sets.
it can be used to contextualise networks, identify signaling and regulatory path amongst targeted genes or to analyse synthetic lethality in the context of anticancer therapy.
