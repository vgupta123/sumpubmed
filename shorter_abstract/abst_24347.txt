membrane proteins regulate a diversity of physiological processes and are the most successful class of targets in drug discovery.
however, small molecule modulators have yet to be reported.
this high-throughput screen , termed irfap-hts, utilizes the recently described marscy1-fluorogen activating protein and the near-infrared and membrane impermeant fluorogen sci <dig>  the cell surface expression of marscy <dig> epitope-tagged receptors can be visualized by simple addition of sci <dig>  user-friendly, rapid, and quantitative detection occurs on a standard infrared western-blotting scanner.
therefore, a low-cost and universally applicable screen for membrane protein trafficking was developed.
the constitutive internalization of lgr <dig> appears to be one primary mode through which its function is regulated.
therefore, irfap-hts was utilized to screen  <dig>  fda-approved and drug-like small molecules for those that antagonize lgr <dig> internalization.
lgr <dig> is expressed in stem cells, modulates wnt/ÃŸ-catenin signaling, and is therefore a promising drug target.
the irfap-hts platform provides a versatile solution for screening more targets with fewer resources.
glucocorticoids were found to potently increase lgr <dig> expression at the plasma membrane.
the irfap-hts screen was deployed against the leucine-rich g protein-coupled receptor- <dig> .
