at 4â€“ <dig> hours, nhe <dig> mrna increases over baseline expression, suggesting increased gene transcription.
aii activates several key signaling pathways that induce acute and chronic changes in nhe <dig> membrane trafficking and gene transcription.
acute changes in aii-induced increases in nhe <dig> exocytosis were blocked by a phospholipase c inhibitor, an arachidonic acid cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase inhibitor, as well as phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase  inhibitors and akt inhibitor, partially blocked by a metalloproteinase inhibitor and an egf  receptor kinase inhibitor, but not affected by an inhibitor of mek- <dig> .
we conclude that angiotensin ii has a direct role in regulating intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption which may contribute to its overall effects in regulation systemic volume and blood pressure.
angiotensin ii  effects on intestinal na+ transport may be multifactorial.
to determine if aii might have a direct effect on intestinal epithelial na+ transport, we investigated its actions on na+ transport in human intestinal epithelial caco2bbe cells.
