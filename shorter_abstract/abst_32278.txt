this is one of the first 454-based transcriptome surveys of an ancestral dinoflagellate taxon and will undoubtedly prove useful for future comparative studies aimed at reconstructing the origin of novel features of the dinoflagellates.
in a genomic context, a sample of  <dig> different genes were demonstrated to occur as tandem repeats, separated by short  inter-genic regions.
here we indicate that tandem gene arrangements and the occurrence of multiple transcribed gene variants are common and indicate potentially complex genomic arrangements in o. marina.
its basal phylogenetic position within the dinoflagellates make o. marina useful for understanding the origin of numerous unusual features of the dinoflagellate lineage; its broad distribution has lent o. marina to the study of protist biogeography; and nutritive flexibility and eurytopy have made it a common lab rat for the investigation of physiological responses of marine heterotrophic flagellates.
nevertheless, genome-scale resources for o. marina are scarce.
in addition, we assess sequence read abundance, as a proxy for gene expression, in response to salinity, an environmental factor potentially important in determining o. marina spatial distributions.
comparison of the reported data set with existing o. marina and other dinoflagellates ests indicates little sequence overlap likely as a result of the relatively limited extent of genome scale sequence data currently available for the dinoflagellates.
however,  <dig> read abundance and subsequent qpcr validation did not correlate well - suggesting that measures of gene expression via ad hoc analysis of sequence read abundance require careful interpretation.
