strong correlation was found between the presence of a particular rayt in a genome and the abundance of its cognate reps.
the rayt genes themselves are subject to rapid evolution, substantially exceeding the substitution rate of neighboring genes.
in this report, we describe a novel class of putative transposases related to is200/is <dig> transposase family and we demonstrate that they are obligately associated with bacterial reps. open reading frames coding for these rep-associated tyrosine transposases  are always flanked by two reps in inverted orientation and thus constitute a unit reminiscent of typical transposable elements.
conversely, we suggest that bimes are in fact a special type of nonautonomous transposable elements, mobilizable by rayts.
in light of our findings, we propose that rayts are responsible for establishment of reps and bimes in bacterial genomes, as well as for their exceptional dynamics and species-specifity.
besides conserved residues involved in catalysis of dna cleavage, rayts carry characteristic structural motifs that are absent in typical is200/is <dig> transposases.
dna sequences flanking rayt genes are in one third of examined cases arranged in modular bimes.
