boundary cells display distinct molecular and cellular properties such as an elongated shape, enriched extracellular matrix components and a reduced proliferation rate compared to intra-rhombomeric cells.
furthermore, surgical ablation of the boundary between r <dig> and r <dig>  or blocking of the contact of r <dig> with boundary cells, results in sustained fgf <dig> expression in this segment.
hindbrain boundary cells express several signaling molecules, such as fgf <dig>  which at earlier developmental stages is transiently expressed in specific rhombomeres.
we show that chick embryos that lack boundary cells due to overexpression of truncated epha <dig> receptor in the hindbrain have continued segmental expression of fgf <dig> at stages when it is normally restricted to hindbrain boundaries.
these findings suggest that boundary cells are required for the downregulation of segmental fgf <dig>  presumably mediated by a soluble factor that emanates from boundaries.
we propose that this new function of boundary cells enables a switch in gene expression that may be required for stage-specific functions of fgf <dig> in the developing hindbrain.
these cell-lineage restricted segments are separated by a subpopulation of cells known as boundary cells.
