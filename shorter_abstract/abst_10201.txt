a genome wide comparison of mdr 19a st <dig> with mdr 19f st <dig> identified  <dig> unique snps in 19a,  <dig> of which were present in antimicrobial resistance genes and  <dig> in virulence factors.
our results suggest a complex genetic picture where high-level drug resistance, vaccine selection pressure, and spn mutational events have created a "perfect storm" for the emergence of mdr 19a.
a subset of mdr 19a were multi-locus sequence typed  and representative isolates' whole genomes sequenced.
mdr 19a increased in the post-pcv <dig> era while 19f, 6b, and 23f concurrently declined.
mlst of mdr 19a  revealed that sequence type   <dig> predominated.
st <dig> was unique amongst mdr 19a in that its minimum inhibitory concentration  values for penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and erythromycin were higher than for other st present amongst post-pcv <dig> mdr 19a.
