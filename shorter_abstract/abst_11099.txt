finally, this model can serve as a guide in efforts to generate a comprehensive model of the mammalian cell cycle in order to explore cancer-related phenotypes.
the model behaviour conforms to perturbation trials previously reported in the literature, and accurately predicts the results of our own knockdown experiments.
eukaryotic cell proliferation involves dna replication, a tightly regulated process mediated by a multitude of protein factors.
the model was validated against quantified levels of protein factors over a range of cell cycle timepoints.
this study establishes a robust model of the processes driving dna replication initiation.
we have developed an ordinary differential equation-based model of the protein-protein interaction network describing replication initiation.
furthermore, we successfully incorporated our replication initiation model into an established model of the entire yeast cell cycle, thus providing a comprehensive description of these processes.
