proteins containing both a gram and a vast domain include notably the yeast ysp <dig> cell death regulator and numerous uncharacterized proteins.
using structure-based phylogeny, we found that the vast domain is structurally related to bet v1-like domains.
our findings open perspectives for the functional analysis of vast-containing proteins and the characterization of novel mechanisms regulating pcd.
several regulators of programmed cell death  in plants encode proteins with putative lipid-binding domains.

using profile hidden markov models  and phylogenetic analysis we found that this domain is conserved among eukaryotes and generally associates with various lipid-binding domains.
we analyzed sequence conservation across the plant kingdom in the vad <dig> protein and identified an uncharacterized vast  domain.
however the function of vad <dig> at the subcellular level is unknown and the domain architecture of vad <dig> has not been analyzed in details.
