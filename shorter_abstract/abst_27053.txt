inflammatory and immune response genes that function in the stimulation of monocytes, natural killer and t-cells, and in the modulation of cell adhesion peaked at  <dig> hrs, while genes involved in wound healing and functional recovery were upregulated at  <dig> hrs.
temporal expression pattern and biological significance of the differentially expressed genes were explored using clustering and pathway analysis software.
the purpose of this study was to relate the temporal dynamics of gene expression to the pathophysiological changes in the lung during the first and second stages of e. coli sepsis in baboons.
cytokine levels in tissue and plasma were assayed by multiplex elisa.
using human oligonucleotide microarrays, we have explored the temporal changes of gene expression in the lung of baboons challenged with sublethal doses of e. coli.
the analysis of gene expression modulation in response to sepsis provides the baseline information that is crucial for the understanding of the pathophysiology of systemic inflammation and may facilitate the development of future approaches for sepsis therapy.
