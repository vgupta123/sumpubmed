inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis partially rescues cell numbers in cap-g mutant retinae and allows normal layering of retinal cell types without alleviating their aberrant nuclear sizes.
however, due to the lack of appropriate mutants, the function of the condensin i complex during vertebrate development has not been described.
the condensation of chromosomes and correct sister chromatid segregation during cell division is an essential feature of all proliferative cells.
high resolution live imaging reveals that the progression of mitosis between prometa- to telophase is delayed and that sister chromatid segregation is impaired upon loss of cap-g. cap-g associates with chromosomes between prometa- and telophase of the cell cycle.
loss of the interaction partners cap-h and cap-d <dig> causes cytoplasmic mislocalization of cap-g throughout mitosis.
structural maintenance of chromosomes  and non-smc proteins form the condensin i complex and regulate chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis.
dna content analysis reveals increased genomic imbalances upon loss of non-smc condensin i subunits.
within the retina, loss of condensin i function causes increased rates of apoptosis among cells within the proliferative ciliary marginal zone  whereas postmitotic retinal cells are viable.
our findings indicate that the condensin i complex is particularly important within rapidly amplifying progenitor cell populations to ensure faithful chromosome segregation.
