each application generated with molgenis comes with an optimized database back-end, user interfaces for biologists to manage and exploit their data, programming interfaces for bioinformaticians to script analysis tools in r, java, soap, rest/json and rdf, a tab-delimited file format to ease upload and exchange of data, and detailed technical documentation.
the molgenis toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple language to model biological data structures and user interfaces.
in recent years we have successfully evaluated the molgenis toolkit for the rapid prototyping of many types of biomedical applications, including next-generation sequencing, gwas, qtl, proteomics and biobanking.
the molgenis toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple model to quickly generate flexible web platforms for all possible genomic, molecular and phenotypic experiments with a richness of interfaces not provided by other tools.
this ‘model-driven’ method ensures reuse of best practices and improves quality because the modeling language and generators are shared between all molgenis applications, so that errors are found quickly and improvements are shared easily by a re-generation.
