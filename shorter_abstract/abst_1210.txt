here we report a survey of mhc genes and their paralogues in the zebrafish genome.
the results extend the linkage information of mhc core genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and show the distribution of the remaining mhc genes and their paralogues to be genome-wide.
in some birds, it consists of only a small number of linked mhc core genes  forming a minimal essential mhc and, in fish, the mhc consists of a so far unknown number of genes including non-linked mhc core genes.
the genomic organisation of the major histocompatibility complex  varies greatly between different vertebrates.
using sequence similarity searches against the zebrafish draft genome assembly ,  <dig> putative mhc gene loci and their paralogues have been identified.
