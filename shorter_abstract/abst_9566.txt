the coding sequence of egfp gene was amplified from pegfp-n <dig> vector and subcloned into the pzippy-neo/gus plasmid under the control of the early-late vaccinia virus  vv <dig>  promoter and flanked by two multiple cloning sites  to generate a novel transfer vector pspv-egfp.
using the pspv-egfp, two recombination cassettes pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf were constructed by cloning the flanking regions of the orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> and inserted into two mcs flanking the egfp gene.
thus, the pspv-egfp vector provides a direct, fast, and convenient way to manipulate the recombinant viruses, indicating that it is highly suited for its designed purpose.
reporter genes are often used as a selectable marker for generation of recombinant viruses in order to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and to obtain candidate vaccine viruses.
using this novel system, two single gene deletion mutants ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> were successfully generated.
routine selection of the recombinant parapoxvirus is time-consuming and labor intensive.
