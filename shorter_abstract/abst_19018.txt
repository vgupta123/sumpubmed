we developed a pig model, and using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification , we investigated alterations in the placental proteome of gilts on a normal-energy-intake  and high-energy-intake  diet.
our findings revealed that maternal nutrition may alter birth weight mainly through the modulation of placental lipid and energy metabolism, which also provides a possible mechanism to explain the higher uniformity of fetal weight in gilts fed a he diet.

in the con group, these proteins were involved in lipid metabolism , nutrient transport , and energy metabolism .
maternal nutrition is the major intrauterine environmental factor that alters fetal weight.
in the con group, heavy and light fetuses were found at the tubal and cervical ends of the uterus respectively at  <dig> d of gestation.
intra-uterine growth restriction  and fetal overgrowth increase risks to postnatal health.
however, the mechanisms underlying the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal development are not entirely clear.
however, in the he group they mainly participated in transcriptional and translational regulation, and intracellular vesicular transport.
