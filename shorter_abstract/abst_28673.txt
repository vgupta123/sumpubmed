the gcdh test provides an improved power over single-snp based methods in detecting the prevalence of ch in human complex phenotypes, offering an opportunity for tackling the missing heritability problem.
compound heterozygosity  in classical genetics is the presence of two different recessive mutations at a particular gene locus.

collapsabel provides a user-friendly pipeline for genotype collapsing, statistical testing, power estimation, type i error control and graphics generation in the r language.
intermediate results are stored either in an sql database or in a so-called big.matrix file to achieve reasonable memory footprint.
our large scale simulation studies show that gcdh is capable of discovering genetic associations due to ch-like interactions with much higher power than a conventional single-snp approach under various settings, whether the causal genetic variations are available or not.
time-consuming procedures are optimized for computational efficiency using java or c++.
heritability of phenotypes so far not accounted for by single genetic variants.
methods to detect ch-like effects in genome-wide association studies  may facilitate explaining the missing heritability, but to our knowledge no viable software tools for this purpose are currently available.
collapsabel provides a computationally efficient solution for screening general forms of ch alleles in densely imputed microarray or whole genome sequencing datasets.
