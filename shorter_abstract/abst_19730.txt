the observation of concordant regulation of svpink <dig> and napink <dig> during in vivo mitochondrial biogenesis was confirmed using rnai, where selective targeting of napink <dig> results in loss of the pink <dig> splice variant in neuronal cell lines.
pink <dig> is expressed abundantly in mitochondria rich tissues, such as skeletal muscle, where it plays a critical role determining mitochondrial structural integrity in drosophila.
we further demonstrate that pink <dig> varies in vivo when human skeletal muscle mitochondrial content is enhanced, supporting the idea that pink <dig> has a physiological role in mitochondrion.
