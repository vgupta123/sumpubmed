3' untranslated regions  contain binding sites for many regulatory elements, and in particular for micrornas .
we propose two complementary approaches to the statistical analysis of oligonucleotide frequencies in mammalian 3' utrs aimed at the identification of candidate binding sites for regulatory elements.
the importance of mirna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation has become increasingly clear in the last few years.
the second method is based on the identification of oligonucleotides showing statistically significant strand asymmetry in their distribution in 3' utrs.
many new candidates are proposed for experimental verification.
