more specifically, our study suggests i) that lcrs are preferentially positioned towards the protein sequence extremities and, in contrast with centrally-located lcrs, such terminal lcrs show a correlation between their lengths and degrees of connectivity, and ii) that centrally-located lcrs are enriched with transcription-related go terms, while terminal lcrs are enriched with translation and stress response-related terms.
regions of protein sequences with biased amino acid composition ) are abundant in the protein universe.
in keeping with previous results, we found that lcr-containing proteins tend to have more binding partners across different ppi networks than proteins that have no lcrs.
our results suggest not only that lcrs may be involved in flexible binding associated with specific functions, but also that their positions within a sequence may be important in determining both their binding properties and their biological roles.
