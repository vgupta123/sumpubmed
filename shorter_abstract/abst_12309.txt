the saprophagous and coprophagous maggots of the drone fly eristalis tenax  have evolved the unique ability to survive in aquatic habitats with extreme microbial stress such as drains, sewage pools, and farmyard liquid manure storage pits.
therefore, they represent suitable models for the investigation of trade-offs between the benefits resulting from colonization of habitats lacking predators, parasitoids, or competitors and the investment in immunity against microbial stress.
further analysis of these immune-related effector molecules from eristalis may help to elucidate the interdependency of ecological adaptation and molecular evolution of the innate immunity in diptera.
in order to identify effector molecules contributing to this microbial defense we constructed a subtractive cdna library using rna samples from untreated and lps injected maggots.
as predicted, we determined a high diversity of novel putative antimicrobial peptides including one e. tenax defensin.
in this study, we screened for genes in e. tenax that are induced upon septic injury.
untreated e. tenax maggots exhibit significant antibacterial activity in the hemolymph which strongly increases upon challenge with lps.
analysis of  <dig> cdnas revealed induced expression of  <dig> cdnas corresponding to  <dig> novel gene clusters in e. tenax.
we identified  <dig> novel genes of e. tenax that were induced in response to septic injury including novel putative antimicrobial peptides.
