here we offer a novel explanation based on a threshold public good game  that includes the interaction of individual and group level selection, where individuals can contribute to multiple collective actions, in our model group hunting and group defense.
a fundamentally new mechanism is proposed how laggards, individuals that have a high tendency to defect during one specific group action can actually contribute to the fitness of the group, by playing part in an optimal resource allocation in threshold public good games.
in particular for medium cost values division of labour evolves within the group with regard to the two types of cooperative actions .
our results show that there are polymorphic equilibria in threshold pggs; that multi-level selection does not select for the most cooperators per group but selects those close to the optimum number of cooperators .
we also demonstrate that these results apply for a wide range of non-linear benefit function types.
in general, our results show that acknowledging a multilevel selection process will open up novel explanations for collective actions.
in addition, the discovery that humans and some animal populations, such as lions, are polymorphic, where cooperators and defectors stably live together -- while defectors are not being punished--, is even more puzzling.
we demonstrate that cooperation can be stable in threshold pgg, even when the proportion of so called free riders is high in the population.
moreover we show evidence that spatial population structure promotes cooperation in multiple pggs.
