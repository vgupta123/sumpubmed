recent studies have suggested gut physiology and pathology relevant to human ibd can be rapidly modeled in zebrafish larvae.
larval zebrafish exposed to tnbs displayed intestinal-fold architecture disruption and inflammation reminiscent of human ibd.
prevention or reversal of this dysbiosis may be a viable option for reducing the incidence and severity of human ibd.
inflammatory bowel disease  involves a breakdown in interactions between the host immune response and the resident commensal microbiota.
the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in zebrafish larvae with ibd-like colitis was characterized by an increased proportion of proteobacteria  and a decreased of firmicutes, which were significantly correlated with enterocolitis severity.
the aim of this study was to investigate the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota in zebrafish models with ibd-like enterocolitis using culture-independent techniques.
this is the first description of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in zebrafish ibd-like models, and these changes correlate with tnbs-induced enterocolitis.
changes in intestinal microbiota were evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  and the predominant bacterial composition was determined with dna sequencing and blast and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
in this study, we defined a reduced biodiversity of gut bacterial community in tnbs-induced coliitis.
ibd-like enterocolitis was induced by exposing larval zebrafish to trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid .
