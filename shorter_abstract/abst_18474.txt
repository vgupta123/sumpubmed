our results indicate that cuticle proteins might be key genes underpinning the response to dna viruses.
gene set enrichment analysis revealed that cuticle proteins were significantly overrepresented in this group of genes.
combined, these results provide much needed host candidate genes that respond to dna viral invaders.
little is known about invertebrate responses to dna viruses.
here, we infect a commercially important pest moth species plodia interpunctella with its naturally infecting dna virus.
we present the first experiment to measure genome-wide gene expression in an insect after infection with a natural dna virus.

furthermore, the large proportion of genes that were downregulated after viral exposure suggests that this virus is actively manipulating the insect immune response.
interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed cuticle proteins were downregulated, suggesting that baculoviruses are able to manipulate its host’s response.
