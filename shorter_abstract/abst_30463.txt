comparative sequence analysis of tmrnas found in bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria provides considerable insights into their secondary structures.
using comparative sequence analysis, phylogenetically-supported 2-d structures were obtained to serve as input for the program erna-3d.
the method, described in detail for the tmrnas of escherichia coli, bacillus anthracis, and caulobacter crescentus, is applicable to every tmrna.
trans-translation releases stalled ribosomes from truncated mrnas and tags defective proteins for proteolytic degradation using transfer-messenger rna .
biologically feasible 3-d models for the entire tmrna molecule could be obtained.
motifs containing loops and turns were extracted from the known structures of other rnas and used to improve the tmrna models.
the models were characterized by a functionally significant close proximity between the trna-like domain and the resume codon.
this small stable rna represents a hybrid of trna- and mrna-like domains connected by a variable number of pseudoknots.
the comparative procedure described here for tmrna is easily adopted for the modeling the members of other rna families.
improved molecular models of biological significance were obtained.
