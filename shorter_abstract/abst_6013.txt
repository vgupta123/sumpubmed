this led to the identification of distinct differences in the goblet cell phenotype post-infection with the two isolates.
further we provide evidence for a potential new marker involving the acidity of the mucins within the goblet cell which may predict outcome of infection within days of parasite exposure.
<dig> probe sets associated with immune and defence responses were up-regulated in gut tissue from an e isolate-infected c57bl/ <dig> mouse compared to tissue from an s isolate infection, including the message for the anti-microbial protein, angiogenin  <dig> .
differences in gene expression levels identified between the s and e-infected mice early during infection have furthered our knowledge of how the s isolate persists for longer than the e isolate in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse.
microarray analysis was used as a tool to identify genes whose expression could determine the differences in expulsion kinetics between the e and s t. muris isolates.
clear differences in gene expression profiles were evident as early as day  <dig> post-infection .
