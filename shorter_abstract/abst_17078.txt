in this study, four wheat bell1-like homeobox  genes were isolated and named wblh <dig> to wblh <dig>  wblh1/wblh3/wblh <dig> expression was observed in the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens.
expression of the four wblh genes is evident in reproductive organs including pistils and transformed stamens and is independent from female sterility in alloplasmic wheat lines with ae.
knox-blh interaction was conserved among various plant species, indicating the significance of knox-blh complex formation in wheat developmental processes.
the functional features of wblh <dig> are likely to be distinct from other blh gene functions in wheat development.
in the pistillody-exhibiting florets, an ectopic ovule is formed within the transformed stamens, and female sterility is also observed because of abnormal integument development.
wblh <dig> was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils but also of the ectopic ovules in transformed stamens, and the wblh <dig> expression pattern in the sterile pistils seemed to be identical to that in normal ovules of fertile pistils.
wblh <dig>  however, formed a complex with wheat knotted <dig> and rough sheath <dig> orthologs through sky and bel domains, but not with a wheat liguleless <dig> ortholog.
in addition, wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> showed interactions with the three wheat knox proteins through the bel domain.
alloplasmic wheat lines with aegilops crassa cytoplasm often show homeotic conversion of stamens into pistils under long-day conditions.
