we report that ngo <dig> encodes obg protein, which is an essential factor for gc viability, associates predominantly with the large 50s ribosomal subunit, and is stably expressed under conditions relevant to infection of the human host.
serious complications associated with these infections are frequent and include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.
the incidence of gonorrhea cases remains high globally while antibiotic treatment options, the sole counter measures against gonorrhea, are declining due to the remarkable ability of gc to acquire resistance.
neisseria gonorrhoeae  is a gram-negative pathogen that most commonly infects mucosal surfaces, causing sexually transmitted urethritis in men and endocervicitis in women.

the cellular levels of obg reach a maximum in the early logarithmic phase and remain constant throughout bacterial growth.
