of the  <dig> loci analyzed in  <dig> t. miscellus individuals,  <dig> showed loss of at least one parental homoeolog in the young allopolyploids.
gene loss, silencing, and the formation of novel gene complexes are some of the consequences that the new polyploid genome may experience.
this study represents the most extensive survey of the fate of genes duplicated by allopolyploidy in individuals from natural populations.
here, we analyze the fate of genes duplicated by polyploidy  in multiple individuals from ten natural populations of tragopogon miscellus , all of which formed independently from t. dubius and t. pratensis less than  <dig> years ago.
patterns of loss were stochastic among individuals from the independently formed populations, except that the t. dubius copy was lost twice as often as t. pratensis.
two loci were retained in duplicate for all polyploid individuals included in this study.
our results indicate that the road to genome downsizing and ultimate genetic diploidization may occur quickly through homoeolog loss, but with some genes consistently maintained as duplicates.
other genes consistently show evidence of homoeolog loss, suggesting repetitive aspects to polyploid genome evolution.
