the present design strategy can thus be exploited in future work on de novo design of helical bundles of higher order and compaction utilizing Δphe residues along with gxxg motif.
at this interface, the geometric pattern of interhelical interactions seems to resemble those observed between helices in transmembrane  proteins.
crystallographic studies suggest that, despite the presence of l-amino acid  residues in the middle of the sequence, the peptide adopts a 310-helical conformation of ambidextrous screw sense, one of them a left-handed  and the other a right-handed  310-helix with a and b being antiparallel to each other.
introduction of Δphe induces β-bends in small and 310-helices in longer peptide sequences.
however, cd studies reveal that the undecapeptide exclusively adopts a right-handed 310-helical conformation.
the de novo design of peptides and proteins has recently surfaced as an approach for investigating protein structure and function.
a de novo designed undecapeptide, ac-gly1-ala2-Δphe3-leu4-gly5-Δphe6-leu7-gly8-Δphe9-ala10-gly11-nh <dig>  was synthesized and characterized using x-ray diffraction and circular dichroism spectroscopic methods.
