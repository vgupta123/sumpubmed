we present a method for precise prediction of a large group of transcription factor binding sites â€“ steroid hormone response elements.
we use a large training set of experimentally confirmed steroid hormone response elements, and adapt a sequence-based statistic method of position weight matrix, for identification of the binding sites in the query sequences.
the proposed method demonstrates high accuracy level, and therefore can be used for prediction of hormone response elements de novo.
due to high diversity of different types of transcription factors and their dna binding preferences, it is a challenging problem to establish an accurate model for recognition of functional regulatory elements in promoters of eukaryotic genes.
experimental results support our analysis by showing significant improvement of the proposed method over previous hre recognition methods.
furthermore, feed-forward neural network is used for cross-verification of the predicted response elements on genomic sequences.
