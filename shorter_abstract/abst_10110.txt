this picture indicates that sips proceeds in cells that are actively fighting stress which facilitates premature senescence while failing to completely activate the orderly program of rs.
the latter supports the hypothesis that senescence-specific de-repression of spp <dig> aids in sips-dependent stromal activation.
in rs only, aurora-b driven cell cycle signaling was deregulated in concert with the suppression of anabolic branches of the fatty acids and estrogen metabolism.
moreover, in sips, proteasome/ubiquitin ligase pathways of protein degradation dominate the regulatory landscape.
the promoters of genes differentially expressed in either rs or sips are unusually enriched by the binding sites for homeobox family proteins, with particular emphasis on hmx <dig>  irx <dig>  hdx and hoxc <dig>  additionally, we identified iroquois homeobox  <dig>  as a master regulator for the secretion of spp1-encoded osteopontin, a stromal driver for tumor growth that is overexpressed by both rs and sips fibroblasts.
in sips, aurora-b signaling is deprioritized, and the synthetic branches of cholesterol metabolism are upregulated, rather than downregulated.
in culturing normal diploid cells, senescence may either happen naturally, in the form of replicative senescence, or it may be a consequence of external challenges such as oxidative stress.
