expression of gfp was studied in embryos from  <dig>  days on and was confined to cells known to express pax <dig>  gfp expression was sufficiently strong that expressing cells could be distinguished from non-expressing cells using flow cytometry.
the transgene provides an excellent tool for studying the functions of different pax6/pax <dig> regulatory elements in controlling pax <dig> expression in animals that are otherwise normal.
we generated a transgenic mouse expressing green fluorescent protein  and neomycin resistance under the control of the entire complement of human pax <dig> regulatory elements using a modified yeast artificial chromosome .
this work demonstrates the functional conservation of the regulatory elements controlling pax6/pax <dig> expression in mice and humans.
it will allow the analysis and isolation of cells in which pax <dig> is activated, irrespective of the status of the endogenous locus.
