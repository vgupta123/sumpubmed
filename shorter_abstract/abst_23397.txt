according to the results of flow cytometry and mtt assay, the synthesized pcfc-g-pei, with considerable transfection efficiency, had obviously lower cytotoxicity against  <dig> t and a <dig> cell lines compared with that of pei  <dig> kd.
the cytotoxicity and in vitro transfection study indicated that pcfc-g-pei copolymer prepared in this paper was a novel gene delivery system with lower cytotoxicity and considerable transfection efficiency compared with commercial pei .
to improve its biocompatibility and transfection efficiency, pei has been modified with peg, folic acid, and chloroquine in order to improve biocompatibility and enhance targeting.
meanwhile, dna condensation, dnase i protection, the particle size and zeta potential of pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes were also determined.
however, its in vivo application was greatly limited due to its high cytotoxicity and short duration of gene expression.
