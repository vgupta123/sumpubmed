anaesthesia was induced with  <dig> mg/kg of intravenous propofol and maintained with isoflurane/o <dig>  heart and respiratory rates; systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures; central venous pressure; spo2; etco2; inspired and expired isoflurane concentrations; and temperature were measured transoperatively.
compared with intravenous fentanyl, ta in bitches: may be easily performed in non-inflamed, ulcerated, adhered mammary tumours; has an isoflurane-sparing effect; improves transoperative and immediate postoperative analgesia; is apparently safe for use in clinical conditions as evidenced by the fact that it did not produce any adverse signs or lidocaine plasma concentrations compatible with toxicity; does not modify the recovery time; and facilitates the surgical procedure without interfering with wound healing.
this technique produces transoperative and postoperative analgesia, reduces surgical bleeding, and facilitates tissue divulsion.
the heart rate was lower and the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was higher in dogs treated with fentanyl than in dogs treated with ta.
tumescent anaesthesia  is a widely used technique in oncologic surgeries necessitating large resection margins.
a  <dig> -mcg/kg intravenous fentanyl bolus  was compared with ta using  <dig> % lidocaine  in bitches submitted to unilateral mastectomy.
this prospective, randomised, blind study evaluated the use of ta in bitches submitted to mastectomy and compared the effect of ta with an intravenous fentanyl bolus.
a fentanyl bolus was administered to  <dig> of  <dig> dogs treated with fentanyl and to none treated with ta.
intraoperative bleeding and the mammary gland excision time were lower in dogs treated with ta.
