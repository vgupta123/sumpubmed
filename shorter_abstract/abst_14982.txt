the analysis of up-regulated differential expressed genes in response to dormancy exposed an enriched interplay among various pathways: signal transduction, seed dehydration, carbohydrate and secondary metabolism, and senescence.
high expression level of key genes in starch synthesis are aps <dig>  apl <dig> and gbssi, which could artificially be reduced for re-directing carbon flow from photosynthesis to create a higher energy biomass.
on the other side, the genes responsible for rapid growth and biomass accumulation through dna assembly, protein synthesis and carbon fixation are repressed.
we used next generation sequencing technology to examine the transcriptome of turion development triggered by exogenous aba.
the identification and functional annotation of differentially expressed genes open a major step towards understanding the molecular network underlying vegetative frond dormancy.
due to their clonal propagation, they are the fastest growing biomass on earth, providing yet an untapped source for industrial applications.
noticeably, three members of late embryogenesis abundant protein family are exclusively expressed during turion formation.
