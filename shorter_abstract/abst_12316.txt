they provide an unparalleled opportunity for studying marine biogeography because they include the globally distributed families tripterygiidae  and blenniidae , the temperate clinidae , and three largely neotropical families .
the blenniiformes comprises six families,  <dig> genera and nearly  <dig> species of small teleost fishes closely associated with coastal benthic habitats.
the origin of the blenniiformes was estimated in the present-day indopacific region, corresponding to the tethys sea approximately  <dig>  mya.
global distributions of blenny genera included in our analysis support the evolution of a largely neotropical clade whose closest relatives  are temperate in distribution.
however, interpretation of these distributional patterns has been hindered by largely unresolved inter-familial relationships and the lack of evidence of monophyly of the labrisomidae.
we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for a monophyletic labrisomidae with five tribes .
according to the consensus of bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony analyses, the monophyly of the blenniiformes and the tripterygiidae, blenniidae, clinidae, and dactyloscopidae is supported.
we explored the phylogenetic relationships of the blenniiformes based on one mitochondrial  and four nuclear  loci for  <dig> blenniiform species, and representative outgroups .
a largely neotropical lineage including the labrisomidae, chaenopsidae and dactyloscopidae  evolved around  <dig>  mya when the neotropics were increasingly separated from the indopacific, but well before the closure of the tethys sea.
the tripterygiidae is the sister group of all other blennies, and the blenniidae is the sister group of the remaining blennies.
