although many qtl were reported, they cover large chromosomal regions and the functional mutations and their underlying biological mechanisms have not yet been identified.
all significantly associated regions together explain  <dig> % of the genetic variance where a qtl on ssc <dig> explains the most genetic variance .
to gain a better insight in the genetic architecture of the trait number of teats, we performed a genome-wide association study by genotyping  <dig> large white pigs using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip.
the genome-wide association study resulted in  <dig> significant snps.

the analysis is based on deregressed breeding values to account for the dense family structure and a bayesian approach for estimation of the snp effects.
the significant snps found in this study could be used in selection to increase number of teats in pigs, so that the increasing number of live-born piglets can be nursed by the sow.
five major qtl were found at high resolution on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of which the qtl on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> are the first ones to be reported on these chromosomes.
selection pressure on the number of teats has been applied to be able to provide enough teats for the increase in litter size in pigs.
for the five highly significant qtl regions, a search for candidate genes was performed.
the most convincing candidate genes were vrtn and prox <dig> on ssc <dig>  mpp <dig>  armc <dig>  and mkx on ssc <dig>  and vertebrae δ-ef <dig> on ssc <dig>  all three qtl contain candidate genes which are known to be associated with vertebral development.
in the new qtl regions on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  no obvious candidate genes were identified.
