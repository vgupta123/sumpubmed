a few nine-spined stickleback contigs lacked an obvious ortholog in three-spined sticklebacks but were found to match genes in other fish species, suggesting several gene losses within  <dig> million years since the divergence of the two stickleback species.
with deep sequencing of nine-spined stickleback cdna libraries, our study provides a significant increase in the number of gene sequences and microsatellite markers for this species, and identifies a number of genes showing patterns of adaptive evolution between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks.
we also report several candidate genes that might be involved in differential adaptation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks.
the synonymous substitution rate was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year between the two species, and a total of  <dig> genes showed patterns of adaptive evolution in one or both species.

this study provides a valuable resource for future studies aiming to identify candidate genes underlying ecological adaptation in this and other stickleback species.
to expand on these resources and aid the study of sticklebacks in a phylogenetic framework, we characterized nine-spined stickleback transcriptomes from brain and liver using deep sequencing.
these sequences were used for evaluating overall differentiation and substitution rates between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks, and to identify genes that are putatively evolving under positive selection.
we identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> different genes that differentiate pond and marine ecotypes.
