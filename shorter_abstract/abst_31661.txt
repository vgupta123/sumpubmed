interleukin- <dig>  is a well-known immuno-modulatory cytokine with an anti-inflammatory activity.
lack of il- <dig> allows induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hinders anti-tumor immunity, thereby favoring tumor growth.
in addition, the structural data of protein complexes suggest how oncogenic mutations influence the interactions and explain their potential impact on il- <dig> signaling in cancer and inflammation.
likewise, mutations that weaken the a2m-app  association may increase the proliferative effect of app through preventing β-amyloid degradation by the a2m receptor, and mutations that abolish the a2m-kallikrein- <dig>  interaction may lead to cell proliferation and metastasis through the destructive effect of klk <dig> on the extracellular matrix.
prediction of protein-protein interactions through structural matching can enrich the available cellular pathways.
our results suggest that mutations that disrupt the interactions of il- <dig> with its receptors  and α2-macroglobulin  may enhance inflammation and modulate anti-tumor immunity.
