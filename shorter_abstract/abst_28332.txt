mass spectrometric analysis of the pituitary identified  <dig> unique peptide sequences that were matched to  <dig> unique proteins.
beyond the expected whole genome duplication, differences between cichlids and mammals can be attributed to gene loss in tetrapods and additional duplication after divergence.
utilizing the a. burtoni genome, we identified  <dig> prohormone genes, with  <dig> identified as a single copy and  <dig> with at least  <dig> duplicated copies.
we characterized the a. burtoni prohormone complement.
in the context of the cichlid radiation, these findings will also facilitate the exploration of neuropeptide and peptide hormone function in behavioral diversity both within a. burtoni and across cichlid and other fish species.
two thirds of prohormone families contain duplications either from the teleost whole genome duplication or a more recent duplication.
whether and how subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or losses of neuropeptides and peptide hormones have contributed to fish behavioral diversity is largely unknown.
this class of signaling molecules derives from prohormone genes that have undergone multiple duplications and losses in fishes.
finally, we used in situ hybridization to localize the expression of galanin, a prohormone with exceptional sequence divergence in cichlids, as well as the expression of a proopiomelanocortin, prohormone that has undergone an additional duplication in some bony fish lineages.
our bioinformatic and mass spectrometric findings provide information on a major vertebrate clade that will further our understanding of the functional ramifications of these prohormone losses, duplications, and sequence changes across vertebrate evolution.
information on fish prohormones has been limited and is complicated by the whole genome duplication of the teleost ancestor.
we combined bioinformatics, mass spectrometry-enabled peptidomics, and molecular techniques to identify the suite of neuropeptide prohormones and pituitary peptide products in astatotilapia burtoni, a well-studied member of the diverse african cichlid clade.

retention of prohormone duplicates was therefore 41 %, which is markedly above previous reports for the genome-wide average in teleosts.
