genomic dna obtained from the strain was used to isolate the gene lipa  and lipase specific foldase gene lipb .
microbial lipases particularly pseudomonas lipases are widely used for biotechnological applications.
the lipa showed obvious esterification activity and thus had potential biocatalytic applications.
in this work, the lipase  and its chaperone  from a screened strain named ab which belongs to pseudomonas aeruginosa were overexpressed in e. coli with two dual expression plasmid systems to enhance the production of the active lipase lipa without in vitro refolding process.
one single expression plasmid system e. coli bl21/pet28a-lipab and two dual expression plasmid systems e. coli bl21/petduet-lipa-lipb and e. coli bl21/pacycduet-lipa-lipb were successfully constructed.
under the same cultured condition, the activities of the lipases expressed by e. coli bl21/pet28a-lipab and e. coli bl21/petduet-lipa-lipb were  <dig> u/l and  <dig> u/l, respectively, while the activity of the lipase expressed by e. coli bl21/pacycduet-lipa-lipb was up to  <dig> u/l.
it is a meaningful work to design experiments to obtain high-level active lipase.
the active lipa could catalyze the reaction between fatty alcohols and fatty acids to generate fatty acid alkyl esters, which meant that lipa was able to catalyze esterification reaction.
the effect of different plasmid system on the active lipa expression was significantly different.
pacycduet-lipa-lipb was more suitable for the expression of active lipa than pet28a-lipab and petduet-lipa-lipb.
there is a limiting factor for functional overexpression of the pseudomonas lipase that a chaperone is necessary for effective folding.
in this work, we screened a lipase-produced strain named ab through the screening procedure, which was identified as p. aeruginosa on the basis of 16s rdna.
the most suitable fatty acid and alcohol substrates for esterification were octylic acid and hexanol, respectively.
the lipase lipa had an optimal temperature of 30Â°c and an optimal ph of  <dig> with a strong ph tolerance.
