bacterial biofilms are of tremendous concern for clinicians, as they can compromise the ability of the immune system and antimicrobial therapy to resolve chronic and recurrent infections.
we selected these agents, because they prevent biofilm formation and induce antimicrobial synergism that may also target other staphylococci.
we determined that the combination of fosfomycin and clarithromycin better impairs s. pseudintermedius biofilm formation compared to treatment with either therapy alone .
morphological examination of these biofilms via scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that fosfomycin alone does impact biofilm formation on orthopaedic implants.
in this study, we treated bacterial biofilms produced by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius  with a combination of fosfomycin and clarithromycin.
