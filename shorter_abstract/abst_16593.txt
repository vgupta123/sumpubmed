as such, the present simulation can help to bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro kinetics.
molecule distributions, reaction rate constants and structural parameters can be adjusted separately in the simulation allowing a comprehensive study of individual effects in the context of a realistic cell environment.
the simulations are performed within a virtual cytoskeleton enriched with further crowding elements, which allows the analysis of molecular crowding effects on intracellular diffusion and reaction rates.
while the co-localization of enzymes leads to faster reaction rates, the reduced mobility decreases the collision rate of reactants, hence reducing the reaction rate, as expected.
we were able to define three factors which describe the effective reaction rate, namely f diff for the diffusion effect, f volume for the crowding, and f access for the reduced accessibility of the molecules.
the simulation framework is used to quantify and separate the effects originating from molecular crowding or the reduced mobility of the reactants.
furthermore, anomalous diffusion can occur due to molecular crowding in the cell.
in the context of diffusion controlled reactions, anomalous diffusion leads to fractal reaction kinetics.
molecules can also unspecifically bind to membranes or the cytoskeleton affecting  the fraction of unbound molecules in the cytosol and  furthermore reducing the mobility.
