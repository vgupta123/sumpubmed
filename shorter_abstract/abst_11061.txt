this is often performed using one of four taxonomic classifications, namely silva, rdp, greengenes or ncbi.
while we find that silva, rdp and greengenes map well into ncbi, and all four map well into the ott, mapping the two larger taxonomies on to the smaller ones is problematic.
we use it to compare the four taxonomies and the open tree of life taxonomy .
it is unclear how similar these are and how to compare analysis results that are based on different taxonomies.
a key step in microbiome sequencing analysis is read assignment to taxonomic units.
