in 24-hour intervals, the colonized epithelium is assessed microscopically, supernatants are collected for measurement of soluble immunoinflammatory mediators and production of cv-n, and cells are lysed for assessment of: 1) apoptosis by cleaved versus total caspase- <dig> assay; 2) nf-κb activation by a luciferase reporter assay; or 3) epithelia-associated colony forming units  in brucella agar.
the bioengineered lactobacilli expressed mcv-n with anti-hiv activity preserved in the epithelial cell context and caused no significant immunoinflammatory changes as compared to the wt l. jensenii.
malp- <dig> activated nf-κb and caused fold-increased levels of proinflammatory mediators with clinically established significance in the cervicovaginal environment , measured by a multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay.
we applied an innovative experimental model using primary and immortalized human cervical and vaginal epithelial cells to assess the functional properties of lactobacillus jensenii, a predominant constituent of the healthy vaginal microbiome, engineered to express the hiv- <dig> entry inhibitor modified cyanovirin-n .
in this model bacteria colonize the epithelial cells over a period of 24- <dig> h. staurosporine and the toll-like receptor 2/ <dig> ligand macrophage-activating lipopeptide- <dig>  serve as positive controls for apoptosis and proinflammatory activation, respectively.
these results highlight the translational value of the colonization model and justify further clinical investigation of the homeostatic and anti-hiv effectiveness of the l. jensenii derivates.
similarly to malp- <dig>  colonization by l. jensenii wt activated nf-κb; however, unlike the synthetic tlr2/ <dig> ligand, the live microorganisms did not induce significant changes in the secreted levels across all inflammation-associated proteins.
wild type  l. jensenii  <dig> consistently colonized cervical and vaginal cells in the absence of epithelial damage and apoptosis.
the mcv-n production and function were confirmed by western blot and a hiv- <dig> gp <dig> binding assay, respectively.
