this trimming is followed by addition of nucleotides at random, forming the n regions  of the v-j and v-d-j junctions.
nucleotides are trimmed from the ends of variable , diversity  and joining  genes during immunoglobulin  and t cell receptor  rearrangements in b cells and t cells of the immune system.
with increasing high-throughput of standardized immunogenetics data, similar probabilistic approaches will improve understanding of processes so far only characterized by the "output" of standardized tools.
we propose a simple first-order model that attempts to transform the observed "output" probability distribution into an estimate closer to the "true trimming process" probability distribution.
the standardized description of the tool output is based on the imgt-ontology axioms and concepts.
we collated a benchmark dataset of tr alpha  and tr gamma  v-j rearranged sequences and junctions analysed with imgt/v-quest and imgt/junctionanalysis, the nucleotide sequence analysis tools from imgt®, the international immunogenetics information system®, .
