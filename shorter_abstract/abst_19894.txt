agmatine is an endogenous polyamine formed by the decarboxylation of l-arginine.
although total expression of mapks and nf-κb was not influenced by hypoxic injury, phosphorylation of these two proteins was increased.
expression and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  and nuclear factor-kappa b  were investigated by western immunoblot analysis.
cell viability was determined by lactate dehydrogenase  assay and apoptosis was examined by annexin v and caspase- <dig> assays.
this observed cell loss was due to apoptotic cell death, as established by annexin v and caspase- <dig> assays.
our results show that agmatine has neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell damage in rgc- <dig> cells and that its effects may act through the jnk and nf-κb signaling pathways.
after  <dig> hours of hypoxic culture, the ldh assay showed  <dig> % cell loss, which was reduced to  <dig> % and  <dig> % when agmatine and bdnf were administered, respectively.
we investigated the protective effects of agmatine against hypoxia-induced apoptosis of immortalized rat retinal ganglion cells .
the effects of agmatine were compared to those of brain-derived neurotrophic factor , a well-known protective neurotrophin for retinal ganglion cells.
