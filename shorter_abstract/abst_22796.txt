however, the regulation of human l1cam expression at the transcriptional level is not well understood.
overexpression of β-catenin or slug could upregulate l1cam expression in a cell-type specific manner.
nevertheless, slug rather than β-catenin levels are correlated with l1cam expression in ec cell lines.
to better understand the molecular basis of l1cam transcriptional regulation, we carried out a detailed characterization of the human l1cam promoter.
both sites could be verified in endometrial carcinoma  cell lines and appear to be used in a cell-type specific manner.
our results, for the first time, provide evidence that the l1cam gene has two functionally active promoter sites that are used in a cell-type specific manner.
previous studies have implied the transcription factors slug and/or β-catenin in l1cam transcriptional regulation.
chromatin-ip analyses confirmed the in silico predicted e-boxes, binding sites for transcription factors snail and slug, as well as lef- <dig> sites, which are related to β-catenin-mediated transcriptional regulation, in both promoters.
slug and β-catenin are involved l1cam transcriptional regulation.
our findings suggest that the l1cam transcriptional regulation is more complex than anticipated and this study provides the basis for a better understanding of l1cam regulation in non-neuronal/tumor cells.
l1cam positive carcinomas are associated with bad prognosis.
the two identified promoter regions showed activity in luciferase reporter assays.
recent data point out that l1cam is regulated in a fashion similar to epithelial-mesenchymal transition .
