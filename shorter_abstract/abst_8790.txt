the emergence of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa  has become a great concern worldwide.
pfge results showed high clonal diversity among the  <dig> isolates.
overproduction of ampc, esacs, and the presence of vim- and oxa-type β-lactamases play additional roles in reduced susceptibility to imipenem in p. aeruginosa isolates in taiwan.
the average prevalence of imipenem-resistance in those isolates was  <dig>  % during a 10-year longitudinal surveillance in taiwan.
oprd mutations with amino acid substitution, shortened putative loop l <dig>  premature stop codon caused by point mutation, frameshift by nucleotide insertion or deletion, and interruption by insertion sequence were found in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of isolates, respectively.
the aim of this study was to investigate resistance mechanisms associated with bloodstream isolated irpa strains in taiwan.
active efflux pumps, ampc β-lactamase overproduction, and extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases  were found in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of irpa isolates, respectively.
this study suggests that alterations in the oprd protein and having an active efflux pump are the main mechanisms associated with bloodstream isolated irpa.
a total of  <dig> non-duplicated irpa isolates were isolated from patients with bloodstream infection.
