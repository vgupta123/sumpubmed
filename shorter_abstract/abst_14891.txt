high-throughput genome biological experiments yield large and multifaceted datasets that require flexible and user-friendly analysis tools to facilitate their interpretation by life scientists.
we developed the annotation, mapping, expression and network  software as a stand-alone, unified suite of tools that enables biological and medical researchers with basic bioinformatics training to manage and explore genome annotation, chromosomal mapping, protein-protein interaction, expression profiling and proteomics data.
moreover, the user interface is designed to simultaneously visualize several types of data such as protein-protein interaction networks in conjunction with expression profiles and cellular co-localization patterns.
the program is available via a website at the sourceforge portal which includes a user guide with concrete examples, links to external databases and helpful comments to implement additional functionalities.
many solutions currently exist, but they are often limited to specific steps in the complex process of data management and analysis and some require extensive informatics skills to be installed and run efficiently.
amen is an innovative solution for molecular systems biological data analysis freely available under the gnu license.
