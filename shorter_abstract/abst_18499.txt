this method demonstrates a significant increase in the retrieved number of psms for a fixed error rate.
here, we propose a new method, termed mumal, for psm assessment that is based on machine learning techniques.
this method gives rise to thousands of spectra in a single run, which are interpreted by computational tools.
our approach not only enhances the computational performance, and thus the turn around time of ms-based experiments in proteomics, but also improves the information content with benefits of a higher proteome coverage.
the shotgun strategy  is widely applied for identification of proteins in complex mixtures.
a recently proposed method termed mude treats the target-decoy analysis as an optimization problem, where sensitivity is maximized.
besides, the described heuristic for solving the optimization problem has to be executed many times to achieve a significant augmentation in sensitivity.
such tools normally use a protein database from which peptide sequences are extracted for matching with experimentally derived mass spectral data.
our method can establish nonlinear decision boundaries, leading to a higher chance to retrieve more true positives.
after the database search, the correctness of obtained peptide-spectrum matches  needs to be evaluated also by algorithms, as a manual curation of these huge datasets would be impractical.
however, the mude model is constructed in such a way that linear decision boundaries are established to separate correct from incorrect psms.
