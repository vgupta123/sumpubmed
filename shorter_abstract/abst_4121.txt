furthermore, our analysis provides the first set of copd co-morbidity candidate biomarkers, including il <dig>  tnf and jup, and characterizes their association to aging and life-style conditions, such as smoking and physical activity.
we integrated records from approximately  <dig> m patients from the medicare database with disease-gene maps that we derived from several resources including a semantic-derived knowledge-base.
since chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  has emerged as a central hub in temporal comorbidity networks, we developed a systematic integrative data-driven framework to identify shared disease-associated genes and pathways, as a proxy for the underlying generative mechanisms inducing comorbidity.
the developed framework provides novel insights in copd and especially copd co-morbidity associated mechanisms.
