first, sequencing errors may have a much larger relevance than in individual snp calling: while their impact in individual sequencing can be reduced by setting a restriction on a minimum number of reads per allele, this would have a strong and undesired effect in pools because it is unlikely that alleles at low frequency in the pool will be read many times.
third, an allele appearing only once in the reads from a pool does not necessarily correspond to a singleton in the set of individuals making up the pool, and vice versa, there can be more than one read – or, more likely, none – from a true singleton.
second, the prior allele frequency for heterozygous sites in individuals is usually  <dig>  , but this is not true in pools: in fact, under the standard neutral model, singletons  are the most common class of variants because p ∝ 1/f and they occur more often as the sample size increases.
performing high throughput sequencing on samples pooled from different individuals is a strategy to characterize genetic variability at a small fraction of the cost required for individual sequencing.
to improve upon existing theory and software packages, we have developed a bayesian approach for minor allele frequency  computation and snp calling in pools : the approach takes into account sequencing errors and allows users to choose different priors.
we present a software which helps in calling snps in pooled samples: it has good power while retaining a low false discovery rate .
in this setting, snape has better power and false discovery rate  than the comparable packages samtools, popoolation, varscan : for n =  <dig> chromosomes, snape has power ≈ 35%and fdr ≈  <dig> %.
the method also provides the posterior probability that a snp is segregating and the full posterior distribution of f for every snp.
