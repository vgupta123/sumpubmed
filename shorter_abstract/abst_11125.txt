in the first set of proteins found to bind small molecule inhibitors of rapamycin, we identified three subsets containing four or five proteins each that may help to elucidate how rapamycin affects cell growth whereas the original authors chose only one novel protein from the array results for further study.
the distance between any two proteins was measured as the graph similarity between their gene ontology  annotations.
although there are several publicly available tools that facilitate the analysis of protein sets, they do not display integrated results in an easily-interpreted image or do not allow the user to specify the proteins to be analysed.
as proof of principle, we analysed two sets of proteins identified in published protein array screens.
in an era of increasingly complex datasets, such tools will help in the formulation of new, testable hypotheses from high-throughput experimental data.
