improper degradation of maternal transcripts, incomplete activation of tfs and abnormal expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function in pbnt embryos likely contributed to incomplete reprogramming of the donor cell nuclei and therefore led to the developmental failure of these cloned embryos.
the percentages of pbnt embryos that developed to morula/blastocyst stages were extremely low even with the use of various treatments that included different scnt protocols and treatment of embryos with small molecules.
incompatibilities between mitochondrial dna  and nuclear dna revealed that the tomm /timm  complex-associated genes in bbnt embryos had the highest expression levels, while the pbnt embryos exhibited much lower expression rates.
przewalski’s gazelle–bovine iscnt embryos  were produced by transferring przewalski’s gazelle fibroblast nuclei into enucleated bovine oocytes.
maternal degradation profiles showed that  <dig> genes were uniquely downregulated in the bbnt embryos, while  <dig> genes were downregulated in the pbnt embryos.
transcriptional microarray analyses of the cloned embryos showed that the upregulation of reprogramming-associated genes in bovine–bovine scnt  embryos was significantly higher than those observed in pbnt embryos .

however, iscnt embryos often fail to produce viable offspring.
in all,  <dig> transcripts related to various transcription regulation factors  were unsuccessfully activated in the iscnt embryos.
the alterations in normal molecular mechanisms contributing to extremely poor development are for the most part unknown.
