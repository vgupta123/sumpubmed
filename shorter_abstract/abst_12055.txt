the rules may be also employed by the protein annotators in manual annotation or implemented in an automatic annotation flowchart.
the association algorithm, apriori, is utilized to mine the relationship between the enzyme class and significant interpro entries.
the candidate rules are evaluated for their classificatory capacity.
the fungus training dataset which lacks an enzyme class description was also used to evaluate the fungus candidate rules.
the trembl entries were treated as the testing set.
an automatic annotation scheme must be in an urgent need to reduce the gap between the amount of new sequences produced and reliable functional annotation.
a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> test entries were matched with the fungus rule set.
the approach involves elucidating the enzyme classifying rule that is hidden in uniprot protein knowledgebase and then applying it for classification.
a correct enzyme classification rate of 70% was obtained for the prokaryote datasets and a similar rate of about 80% was obtained for the eukaryote datasets.
the feasibility of using the method presented here to classify enzyme classes based on the enzyme domain rules is evident.
the number of sequences compiled in many genome projects is growing exponentially, but most of them have not been characterized experimentally.
