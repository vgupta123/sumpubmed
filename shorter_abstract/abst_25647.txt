transposable elements  are mobile genetic dna sequences.
our results indicate that the initial invasion of csuple <dig> into c. suppressalis occurred before c. suppressalis populations spread throughout china, and suggest that c. suppressalis populations have a common ancestor in china.
this research was carried out in order to find diversity between c. suppressalis field populations and detect the original settlement of c. suppressalis populations based on the piggybac-like element .
additionally, the lower reaches of the yangtze river are probably the original settlement of c. suppressalis in china.
the rice stem borer chilo suppressalis walker is one of the most important insect pests of many subtropical and tropical paddy fields.
additionally, the csuple <dig>  sequence varied slightly between field populations, with polymorphic indels  and hyper-variable regions including the identification of the 3â€² region outside the open reading frame .
tes can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations and they have the capacity to multiply.
this insect occurs in all the rice-growing areas in china.
here we identify a new piggybac-like element  in the rice stem borer chilo suppressalis walker, which is called csuple <dig>  .
twenty-one different insertion sites for csuple <dig> copies were identified with at least two insertion loci found in all populations.
we also aim to provide insights into the evolution of ples in c. suppressalis and the phylogeography of c. suppressalis.
finally, the csuple <dig> insertion site appears to be a candidate marker for phylogenetic research of c. suppressalis.
csuple <dig>  insertion frequency varied between field populations.
sequences variation was found between csuple <dig> copies and varied within and among field populations.
