we propose reaction graph kernels for automatically assigning ec numbers to unknown enzymatic reactions in a metabolic network.
the prediction results of reaction graph kernels on  <dig> unknown enzymatic reactions are compared with an expert's knowledge.
reaction graph kernels compute similarity between two chemical reactions considering the similarity of chemical compounds in reaction and their relationships.
towards identifying the functions of those enzymes, assignment of ec numbers to the enzymatic reactions they catalyze plays a key role, since ec numbers represent the categorization of enzymes on one hand, and the categorization of enzymatic reactions on the other hand.
in computational experiments based on the kegg/reaction database, our method successfully predicted the first three digits of the ec number with 83% accuracy.
we also exhaustively predicted missing ec numbers in plant's secondary metabolism pathway.
using the same data for evaluation, we compared our method with e-zyme, and showed its ability to assign more number of accurate ec numbers.
reaction graph kernels are a new metric for comparing enzymatic reactions.
