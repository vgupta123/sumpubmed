here we propose a flexible bayesian model for analysis of ai, which accounts for bias and can be implemented without dna controls.

existing statistical models which account for bias rely on information from dna controls, which can be cost prohibitive for large intraspecific studies.
the resulting estimates of bias can be used to correct for bias in the pg model, without data filtering.
the pg model developed here performs well when bias is known, or slightly misspecified.
however, bias has been found to result from multiple factors including: genome ambiguity, reference quality, the mapping algorithm, and biases in the sequencing process.
two alternative approaches have been developed to handle bias: adjusting for bias using a statistical model and filtering regions of the genome suspected of harboring bias.
rna-seq is the most common way to measure ase and a binomial test is often applied to determine statistical significance of ai.
the proposed model always has a lower type i error rate compared to the binomial test.
one method of identifying cis regulatory differences is to analyze allele-specific expression  and identify cases of allelic imbalance .
consistent with prior studies, bias dramatically affects the type i error rate.
the closer the estimate of bias is to the true underlying bias, the lower the type i error rate.
correct estimates of bias result in a level alpha test.
