the model demonstrates better results when compared to several techniques in the literature.
in a prior work, all sequences were represented as probability matrices of residues adopting each of helix, sheet and coil states, based on energy calculations using the c-alpha, c-beta, side-chain  algorithm.
however, training on large numbers of protein chains compromises the classifier ability to generalize to new sequences.
the implications of these findings are:  the choice of training proteins is important in preserving the generalization of a classifier to predict new sequences accurately and  ssp techniques sensitive in distinguishing between backbone hydrogen bonding and side-chain or water-mediated hydrogen bonding might be needed in the reduction of coil ⇔ sheet misclassifications.
the functional relationship between the conformational energies computed with cabs force-field and residue states is approximated using a classifier termed the fully complex-valued relaxation network .
previous works relied on cross validation as an estimate of classifier accuracy.
here, a small group of  <dig> proteins termed the compact model is selected from the cb <dig> dataset using a heuristics-based approach.
the performance of the compact model is compared with traditional cross-validated accuracies and blind-tested on a dataset of g switch proteins, obtaining accuracies of ∼ <dig> %.
since the predictions of ssp methods are applied as input to higher-level structure prediction pipelines, even small errors may have large perturbations in final models.
