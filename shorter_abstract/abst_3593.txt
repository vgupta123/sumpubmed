this study provided the first step to understanding the molecular mechanism of the differential development of ray florets and disc florets in chrysanthemum, and also provided valuable genomic resources for candidate genes applicable for the breeding of novel varieties in chrysanthemum.
go and kegg pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the degs to identify differences in the biological processes and pathways between ray florets and disc florets.
chrysanthemum morifolium is one of the most important global cut flower and pot plants, and has been cultivated worldwide.
comparative transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in patterns of gene expression and signaling pathways between ray florets and disc florets in chrysanthemum morifolium.

however, limited genomic resources are available and the molecular mechanisms involved in the two morphologically distinct floret developmental cycles in chrysanthemum remain unclear.
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes   were identified between ray florets and disc florets, including genes encoding transcription factors and protein kinases.
the transcriptomes of chrysanthemum ray florets, disc florets and leaves were sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing technology.
the important regulatory genes controlling flower development and flower organ determination, as well as important functional genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, were identified, of which two leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase-encoding genes showed specific expression in ray florets.
in total,  <dig>  g reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 738 bp, of which  <dig>  unigenes showed similarity to known proteins in the swissprot or ncbi non-redundant protein databases.
