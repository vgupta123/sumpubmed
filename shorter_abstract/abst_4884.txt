in contrast to the large number of ligands only seven type i and five type ii receptors have been identified in mammals, implicating a prominent promiscuity in ligand-receptor interaction.
as suggested from the dimeric nature of the ligands, binding to immobilized receptors shows avidity due to cooperative binding caused by bivalent ligand-receptor interactions.
interestingly, low and high affinity binding sites were identified, as defined by the presence of either one or two bmp receptor -ia receptor chains, respectively.
both sites contribute to different cellular responses in that the high affinity sites allow a rapid transient response at low ligand concentrations whereas the low affinity sites facilitate sustained signaling but higher ligand concentrations are required.
binding of a ligand to a single high affinity receptor chain functioning as anchoring molecule and providing sufficient complex stability allows the subsequent formation of signaling competent complexes.
transforming growth factor Î² superfamily members transduce signals by oligomerizing two classes of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type i and type ii.
in vitro interaction analyses showed two different prototypes of binding kinetics, 'slow on/slow off' and 'fast on/fast off'.
thus, the resulting receptor arrangement can principally consist of four different receptors, which is consistent with our interaction analysis showing low ligand-receptor specificity within one subtype class.
to compare these in vitro observations to the situation in vivo, binding studies on whole cells employing homodimeric as well as heterodimeric bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  mutants were performed.
for bmp <dig>  further complexity is added by the fact that heterooligomeric signaling complexes containing only one type i receptor chain can also be found.
surprisingly, the binding specificity of ligands to the receptors of one subtype is only moderate.
