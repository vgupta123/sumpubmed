in the absence of functional pax <dig>  progenitors do not express er <dig> and the rostrolateral cortex lacks er81-positive layer  <dig> neurons.
the results suggest that endogenous pax <dig>  which is expressed at the highest level in progenitors of the rostrolateral cortex, exerts region-specific control of er <dig> activity, thus specifying a subpopulation of layer  <dig> projection neurons.
we found that the presence of one of these sites is necessary and sufficient for full activation of the er <dig> promoter in pax6-transfected hela cells, while other still unknown factors appear to contribute to er <dig> promoter activity in cortical progenitors and neuronal cells.
we conclude that the genetic interplay between the transcription factors, pax <dig> and er <dig>  is responsible, in part, for the regional specification of a distinct sublineage of layer  <dig> projection neurons.
pax <dig> and the ets family transcription factor er <dig>  which is presumed to play a role in the specification of a sublineage of layer  <dig> projection neurons, are expressed with a prominent rostrolateral-high to caudomedial-low gradient in cortical progenitors.
