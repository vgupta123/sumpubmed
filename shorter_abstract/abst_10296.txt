in this study, we sequenced size-selected directional libraries representing srna samples from neisseria gonorrhoeae strain fa  <dig>  and examined the fe- and temporal regulation of these srnas.
fourteen srnas were induced in high fe conditions, consisting of both cis and trans srnas, some of which are predicted to control expression of a known virulence factor, and one sam riboswitch.
rna-seq data for all time points identified a pool of at least  <dig> potential srnas.
temporal regulation of these srnas suggests a regulatory role in controlling functions necessary for survival, and may be important for phenotypes often associated with altered growth rates, such as biofilm formation or intracellular survival.
differential analysis demonstrated that expression appeared to be regulated by fe availability for at least fifteen of these srnas.
an additional putative cis-acting srna was repressed by fe availability.
the expression of the  <dig> fe-induced srnas also exhibited temporal control, as their expression levels increased dramatically as the bacteria entered stationary phase.
