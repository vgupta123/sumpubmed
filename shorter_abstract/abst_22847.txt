il- <dig>  a th <dig> cell-derived proinflammatory molecule, has been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis  and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .
we then cultured nscs with il- <dig> and determined nsc proliferation by neurosphere formation capability and cell number count, differentiation by immunostaining neural specific markers, and apoptosis of nscs by flow cytometry.
thus, in addition to its proinflammatory role in the immune system, il- <dig> may also play a direct role in blocking remyelination and neural repair in the cns.
il- <dig> inhibited nsc proliferation, but did not induce cytotoxicity or apoptosis.
while il- <dig> receptor  is expressed in many immune-related cells, microglia, and astrocytes, it is not known whether il- <dig> exerts a direct effect on neural stem cells  and oligodendrocytes, thus inducing inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system.
