here, the hypothesis was tested that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bovine somatotropin  during the preovulatory period would improve pregnancy success of lactating dairy cows at first service.
cows inseminated following natural estrus or timed artificial insemination were given a single injection of bst or a placebo injection at insemination .
results regarding the use of bovine somatotropin for enhancing fertility in dairy cattle are variable.
as expected, bst did not increase vaginal temperature.
the second experiment was performed during heat stress in florida.
results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bst treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows.
there was a tendency  for a smaller percent of control cows to have high plasma progesterone concentrations  at day  <dig> after insemination than for bst-treated cows .
when only cows that were successfully synchronized were considered, the magnitude of the absolute difference in the percentage of inseminated cows that were diagnosed pregnant between bst and control cows was reduced .
