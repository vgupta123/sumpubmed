one possible reason is that the pairwise similarity scores used in automatic classification do not adequately reflect the judgments made in manual classification.
visual examination of hard-to-classify proteins confirms our previous finding, that global structural similarity of domains is not the only criterion used in the scop classification.
we use dali, sheba and vast pairwise scores on the scop c class domains, to investigate a variety of hierarchical clustering procedures.
dendrogram- or tree-cutting strategies fell into four categories according to the similarity of resulting partitions to the scop fold partition.
automatic methods such as fssp or dali domain dictionary, yield divergent classifications, for reasons not yet fully investigated.
two strategies which optimize similarity to scop, gave an average of 72% true positives rate , at a 1% false positive rate.
another possibility is the difference between manual and automatic classification procedures.
