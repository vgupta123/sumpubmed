in silico analysis using molecular modeling, dynamics and docking identified the amino acids that were involved in the interactions between pbmls and pbmls-interacting proteins.
the fungus paracoccidioides spp is the agent of paracoccidioidomycosis , a pulmonary mycosis acquired by the inhalation of fungal propagules.
these data suggest that pbmls could play different roles in the fungal cell.
these observations indicate that pbmls interacts with proteins that are in different functional categories, such as cellular transport, protein biosynthesis, modification and degradation of proteins and signal transduction.
paracoccidioides malate synthase  is important in the infectious process of paracoccidioides spp because the transcript is up-regulated during the transition from mycelium to yeast and in yeast cells during phagocytosis by murine macrophages.
the objective of this study was to identify and analyze proteins that possibly bind to pbmls  because protein interactions are intrinsic to cell processes, and it might be possible to infer the function of a protein through the identification of its ligands.
some of the protein interactions were confirmed by far-western blotting using specific antibodies, and the interaction of pbmls with macrophages was validated by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.
the search for interactions was performed using an in vivo assay with a two-hybrid library constructed in s. cerevisiae; the transcripts were sequenced and identified.
in addition, pbmls acts as an adhesin in paracoccidioides spp.
