overall, the effects of ethanol on signalling in vivo were similar to those reported for in vitro exposure to ethanol and/or lipopolysaccharide.
cytokine concentrations in the samples of peritoneal lavage fluid and in serum were determined at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr after lipopolysaccharide administration.
to determine if nf-Îºb composed of other subunits was inhibited, transgenic mice with a luciferase reporter were used.
previous reports indicate that ethanol, in a binge drinking model in mice, inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo.
considering evidence that signaling can be very different in vitro and in vivo, the present study was conducted to determine if effects of ethanol on tlr <dig> signaling reported for cells in culture or cells removed from ethanol treated mice and stimulated in culture also occur when ethanol treatment and tlr <dig> activation occur in vivo.
phosphorylated p <dig>  erk, and c-jun  were quantified with kits or by western blot using samples taken  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min after stimulation of peritoneal macrophages with lipopolysaccharide in vivo.
ethanol suppressed production of most pro-inflammatory cytokines to a similar degree as it inhibited key tlr <dig> signaling events.
all of these data were used to measure the area under the concentration vs time curve, which provided an indication of the overall effects of ethanol in this system.
the observation that ethanol given  <dig> hr before dosing with lps modulated production of some cytokines indicates a persistent effect which does not require continued presence of ethanol.
