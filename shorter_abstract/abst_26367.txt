in particular, the pathways associated with cell cycle and dna damage and repair processes appear to be disrupted in favour of apoptosis.
these latter changes presumably protect and maintain a healthy colonic epithelium against incidental dietary and environmental insults.
aom induces substantial changes in gene expression, resulting in an early switch in the cell cycle process, involving p <dig> signalling, towards cell cycle arrest leading to the more effective process of apoptosis to counteract this genotoxic insult.
aom administration superimposes substantial changes on these basal gene expression patterns in both the distal and proximal rat colonic epithelium.
the healthy ratsâ€™ colon exhibits extensive gene expression changes between its proximal and distal ends.
in this report we define the normal rat colonic epithelium by describing transcriptional events along the anterior-posterior axis and then investigate the acute effects of azoxymethane  on gene expression, with a particular emphasis on pathways associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity in the proximal and distal compartments using whole genome expression microarrays.
there are large transcriptional changes that occur in epithelial gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the normal healthy rat colon.
