we developed a high-throughput bacterial adhesion inhibition  assay based on human respiratory cell lines and on live bacteria chemically conjugated to a fluorescent dye.
although the causes of pertussis resurgence are matter of debate, emerging evidences suggest that acellular vaccines efficiently protect against the hallmark symptoms of pertussis disease but fail to prevent colonization.
employing a <dig> cells as model, we evaluated the impact of antibodies elicited by acellular  and whole cell  vaccines on b. pertussis adhesion in vitro.
consequently, there is a need for novel bioassays to evaluate at pre-clinical or clinical level the impact of different vaccines on b. pertussis colonization.
despite high vaccination coverage whooping cough is currently re-emerging in many developed countries.
moreover, we settled the method also on polarized calu- <dig> cells grown at air-liquid interface , showing that this assay can be extended to more complex cell models mimicking the airway epithelium.
