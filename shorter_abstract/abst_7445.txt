the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases  of gibberellin  biosynthesis have a key role in the metabolism of a major plant hormone.
the ga 2-oxidase from pisum sativum l., psga2ox <dig>  was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase  fusion.
the activity of recombinant ga 2odds from many species has been characterised in detail, however little information relates to enzyme purification.
native ga 2odds displayed lability during purification.
two ga 2odds were expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity.
the successful purification of milligram quantities of psga2ox <dig> enables mechanistic and structural studies not previously possible on ga 2odds.
it displayed a km of  <dig>  Î¼m and a vmax of  <dig>  pkat/mg toward ga <dig>  the ga 3-oxidase from arabidopsis thaliana, atga3ox <dig>  was expressed as a poly-tagged thioredoxin fusion.
it was purified in the three steps of affinity chromatography, gst removal and gel filtration.
it was purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration.
psga2ox1's action in planta as deduced from the effect of the null mutation sln on ga levels in seeds is in agreement with the kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzyme.
