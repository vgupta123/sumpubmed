the generation and use of mhc class ii tetramers to study antigen-specific cd4+ t cells appears less straightforward.
hla-dr*1101-bir molecules can be pulsed with at least three different promiscuous peptide epitopes, derived from tetanus toxoid, influenza ha and the tumour associated antigen mage- <dig> respectively, to stain specific cd4+ t cells.
it is therefore possible to generate a soluble recombinant hla-dr* <dig> backbone that is receptive for loading with different peptides to stain specific cd4+ t cells.
we compared soluble mhc class ii-immunoglobulin fusion proteins  with soluble mhc class ii protein fused with an optimised bir site for enzymatic biotynilation , both produced in insect cells.
no such reagent is in fact available for this hla-dr allele, one of the most frequent in the caucasian population.
as shown for other hla-dr alleles, we confirm that not all the strategies to produce soluble hla-dr* <dig> multimers are equivalent.
both staining temperature and activation state of cd4+ t cells are critical for the binding of peptide-pulsed hla-dr*1101-bir to the cognate tcr.
we attempted the generation of "empty" functional hla-dr* <dig> tetramers, receptive for loading with synthetic peptides by incubation.
most mhc class ii tetramers are produced with a homogeneously built-in peptide, reducing greatly their flexibility of use.
we find that hla-dr*1101-bir molecules are superior to the hla-dr*1101-ig ones both in biochemical and functional terms.
