miniature inverted repeat transposable element  is one type of transposable element , which is largely found in eukaryotic genomes and involved in a wide variety of biological events.
<dig> genome under three conditions: in seedlings germinated from the seeds received a high dose γ-ray irradiation, in plantlets regenerated from anther-derived calli and from scutellum-derived calli, and were confirmed by pcr validation and sequencing.
it is for the first time that mging active transposition was demonstrated under γ-ray irradiation or in cell re-differentiation process in rice.
by using a modified transposon display  analysis, the active transpositions of mging were detected in rice jiahua no.
furthermore, cell re-differentiation experiment showed that active transpositions of both mging and mping  were identified only in regenerated plantlets.
we found that the amplicon discrepancy of a gene locus loc_os01g <dig> in different rice cultivar genomes was resulted from the existence of a member of gaijin-like mites .
this newly identified active mite will provide a foundation for further analysis of the roles of mites in biological process.
sequence analysis revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms  or short additional dna sequences at transposition sites post mging transposition.
