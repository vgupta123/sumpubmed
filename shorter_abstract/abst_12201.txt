the successful application of predictive modelling in arabidopsis thaliana can bring systems-biological interpretation of plant systems forward.
using the gained knowledge, metabolic engineering strategies to engage plants as biotechnological factories can be developed.
our computational model indicates that the a. thaliana leaf operates near its theoretical optimum flux state in the light, however, only in a narrow range of photon usage.
the simulations further demonstrate that the natural day-night shift requires substantial re-arrangement of pathway flux between compartments:  <dig> reactions, involving redox and energy metabolism, substantially change the extent of flux, whereas  <dig> reactions even invert flux direction.
the integration with experimental transcriptome data pinpoints selected transcriptional changes that mediate the diurnal adaptation of the plant and superimpose the flux response.
systematic analysis of this network, utilizing elementary flux modes, investigates metabolic capabilities of the plant and predicts relevant properties on the systems level: optimum pathway use for maximum growth and flux re-arrangement in response to environmental perturbation.
to obtain insight into its functional properties, we constructed a large-scale metabolic network of the leaf of a. thaliana.
in this regard, systems biology, in particular the integration of metabolic and regulatory networks, is promising to broaden our knowledge and to further explore the biotechnological potential of plants.
