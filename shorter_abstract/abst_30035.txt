pcv <dig> triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response, but the key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interferes with host innate immunity have not yet been elucidated.
the up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, cytokine activity, locomotion, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and antigen procession and presentation.
the observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the underlying immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs following pcv <dig> infection.
pams were successfully infected by pcv2-wh strain, as evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  and immunofluorescence assay  results.
microarray analysis at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection  revealed  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively, that were differentially expressed .
