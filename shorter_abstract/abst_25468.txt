to predict the drivers of co-expression divergence, we integrate topological relationships in the co-expression networks with available high confidence protein-protein interaction data.
we validate the predicted divergences in dna mismatch repair and histone acetylation by measuring the effects of small molecule inhibitors in recombinant progeny clones combined with quantitative trait locus  mapping.
for both phenotypic states, pfcrt co-expressed gene sets are associated with hemoglobin metabolism, consistent with cq’s expected mode of action.
this analysis identifies  <dig> transcriptional regulators from the apiap <dig> family and histone acetylation as potential mediators of these divergences.
to identify pfcrt-interacting genes, we analyze pfcrt co-expression networks in  <dig> phenotypic states - cq-resistant  and cq-sensitive  recombinant progeny clones - using a computational approach that prioritizes gene interactions into functional and regulatory relationships.

resulting networks provide insights into pfcrt’s biological functions and regulation, as well as the divergent phenotypic effects of its allelic variants in different genetic backgrounds.
this work demonstrates the utility of differential co-expression viewed in a network framework to uncover functional and regulatory divergence in phenotypically distinct parasites.
the paradigm of resistance evolution to chemotherapeutic agents is that a key coding mutation in a specific gene drives resistance to a particular drug.
pfcrt-associated co-expression in the cq resistant progeny highlights cqr-specific gene relationships and possible targeted intervention strategies.
