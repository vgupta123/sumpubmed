in addition, we designed pdonr-r4-r <dig> so that dna fragments already cloned upstream or downstream of the gateway cassette in the original destination vectors can still be utilized for promoter-gene or translational fusions after the conversion.
the aim of this work was to make the multisite gateway technology available for multiple biological purposes.
a vast number of single-site gateway destination vectors have been created while multisite gateway is limited to few destination vectors and therefore to few applications.
our tool makes multisite gateway a more widely accessible technology and expands its applications by exploiting all the features of the gateway vectors already available.
we created a construct, pdonr-r4-r <dig>  to easily convert any available gateway destination vector to a multisite gateway vector in a single recombination reaction.
invitrogen gateway technology exploits the integrase/att site-specific recombination system for directional cloning of pcr products and the subsequent subcloning into destination vectors.
one or three dna segments can be cloned using gateway or multisite gateway respectively.
