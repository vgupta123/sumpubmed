therefore, an effective inter-species t4ss effector prediction tool is urgently needed to help discover new effectors in a variety of bacterial species, especially those with few known effectors, e.g., helicobacter pylori.
many bacteria can deliver pathogenic proteins  through type iv secretion systems  to eukaryotic cytoplasm, causing host diseases.
the inter-species prediction tool package, t4sepre, was further used to predict new t4ss effectors from h. pylori, an important human pathogen associated with gastritis, ulcer and cancer.
in total,  <dig> new highly possible h. pylori t4s effector genes were computationally identified.
the inherent property, such as sequence diversity and global scattering throughout the whole genome, makes it a big challenge to effectively identify the full set of t4ss effectors.

in this research, we first manually annotated a full list of validated t4ss effectors from different bacteria and then carefully compared their c-terminal sequential and position-specific amino acid compositions, possible motifs and structural features.
