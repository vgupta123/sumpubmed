for each of  <dig>  nucleotide positions of the mt genome it holds two sets of four 25-mer probes each that match the heavy and the light strand of a reference mt genome and vary only at their central position to interrogate all four possible alleles.
in addition, the mitochip v <dig>  carries alternative local context probes to account for known mtdna variants.
reseqchip allows for the automated consolidation of base calls from alternative local mt genome context probes.
we provide reseqchip, a free software that automates the process of resequencing mtdna using multiple local context probes on the mitochip v <dig> .
