horizontal gene transfer , a source of genetic variation, is generally considered to facilitate hosts' adaptability to environments.

in this study, based on sequence data accumulated to date, we used a unified method consisting of similarity search and phylogenetic analysis to detect horizontally transferred genes  between prokaryotes and five insect species including drosophila melanogaster, anopheles gambiae, bombyx mori, tribolium castaneum and apis mellifera.
at least half of the predicted donor organisms may be entomopathogenic bacteria.
on the basis of phylogenetic topologies and blast search results, donor bacteria of these genes were inferred, respectively.
importantly, our results imply that pathogens may be advantageous to the subsistence and prosperity of hosts through effective hgt events at a large evolutionary scale.
unexpectedly, the candidate htgs were not detected in d. melanogaster, an.
however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of the transferred genes to the evolution of metazoan recipients is rare.
these genes potentially contributed to functional innovation and adaptability of lepidopteran hosts in their ancient lineages associated with the diversification of angiosperms.
additionally,  <dig> types of the detected silkworm htgs share homologous sequences in species of other lepidopteran superfamilies, suggesting that the majority of these htgs were derived from ancient transfer events before the radiation of ditrysia clade.
