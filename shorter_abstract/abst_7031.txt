the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi sensu lato in a well defined population of bernese mountain dogs and to compare this prevalence with data from dogs of other breeds.
glomerulonephritis in dogs has been associated with b. burgdorferi infections.
in bernese mountain dogs with glomerulonephritis antibodies against b. burgdorferi have been found in most dogs, raising the question if the breed is predisposed to infections with b. burgdorferi.
seroprevalence of b. burgdorferi was assessed by elisa and western blot and was 58% in bernese mountain dogs compared to 15% in control dogs.
the cause of the considerably higher prevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi in bernese mountain dogs and it's consequences are not known.
neither antibodies against leptospires nor vaccination or hair coat color influenced the results.
<dig> bernese mountain dogs and  <dig> control dogs  were included.
bernese mountain dogs and control dogs were kept in similar environments.
a breed predisposition can be suspected.
