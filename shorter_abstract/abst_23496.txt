histological and biochemical analyses of rat brains revealed increased levels of oxidative stress markers and a loss of approximately 65% of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra region.
this is the first preclinical evaluation of a water-soluble coenzyme q <dig> formulation showing the evidence of prophylactic neuroprotection at clinically relevant doses.
the paraquat-exposed rats also displayed impaired balancing skills on a slowly rotating drum  evidenced by their reduced spontaneity in gait performance.
parkinson's disease, for which currently there is no cure, develops as a result of progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the brain; thus, identification of any potential therapeutic intervention for disease management is of a great importance.
