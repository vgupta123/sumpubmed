confocal laser scanning microscopy and subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that all rgfg isoforms bearing the mts were specifically targeted to mitochondria whereas isoforms and deletion mutants lacking the mts were localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
computational analysis identified a mitochondrial targeting sequence  in the n-terminus of three previously described rgfg isoforms.
in the present study we focused on elucidating the expression and subcellular distribution of alternatively spliced rat gfg isoforms.
the present study demonstrates that the antisense rna itself is translated, and that protein isoforms resulting form alternative rna splicing are sorted to different subcellular compartments.
gfg/nudt is a nudix hydrolase originally identified as the product of the fibroblast growth factor- <dig> antisense  gene.
previous findings strongly support a role for the fgf antisense rna as a regulator of fgf <dig> expression.
rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry revealed tissue-specific gfg mrna isoform expression and subcellular distribution of gfg immunoreactivity in cytoplasm and nuclei of a wide range of normal rat tissues.
fgf- <dig> and gfg immunoreactivity were co-localized in some, but not all, tissues examined.
