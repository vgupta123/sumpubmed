previous results demonstrated that the transcription factor vhnf <dig> confers caudal identity to the hindbrain inducing krox <dig> in r <dig> and mafb/kreisler in r <dig> and r <dig>  through fgf signaling  <cit> .
refinement of the ap identities within the hindbrain requires the establishment of local signaling centers, which emit signals that pattern territories in their vicinity.
during early steps of embryonic development the hindbrain undergoes a regionalization process along the anterior-posterior  axis that leads to a metameric organization in a series of rhombomeres .
we also analyzed the expression profiles of fgf activity readouts, such as mkp <dig> and pea <dig>  and showed that both are expressed within the hindbrain at early stages of embryonic development.
we show that in the chick hindbrain, fgf <dig> is transcriptionally activated as early as  <dig> min after mvhnf <dig> electroporation, suggesting that it is a direct target of this transcription factor.
while ras-erk1/ <dig> activity is necessary for mkp <dig>  krox <dig> and mafb induction, pi3k-akt is not involved in that process.
finally, we addressed the question of which of the fgf-responding intracellular pathways were active and involved in the regulation of krox <dig> and mafb in the hindbrain.
