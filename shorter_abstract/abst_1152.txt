this transition results in redundancy of genes and gene families, leading to an increase in junk dna and eventually to gene loss.
a total of  <dig> protein families, present in all cyanobacterial genomes, were identified.
to increase our understanding of genomic changes in the lineage, the genomes of  <dig> contemporary cyanobacteria were analysed for shared and unique orthologs.
the evolution of cyanobacterial genome sizes involves a mix of gains and losses in the clade encompassing complex cyanobacteria, while a single event of reduction is evident in a clade dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria.
orthologs unique to cyanobacteria exhibiting specific characteristics, such as filament formation, heterocyst differentiation, diazotrophy and symbiotic competence, were also identified.
a few orthologs can be correlated with specific phenotypes in cyanobacteria, such as filament formation and symbiotic competence; these constitute exciting exploratory targets.
an ancestral character reconstruction suggests that the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria had a genome size of approx.
genome sizes and gene family copy numbers evolve at a higher rate in the former clade, and multi-copy genes were predominant in large genomes.
the expansion strategy is driven by gene-family enlargment and generates a broad adaptive potential; while the genome streamlining strategy imposes adaptations to highly specific niches, also reflected in their different functional capacities.
a few genomes display extreme proliferation of non-coding nucleotides which is likely to be the result of initial expansion of genomes/gene copy number to gain adaptive potential, followed by a shift to a life-style in a highly specific niche .
two of these are unique to the phylum, corresponding to an abrb family transcriptional regulator and a gene that escapes functional annotation although its genomic neighbourhood is conserved among the organisms examined.
