we also found the increase of both biomass production and co <dig> fixation with light intensity and co <dig> concentration in c <dig> is faster than that in c <dig>  which reflected more efficient use of light and co <dig> in c <dig> plant.
we also identified more correlated reaction sets in c <dig>  and demonstrated c <dig> plants have better modularity with complex mechanism coordinates the reactions and pathways than that of c <dig> plants.
all results are consistent with the actual situation, which indicate that flux balance analysis is a powerful method to study plant metabolism at systems level.
in addition, preliminary analysis indicated that the rate of co <dig> fixation and biomass production in pck subtype are superior to nadp-me and nad-me subtypes under enough supply of water and nitrogen.
in addition, all the essential reactions in c <dig> network are also essential for c <dig>  while there are some other reactions specifically essential for c <dig>  which validated that the basic metabolism of c <dig> plant is similar to c <dig>  but c <dig> is more complex.
moreover, c <dig> plant has better robustness no matter the objective function is biomass synthesis or co <dig> fixation.
by graph theory, we found the c <dig> network exhibit more dense topology structure than c <dig>  the simulation of enzyme knockouts demonstrated that both c <dig> and c <dig> networks are very robust, especially when optimizing co <dig> fixation.
we demonstrated that in contrast to c <dig>  c <dig> plants have less dense topology, higher robustness, better modularity, and higher co <dig> and radiation use efficiency.
finally, we explored the contribution of different c <dig> subtypes to biomass production by setting specific constraints.
the c <dig> photosynthetic cycle supercharges photosynthesis by concentrating co <dig> around ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase and significantly reduces the oxygenation reaction.
