molecular dynamics  simulations provide valuable insight into biomolecular systems at the atomic level.
at the same time, complete workflows for advanced simulation protocols can be established and managed on remote resources by a graphical interface which increases reusability of protocols and additionally lowers the entry barrier into such simulations for, e.g., experimental scientists who want to compare their results against simulations.
native structure-based models, also called g≈ç-type models, are based on energy landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration.
this infrastructure organizes the setup of such simulations resulting in increased comparability of simulation results.
here, we establish an efficient infrastructure for native structure-based models to support the community and enable high-throughput simulations on remote computing resources via gridbeans and unicore middleware.
