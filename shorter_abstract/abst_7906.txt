this was true for absolute latency, with respect to stimulus onset, as well as for relative latency, with respect to population response onset.
we compared stimulus reconstruction quality based on the ganglion cell response parameters latency, first interspike interval, and rate.
for stimulus reconstruction of moving stimuli using latency was superior to using the other stimulus parameters.
archerfish show very short behavioural latencies in response to falling prey.
this raises the question, which response parameters of retinal ganglion cells to moving stimuli are best suited for fast coding of stimulus speed and direction.
latency is the fastest response parameter available to the brain.
the quantitative data of this study are in good accordance with previously published behavioural response latencies.
