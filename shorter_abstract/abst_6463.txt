these data will facilitate gene discovery and functional genomic studies of the peanut plant.
we completed a successful global analysis of the peanut transcriptome using rna-seq, a large number of unigenes were assembled, and almost four thousand ssr primers were developed.
based on sequence similarity search with known proteins, a total of  <dig>  genes were identified.
in this study, we employed rna-seq to analyse the transcriptomes of the immature seeds of three different peanut varieties with different oil contents.
in addition, this study provides insight into the complex transcriptome of the peanut and established a biotechnological platform for future research.
among these unigenes, only  <dig>  unigenes were annotated with  <dig> gene ontology  functional categories.
the peanut  is an important oilseed crop in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
