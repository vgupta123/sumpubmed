it seems that there is a synergistic effect in detecting significant gene sets when significant genes have within-class correlation and the association between survival and genes is positive or negative .
we focused on the survival phenotype and compared the performances of gene set enrichment analysis , global test , wald-type test  and global boost test  methods in a simulation study and on two ovarian cancer data sets.
for the ovarian cancer data set, using the fdr threshold of q <  <dig> , the gt, wt and gbst detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant pathways, respectively, whereas neither gsea <dig> nor gsea <dig> detected any significant pathways.
many gene-set analysis methods have been previously proposed and compared through simulation studies and analysis of real datasets for binary phenotypes.
simulation studies and a real data example indicate that gt, wt and gbst tend to have high power, whereas gsea <dig> and gsea <dig> have lower power.
simulation results indicated that gt, wt and gbst consistently have higher power than gsea <dig> and gsea <dig> across all scenarios.
we considered two versions of gsea by allowing different weights: gsea <dig> uses equal weights, yielding results similar to the kolmogorov-smirnov test; while gsea2's weights are based on the correlation between genes and the phenotype.
we compared gsea <dig>  gsea <dig>  gt, wt and gbst in a simulation study with various settings for the correlation structure of the genes and the association parameter between the survival outcome and the genes.
however, the power of the five tests depends on the combination of correlation structure and association parameter.
