the majority of information in the biological literature resides in full text articles, instead of abstracts.
we present an approach to recognize named entities in full text.
it is also computationally efficient and robust to noise commonly found in full text material.
we use the method to create a protein name dictionary from a set of  <dig>  full text articles.
we assess the quality of the dictionary by studying its protein name recognition performance in full text.
this is a limitation, because such databases have low coverage of the many name variants which are used to refer to biological entities in the literature.
the approach collects high frequency terms in an article, and uses support vector machines  to identify biological entity names.
only  <dig> % of the names in this dictionary match swissprot description lines.
