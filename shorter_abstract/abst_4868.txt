based on the combined presence or absence of these markers, we distinguished  <dig> different genotypes, including three major genotypes encountered in 75% of the studied strains, although spi determinants were almost always detected, sgi <dig>  inti <dig>  sul <dig> and blatem determinants were found 47%, 52%, 54% and 12% of the time respectively, varying according to isolation source.
to investigate antimicrobial resistance, the study also targeted the presence of genes involved in sulfonamide  and beta-lactam  resistance.
the genediscÂ® assay developed in this study madeit easier to explore variability within serotype typhimurium by analyzing ten relevant gene determinants in a large collection of strains.
typhimurium is the main serotype of salmonella enterica subsp.
a total of  <dig> unrelated s. typhimurium strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from various sources, including food animals, food products, human and environmental samples were studied.
low-marker patterns were most often detected in poultry sources whereas full-marker patterns were observed in pig, cattle and human sources.
