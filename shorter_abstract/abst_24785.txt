importantly, these novel early endoderm-expressing genes will be valuable for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms that regulate endoderm development.
we describe the identification of novel as well as known genes that are expressed in de using serial analysis of gene expression .
however, investigation into the molecular mechanisms of de differentiation has been hindered by the lack of early de-specific markers.
using whole mount in situ hybridization, we confirmed that 22/ <dig>  genes showed previously uncharacterized expression in the de.
the embryonic definitive endoderm  gives rise to organs of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract including the liver, pancreas and epithelia of the lung and colon.
we generated and analyzed three longsage libraries from early de of murine embryos: early whole definitive endoderm , foregut , and hindgut .
a list of candidate genes enriched for expression in endoderm was compiled through comparisons within these three endoderm libraries and against  <dig> mouse longsage libraries generated by the mouse atlas of gene expression project encompassing multiple embryonic tissues and stages.
the high efficiency of this endoderm screen indicates that our approach can be successfully used to analyze and validate the vast amount of data obtained by the mouse atlas of gene expression project.
importantly, two genes identified, pyy and 5730521e12rik, showed exclusive de expression at early stages of endoderm patterning.
