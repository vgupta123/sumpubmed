several potentially overlapping scenarios of early-stage alzheimer pathogenesis have been discussed, with an emphasis on the protective effects of at- <dig> mediated antihypertensive response on cytoskeleton remodeling, along with neuronal activation of oncogenes, luteinizing hormone signaling and insulin-related growth regulation, forming a pleiotropic model of its early stages.
high-throughput profiling of human tissues typically yield as results the gene lists comprised of a mix of relevant molecular entities with multiple false positives that obstruct the translation of such results into mechanistic hypotheses.
from general probabilistic considerations, gene lists distilled for the mechanistically relevant components can be far more useful for subsequent experimental design or data interpretation.
the input candidate gene lists were processed into different tiers of evidence consistency established by enrichment analysis across subsets of the same experiments and across different experiments and platforms.
the cut-offs were established empirically through ontological and semantic enrichment; resultant shortened gene list was re-expanded by ingenuity pathway assistant tool.
the gene list distilled by this analytic technique and its network representation were termed compact disease model .
a flexible approach for high-throughput data analysis, the compact disease model generation, allows extraction of meaningful, mechanism-centered gene sets compatible with instant translation of the results into testable hypotheses.
the integrated analysis of this gene signature allowed us to identify the protein traffic vesicles as prominent players in the pathogenesis of alzheimerâ€™s.
