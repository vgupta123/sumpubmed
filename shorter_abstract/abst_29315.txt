in this study we explored the characteristics of novel collagen and fibrin matrices for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.
we analyzed the characteristics of newly developed hybrid collagen-i-fibrin-gels and collagen nanofibers as well as collagen sponges and opla®-scaffolds.
in contrast, common collagen sponges and opla®-scaffolds showed less cell proliferation and in collagen sponges an increased apoptosis rate was evident.
tissue engineering of vascularised skeletal muscle is a promising method for the treatment of soft tissue defects in reconstructive surgery.
significant proliferation of cultivated myoblasts was detected in collagen-i-fibrin matrices and collagen nanofibers.
collagen i-fibrin mixtures as well as collagen nanofibers yield good proliferation rates and myogenic differentiation of primary rat myoblasts in vitro in addition, parallel orientated nanofibers enable the generation of aligned cell layers and therefore represent the most promising step towards successful engineering of skeletal muscle tissue.
