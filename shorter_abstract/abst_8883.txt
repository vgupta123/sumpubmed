while these approaches are useful, they are not without drawbacks; these methods can find clusters in purely random data, and even clusters enriched for biological functions can be skewed towards a small number of processes .
an important initial step in the analysis of microarray data is clustering of genes with similar behavior.
nnn was particularly successful at generating functionally coherent clusters with high precision, and these clusters generally represented a much broader selection of biological processes than those recovered by other methods.
this method produces clusters based on overlapping cliques within an interaction network generated from mutual nearest neighborhoods.
we developed nearest neighbor networks , a graph-based algorithm to generate clusters of genes with similar expression profiles.
the nearest neighbor networks algorithm is a valuable clustering method that effectively groups genes that are likely to be functionally related.
it is particularly attractive due to its simplicity, its success in the analysis of large datasets, and its ability to span a wide range of biological functions with high precision.
