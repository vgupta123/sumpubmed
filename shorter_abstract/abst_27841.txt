we performed gene expression profiling of the amygdala and hippocampus taken from inbred mouse strains c57bl/6j and a/j.
the selected brain areas are implicated in neurobehavioral traits while these mouse strains are known to differ widely in behavior.
consequently, we hypothesized that comparing gene expression profiles for specific brain regions in these strains might provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of human neuropsychiatric traits.
we were able to identify modules of co-expressed genes that distinguish a strain or brain region.
close examination of the strain-specific gene expression profiles, however, revealed no functional relevance but a significant enrichment of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the probe sequences used for array hybridization.
we performed a whole-genome gene expression experiment and applied a systems biology approach using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.
the brain-region specific modules were found to be independent of genetic background and are therefore likely to represent biologically relevant molecular networks that can be studied to complement our knowledge about pathways in neuropsychiatric disease.
