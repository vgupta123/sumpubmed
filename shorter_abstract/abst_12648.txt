this work provides clear evidences that the genetic system based on cappelli and ofanto represents an ideal tool for the genetic dissection of the molecular response to drought and other abiotic stresses.
the cv ofanto  activated a large set of well-known drought-related genes after drought treatment, while cappelli  showed the constitutive expression of several genes induced by drought in ofanto and a modulation of a limited number of genes in response to stress.
a gene of unknown function having the greatest expression difference between the two cultivars was selected and used for expression qtl analysis, the corresponding qtl was mapped on chromosome 6b.
durum wheat often faces water scarcity and high temperatures, two events that usually occur simultaneously in the fields.
noteworthy, the heat response in cappelli involved also the up-regulation of genes belonging to fatty acid Î²-oxidation pathway, glyoxylate cycle and senescence, suggesting an early activation of senescence in this cv.
at molecular level the two cvs differed for the activation of molecular messengers, genes involved in the regulation of chromatin condensation, nuclear speckles and stomatal closure.
in ofanto the combination of drought and heat stress led to an increased number of modulated genes, exceeding the simple cumulative effects of the two single stresses, whereas in cappelli the same treatment triggered a number of differentially expressed genes lower than those altered in response to heat stress alone.
here we report on the stress responsive strategy of two durum wheat cultivars, characterized by different water use efficiency, subjected to drought, heat and a combination of both stresses.
