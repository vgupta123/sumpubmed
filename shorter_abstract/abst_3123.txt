an intense illumination of tissues expressing mem-kr affects cell viability and function in living zebrafish embryos.
as a proof-of-principle, two zebrafish transgenic lines were used to affect cell viability and function: sqkr <dig> expresses mem-kr in the hindbrain rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  and elsewhere; sqkr <dig> expresses mem-kr in the heart and elsewhere.
killerred  is a novel photosensitizer that efficiently generates reactive oxygen species  in kr-expressing cells upon intense green or white light illumination in vitro, resulting in damage to their plasma membrane and cell death.
photobleaching of kr by intense light in the heart of sqkr <dig> embryos at lower levels caused a reduction in pumping efficiency of the heart and pericardial edema and at higher levels - in cell death in the hindbrain of sqkr <dig> and in the heart of sqkr <dig> embryos.
we report an in vivo modification of this technique using a fluorescent microscope and membrane-tagged kr -expressing transgenic zebrafish.
as mem-kr accumulates on the cell membrane and/or golgi, it highlights cell bodies and extensions, and reveals details of cellular morphology.
hence, the zebrafish transgenics expressing mem-kr in a tissue-specific manner are useful tools for studying the biological effects of ros.
the photodynamic property of kr made it possible to damage cells expressing this protein in a dose-dependent manner.
