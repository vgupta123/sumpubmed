network-based approaches have recently gained considerable popularity in high- dimensional regression settings.
we measure the strength of this association using mutual information between the gene pair and the clinical outcome.
we found that the alternative outcome-guided mutual information network further improved the prediction power of the network-based cox regression.
our network edges consist of gene pairs that are significantly associated with the clinical outcome.
in this study, we demonstrate an alternative network construction method for the outcome-guided gene interaction network, and we investigate its utility in survival analysis using net-cox regression as compared with conventional networks, such as co-expression or static networks obtained from the existing knowledgebase.
the net-cox model has shown to outperform the models that do not use this network information.
we expect that a modification of the network regularization term in the net-cox model could further improve its prediction power because the properties of our network edges are not optimally reflected in its current form.
a recent approach called the network-based cox  model attempts to resolve this issue by incorporating prior gene network information into the cox regression.
for example, the cox regression model is widely used in expression analysis to predict the survival of patients.
however, as the number of genes becomes substantially larger than the number of samples, the traditional cox or l2-regularized cox models are still prone to noise and produce unreliable estimations of regression coefficients.
