there was no significant difference in the bacterial diversity between the 'uncolonised' and 'colonised' acs.
diagnostic criteria include a positive culture from the catheter tip along with blood, yet in many patients with signs of infection, current culture techniques fail to identify pathogens on catheter segments.
this suggests that vascular devices cultured conventionally and reported as non infective may at times potentially be a significant source of sepsis in critically ill patients.
we hypothesised that a molecular examination of the bacterial community on short term arterial catheters  would improve our understanding of the variety of organisms that are present in this niche environment and would help develop new methods for the diagnosis of cri.
the whole bacterial community presenting on all acs was evaluated by molecular methods, i.e., a strategy of whole community dna extraction, pcr amplification followed by cloning and 16s rdna sequence analysis.
