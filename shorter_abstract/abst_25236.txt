the t translocation is found in  <dig> to 25% of cases of childhood b-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
we compared the leukemia cell gene expression profiles of  <dig> tel/aml1-positive all patients to those of  <dig> tel/aml1-negative patients, whose blast cells did not contain any additional recurrent translocation.
gene enrichment analysis defined five enriched go categories: cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding, associated with  <dig> genes -runx <dig>  tcfl <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  cbfa2t <dig>  cd <dig>  scarb <dig>  tp53inp <dig>  acvr1c, pik3c <dig>  egfl <dig>  sema6a, ctgf, lsp <dig>  tfpi â€“ highlighting the biology of the tel/aml <dig> sub-group.
tel/aml1-positive patients are thus an interesting subgroup to study, and such studies should elucidate the biological processes underlying tel/aml <dig> pathogenesis.
gene expression analyses of leukemia cells from  <dig> children with tel/aml1-positive and -negative b-lineage all led to the identification of five biological processes, associated with  <dig> validated genes characterizing and highlighting the biology of the tel/aml1-positive all sub-group.
this rearrangement results in the fusion of etv <dig>  and runx <dig>  genes and defines a relatively uniform category, although only some patients suffer very late relapse.
these results were first confirmed by the analysis of an additional microarray data-set  and second by real-time rt-pcr quantification and clustering using an independent set .
