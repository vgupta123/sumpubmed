there are various forms of crosstalk between different pathways those genes belonging to, which would allow plants to fine-tune its defense responses.
three libraries were generated from pooled leaf tissues of chrysanthemum morifolium ‘nannongxunzhang’ that were collected at different time points with  or without  aphid infestations and mock puncture treatment , and sequenced using an illumina hiseqtm  <dig> platform.
a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained in library ck, y and z, respectively.
here, we investigate the gene expression changes in response to aphid feeding in chrysanthemum leaf by rna-seq technology.
changes in gene expression induced by aphid feeding are shown to be multifaceted.
approximately  <dig> % of the clean reads were mapped to a reference gene database including all known chrysanthemum unigene sequences.
these degs were involved in phytohormone signaling, cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species  pathway and transcription factor regulatory networks, and so on.
the molecular mechanisms of plant defense responses to aphid are only partially understood.
