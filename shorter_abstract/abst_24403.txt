immuno-fluorescence microscopy, sds-page and 2-d page of surface proteins revealed clear differences of wild-type and mutant protein patterns, which were verified by atomic force microscopy.
our data indicate that dip <dig> is predominantly involved in the organization of the outer surface protein layer rather than in the separation of the peptidoglycan cell wall of dividing bacteria.
the adhesion- and invasion-negative phenotype of corresponding mutant strains is an effect of rearrangements of the outer surface.
microscopic inspection of dip <dig> mutant strains revealed an increased size of the single cells in combination with an altered less club-like shape and formation of chains of cells rather than the typical v-like division forms or palisades of growing c. diphtheriae cells.
corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria, is well-investigated in respect to toxin production, while little is known about c. diphtheriae factors crucial for colonization of the host.
dip <dig> mutant cells were not only altered in shape and surface structure but completely lack the ability to adhere to host cells and consequently invade these.
