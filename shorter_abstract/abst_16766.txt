combined with simulation results, we provided explanations to the existence of ratio underestimation, intensity-dependence of ratio bias, and anti-correlation of ratios in dye-swap replicates.
microarray-based measurement of mrna abundance assumes a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the dye concentration.
fourth, the background intensity for the cy <dig> channel is higher than that for the cy <dig> channel.
by scanning a microarray scanner calibration slide containing known concentrations of fluorescent dyes under  <dig> pmt gains, we were able to evaluate the differences in calibration characteristics of cy <dig> and cy <dig>  first, the calibration curve for the same dye under the same pmt gain is nonlinear at both the high and low intensity ends.
second, the degree of nonlinearity of the calibration curve depends on the pmt gain.
although normalization methods improve reproducibility of microarray measurements, they appear less effective in improving accuracy.
a method of calculating ratios based on concentrations estimated from the calibration curves was proposed for correcting ratio bias.
we further demonstrated that although lowess normalization effectively eliminates the intensity-dependence of ratio bias, the systematic deviation from true ratios largely remained.
in reality, however, the calibration curve can be nonlinear.
