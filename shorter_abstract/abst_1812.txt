the degree of postcopulatory sexual selection, comprising variable degrees of sperm competition and cryptic female choice, is an important evolutionary force to influence sperm form and function.
our findings suggest that sexual selection in chinese anurans favors longer sperm when the level of sperm competition is high.
here we investigated the effects of mating system and spawning location on the evolution of sperm morphology in  <dig> species of chinese anurans.
we also examined how relative testes size as an indicator of the level of sperm competition affected variation in sperm morphology across a subset of  <dig> species.
we found a significant association of mating system and spawning location with sperm morphology.
consistent with predictions from sperm competition theory, we found a positive correlation between sperm morphology and relative testes size after taking phylogeny into account.
pre-copulatory male-male competition and spawning location, on the other hand, do not affect the evolution of sperm morphology after taking body mass and absolute testes mass into account.

however, when removing the effects of body mass or absolute testes mass for species for which such data were available, this effect became non-significant.
