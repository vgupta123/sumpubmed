furthermore, reversion rates to antibiotic sensitivity were extremely high, generally over 50%, consistent with an epigenetic inheritance mode of resistance.
we studied resistance to three different antibiotics, ampicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid, which act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis and dna synthesis, respectively.
the endogenous Î²-lactamase gene represented a cryptic gene, normally inactive, but when by chance expressed capable of providing potent ampicillin resistance.
the glutamate decarboxylase gene, in contrast, is normally expressed, but when overexpressed has the incidental capacity to give an increase in ampicillin resistance.
in this report we describe the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria mediated by the epigenetic inheritance of variant gene expression patterns.
this provides proof in principle that epigenetic inheritance, as well as dna mutation, can drive evolution.
we show that within an isogenic population there are heritable variations in gene expression patterns, providing phenotypic diversity for antibiotic selection to act on.
in each case survival rates were too high to be accounted for by spontaneous dna mutation.
we investigated the evolution of resistant e. coli when exposed to low concentrations of antibiotic.
the gene expression patterns of the antibiotic resistant e. coli were characterized with microarrays.
three categories of resistance genes were identified.
in addition, resistance levels could be ramped higher by successive exposures to increasing antibiotic concentrations.
the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a topic of major medical importance.
candidate genes, whose altered expression might confer survival, were tested by driving constitutive overexpression and determining antibiotic resistance.
evolution is the result of natural selection acting on variant phenotypes.
