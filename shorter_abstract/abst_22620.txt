we found that untreated rad26Î” cells were defective for two microtubule-dependent processes: chromosome segregation and morphogenesis.
in fission yeast, the rad <dig> pikk and its regulatory subunit rad <dig> coordinate the detection of checkpoint signals with pathway outputs.
results of over expression and epistasis experiments confirm that rad <dig> and rad <dig> define a response to microtubule destabilizing conditions.
dna structure checkpoints are conserved eukaryotic signal transduction pathways that help preserve genomic integrity.
members of the pi- <dig> kinase related kinase  family are essential elements of dna structure checkpoints.
cytoplasmic accumulation of rad26-gfp depended on rad <dig>  a 14-3- <dig> protein also required for dna structure checkpoints and morphogenesis.
interestingly, cytoplasmic accumulation of rad26-gfp occurred following treatment with microtubule destabilizing drugs, but not during treatment with the genotoxic agent phleomycin.
upon detecting checkpoint signals such as stalled replication forks or double-stranded dna breaks, these pathways coordinate appropriate stress responses.
