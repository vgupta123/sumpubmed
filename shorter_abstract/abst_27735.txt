in this study we used murine satellite cells  and their ability to differentiate into myotubes or early fat storage cells to select glycosylation related genes whose variation of expression is myogenesis specific.
according to their function, interaction networks of the products of these selected genes converged to cell fusion.
comparison with data obtained for c2c <dig> revealed that only  <dig> genes had similar expression profiles in both cell types and that  <dig> genes were specifically regulated in msc.
classification according to protein function encoded by these  <dig> genes showed that the main regulated cellular processes during this differentiation were  remodeling of the extracellular matrix, particularly, sulfated structures,  down-regulation of o-mannosyl glycan biosynthesis, and  an increase in adhesion protein expression.
a functional study was performed on itga <dig> and chst <dig> encoding two highly up-regulated proteins.
showed significant variations in expression for genes involved in pathways of glycolipid synthesis.
a population of myoblasts, known as satellite cells, is responsible for post-natal growth of muscle and for its regeneration.
results were validated statistically by without a priori clustering.
by contrast, the inactivation of itga <dig> by specific shrna dramatically decreased the fusion ability of msc.
our screening method detected  <dig> genes specific for myogenic differentiation out of the  <dig> genes studied.
these modifications are tightly regulated over time and can be characterized through the study of changes in gene expression associated with this process.
