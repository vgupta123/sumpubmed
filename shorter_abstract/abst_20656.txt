however, the taxonomic and functional assignment of the obtained sequence fragments remains a pressing problem.
existing algorithms are largely optimized for speed and coverage; in contrast, we present here a software framework that focuses on a restricted set of informative gene families, using maximum likelihood to assign these with the best possible accuracy.
we discuss how we validated our pipeline using complete genomes as well as simulated and actual environmental sequences.
this framework  uses raw nucleotide sequences as input, and includes hand-curated, extensible reference information.
