here, we describe the first arcobacter multilocus sequence typing  method for a. butzleri, a. cryaerophilus, a. skirrowii, a. cibarius and a. thereius.
additionally, this sample set contained four strains representing a new arcobacter species, a. thereius.
all arcobacter isolates typed in this study contain two glya genes, one linked to lyss  and the other linked to ada .
the seven loci used in the four-species arcobacter mlst method are the same as those employed previously in c. jejuni, c. coli, c. helveticus and c. fetus , glna, glta, glya, pgm and tkt).
glya <dig> was incorporated into the arcobacter mlst method while glya <dig> was not because it did not increase substantially the level of discrimination.
a large number of alleles were identified at each locus with the majority of isolates containing a unique sequence type.
nevertheless, the large number of identified alleles and sequence types indicate that this mlst method will prove useful in both arcobacter strain discrimination and in epidemiological studies of sporadic arcobacter-related gastroenteritis.
a sample set of  <dig> arcobacters, including  <dig> a. butzleri,  <dig> a. cryaerophilus,  <dig> a. skirrowii and  <dig> a. cibarius isolates from a wide variety of geographic locations and sources, was typed in this study.
no association of mlst alleles or sequence types with host or geographical source was observed with this sample set.
are a common contaminant of food and water, and some species, primarily a. butzleri and a. cryaerophilus, have been isolated increasingly from human diarrheal stool samples.
