the platelet-huvecs adhesion was attenuated when cells were treated with cytochalacin b. inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine led to suppression of membrane ruffles in huvecs and augmentation of platelet-endothelial adhesion.
rapamycin enhanced membrane ruffling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells  and adhesion of platelets to huvecs.
thrombus formation increased in rats that were injected with rapamycin.
in conclusion, we found that endothelial membrane remodeling induced by rapamycin is crucial for the adhesion of platelets to endothelial cells and thereby for thrombosis in vivo, and that the endothelial membrane remodeling is autophagy dependent.
the platelets were from healthy volunteers and the platelet-endothelium  adhesion in cultured endothelial cells was assessed.
membrane rufflings in endothelial cells were examined by confocal and electron microscope.
