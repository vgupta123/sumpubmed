mass mortalities caused by wssv have pronounced commercial impact on shrimp aquaculture.
here we report the discovery of an unusually large amount of sequences with high similarity to wssv in a genomic library from the jamaican bromeliad crab metopaulias depressus.
together with reanalysis of two similar cases of wssv-like sequences in penaeid shrimp genomic libraries, our data allowed comparison of gene composition and gene order between different lineages related to wssv.
furthermore, screening of published sequence databases revealed sequences with highest similarity to wssv and the newly described virus in genomic libraries of at least three further decapod species.
among these, twelve orthologs of wssv genes coding for non-structural proteins and nine genes known to code for the major components of the wssv virion were discovered.
our results shed new light on the evolution of the nimaviridae and point to a long association of this viral group with decapod crustaceans.
de novo assembly of these sequences allowed for the partial reconstruction of the genome of this endogenized virus with total length of  <dig> kbp encompassed in three scaffolds.
the white spot syndrome virus  is an important pathogen that infects a variety of decapod species and causes a highly contagious disease in penaeid shrimps.
until now wssv is the only known member of the virus family nimaviridae, a group with obscure phylogenetic affinities.

analysis of the viral sequences detected in decapods suggests that they are less a result of contemporary wssv infection, but rather originate from ancestral infection events.
