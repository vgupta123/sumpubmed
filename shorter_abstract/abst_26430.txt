we also propose a novel network model, called the two-typed, divided network.
in this paper, we describe a graph-theoretical method for in silico prediction of the cellular subsystems that are related to the expression of a target phenotype.
it has been shown via various experiments that the enumerated modules are indeed related to phenotype-expression when tested with different target phenotypes like hydrogen production, motility, aerobic respiration, and acid-tolerance.
by comparing dozens of genome-scale networks of functionally associated proteins, our method efficiently identifies those statistically significant functional modules that are in at least α networks of phenotype-expressing organisms but appear in no more than β networks of organisms that do not exhibit the target phenotype.
the new network model and the criteria make the problem tractable even while very large networks are being compared.
thus, we have proposed a methodology that can identify potential statistically significant phenotype-related functional modules.
the functional module is modeled as an -clique, where α and β are two criteria introduced in this work.
