in addition, transcript levels of genes related to gibberellins, auxin, cytokinins, abscisic acid and brassinolides were altered in response to increased or reduced gibberellins.
gibberellins may interact with other hormones to regulate carrot plant growth through crosstalk mechanisms.
the results found that ga <dig> dramatically reduced the root growth but stimulated the shoot growth of carrot.
the inhibited tuberous root growth but enhanced shoot growth in plants treated with ga <dig> can be principally attributed to the changes in the xylem development of carrot roots.
this study provided novel insights into the functions of gibberellins in the growth and development of carrot.
to investigate the effects of gibberelliins on the growth of carrot, we treated carrot plants with gibberellic acid  <dig>  or paclobutrazol .
gibberellins stimulate cell elongation and expansion during plant growth and development.
carrot is a root plant with great value and undergoes obvious alteration in organ size over the period of plant growth.
