this report describes the development of a large number of ssr and snp markers from the whole genome shotgun sequence data of b. oleracea, and the construction of a high-density genetic linkage map using a double haploid mapping population.
all the markers on the map will be transferable and could be used for the construction of other genetic maps.
in  <dig>  the b. oleracea genome sequencing project was launched using next generation sequencing technology.
the b. oleracea high-density genetic linkage map that was constructed includes  <dig>  markers in nine linkage groups spanning a total of  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci.
the map also provides useful information for positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes and traits in b. oleracea.
there were  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> snp markers on the map.
