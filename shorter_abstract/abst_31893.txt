it is emphasised that atypical scrapie, as distinct from classical scrapie, has been recognised only relatively recently and differs from classical scrapie in its clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features.
the occurrence of atypical scrapie in three sheep in  the sheep unit is reported.
two of the three sheep showed no clinical signs prior to death but all were confirmed as having atypical scrapie by immunohistochemistry and western immunoblotting.
by process of exclusion, a likely explanation for the three cases of atypical scrapie is that they arose spontaneously and were not infected from an exterior source.
it would mean that atypical scrapie is liable to occur in flocks worldwide, especially in older sheep of susceptible genotypes.
in the wake of the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy the british government established a flock of sheep from which scrapie-free animals are supplied to laboratories for research.
results of epidemiological investigations are presented and possible aetiologies of the cases are discussed.
they are kept in a purpose-built sheep unit under strict disease security and are monitored clinically and post mortem for evidence of scrapie.
most cases are detected in apparently healthy sheep by post mortem examination.
three breeds of sheep carrying a variety of different genotypes associated with scrapie susceptibility/resistance were imported in  <dig> and  <dig> from new zealand, a country regarded as free from scrapie.
