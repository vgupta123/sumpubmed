putative orthologs of plant su3- <dig> set protein sequences were retrieved from major representatives of land plants.
the structural differences among evolutionary groups of plant su3- <dig> set genes with different functions were described, contributing to the design of further experimental studies.
one or multiple retroposition events might have occurred among suvh genes with the donor genes leading to the v- <dig> orthologous group.
we also found that the majority of suvh members were intronless and formed three subclades within the suvh clade.
although there have been studies on the evolution of plant su3- <dig> set genes, a systematic evolutionary study including major land plant groups has not been reported.
a novel clustering that included most members analyzed, henceforth referred to as core su3- <dig> homologues and related  gene clade, was identified as well as all orthologous groups previously identified.
a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the plant su3- <dig> set genes was performed.
our analysis showed that plant su3- <dig> set proteins possessed a variety of domain organizations, and can be classified into five types and ten subtypes.
at least three classes of gene structures had been formed before the divergence of physcomitrella patens  from other land plants.
plant su3- <dig> set genes also exhibit a wide range of gene structures among different paralogs within a family, even in the regions encoding conserved preset and set domains.
additional domains such as sar, znf_c2h <dig> and wiyld were early integrated into primordial preset/set/postset domain organization.
