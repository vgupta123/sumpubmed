elective analysis of the effects of this drug on bronchoconstriction in viable lung tissue offers an insight into the mechanism of action of the inflammatory cascade occurring during rao which is still unclear.
in human neuroendocrinology, high levels of glucocorticoids have been proven to function via a non-genomic mechanism of membrane receptors.
this allows speculation about similar rapid non-genomic mechanisms of high-dosage inhaled glucocorticoids in the lower airways of horses.
glucocorticoids have been proven to be effective in the therapy of recurrent airway obstruction  in horses via systemic as well as local  administration.

the inhibiting effect was measured through instillation of a known mediator of inflammation and bronchoconstriction, leukotriene c <dig>  for this, the accessory lobes of  <dig> horses subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelated to the respiratory apparatus were used to obtain viable lung slices.
we aimed at electively studying the effects of the glucocorticoid beclomethasone dipropionate on equine precision-cut lung slices .
the concentration of beclomethasone used on the lung slices in our study can be considered as high.
