we validated prediction signatures for eleven out of fifteen tested drugs .
specifically, the random forest algorithm generated more precise and robust prediction signatures when compared to support vector machines and the more commonly used elastic net regression.
three large-scale pharmacogenomic studies have screened anticancer compounds in greater than  <dig> distinct human cancer cell lines.
we combined these datasets to generate and validate multi-omic predictors of drug response.
multi-omic predictors of drug response can be generated and validated for many drugs.
we compared drug response signatures built using a penalized linear regression model and two non-linear machine learning techniques, random forest and support vector machine.
the precision and robustness of each drug response signature was assessed using cross-validation across three independent datasets.
the resulting drug response signatures can be used to stratify patients into treatment groups based on their individual tumor biology, with two major benefits: speeding the process of bringing preclinical drugs to market, and the repurposing and repositioning of existing anticancer therapies.
although clinical trials remain the only way to truly measure drug toxicities and effectiveness, as a scientific community we lack the resources to clinically assess all drugs presently under development.
a challenge in precision medicine is the transformation of genomic data into knowledge that can be used to stratify patients into treatment groups based on predicted clinical response.
therefore, an effective preclinical model system that enables prediction of anticancer drug response could significantly speed the broader adoption of personalized medicine.
