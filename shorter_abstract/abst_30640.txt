in addition to truncation mutations, multiple genetic and epigenetic factors can contribute to dase, and we propose that dase is a functional index for cis-acting regulatory variants and pathogenic mutations, and that global analysis of dase in breast cancer precursor tissues can be used to identify novel causative alleles for breast cancer susceptibility.

we developed two statistical methods, snp- and gene-based approaches, which allowed us to identify a list of  <dig> candidate dase loci  by both methods.
ingenuity pathway analysis of dase loci revealed one major breast cancer-relevant interaction network, which includes two known cancer causative genes, znf <dig>  and usp <dig> , and a breast cancer causative gene, dmbt <dig> .
our study demonstrated for the first time that global dase analysis is a powerful new approach to identify breast cancer risk allele.
differential allele-specific expression  has been shown to contribute to phenotypic variables in humans and recently to the pathogenesis of cancer.
sequence analysis of a 5â€² race product of dmbt <dig> demonstrated that rs <dig>  a putative breast cancer risk locus, appears to be one of the causal variants leading to dase in dmbt <dig>
the significant mortality associated with breast cancer  suggests a need to improve current research strategies to identify new genes that predispose women to breast cancer.
we previously reported that nonsense-mediated mrna decay  could lead to dase of brca1/ <dig>  which is associated with elevated susceptibility to breast cancer.
