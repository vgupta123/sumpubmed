in contrast, attenuation of tlr <dig> responses was only observed after extensive preincubation of lipoproteins and lps.
dietary fats get absorbed by epithelial cells and processed into a range of lipoprotein particles after which they are basolaterally secreted and collected in the lymphatics.
these results demonstrate the ability of lipoproteins vldl, ldl and hdl to inhibit tlr responses towards bacterial-ligands and bacteria.
the small intestine is a specialized compartment were close interactions take place between host, microbes, food antigens and dietary fatty acids.
in contrast to the colon, the small intestine is covered only by a thin mucus coat that allows for intimate interactions between host-cells and microbes.
lipoproteins vldl, ldl and hdl were found to neutralize tlr responses towards specific tlr-ligands or a selection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
presence of lipoproteins was found to modulate the mamp-induced cytokine release by primary human monocytes measured as changes in the release of il- <dig>  tnfα, gm-csf and ifnγ.
much less attention has been given to the potential role of lipoproteins as factors contributing to the maintenance of small intestinal immune homeostasis via modulating bacteria-induced immune responses.
