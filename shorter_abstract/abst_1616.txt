instead, the transcriptome comparison between the two strains indicated that several immune system loci as well as elevated energy requirements of the resistant flies might be necessary to lever the detoxification process.
the olive fly, bactrocera oleae, is the most devastating pest of cultivated olives.
four of these loci  showed consistently higher expression both in the spinosad resistant strain and in wild flies from a resistant california population.
further functional analyses of the nine over-expressed and eleven under-expressed loci were performed.
the olive fly α6-subunit of the nachr was cloned from the laboratory sensitive strain and a spinosad selected resistant line.
mutations in the α <dig> subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  have been implicated in spinosad resistance in several species  but excluded in others .
in order to clarify the spinosad resistance mechanisms in the olive fly, we searched for mutations in the α6-subunit of the nachr and for up-regulated genes in the entire transcriptome of spinosad resistant olive flies.
the observed nucleotide differences in the nachr-α <dig> subunit between the sensitive and spinosad resistant olive fly strains did not advocate for the involvement of receptor mutations in spinosad resistance.
in recent years, the naturalyte spinosad is used against the olive fly.
yet, additional mechanisms involving enhanced metabolism of detoxification enzymes  have also been reported.
additionally, whole transcriptome analysis was performed in the two strains in order to reveal any underlying resistance mechanisms.
