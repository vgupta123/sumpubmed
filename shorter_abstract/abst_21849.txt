to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study on structure- and sequence-based predictive models of hiv- <dig> pr and rt drug resistance developed by implementing a four-body statistical potential and n-grams, respectively, to generate mutant attribute vectors.
performance of the learning methods is evaluated on the basis of tenfold cross-validation, using previously assayed and publicly available in vitro data relating mutational patterns in the targets to quantified inhibitor susceptibility changes.
in a novel application, we describe a technique for identifying every possible pair of rt inhibitors as either potentially effective together as part of a cocktail, or a combination that is to be avoided.
overall performance results are competitive with those of a previously published study utilizing a sequence-based strategy, while our structure- and sequence-based models provide orthogonal and complementary prediction methodologies, respectively.
here we implement statistical learning algorithms to develop structure- and sequence-based models for systematically predicting the effects of mutations in the pr and rt proteins on resistance to each of eight and eleven inhibitors, respectively.
successful management of chronic human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infection with a cocktail of antiretroviral medications can be negatively affected by the presence of drug resistant mutations in the viral targets.
protein mutational patterns are associated with varying degrees of resistance to their respective inhibitors, with extremes that can range from continued susceptibility to cross-resistance across all drugs.
