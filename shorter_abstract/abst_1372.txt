the diversity and global spread of the ruminant species may have required an expansion of the type i ifn locus and its constituent genes to provide broad anti-viral protection required for foraging and foregut fermentation.
ifnb and ifne define the limits of the locus, with all other type i ifn genes except ifnk distributed between these boundaries, strongly suggesting that the locus has broadened as ifn genes duplicated and then evolved into a series of distinct families.
the ifnb , represented in human and mouse by one copy, are also present as multiple copies in bos taurus.
the ifnw family is greatly expanded, comprising  <dig> potentially functional genes and at least  <dig> pseudogenes.
the type i ifn locus in bos taurus has undergone significant rearrangement and expansion compared to mouse and human, however, with the constituent genes separated into two sub-loci separated by > <dig> kb.
a new type i ifn family  of four members, one of which is a pseudogene, appears to have diverged from the ifna lineage at least  <dig> million years ago, but is absent in all other sequenced genomes with the possible exception of the horse, a non-ruminant herbivore.
in summary, we have provided the first comprehensive annotation of the type i ifn locus in bos taurus, thereby providing an insight into the functional evolution of the type i ifn in ruminants.
