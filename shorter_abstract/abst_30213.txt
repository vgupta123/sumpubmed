however, variance in female longevity was not explained by male identity, family, body size, number of previous copulations, or copulation duration.
we assessed whether males and their sons vary genetically in their ability to obtain matings and harm females, and whether more successful males were also more damaging.
in the black scavenger or dung fly sepsis cynipsea  mating reduces female survival, apparently because males wound females during copulation.
alternatively, damage may be a side-effect of male-male competition.
here we tested the hypothesis that harming females during mating is an incidental by-product of characters favoured during pre-copulatory male-male competition.
we therefore found no support for harm being a side effect of traits favoured in pre-copulatory male-male competition.
as previously reported, our results show mating is costly for female s. cynipsea.
our results indicate a heritable component of some yet unspecified male trait that influence harm and mating success.
additionally, family identity significantly influenced male copulation success.
however, there was no relationship between copulation success of fathers or sons and the mean longevity of their mates.
