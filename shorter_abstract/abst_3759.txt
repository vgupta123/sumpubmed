effective population size  is related to genetic variability and is a basic parameter in many models of population genetics.
we also analyzed two real data sets to demonstrate the behavior of the new method; a single gene hepatitis c virus data set sampled from egypt and a  <dig> locus drosophila ananassae data set representing  <dig> different populations.
the results demonstrate the essential role of multiple loci in recovering population size dynamics.
a number of methods for inferring current and past population sizes from genetic data have been developed since jfc kingman introduced the n-coalescent in  <dig>  here we present the extended bayesian skyline plot, a non-parametric bayesian markov chain monte carlo algorithm that extends a previous coalescent-based method in several ways, including the ability to analyze multiple loci.
through extensive simulations we show the accuracy and limitations of inferring population size as a function of the amount of data, including recovering information about evolutionary bottlenecks.
multi-locus data from a small number of individuals can precisely recover past bottlenecks in population size which can not be characterized by analysis of a single locus.
