non-biological experimental error routinely occurs in microarray data collected in different batches.
the proposed experimental design uses identical reference samples in each batch in every experiment.
it is often impossible to compare groups of samples from independent experiments because batch effects confound true gene expression differences.
in this report we describe a generalized empirical bayes approach to correct for cross-experimental batch effects, allowing direct comparisons of gene expression between biological groups from independent experiments.
existing methods can correct for batch effects only when samples from all biological groups are represented in every batch.
we examine the effects of non-biological variation within a single experiment and between experiments.
these reference samples are from the same tissue as the experimental samples.
this design with tissue matched reference samples allows a gene-by-gene correction to be performed using fewer arrays than currently available methods.
using this method, gene expression in the blood of patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy is shown to differ for hundreds of genes when compared to controls.
