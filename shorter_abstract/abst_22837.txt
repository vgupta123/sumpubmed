the combined results from these ko models clearly indicate that fgf <dig> plays a role in cortical cell genesis during embryonic development as well as in adulthood.
the fgf <dig> gene is expressed in the brain neuroepithelium during embryonic development and in astroglial cells throughout life.
the results demonstrate that the phenotype of two completely different fgf <dig> ko mouse lines, lacking exon  <dig> or exon  <dig>  is remarkably similar.
