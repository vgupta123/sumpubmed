in this study we show that disruption of the geraa gene in b. licheniformis mw <dig> hamper l-alanine and casein hydrolysate-triggered spore germination, measured by absorbance at  <dig> nm and confirmed by phase contrast microscopy.
these results demonstrate that the b. licheniformis mw <dig> gera locus is involved in germination induced by l-alanine and potentially other components present in casein hydrolysate.
in b. subtilis, these proteins are assumed to form a germinant receptor involved in spore germination induced by the amino acid l-alanine.
addition of d-alanine in the casein hydrolysate germination assay abolished germination of both b. licheniformis mw <dig> and the complementation mutant.
this ability was restored by complementation with a plasmid-borne copy of the gera locus.
the genome of bacillus licheniformis dsm  <dig> harbours three neighbouring open reading frames showing protein sequence similarities to the proteins encoded from the bacillus subtilis subsp.
