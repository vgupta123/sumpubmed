the variation in this distribution can be correlated to the organisms ecological niche.
this multimodal distribution is an effect of allowed combinations of the charged amino acids, and not due to evolutionary causes.
contributions to this variation maybe mapped to individual proteins by studying the variation in pi of orthologs across microorganism genomes.
the analysis of pi distribution by using orthologs provides a basis for resolution of theoretical proteome comparison at the level of individual proteins.
individual cogs conserved in both the acidic and basic regions of the trimodal distribution are identified, and orthologs that best represent the variation in levels of the acidic and basic regions are listed.
orthologs identified that significantly vary between the major acidic and basic regions maybe used as representative of the variation of the entire proteome.
theoretical proteome analysis, generated by plotting theoretical isoelectric points  against molecular masses of all proteins encoded by the genome show a multimodal distribution for pi.
pairwise analysis of pi variation show that a few cogs are conserved within, but most vary between, the acidic and basic regions of the distribution, while molecular mass is more highly conserved.
the distribution of ortholog pi values showed trimodal distributions for all prokaryotic genomes analyzed, similar to whole proteome plots.
