intracellular magnesium is abundant, highly regulated and plays an important role in biochemical functions.
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis using a specific antibody demonstrated that magt <dig> mrna and protein is increased by about  <dig> -fold and 32%, respectively, in kidney epithelial cells cultured in low magnesium media relative to normal media and in kidney cortex of mice maintained on low magnesium diets compared to those animals consuming normal diets.
transport is very specific to mg2+ as other divalent cations did not evoke currents.
large external concentrations of some cations inhibited mg2+ transport  in magt1-expressing oocytes.
based on northern analysis of mouse tissues, a  <dig>  kilobase transcript is present in many tissues.
despite the extensive evidence for unique mammalian mg2+ transporters, few proteins have been biochemically identified to date that fulfill this role.
accordingly, it is apparent that an increase in mrna levels is translated into higher protein expression.
the corresponding cdna comprises an open reading frame of  <dig> base pairs encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids.
we used this knowledge to identify a novel gene that is regulated by magnesium.
oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify a novel human gene that encodes a protein involved with mg2+-evoked transport.
we have shown that epithelial magnesium conservation is controlled, in part, by differential gene expression leading to regulation of mg2+ transport.
these studies suggest that magt <dig> may provide a selective and regulated pathway for mg2+ transport in epithelial cells.
