thus, although rtms seems a promising method for preoperative planning as well as neuropsychological research, the current protocol needs further improvement.
repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation  has been used for studying language organization in healthy volunteers and patients, and to detect cortical areas involved in language processing.
intraobserver and interobserver reliability of seven different error types were tested by two investigators.
analysis was performed blinded to the previous results and stimulated cortical sites.
overall, the results of both the interobserver and the intraobserver investigations show variable accordance.
considering the most important error type, “no response”, there is only small variability in inter- and intraobserver mapping.
with our current protocol, interobserver and intraobserver comparisons only corresponded partially.
to determine the reliability of rtms language mapping, we conducted both an interobserver and an intraobserver investigation.
