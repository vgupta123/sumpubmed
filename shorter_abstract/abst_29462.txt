phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that the primate n domains and the rodent n <dig> domains exhibit a higher degree of conservation than that observed in a comparison of the mouse n <dig> and n <dig> domains, or mouse n <dig> and n <dig> domains.
relative conservation of primate n domains and rodent n <dig> domains suggests that, despite independent gene family expansions and structural diversification, mouse and human psgs retain conserved functions.
the high non-synonymous substitution rates observed in the cfg face of the mouse n <dig> domain, within a context of overall conservation, suggests divergence of function of mouse psgs.
we analysed the evolution of the mouse psg sequences, and compared them to rat, human and baboon psgs to attempt to understand the evolution of this complex gene family.
in contrast to most primate psg n domains, rodent psg n <dig> domains do not contain an rgd tri-peptide motif, but do contain rgd-like sequences, which are not conserved in rodent n <dig> and n <dig> domains.
partial conservation of rgd and rgd-like tri-peptides in primate and rodent n and n <dig> domains, respectively, supports a role for these motifs in psg function.
rodent and primate pregnancy-specific glycoprotein  gene families have expanded independently from a common ancestor and are expressed virtually exclusively in placental trophoblasts.
