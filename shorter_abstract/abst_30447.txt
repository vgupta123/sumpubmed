all isolates were characterized to determine their genetic relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multi locus sequence typing .
dna hybridization studies suggested a chromosomal location of blactx-m- <dig>  whole genome sequencing located ctx-m- <dig> within a complete isecp- <dig> transposition unit inserted into an orf encoding for a putative membrane protein.
this is the first characterization of a chromosomal insertion of blactx-m- <dig> in klebsiella pneumonia st <dig>  a finding suggesting that in enterobacteriaceae, chromosomal locations may also act as reservoirs for the spread of blactx-m- <dig> encoding transposition units.

pcr-based analysis of the flanking regions demonstrated that insertion into this region is unique and present in all outbreak isolates.
pfge revealed three clusters  with a sub-cluster  comprising of  <dig> isolates with an identical pfge pattern.
