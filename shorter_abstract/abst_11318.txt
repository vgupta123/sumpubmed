in life science, for instance, the gene ontology is widely exploited in genomic applications and the medical subject headings is the basis of biomedical publications indexation and information retrieval process proposed by pubmed.
we illustrate the benefit of using this information retrieval system on two case studies one of which aiming at collecting human genes related to transcription factors involved in hemopoiesis pathway.
this paper describes an information retrieval system that relies on domain ontology to widen the set of relevant documents that is retrieved and that uses a graphical rendering of query results to favor user interactions.
because of the increasing number of electronic resources, designing efficient tools to retrieve and exploit them is a major challenge.
users may thus be confused by the selection and have no idea on how to adapt their queries so that the results match their expectations.
the ontology based information retrieval system described in this paper  is freely available at: http://www.ontotoolkit.mines-ales.fr/obirsclient/.
the selection of documents is displayed in a semantic map to provide graphical indications that make explicit to what extent they match the user's query; this man/machine interface favors a more interactive and iterative exploration of data corpus, by facilitating query concepts weighting and visual explanation.
