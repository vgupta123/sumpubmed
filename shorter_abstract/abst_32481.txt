however, the biological function of long ncrnas in mammalian cells remains largely unknown.
our recent expression profiling of selected human long ncrnas revealed that a majority were expressed in an organ-specific manner, suggesting their function was linked to specific physiological phenomena in each organ.
postgenomic transcriptome analyses have identified large numbers of noncoding rnas in mammalian cells.
expression profiling of  <dig> thymus-specific ncrnas in  <dig> t-cell leukemia cell lines derived from various stages of t-cell maturation revealed that hit <dig> ncrna, named thy-ncr <dig>  was specifically expressed in cell lines derived from stage iii immature t cells in which the neighbouring cd <dig> gene cluster is also specifically activated.
the thy-ncr <dig> precursor exhibited complex alternative splicing patterns and differential usage of the 5' terminus leading to the production of an estimated  <dig> isoforms, which were predominantly located in the cytoplasm.
complex alternative splicing produces multiple thy-ncr <dig> isoforms.
two major thy-ncr <dig> isoforms are cytoplasmic riboregulators that suppress the expression of mfap <dig> mrna, which is degraded by an uncharacterized hupf1-dependent pathway.
