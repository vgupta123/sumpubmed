hybridization among louisiana irises has been well established and the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation is known to affect the potential for and the directionality of introgression between taxa.
here we use co-dominant markers to identify regions where qtl are located both within and between backcross maps to compare the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and fitness traits across treatments and years.
qtl mapping was used to elucidate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation between iris fulva and iris brevicaulis.
these were used as the framework for mapping qtl associated with variation in  <dig> phenotypic traits likely responsible for reproductive isolation and fitness.
two different traits affecting reproductive isolation, flowering time and sterility, exhibit different genetic architectures, with numerous qtl across the iris genome controlling flowering time and fewer, less distributed qtl affecting sterility.
given the distribution and effect direction of qtl affecting reproductive isolation and fitness, we have predicted genomic regions where introgression may be more likely to occur  and those that are less likely to exhibit introgression .
homologous co-dominant est-ssr markers scored in two backcross populations between i. fulva and i. brevicaulis were used to generate genetic linkage maps.
in most cases, homologous qtl were not identified in both backcross populations, however, homologous qtl for flowering time, number of growth points per rhizome, number of nodes per inflorescence, and number of flowers per node were identified on several linkage groups.
qtl were dispersed throughout the genome, with the exception of one region of a single linkage group  where qtl for flowering time, sterility, and fruit production clustered.
