we present a novel methodology to normalize rna-seq data, taking into account transcript size, gc content, and sequencing depth, which are the major quantification-related biases.
second, it was well known that the higher the gc content , the more the transcripts are underestimated.
in this study, we found that transcripts shorter than 600Â bp have an underestimated expression level, while longer transcripts are even more overestimated that they are long.
third, we demonstrated that the sequencing depth impacts the size bias and proposed a correction allowing the comparison of expression levels among many samples.
the methodology presented in this article identifies and corrects different biases that influence rna-seq quantification, and provides more accurate estimations of gene expression levels.
in order to compare samples from different tissue, a calibration using several reference genes will be required.
the efficiency of our approach was then tested by comparing the correlation between normalized rna-seq data and qrt-pcr expression measurements.
