during the metabolic switch, global changes in gene expression influence the metabolic machinery of saccharopolyspora erythraea, resetting an entirely novel gene expression program.
we showed that the metabolic switch is a sophisticated mechanism of transcriptional regulation capable of resetting and re-synchronizing gene expression programs at extraordinary speed and scale.
our results, which attained close to saturating sequencing coverage of the transcriptome, revealed unanticipated transcriptional complexity with almost one third of transcriptional content originating from un-annotated sequences.
the new transcriptional program is orchestrated by a bottleneck event during which mrna levels are severely restricted by targeted mrna degradation.
consistent with other members of the actinobacterial phylum, saccharopolyspora erythraea undergo a transitional switch.
we performed rna sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes that occur during growth of saccharopolyspora erythraea in batch culture.
this switch is characterized by numerous metabolic and morphological changes.
paralogous transposon clusters, delineate these transcriptional programs.
