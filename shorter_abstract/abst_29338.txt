these features allow the integrator to take larger time steps than other methods.
systems biology models of different sizes and behaviors, the method competes well with established integrators in solving the system equations, and it outperforms them significantly when local parameter sensitivities are evaluated.
dynamic mathematical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations  play an important role in systems biology.
this applies especially to systems identification problems where the parameter sensitivities must be integrated alongside the system variables.
although several very good general purpose ode solvers exist, few of them compute the parameter sensitivities automatically.
for future applications, comparatively ‘cheap’ parameter sensitivities will enable advances in solving large, otherwise computationally expensive parameter estimation and optimization problems.
for any sufficiently complex model, the speed and accuracy of solving the odes by numerical integration is critical.
