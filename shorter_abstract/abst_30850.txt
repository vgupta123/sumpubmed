simultaneously, we also measured different body parameters like body weight, blood glucose level and cytokines profile  at each time point for all the groups.
the later were then further separated into subgroups that either received no additional treatment, or were treated with different doses of the ayurvedic formulation kal- <dig>  at different time points  eight different tissues were isolated from mice being fed on different diet compositions.
our initial experiments involved two groups of mice, one on normal diet  and the other on high-fat and high-sucrose .
these tissues were used to extract gene-expression data through microarray experiment.
using partial least square discriminant analysis  method we identified gene-expression signatures that predict physiological parameters like blood glucose levels, body weight and the balance of pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokines.
the resulting models successfully predicted diet-induced changes in body weight and blood glucose levels, although the predictive power for cytokines profiles was relatively poor.
we used the c57bl/6Â j mouse which is known as a counterpart for diet-induced human diabetes and obesity model.
in the present study we employed the murine model of diet-induced obesity to determine the early, tissue-specific, gene expression signatures that characterized progression to obesity and type  <dig> diabetes.
