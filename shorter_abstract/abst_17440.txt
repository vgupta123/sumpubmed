the method is based on selective amplification of cdna fragments generated by restriction endonucleases, electrophoretic separation of the products and comparison of the band patterns between treated samples and controls.
immobilized cdna is sequentially digested with several restriction endonucleases and the released dna fragments are collected in mutually exclusive pools.
cdna-aflp protocols described in the literatur and the new sequential digestion protocol were simulated on sets of cdna sequences from mouse, human and arabidopsis thaliana.
simulation revealed that sequential digestion of immobilized cdna followed by the partitioning of released fragments into mutually exclusive pools outperformed other cdna-aflp protocols in terms of coverage, redundancy, fragment length, and the total number of pcrs.
the redundancy and coverage, the total number of pcr reactions, and the average fragment length were calculated for each protocol and cdna set.
unequal distribution of restriction sites used to generate cdna fragments negatively affects the performance of cdna-aflp.
to investigate the performance of the protocol, software tool mecs  was written in perl.
with the goal of improving the coverage of cdna-aflp without increasing its redundancy, we designed a modified cdna-aflp protocol.
for a. thaliana, human and mice transcriptome, the use of two marking enzymes and three sequentially applied releasing enzymes for each of the marking enzymes is recommended.
