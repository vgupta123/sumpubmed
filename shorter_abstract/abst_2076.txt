we developed  <dig> sts  markers to build a physical rh  map and  <dig> genetic markers to extend the genetic map of gga <dig>  we screened a bac  library with markers for the mhc-b, mhc-y and rrna complexes.
the chicken karyotype is composed of  <dig> chromosome pairs, of which  <dig> still remain totally absent from the current genome sequence assembly, despite international efforts towards complete coverage.
besides the obvious need of full genome coverage with genetic markers for qtl  mapping and major genes identification studies, there is a major interest in the detailed study of this chromosome because it carries the two genetically independent mhc complexes b and y. in addition, gga <dig> carries the ribosomal rna  genes cluster, also known as the nor .
a region with high recombination rates and containing po <dig> repeated elements separates the two mhc complexes.
the characterisation of the recombination hotspots separating the two mhc complexes demonstrates the presence of po <dig> repetitive sequences both in tandem and inverted orientation.
