using illumina sequencing technology, we generated  <dig> million sequencing reads for meam <dig>  these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences and  <dig>  sequences were annotated with an e-value above 10- <dig>  compared with the med transcriptome, we identified  <dig>  pairs of high quality orthologous genes and inferred their sequence divergences.
over the past  <dig> years, two species of the whitefly bemisia tabaci species complex, middle east-asia minor  <dig>  and mediterranean , have both spread from their origin middle east/mediterranean to many countries despite their apparent differences in many life history parameters.
based on the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, we identified  <dig> sequences that have evolved in response to positive selection.
in this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of meam <dig> and took a comparative genomic approach to investigate the transcriptome evolution and the genetic factors underlying the differences between meam <dig> and med.
the level of sequence divergence provides additional support to the proposition that meam <dig> and med are two species.
invasive species are valuable model systems for examining the evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms associated with their specific characteristics by comparison with closely related species.
this study will provide a road map for future investigations on the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological differences.
many of those genes are predicted to be involved in metabolism and insecticide resistance which might contribute to the divergence of the two whitefly species.
