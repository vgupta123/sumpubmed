bacterial diversity was characterized using massive parallel 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing.
limited information is available about the effect of antimicrobials on small intestinal microbiota, an important contributor to gastrointestinal health.
our results illustrate the complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the challenges associated with evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and their potential interactions.
bacterial diversity resembled the pre-treatment state in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs.
tylosin was administered at  <dig> to  <dig> mg/kg q  <dig> hr for  <dig> days to five healthy dogs, each with a pre-existing jejunal fistula.
however, these changes were not associated with any short-term clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease in healthy dogs.
the proportions of enterococcus-like organisms, pasteurella spp., and dietzia spp.
increased significantly during tylosin administration .
the antibiotic tylosin is often successfully used for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in dogs, but its exact mode of action and its effect on the intestinal microbiota remain unknown.
recent studies have shown that the fecal microbiota is generally resilient to short-term antibiotic administration, but some bacterial taxa may remain depressed for several months.
several bacterial groups considered to be sensitive to tylosin increased in their proportions.
several bacterial taxa such as spirochaetes, streptomycetaceae, and prevotellaceae failed to recover at day  <dig> .
on day  <dig>  the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day  <dig> in only  <dig> of  <dig> dogs.
microbial populations were phylogenetically more similar during tylosin treatment.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tylosin on canine jejunal microbiota.
tylosin may lead to prolonged effects on the composition and diversity of jejunal microbiota.
pyrosequencing revealed a previously unrecognized species richness in the canine small intestine.
the proportion of escherichia coli-like organisms increased by day  <dig> .
