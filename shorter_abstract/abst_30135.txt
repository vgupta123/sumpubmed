with its mutualistic photorhabdus luminescens bacteria, h. bacteriophora invades multiple species of insects, which it kills and exploits as a food source for the development of several nematode generations.
the ability to culture the life cycle of h. bacteriophora on plates growing the bacterial symbiont makes it a very exciting model of parasitic infection that can be used to unlock the molecular events occurring during infection of a host that are inaccessible using vertebrate hosts.
to profile the transcriptional response of an infective nematode during the early stage of infection, we performed next generation rna sequencing on h. bacteriophora ijs incubated in manduca sexta hemolymph plasma for 9Â h. a subset of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were validated using qrt-pcr.
a significant proportion of these genes are unique to parasitic nematodes, suggesting the identification of a group of parasitism factors within nematodes.
future studies using these candidates may provide functional insight into the process of nematode parasitism and also the molecular evolution of parasitism within nematodes.
a subset of degs is conserved across clade v parasitic nematodes revealing an array of candidate parasitic genes.
comparative analysis of the transcriptome with untreated controls found a number of differentially expressed genes  which cover a number of different functional categories.
our analysis reveals transcriptional changes in the regulation of a large number of genes, most of which have not been shown previously to play a role in the process of infection.
a limiting factor has been the obligate requirement for a vertebrate host which has hindered investigation of the parasitic nematode infective process.
