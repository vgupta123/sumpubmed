in this paper we provide a comparative study of four of these methods: fisher's exact test, gene set enrichment analysis , random-sets , and gene list analysis with prediction accuracy .
we then validate the other three methods on seven real data sets with known genetic perturbations and then compare the methods on two cancer data sets where our a priori knowledge is limited.
our analysis highlights the deep difference existing between associative and predictive methods for detecting enrichment and the use of both to better interpret results of pathway analysis.
we first compare all four methods on simulated data sets to verify that fisher's exact test is markedly worse than the other three approaches.
the three methods considered in our study recover relevant gene sets known to be deregulated in the experimental conditions and pathologies analyzed.
the first three methods use associative statistics, while the fourth uses predictive statistics.
the simulation study highlights that none of the three method outperforms all others consistently.
glapa is more conservative and large differences between the two phenotypes are required to allow the method to detect differential deregulation in gene sets.
this was reflected in the analysis on real data sets as gsea and rs were seen to be significant for particular gene sets while glapa was not, suggesting a small effect size.
more importantly, the rankings of the three methods share significant overlap.
a variety of methods have been developed for assessing the enrichment of sets of genes with respect to differential expression.
