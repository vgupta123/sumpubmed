three major classes of corrections have been proposed to correct the dependent nature of genetic data in bonferroni adjustments: permutation testing and related alternatives, principal components analysis , and analysis of blocks of ld across the genome.
a bonferroni correction using the number of ld blocks found by the three algorithms implemented by haploview resulted in an insufficiently conservative threshold, corresponding to a genome-wide significance level of α =  <dig>  -  <dig> .
bonferroni adjustments can be made but are conservative due to the preponderance of linkage disequilibrium  between genetic markers, and permutation testing is not always a viable option.
correcting for the number of ld blocks resulted in an anti-conservative bonferroni adjustment.
we observed a moderate increase in power when using presto, slide, and simpleℳ when compared with traditional bonferroni methods for population data genotyped on the affymetrix  <dig>  platform in european americans .
slide and simpleℳ are particularly useful when using a statistical test not handled in optimized permutation testing packages, and genome-wide corrected p-values using slide, are much easier to interpret for consumers of gwas studies.
as we enter an era when testing millions of snps in a single gene association study will become the standard, consideration of multiple comparisons is an essential part of determining statistical significance.
