the timing of events in organogenesis of diverse character complexes in all body regions is not uniform across amniotes and can be analysed using a parsimony-based method.
although embryology has played a major role in morphological studies of vertebrate phylogeny, data on developmental timing have never been examined to explore and test the alternative phylogenetic hypotheses.
a basal position of turtles to the living saurian clades is clearly supported by timing of organogenesis data.
the clear signal of a basal position of turtles provided by heterochronic data implies significant convergence in either molecular, adult morphological or developmental timing characters, as only one of the alternative solutions to the phylogenetic conundrum can be right.
three main hypotheses of living sister-groups of turtles have resulted from them: all reptiles, crocodiles + birds or squamates + tuatara.
the phylogenetic position of turtles is the most disputed aspect in the reconstruction of the land vertebrate tree of life.
changes in the relative timing of particular events diagnose many clades of amniotes and include a phylogenetic signal.
