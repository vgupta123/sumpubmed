mce <dig> is one of the four virulence-related mce operons of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
the mce3r promoter activity in the presence of mce3r was significantly reduced compared with that in the absence of the regulator, during the in vitro culture of m. tuberculosis.
in a previous work we showed that the overexpression of mce3r in mycobacterium smegmatis and m. tuberculosis abolishes the expression of lacz fused to the mce <dig> promoter, indicating that mce3r represses mce <dig> transcription.
we obtained a knockout mutant strain of m. tuberculosis h37rv by inserting a hygromycin cassette into the mce3r gene.
the mutation results in a significant increase in the expression of mce <dig> genes either in vitro or in a murine cell macrophages line as it was determined using promoter-lacz fusions in m. tuberculosis.
mce3r repress the transcription of mce <dig> operon and self regulates its own expression but does not affect the transcription of mce <dig>  mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons of m. tuberculosis.
