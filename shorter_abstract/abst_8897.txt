however, we also find pathways that are enriched in multiple modules, which could provide important information about the hierarchical organization of the system.
it is generally acknowledged that a functional understanding of a biological system can only be obtained by an understanding of the collective of molecular interactions in form of biological networks.
we study these module prediction methods for simulated benchmark networks as well as  <dig> biological protein interaction networks .
a particular focus of our analysis is placed on the biological meaning of the predicted modules by utilizing the gene ontology  database as gold standard for the definition of biological processes.
overall, our study reveals that there is a large heterogeneity among the different module prediction algorithms if one zooms-in the biological level of biological processes in the form of go terms and all methods are severely affected by a slight perturbation of the networks.

furthermore, we investigate the robustness of the results by perturbing the pins simulating in this way our incomplete knowledge of protein networks.
on a mesoscopic level of protein networks, modules are of significant importance because these building blocks may be the next elementary functional level above individual proteins allowing to gain insight into fundamental organizational principles of biological cells.
protein networks are one particular network type of special importance, because proteins form the functional base units of every biological cell.
