we have characterized the faecal microbiota of  <dig> guinea pigs using illumina shotgun metagenomics, and used this data to compile a gene catalogue of its prevalent microbiota.
guinea pig  is an important model for human intestinal research.
subsequently, we compared the guinea pig microbiome to existing human gut metagenome data from the metahit project.
we found that the bacterial richness obtained for human samples was lower than for guinea pig samples.
for example, the guinea pig contained considerably more of the mucin-degrading akkermansia, as well as of the methanogenic archaea methanobrevibacter than found in humans.
most microbiome functional categories were less abundant in guinea pigs than in humans.
exceptions included functional categories possibly reflecting dehydration/rehydration stress in the guinea pig intestine.
the results lay the foundation for future gastrointestinal research applying guinea pigs as models for humans.
the intestinal microbiotas of both species were dominated by the two phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes, but at genus level, the majority of identified genera  were differently abundant in the two hosts.
