we have demonstrated that the cgcn and its corresponding regulons provides rich information for experimental biologists to design experiments, interpret experimental results, and develop novel hypothesis on gene function in this poorly annotated genome.
four unknown hub genes were identified in modules highly enriched for go terms related to leukocyte activation , rna processing , nucleic acid metabolic process  and organic-acid metabolic process .
such highly connected genes should be investigated more closely as they likely to have key regulatory roles.
moreover, gene co-expression networks using “guilt-by-association” principle have been used to predict the potential function of  <dig> genes with no functional annotation.
for example, modules with important biological functions such as response to virus, response to bacteria, energy metabolism, cell signaling and cell cycle have been identified.
based on the assumption that genes with similar patterns of expression across a vast array of tissues and experimental conditions are likely to encode proteins with related functions or participate within a given pathway, we constructed a genome-wide cattle gene co-expression network  using  <dig> microarray datasets that contained a total of  <dig> affymetrix genechip bovine genome arrays that were retrieved from either ncbi geo or ebi arrayexpress.
all of the identified modules showed strong functional enrichment for gene ontology  terms and reactome pathways.
seven years after sequencing the cattle genome, there are still genes that have limited annotation and the function of many genes are still not understood, or partly understood at best.
