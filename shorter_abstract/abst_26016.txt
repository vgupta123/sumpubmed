we enriched the e-bp from placental nuclear extracts using dna-affinity dynabeads and showed by western blot analysis and supershift emsa experiments that the e-bp is composed of the transcription factors upstream stimulating factor   <dig> and usf <dig>  depletion of the usfs by rnai and expression of a dominant-negative usf mutant, were both associated with a significant decrease in p <dig> -dependent reporter gene expression.
our recent studies of p <dig>  in vitro and in a human trophoblast cell line  revealed that interactions of placental nuclear protein with the e-box element at position - <dig> are required for full promoter activity.
the aim of this work was to identify and characterise the placental e-box -binding protein  as a step towards understanding how the expression of cyp <dig> is regulated in the bovine placenta.
from these results we conclude that usf <dig> and usf <dig> are activators of the bovine placenta-specific promoter p <dig>  and thus act in the opposite mode as in the case of the non-orthologous human placenta-specific promoter.
furthermore, scatter plot analysis of p <dig>  activity vs. usf binding to the e-box revealed a strong positive correlation between the two parameters.
