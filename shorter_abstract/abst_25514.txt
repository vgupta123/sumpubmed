the present study evaluated the potential use of chlorin e <dig> â€“ polyvinylpyrrolidone  as a multimodality photosensitizer for fluorescence detection and photodynamic therapy  on nsclc and sclc xenografts.
little is known about the comparative efficacy of pdt in treating non-small cell lung carcinoma  and small cell lung carcinoma , despite ongoing clinical trials treating lung cancers.
human nsclc  and sclc  tumor cell lines were used to establish tumor xenografts in the chick chorioallantoic membrane  model as well as in the balb/c nude mice.
irradiation at  <dig> h drug-light interval showed greater tumor necrosis against human nsclc xenografts in nude mice.
photodynamic therapy  is an effective local cancer treatment that involves light activation of a photosensitizer, resulting in oxygen-dependent, free radical-mediated cell death.
sclc xenografts were observed to express resistance to photosensitization with ce6-pvp.
in the cam model, ce6-pvp was applied topically  and fluorescence intensity was charted at various time points.
