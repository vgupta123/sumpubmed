we demonstrate that differential footprinting is associated with differential gene expression and can be used to define cell types by their specific tf occupancy patterns.
while dnase-seq data can provide global snapshots of tf binding, tools for detecting differential binding from pairs of dnase-seq data sets are lacking.
the analysis of differential gene expression is a fundamental tool to relate gene regulation with specific biological processes.
differential binding of transcription factors  can drive differential gene expression.
