the mads-box transcription factor srfa is required for several stages of development, including slug migration and spore terminal differentiation.
subtractive hybridization allowed the isolation of a gene, sign , that was dependent on the transcription factor srfa for expression at the slug stage of development.
this morphogenetic process requires the differential regulation of a large number of genes and is coordinated by extracellular signals.
all these genes have a similar structure, composed of a first exon containing a  <dig> nucleotides long open reading frame and a second exon comprising the remaining of the putative coding region.
the  <dig> most similar genes are grouped in two regions of chromosome  <dig> and have been named group <dig> and group <dig> sign genes.
two groups of very similar genes from this family have been shown to be specifically expressed in prestalk cells during development.
homology searches detected the existence of a large family of sign-related genes in the dictyostelium discoideum genome.
the addition of antibodies raised against sign group  <dig> proteins induced disintegration of multi-cellular structures at the mound stage of development.
a large family of genes coding for small proteins has been identified in d. discoideum.
analyses of their promoter regions indicate that these genes are expressed in the prestalk region of developing structures.
