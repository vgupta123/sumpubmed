both the binding to risc members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5’-isomir- <dig> compared with mir- <dig>  for some targets, both mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mrna levels.
although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of mir- <dig> variants and predicted mrna targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for mir-101- and 5’-isomir- <dig>
the analysis of small rna sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5’-isomir- <dig> is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain.
although isomirs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive.
high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature mirnas .
these results suggest that isomirs are functional variants and further indicate that for a given mirna, the different isomirs may contribute to the overall effect as quantitative and qualitative fine-tuners of gene expression.
micrornas  are short non-coding regulatory rnas that control gene expression usually producing translational repression and gene silencing.
