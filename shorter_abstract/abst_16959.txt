geographic distribution of the genetic diversity in domestic animals, particularly mitochondrial dna, has often been used to infer centers of domestication.
breeds originating in northern europe are characterized by having a high frequency of mtdna sequences belonging to a haplogroup rare in other populations .
this has been suggested to indicate a possible origin of the haplogroup  in central or northern europe.
the sequences observed in the ancient samples do not include the haplogroup indicative for northern european breeds .
we studied this hypothesis by analyzing  <dig> mtdna sequences in ancient scandinavian dogs.
we find no evidence for local domestication.
