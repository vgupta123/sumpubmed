these results show that nonparametric methods are slightly better in the test cases we study, although the choice of test statistic may often be dependent on the specific phenotype and haplotype structure being studied.
application of these methods requires careful consideration of algorithmic choices based on both theoretical and practical factors.
finding the genetic causes of quantitative traits is a complex and difficult task.
the use of inbred strains of mice for qtl mapping has many advantages over traditional methods.
we describe a detailed comparative analysis of variations on our marker association method.
recently, we reported the application of a haplotype association mapping method which utilizes dense genotyping data across a diverse panel of inbred mouse strains and a marker association algorithm that is independent of any specific phenotype.
we also report our initial application of this method to phenotypes cataloged in the mouse phenome database.
the use of multi-snp windows to infer local haplotype structure is critical to the use of a diverse panel of inbred strains for qtl mapping.
in particular, we describe the use of inferred haplotypes from adjacent snps, parametric and nonparametric statistics, and control of multiple testing error.
however, there are also limitations in comparison to the traditional linkage analysis from f <dig> and ri lines.
as the availability of genotyping data grows in size and density, analysis of these haplotype association mapping methods should be of increasing value to the statistical genetics community.
our findings suggest general guidelines, though a complete evaluation of these methods can only be performed as more genetic data in complex diseases becomes available.
