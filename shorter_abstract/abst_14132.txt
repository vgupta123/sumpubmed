pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, with a range of well-established information including genome annotation.
unexpectedly, we found that duf <dig> pfam is remarkably similar to pfam family duf <dig> suggesting that the sequence-based classification alone may not be sufficient to classify proteins into pfam families.
pfam has two large series of functionally uncharacterized families, known as domains of unknown function  and uncharacterized protein families .
crystal structures of two proteins from deinococcus radiodurans and streptomyces coelicolor belonging to pfam protein family duf <dig>  have been determined using selenium-single-wavelength anomalous dispersion .
