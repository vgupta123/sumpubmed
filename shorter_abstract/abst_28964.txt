treatment with tp compounds also alleviated cholesterol accumulation and restored clathrin-independent endocytosis in hd neurons.
in the present study, we aimed to determine whether tp compounds could prevent aggregation and restore early cellular defects in primary embryonic striatal neurons from animal model representing hd.
previously, we demonstrated that tricyclic pyrone  compounds efficiently inhibited formation of amyloid-Î²  aggregates in cell and mouse models representing alzheimer's disease .
however, recent studies have identified early cellular dysfunctions that preclude aggregate formation.
we have found that tp compounds not only blocked mhtt-induced aggregation, but also alleviated early cellular dysfunctions that preclude aggregate formation.
tp compounds effectively inhibit aggregation caused by mhtt in neurons and glial cells.
