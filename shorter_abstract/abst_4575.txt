one of the genes cloned from the subtraction was homologous to solanum tuberosum mbf <dig>  encoding the coactivator multiprotein bridging factor  <dig>  here, we have characterized this stmbf <dig> homolog  from capsicum annuum and investigated its role in abiotic stress tolerance.
on the other hand, seed germination, cotyledon greening and lateral root formation were more severely influenced by salt stress in transgenic lines compared with wild-type plants, indicating that cambf1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants were hypersensitive to salt stress.
overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis displayed reduced tolerance to cold and high salt stress during seed germination and post-germination stages.
tissue expression profile analysis using quantitative rt-pcr showed that cambf <dig> was expressed in all tested tissues, and high-level expression was detected in the flowers and seeds.
the pepper fruit is the second most consumed vegetable worldwide.
the expression of cambf <dig> in pepper seedlings was dramatically suppressed by exogenously supplied salicylic acid, high salt, osmotic and heavy metal stresses.
to identify cold-related genes regulated by abscisic acid  in pepper seedlings, cdna representational difference analysis was previously performed using a suppression subtractive hybridization method.
cambf <dig> may be useful for genetic engineering of novel pepper cultivars in the future.
constitutive overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis aggravated the visible symptoms of leaf damage and the electrolyte leakage of cell damage caused by cold stress in seedlings.
however, low temperature affects the vegetative development and reproduction of the pepper, resulting in economic losses.
cambf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis may reduce stress tolerance by downregulating stress-responsive genes to aggravate the leaf damage caused by cold stress.
furthermore, the expression of rd29a, erd <dig>  kin <dig>  and rd <dig> in the transgenic plants was lower than that in the wild-type plants.
