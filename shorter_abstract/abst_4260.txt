after the new assembly process, using wgm as scaffolder, we detected a large inversion with size bigger than one-half of genome.
the new assembly of c. pseudotuberculosis was deposited in genbank under the accession no.
in addition, the improving of techniques for construction of high accuracy genomic maps, for example, whole-genome mapping  , have allow high-resolution assembly that can detect large rearrangements.
a specific analysis using blast and nr database shows that the inversion occurs between two homology rna ribosomal regions.
the sequencing was performed using the platform ion pgm and fragment library .
cp <dig> was the first strain of this species sequenced in brazil, and its genome has been used as model for several studies in silico of caseous lymphadenitis disease.
in conclusion, the results showed by wgm could be used to detect mismatches in assemblies, providing genomic maps with high resolution and allow assemblies with more accuracy and completeness.
a restriction map was constructed, using the technique of wgm with the enzyme kpni.
