ncpa further decreased the frequency of synaptic inputs to neurons in island preparations and lowered the input resistance of inspiratory neurons, even when chemical communication between neurons and other cells was impeded.
the a1r agonist n6-cyclopentyladenosine  reduced population burst frequency in slices by ca.
this study examined mechanisms linking a1r activation to depression of prebötc rhythmogenesis in medullary slice and island preparations from neonatal mice.
converting slices to island preparations decreased synaptic input to inspiratory neurons.
converting medullary slices to islands by cutting away much of the medullary tissue adjacent to the prebötc decreased the amplitude of action potential bursts generated by a population of neurons within the prebötc , without noticeably affecting burst frequency.
activation of adenosine a <dig> receptors  depresses prebötc rhythmogenesis.
together these data support the suggestion that depression of prebötc activity by a1r activation involves both decreased neuronal excitability and diminished inter-neuronal communication.
as in normal  artificial cerebrospinal fluid , ncpa decreased burst frequency in slices when gabaaergic or gabaaergic and glycinergic transmission were blocked, and in islands when gabaaergic transmission was antagonized.
although it remains unclear whether a1r activation is important for organisms in a normal metabolic state, a1r activation is important to the response of the prebötc to metabolic stress, such as hypoxia.
