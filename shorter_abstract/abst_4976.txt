this malfunction may relate to demonstrated hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex , including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
in contrast to controls, patients did not demonstrate a normal post-error slowing  phenomenon.
for this pilot study, ten ocd patients and  <dig> aged-matched healthy controls completed modified versions of the eriksen flanker task before and after one session of deep 1 hz rtms  over the mpfc .
ocd patients received nine additional sessions of daily rtms to assess their clinical response.
when subjects were asked to report their errors, ocd patients were able to report fewer of their errors than the control group.
simultaneous improvement of ocd symptoms by this method might suggest a correlation between error monitoring impairment and ocd pathophysiology.
in this study, we measured aspects of error monitoring in individuals with ocd and administered deep low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  in an attempt to modulate error monitoring capacity.

some theories suggest that repetitive thoughts and behaviours in obsessive compulsive disorder  are driven by malfunctioning error monitoring.
