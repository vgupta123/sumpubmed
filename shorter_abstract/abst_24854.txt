stem also supports efficient and statistically rigorous biological interpretations of short time series data through its integration with the gene ontology.
the unique algorithms stem implements to cluster and compare short time series gene expression data combined with its visualization capabilities and integration with the gene ontology should make stem useful in the analysis of data from a significant portion of all microarray studies.
due to the cost of microarray experiments, and also in some cases the limited availability of biological material, about 80% of microarray time series experiments are short .
we introduce the short time-series expression miner  the first software program specifically designed for the analysis of short time series microarray gene expression data.
stem implements unique methods to cluster, compare, and visualize such data.
time series microarray experiments are widely used to study dynamical biological processes.
