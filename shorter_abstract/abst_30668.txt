this study provides first experimental evidence for the existence of short non-coding rnas in marine microalgae.
the latter were also present in e. huxleyi.
to discover the presence and regulation of short non-coding rnas  in these two important phytoplankton groups, we sequenced short rna transcriptomes of two diatom species  and validated them by northern blots along with the coccolithophore emiliania huxleyi.
despite an exhaustive search, we did not find canonical mirnas in diatoms.
our data suggest that canonical mirnas are absent from diatoms.
however, the group of trna-derived srnas seems to be very prominent in diatoms and coccolithophores and maybe used for acclimation to environmental conditions.
marine phytoplankton are responsible for 50% of the co <dig> that is fixed annually worldwide and contribute massively to other biogeochemical cycles in the oceans.
