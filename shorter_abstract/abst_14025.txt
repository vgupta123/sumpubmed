variation in flic was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified.
flic sequences were obtained for more than  <dig> strains comprising  <dig> different h <dig> alleles.
flic sequencing of  <dig> strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those exhibiting "g" or "m,t" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse group.
