we show that il1β amplifies antimicrobial peptide production in odontoblasts in vitro 100-fold more than lipopolysaccharide, in a manner matching subsequent in vivo measurements.
our data suggest that odl amplifies bacterial signals dramatically by self-feedback cytokine-chemokine signal-receptor cycling, and signal convergence through il1r <dig> and possibly others, to increase defensive capacity including antimicrobial peptide production to protect the tooth and contain the battle against carious bacteria within the dentin.
interleukins, chemokines, and all tested receptors thereof were differentially up-regulated in odl of carious teeth, well over one hundred-fold for  <dig> of  <dig> genes.
by interrogating reconstructed protein interaction networks corresponding to the differentially up-regulated genes, we develop the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cytokines highly expressed in odl of carious teeth, il-1β, il-1α, and tnf-α, carry the converged inflammatory signal.
immunologic responses of the tooth to caries begin with odontoblasts recognizing carious bacteria.
the present study aims to determine cytokine gene expression profiles generated within human teeth in response to dental caries in vivo and to build a mechanistic model of these responses and the downstream signaling network.
we demonstrate profound differential up-regulation of inflammatory genes in the odontoblast layer  in human teeth with caries in vivo, while the pulp remains largely unchanged.
