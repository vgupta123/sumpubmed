furthermore, there is an obvious interplay between donor age and cell passage that in the future must be accounted for when developing cell-based therapies for clinical use.
chondrogenic and osteogenic potential decreased with age for each group, and adipogenic differentiation decreased only in cells from the oldest donors.
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  are a widely researched adult stem cell population capable of differentiation into various lineages.
because many promising applications of tissue engineering require cell expansion following harvest and involve the treatment of diseases and conditions found in an aging population, the effect of donor age and ex vivo handling must be understood in order to develop clinical techniques and therapeutics based on these cells.
significant decreases in differentiation potentials due to passage were observed as well for osteogenesis of bmscs from the youngest donors and chondrogenesis of the cells from the oldest donors.
