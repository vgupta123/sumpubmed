we have investigated the expression patterns of five alternative first exons of the cd <dig> gene in several human tissues and cell types, to better understand the molecular details behind its regulation.
the alternative transcripts are all expressed in more than one human tissue and their expression patterns vary highly in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, adipose tissue, placenta, spinal cord, cerebrum and monocytes.
tissue-specific expression patterns of the alternative first exons of cd <dig> suggest that the alternative first exons of the gene are regulated individually and tissue specifically.
it is expressed in many tissues and cell types, with a tissue specific expression pattern that is a result of a complex regulation for which the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood.
the molecular mechanisms regulating cd <dig> thus appear to be unusually complex, which might reflect the multifunctional role of the gene in different tissues and cellular conditions.
the alternative promoters lack tata-boxes and cpg islands.
the upstream region of exon 1b contains several features common for house keeping gene and monocyte specific gene promoters.
cd <dig> is a membrane glycoprotein involved in a variety of cellular processes such as lipid transport, immune regulation, hemostasis, adhesion, angiogenesis and atherosclerosis.
at the same time, the fact that all first exons are upregulated in thp- <dig> macrophages in response to oxidized low density lipoproteins may suggest that the alternative first exons are coregulated in this cell type and environmental condition.
