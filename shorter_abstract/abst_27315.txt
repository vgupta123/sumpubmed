this gene loss has been accompanied either by deletion of the respective dna region or replacement with non-coding dna that is at rich in composition.
it represents a new model system to study molecular adaptations of genome evolution that accompany a switch from free-living to intracellular existence.
our analyses suggest highly specific targeting/loss of individual genes during the process of genome reduction and establishment of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont inside a eukaryotic cell.
to investigate the genome modifications that have accompanied the process of endosymbiosis, here we compare gene structure, content and organisation in spheroid body and cyanobacterial genomes.
spheroid bodies are of cyanobacterial origin and exhibit features that suggest physiological adaptation to their intracellular life style.
this association is the first example of an obligate cyanobacterial symbiosis involving nitrogen fixation for which genomic data are available.
in addition, genome modifications have led to the fusion and truncation of genes.
we also report that in the spheroid body's genome there is an accumulation of deleterious mutations in genes for cell wall biosynthesis and processes controlled by transposases.
recently, we have helped to characterise an intracellular nitrogen fixing bacterium, the so-called spheroid body, located within the diatom rhopalodia gibba.
our findings confirm, at the genome level, earlier speculation on the obligate intracellular status of the spheroid body in rhopalodia gibba.
comparison of the spheroid body's genome sequence with corresponding regions of near free-living relatives indicates that multiple modifications have occurred in the endosymbiont's genome.
interestingly, the formation of pseudogenes in the spheroid body has occurred in the presence of intact, and presumably functional, reca and recf genes.
