this method was then used for downstream profiling of plasma mirnas found in archived samples from one nonhuman primate  experimentally challenged with ebola virus by the aerosol route.
here, we developed an optimized protocol for mirna extraction from plasma samples by evaluating five different rna extraction kits, trizol phase separation, purification additives, and initial plasma sample volume.
using this optimized protocol, mirnas from archived plasma samples of one rhesus macaque challenged with aerosolized ebola virus was profiled using a targeted real-time pcr array.
a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> unique mirnas assayed were present in the plasma samples at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  post-exposure.
specifically, we optimized an extraction protocol for mirnas from trizol-inactivated plasma samples that can be used for highly pathogenic viruses.
this study contributes to the knowledgebase of circulating mirna extraction methods and expands on the potential applications of cell-free mirna profiling for diagnostics and pathogenesis studies.
these experiments showed that 50 μl plasma processed using the qiagen mirneasy mini kit with 5 μg of glycogen as a co-precipitant yielded the highest recovery of endogenous mirnas.
comparison of real-time rt-pcr results for spiked-in and endogenous mirna sequences determined extraction efficiencies from five different rna purification kits.
