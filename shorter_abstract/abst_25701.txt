the assay simultaneously detected five genes, namely 16s rrna of the staphylococcus genus, fema of s. aureus, meca that encodes methicillin resistance, luks that encodes production of panton-valentine leukocidin , a necrotizing cytotoxin, and one internal control.
the present study focused on the development of a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid detection of mrsa.
the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the pentaplex pcr assay was evaluated by comparing it with the conventional method.
the analytical sensitivity of the pentaplex pcr at the dna level was found to be  <dig> ng dna.
the analytical specificity was evaluated with  <dig> reference staphylococci and non-staphylococcal strains and was found to be 100%.
staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, especially methicillin-resistant s. aureus , which causes a wide range of hospital and community-acquired infections worldwide.
the pentaplex pcr assay developed was rapid and gave results within  <dig> h, which is essential for the identification of staphylococcus spp., virulence and their resistance to methicillin.
the presence of an internal control in the pentaplex pcr assay is important to exclude false-negative cases.
our pcr assay may be used as an effective surveillance tool to survey the prevalence of mrsa and pvl-producing strains in hospitals and the community.
