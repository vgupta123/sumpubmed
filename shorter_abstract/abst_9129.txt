we have developed an online system that efficiently identifies polymorphic strs and provides novel distinguishable str biomarkers for different levels of specificity.
in addition, we analyzed str variations for highly conserved homologous genes and human-unique genes.
in total  <dig> polymorphic strs were identified from  <dig> human-unique genes, among which  <dig> strs were retrieved and clustered into three different groups for efficient comparison.
high-throughput next generation sequencers have fostered new cutting-edge computing techniques for genome-scale analyses, and cross-genome comparisons have facilitated the efficient identification of polymorphic str markers for various applications.
assembled contigs from next generation sequencing data were aligned and calibrated according to selected reference sequences.
candidate polymorphic strs within a personal genome could be easily retrieved and compared to the constructed str profile through query keywords, gene names, or assembled contigs.
short tandem repeats  are abundant in human genomes.
to verify identified polymorphic strs, human genomes from the  <dig> genomes project were employed for comprehensive analyses, and str markers from the combined dna index system  and disease-related str motifs were also applied as cases for evaluation.
an automated and efficient system for detecting human polymorphic strs at the genome scale is proposed in this study.
