this sophisticated biotrophic parasite infiltrates wheat leaves and develops infection structures inside host cells, appropriating nutrients while suppressing the plant defense response.
some predicted srna precursors possess a microrna-like stem-loop secondary structure; others originate from much longer inverted repeats containing gene sequences.
development in most eukaryotes is regulated by small rna molecules, and the success of host-induced gene silencing technology in puccinia spp.
however, some fungi lack this capability, and small rnas have not yet been reported in rust fungi.
the objective of this study was to determine whether p. striiformis carries an endogenous small rna repertoire.
we extracted small rna from rust-infected wheat flag leaves and performed high-throughput sequencing.
this work provides an inventory of small rnas endogenous to an important plant pathogen, enabling further exploration of gene regulation on both sides of the host/parasite interaction.
we conclude that small rnas are likely to play a role in regulating the complex developmental processes involved in stripe rust pathogenicity.

precise post-transcriptional processing and high accumulation of specific srna sequences were observed.
predicted fungal target genes were enriched for kinases and small secreted proteins, while the list of wheat targets included homologs of known plant resistance genes.
sequencing and bioinformatics results were verified by rt-pcr.
fungal-specific reads were identified by mapping to the p. striiformis draft genome and removing reads present in uninfected control libraries.
like other rnai-equipped fungi, p. striiformis produces large numbers of 20–22 nt sequences with a preference for uracil at the 5′ position.
