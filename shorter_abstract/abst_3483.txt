ftsec spheroids contain central cores of hyaline matrix surrounded by mono- or multi-layer epithelial sheets.
this was also reflected in the reduced proliferative indices observed in 3d spheroids stained for the proliferation marker mib <dig>  comparisons with gene expression profiles of fresh fallopian tube tissues revealed that 2d ftsec cultures clustered with follicular phase tubal epithelium, whereas 3d ftsec cultures clustered with luteal phase samples.
pathways significantly under-represented in 3d ftsec cultures were associated with cell cycle progression and dna replication.
however, there are relatively few in vitro models of this tissue type available for use in studies of ftsec biology and malignant transformation.
we have established and characterized 3d spheroid culture models of primary ftsecs.
fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells  have been implicated as a cell-of-origin for high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer.
this 3d model of fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells will advance our ability to study the underlying biology and etiology of fallopian tube tissues and the pathogenesis of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer.

gene expression profiling identified more than a thousand differentially expressed genes between 3d and 2d cultures of the same ftsec lines.
