results of lls, pcv <dig> viremia and adwg support the test product’s efficacy in the face of strong maternally derived pcv <dig> immunity.
the study aimed to assess the efficacy of a novel combination vaccine , against pcv <dig> and m. hyo natural infection , in the presence of strong maternally derived pcv <dig> immunity , under field conditions.
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  and porcine circovirus type  <dig>  are major pathogens that cause significant health problems in swine worldwide.

maternal derived immunity  has been suggested as a significant immediate defence factor for newborn piglets and may interfere with piglet’s vaccination-induced immunity.
the study was performed according to a controlled, randomized and blinded design in a greek swine unit with enzootic pneumonia  and subclinical pcv <dig> infection.
vaccination significantly reduced the severity of lung lesions at slaughter  .
furthermore, 25 g higher average daily weight gain  was observed during the finishing phase  and 18 g greater adwg overall .
in total,  <dig> healthy three-week-old suckling piglets were allocated randomly, either to treatment  or control group .
