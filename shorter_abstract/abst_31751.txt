we have developed a relational web-accessible database with comprehensive query options integrating all experimental data.
by using this systematic approach, we have prioritised genes in linkage regions of xq28-mapped diseases to an amenable number for mutational screens.
over  <dig> of approximately  <dig> x-linked diseases map to this region, and systematic mapping, transcript identification, and mutation analysis has led to the identification of causative genes for  <dig> of these diseases, leaving another  <dig> diseases mapped to xq <dig>  where the causative gene is still unknown.
to expedite disease gene identification, we have initiated the functional characterisation of all known xq <dig> genes.
by using a systematic approach, we describe the xq <dig> genes by rna in situ hybridisation and northern blotting of the mouse orthologs, as well as subcellular localisation and data mining of the human genes.
well known for its gene density and the large number of mapped diseases, the human sub-chromosomal region xq <dig> has long been a focus of genome research.
using this database, we matched gene expression patterns with affected tissues for  <dig> of the  <dig> remaining xq <dig> linked diseases, where the causative gene is unknown.
