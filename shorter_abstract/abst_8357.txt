it extends previous approaches in that it can handle multiple labels which naturally appear in the context of protein function.
explicit modeling of multilabels significantly improves the capability of learning protein function from multiple kernels.
we develop a probabilistic model for combining kernel matrices to predict the function of proteins.
the performance and the interpretability of the inference model are further improved by simultaneously predicting the subcellular localization of proteins and by combining pairwise classifiers to consistent class membership estimates.
learning of functional categories gains from co-prediction of subcellular localization.
