cytoplasmic male sterility , a common phenotype in higher plants, is closely associated with rearrangements in mitochondrial dna , and is widely used to produce f <dig> hybrid seeds in a variety of valuable crop species.
plant mitochondria, semiautonomous organelles that function as manufacturers of cellular atp, have their own genome that has a slow rate of evolution and rapid rearrangement.
a comparative analysis of the mtdna of several angiosperms, including those from ks <dig>  km <dig>  rice, maize, arabidopsis thaliana, and rapeseed, showed that non-coding sequences of higher plants had mostly divergent multiple reorganizations during the mtdna evolution of higher plants.
comparative analysis of several angiosperm mtdnas indicated that non-coding sequences are the most frequently reorganized during mtdna evolution in higher plants.
in the present work, we describe the mitochondrial genome of a wheat k-type cms line and compare it with its maintainer line.
compared to our previously published sequence of a k-type maintainer line, km <dig>  we detected ks3-specific mtdna  and repeats  as well as genes that are unique to each line: rpl <dig> was missing in ks <dig> and trnh was absent from km <dig>  we also defined  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> protein-coding, albeit functionally irrelevant, genes, and predicted  <dig> unique orfs in ks <dig>  representing potential candidates for k-type cms.
the complete mitochondrial genome of the wheat k-type cms line ks <dig> is very different from that of its maintainer line km <dig>  especially in non-coding sequences.
the complete mtdna sequence of a wheat k-type  cms line, ks <dig>  was assembled into a master circle  molecule of  <dig>  bp and found to harbor  <dig> known protein-coding genes, three rrnas , and  <dig> different trnas.
all these sequence variations are candidates for involvement in cms.
