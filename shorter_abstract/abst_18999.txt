systematic errors could be identified at time-points where the median percent deviation exceeded a threshold value, determined by the choice of smoothing model and the number of observed trends.
while the concentration trends of individual metabolites can be modeled with common curve fitting techniques, a more accurate representation of the data needs to consider effects that act on more than one metabolite in a given sample.
both the simulation framework and error correction method represent examples of time-course analysis that can be applied to further developments in 1h-nmr methodology and the more general application of quantitative metabolomics.
to detect systematic errors, a nonparametric fit was applied to each trend and percent deviations calculated at every timepoint.
although we focus on nuclear magnetic resonance  analysis in the context of cell culture, a number of possible extensions are discussed.

the resulting shapes were then scaled to simulated compound concentrations.
trend shapes were simulated from generic functions corresponding to each classification.
finally, the scaled trends were perturbed using a combination of random and systematic errors.
the presented algorithm was able to identify systematic errors as small as  <dig>  % under a wide range of conditions.
