we find that, while the regulatory networks driven by dichaete and soxneuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance.
we also examined the presence of sox motifs within binding intervals and the correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation.
in drosophila melanogaster, the two group b sox proteins dichaete and soxneuro show widespread common binding across the genome.
nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites.
while some instances of functional compensation have been observed in drosophila, the function of common binding and the extent of its evolutionary conservation is not known.
group b sox proteins are a highly conserved group of transcription factors that act extensively to coordinate nervous system development in higher metazoans while showing both co-expression and functional redundancy across a broad group of taxa.
through a quantitative comparison of dichaete binding, we evaluated the rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites.
our analysis provides insights into the evolution of group b sox function, highlighting the specific conservation of shared binding sites and suggesting alternative sources of neofunctionalisation between paralogous family members.
