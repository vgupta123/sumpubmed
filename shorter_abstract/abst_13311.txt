a greedy search algorithm, based on the generalized dirichlet distribution, is carried out over the feature space to search for the set of “grouping variables” that best discriminate between known group structures in the data, modelling the compositional variables using beta distributions.
statistical classification methods are used to test the ability of the selected features to differentiate between known groups in the data.
compositional data are subject to a constant-sum constraint, which restricts the sample space to a simplex.
cfs is a feature selection method, while recursive partitioning is a learning tree algorithm that has been used for feature selection in the past.
the proposed feature selection method performs well for both glycan chromatography datasets.
high-throughput hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography  technology for glycan analysis allows for the detailed quantification of the glycan content in human serum.
it is computationally slower, but results in a lower misclassification rate and a higher sensitivity rate than both correlation-based feature selection and the classification tree method.
statistical analysis of glycan chromatography datasets should account for their unusual mathematical properties.
the principal objective is to provide a template for the analysis of glycan chromatography data that may be used to identify potential glycan biomarkers.
the algorithm is applied to two glycan chromatography datasets.
as the volume of glycan hilic data being produced increases, there is a considerable need for a framework to support appropriate statistical analysis.
