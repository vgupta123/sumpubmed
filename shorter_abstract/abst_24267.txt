we undertook a differential display polymerase chain reaction  screen to identify genes with distinct expression patterns between dorsal and ventral regions of the chick midbrain in order to identify genes which regulate the sculpturing of such divergent neuronal organisation.
we identified  <dig> differentially expressed bands in our initial screen.
however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that establish these different structural arrangements are not well understood.
we focused on the dv axis of the early chick midbrain since mesencephalic alar plate and basal plate develop into laminae and nuclei, respectively.
our phylogenetic analysis of qr <dig> shows that it is the chick orthologue of sparc-like 1/hevin/mast <dig> gene in mice, rats, dogs and humans, a protein involved in cell adhesion.
during the development of the central nervous system , patterning processes along the dorsoventral  axis of the neural tube generate different neuronal subtypes.
additionally, we verified differential levels of expression of a selected number of genes by using reverse transcriptase  pcr method with gene-specific primers.
twenty-six of these could be assigned to specific genes and we could unambiguously show the differential expression of five of the isolated cdnas in vivo by in situ mrna expression analysis.
early in development ventral and dorsal regions are similar in size and structure.
