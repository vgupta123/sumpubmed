kutzneria albida is one of the eight known members of the genus.
kutzneria albida genome sequencing and analysis allow a deeper understanding of evolution of this genus of pseudonocardiaceae, provide new insight in the phylogeny of the genus, as well as decipher the hidden secondary metabolic potential of these rare actinobacteria.
to explore the biosynthetic potential of kutzneria albida to its full extent, the complete genome was sequenced.
kutzneria albida is the first species of the genus kutzneria with a completely sequenced genome.
moreover, the genome revealed  <dig> additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, suggesting a huge biosynthetic potential, which makes kutzneria albida a very rich source of natural products.
comparison of the kutzneria albida genome to genomes of other actinobacteria clearly shows its close relations with pseudonocardiaceae in line with the taxonomic position of the genus.
genome analysis revealed  <dig> gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways.
two large genomic islands were identified, containing regions most enriched with secondary metabolism gene clusters.
kutzneria is a representative of a rarely observed genus of the family pseudonocardiaceae.
large parts of this secondary metabolism “clustome” are dedicated to siderophores production.
