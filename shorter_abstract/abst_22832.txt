immunoreactivity also occurs in discretely localized glial structures.
at all ages examined, psa-ncam occurs in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, solitary nuclear complex, vestibular and cochlear nuclei, reticular formation nuclei, and most of the precerebellar nuclei.
immunohistochemical staining for psa-ncam occurs in tg and several brainstem regions during prenatal life and in adulthood.
the results obtained show that, in man, the expression of psa-ncam in selective populations of central and peripheral neurons occurs not only during prenatal life, but also in adulthood.
in specimens of different age, the distribution pattern remains fairly steady, whereas the density of immunoreactive structures and the staining intensity may change and are usually higher in newborn than in adult specimens.
in particular, the localization of psa-ncam in tg primary sensory neurons likely to be involved in the transmission of protopathic stimuli suggests the possible participation of this molecule in the processing of the relevant sensory neurotransmission.
in the adult tissue, positive neurons are mostly small- and medium-sized, and amount to about 6% of the total ganglionic population.
in the brainstem, psa-ncam is mainly distributed at the level of the medulla oblongata and pons and appears scarce in the mesencephalon.
with the aim of providing information relevant to the potential for dynamic changes of specific neuronal populations in man, this study analyses the immunohistochemical occurrence of psa-ncam in the human trigeminal ganglion  and brainstem neuronal populations at prenatal and adult age.
in the tg, psa-ncam is localized to neuronal perikarya, nerve fibres, pericellular networks, and satellite and schwann cells; further, cytoplasmic perikaryal staining and positive pericellular fibre networks are detectable with higher frequency in adult than in newborn tissue.
as a general rule, it appears as a surface staining suggestive of membrane labelling on neuronal perikarya and proximal processes, and as filamentous and dot-like elements in the neuropil.
