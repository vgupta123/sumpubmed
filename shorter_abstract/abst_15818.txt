whole genome sequencing of bisulfite converted dna  method provides comprehensive information of dna methylation.
we also show that dna methylation levels of adjacent cpg sites are correlated, and this similarity in local dna methylation levels extends several kilobases.
taking these observations into account, we propose a new method based on bayesian classification to infer dna methylation status while considering the neighborhood dna methylation levels of a specific site.

we demonstrate that the number of sequence reads per position from methylc-seq data displays a large variance and can be modeled as a shifted negative binomial distribution.
this method should be widely applicable to the analyses of methylc-seq data from diverse sparsely methylated genomes.
we show that our approach has higher sensitivity and better classification performance than the binomial method via multiple analyses, including computational simulations, area under curve  analyses, and improved consistencies across biological replicates.
a widely used current method for this purpose, the so-called binomial method, is intuitive and straightforward, but lacks power when the sequence coverage and the genome-wide methylation level are low.
our method improves the existing binomial method for binary methylation calls by utilizing a posterior odds framework and incorporating local methylation information.
an important application of these whole genome methylation maps is classifying each position as a methylated versus non-methylated nucleotide.
