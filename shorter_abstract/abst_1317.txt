ipcs were significantly less frequent in the patients with crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis .
within the intestinal immune system, b cells produce physiologically natural antibodies but pathologically atypical anti-neutrophil antibodies  are frequently observed in patients with ibd.
it can therefore be inferred that the gut contains an alternative population of b cells that have a regulatory function.
the ipcs in small intestinal, colonic and rectal biopsy specimens of patients with ibd were analysed by means of immunofluorescence using polyclonal rabbit anti-human ig and goat anti-human igm.
the objective is to investigate the localisation of immunoglobulin-producing cells  in samples of inflamed intestinal tissue taken from patients with ibd, and their possible relationship with clinical features.
two different patterns of b lymphocyte infiltrates were found in the intestinal tissue: one was characterised by a strong to moderate stromal localisation of small igm+/cd79+/cd20-/cd21-/cd23-/cd5± ipcs ; in the other  no such small ipcs were detected in stromal or epithelial tissues.
inflammatory bowel disease  is thought to be due to an abnormal interaction between the host immune system and commensal microflora.
