comparative genomic analysis of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> identified strain specific genes.
citrus bacterial canker is a disease that has severe economic impact on citrus industries worldwide and is caused by a few species and pathotypes of xanthomonas.
numerous genes with differential expression in xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> were identified.
virulence genes including genes encoding t3ss components and effectors are induced in xvm <dig> medium.
our study indicated that avrgf <dig> contributes to the host range limitation of xcaw <dig> whereas xopaf contributes to virulence.
citri strain  <dig>  is a type a  strain with a wide host range, whereas its variant x. citri subsp.
to characterize the mechanism for the differences in host range of xcca and xcaw, the genome of xcaw <dig> that was completed recently was compared with xcca <dig> genome.
mutation analysis of xopaf indicates that the gene contributes to xcaw growth in mexican lime but does not contribute to the limited host range of xcaw.
this study provided the foundation to further characterize the mechanisms for virulence and host range of pathotypes of x. citri subsp.
citri strain aw <dig>  is restricted to mexican lime.
transcriptome analyses of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> presented insights into the expression of the two closely related strains of x. citri subsp.
among the  <dig>  common genes of xcaw <dig> compared to xcca <dig>   <dig> genes in nb and  <dig> genes in xvm <dig> conditions were differentially regulated.
xcaw <dig> showed higher protease activity than xcca <dig> whereas xcaw <dig> showed lower pectate lyase activity in comparison to xcca <dig>
two hundred ninety two and  <dig> genes showed differential expression in xvm <dig> compared to in nb for xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig>  respectively.
