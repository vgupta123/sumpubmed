in the present study we use microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing  to analyze closely related c. jejuni isolates from chicken and human infection.
campylobacter jejuni is widespread in the environment and is the major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans.
in this study we demonstrated the utility of 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays for genotyping of campylobacter jejuni isolates, with resolution outperforming mlst.
all methods show that there is no inherit difference between isolates infecting humans and chicken, suggesting a common underlying population of c. jejuni.
