the trisialoganglioside  is one of the major brain gangliosides and acts as an endogenous regulator in the brain.
our data provide novel evidence that a akt/gsk-3β/tau-dependent, but not caspase- <dig> signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in gt1b-mediated neurotoxic actions on mesencephalic da neurons.
moreover, a gsk-3β specific inhibitor, l803-mt, attenuated tau phosphorylation and rescued da neurons from cell death in mesencephalic cultures.
interestingly, while gt1b enhanced caspase- <dig> activity, devd, a caspase- <dig> inhibitor, failed to rescue da neuronal death.
gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids exist in mammalian cell membranes particularly neuronal membranes.
we further investigate the underlying mechanisms of gt1b neurotoxicity.
consistent with earlier findings, gt1b attenuated the da neuron number and dopamine uptake level in mesencephalic cultures.
