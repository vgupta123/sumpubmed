in the laboratory, the drosophila melanogaster heat shock protein hsp <dig> can buffer the phenotypic effects of genetic variation.
mutant flies were also significantly less fecund and shorter-lived than wild-type flies, as well as less well buffered against cryptic deleterious variation, as we show through inbreeding experiments.
we here study naturally occurring mutations in hsp <dig>  and their effects on fitness and phenotypic buffering in flies derived from wild populations.
our work shows that hsp <dig>  a regulator of the stress response and of signaling, helps buffer deleterious variation in fruit flies derived from wild population, and that its buffering role becomes even more important under heat stress.
in competition experiments, mutant flies performed much more poorly than wild-type flies.
specifically, in hsp <dig> mutant flies female fecundity dropped to much lower levels after inbreeding than in wild-type flies.
the insertions we observed occur at low population frequencies, and reduce hsp <dig> gene expression.
laboratory experiments either manipulate hsp <dig> activity pharmacologically, or they induce mutations with strong effects in the gene hsp <dig>  the single-copy fly gene encoding hsp <dig>  it is unknown whether observations from such laboratory experiments are relevant in the wild.
