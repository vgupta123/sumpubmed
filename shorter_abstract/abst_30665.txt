seventy-two 1-day-old male hy-line chickens were divided into a control group, a low arsenic trioxide -treated  group, a middle as2o3-treated  group, and a high as2o3-treated  group.
the results showed that after being treated with as2o <dig>  the levels of inflammatory-related factor nf-κb and pro-inflammatory cytokines in chicken brain tissues increased .

the protein expression of inos was detected by western blot.
the heavy metal arsenic is widely distributed in nature and posses a serious threat to organism’s health.
the mrna levels of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κb  and of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including inducible no synthase , cyclooxygenase- <dig> , and prostaglandin e synthase , in chicken brain tissues  on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were measured by real-time pcr.
however, little is known about the arsenic-induced inflammatory response in the brain tissues of birds and the relationship and mechanism of the inflammatory response.

the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of dietary arsenic on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the brains of gallus gallus.
arsenic exposure caused obvious ultrastructural changes.
arsenic exposure in the chickens triggered host defence and induced an inflammatory response by regulating the expression of inflammatory-related genes in the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem and myelencephalon.
