four nuclear genes and two chloroplast regions were sequenced in  <dig> individuals of these three eriobotrya taxa from two locations where they coexist.
daduheensis,  <dig> showed nucleotide additivity of e. japonica and e. prinoides in at least one nuclear gene, and  <dig> of them harboured nucleotide additivity at all the four nuclear genes.

it occurs fairly common in the genera of the subtribe pyrinae.
most hybrid individuals are later-generation hybrids.
both e. japonica and e. prinoides can serve as female parent.
in the two chloroplast regions,  <dig> and  <dig> individuals were identical with e. japonica and e. prinoides, respectively.
differential adaptation might maintain the species boundary of e. prinoides and e. japonica in the face of hybridization and potential introgression.
interspecific hybridization has long been recognized as a pivotal process in plant evolution and speciation.
a few fixed nucleotide substitutions or gaps were found in each of the investigated nuclear and chloroplast loci between e. japonica and e. prinoides.
daduheensis has been recognized as either a variety of e. prinoides, a natural hybrid between e. prinoides and e. japonica, or a variety of e. japonica.
daduheensis were also shared with those of e. japonica and e. prinoides.
in eriobotrya, a small tree genus of pyrinae, e. prinoides var.
of the  <dig> individuals of e. prinoides var.
most haplotypes of e. prinoides var.
our study provides compelling evidence for a hybrid status for e. prinoides var.
