the aim of the study was to describe the repeatability of identification of abdominal structures in normal horses using a detailed ultrasonographic examination technique and using a focused, limited preparation technique.
liver, spleen, caecum, duodenum and other small intestine were identified more frequently with the detailed examination.
small intestine was most frequently identified in the ventral abdomen, its identification varied markedly within and between horses, and required repeated examinations in some horses.
multiple imaging sites and repeated examinations may be required to identify small intestine.
sacculated colon was identified in all ventral sites, and was infrequently identified in dorsal sites.
a detailed abdominal ultrasound examination was performed in five normal horses, repeated on five occasions .
there were some normal variations which should be considered when interpreting ultrasonographic findings in clinical cases: left kidney was not always identified, sacculated colon was occasionally identified in dorsal flank sites.
large colon and right kidney were identified in 100% of examinations with both techniques.
ultrasonography is an important diagnostic tool in the investigation of abdominal disease in the horse.
caecum, sacculated large intestine, spleen, liver and right kidney were consistently identified with both techniques.
five imaging sites were then selected for a single focused ultrasound examination in  <dig> normal horses.
caecum, colon, spleen, liver and right kidney were repeatably identified using the detailed technique, and had defined locations.
