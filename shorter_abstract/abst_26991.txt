web-based est analysis tools are proving to be the most convenient option for biologists when performing their analysis, so these tools must continuously improve on their utility to keep in step with the growing needs of research communities.
we have developed a web-based est analysis pipeline called estpiper, which streamlines typical large-scale est analysis components.
estpiper streamlines the typical process of est analysis.
extensive documentation of estpiper's functionality is embedded throughout the web site to facilitate understanding of the required input and interpretation of the computational results.
the user can also download intermediate results and port files to separate programs for further analysis.
a web server hosting estpiper is provided at  to now support projects of all size.
effectively, generating est data is no longer a bottleneck for investigators.
however, processing large amounts of est data remains a non-trivial challenge for many.
the intuitive web interface guides users through each step of base calling, data cleaning, assembly, genome alignment, annotation, analysis of gene ontology , and microarray oligonucleotide probe design.
