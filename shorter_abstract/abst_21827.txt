lowmaca is a software for the identification of gain-of-function mutations in putative oncogenic families, increasing the amount of information on functional domains and their possible role in cancer.
nevertheless, the mutational landscape of many tumor types is heterogeneous and encompasses a long tail of potential driver genes that are systematically excluded by currently available methods due to the low frequency of their mutations.
in this context lowmaca emphasizes the role of genes mutated at low frequency otherwise undetectable by classical single gene analysis.
lowmaca is an r package available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/lowmaca.html.
furthermore, we applied the same concept to a list of known and candidate driver genes, and observed that low confidence genes show similar patterns of mutation compared to high confidence genes of the same protein family.
we developed lowmaca , a method that combines the mutations of various proteins sharing the same functional domains to identify conserved residues that harbor clustered mutations in multiple sequence alignments.
we analyzed the ras superfamily exploiting the known driver mutations of the trio k-n-hras, identifying new putative driver mutations and genes belonging to less known members of the rho, rab and rheb subfamilies.
