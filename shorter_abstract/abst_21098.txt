npa tolerance of txr1- <dig> and ixr1- <dig> was further supported by electrophysiological analysis of net h+ fluxes in the mature, but not elongation zone of roots.
ta inhibits cellulose biosynthesis in expanding plant tissues and is essential for disease induction.
we also show that npa inhibitory response in roots occurs in the mature root zone but not the elongation zone.
auxin treatment of various plant tissues has been repeatedly demonstrated to inhibit ta toxicity and to reduce common scab.

however, all mutants had significantly enhanced tolerance to 1-napthylphthalamic acid , another auxin efflux transport inhibitor, which blocks polar auxin transport at a site distinct from tiba.
three cbi resistant a. thaliana mutants; txr1- <dig> , ixr1- <dig>  and kor <dig> , showed no altered root growth response to treatment with natural or synthetic auxins, nor with the auxin efflux transport inhibitor  <dig> ,5-triiodobenzoic acid .
this work utilises arabidopsis thaliana mutants with resistance to cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors  to investigate the interaction between ta, other cbis and auxins.
