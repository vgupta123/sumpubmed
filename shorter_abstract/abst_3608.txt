we develop a heuristic solution that aims to find mfasts in sets of many, large phylogenetic trees.
overall, this method provides a simple and fast way to identify strongly supported subtrees within large phylogenetic hypotheses.
in the first phase, it identifies small candidate subtrees from the set of input trees which serve as the seeds of larger subtrees.
its performance is robust to the number and size of the input trees.
although this heuristic does not guarantee to find all mfasts or the largest mfast, it found the mfast in all of our synthetic datasets where we could verify the correctness of the result.
in the second phase, it combines these small seeds to build larger candidate mfasts.
we demonstrate that this heuristic can easily handle data sets with  <dig> taxa, greatly extending the estimation of mfasts beyond current methods.
in the final phase, it performs a post-processing step that ensures that we find a frequent agreement subtree that is not contained in a larger frequent agreement subtree.
we consider the problem of finding the maximum frequent agreement subtrees  in a collection of phylogenetic trees.
our method works in multiple phases.
