the first atlantic cod  genome assembly published in  <dig> was one of the early genome assemblies exclusively based on high-throughput  <dig> pyrosequencing.
by combining data from illumina,  <dig> and the longer pacbio sequencing technologies, as well as integrating the results of multiple assembly programs, we have created a substantially improved version of the atlantic cod genome assembly.
indeed, retrospective analyses reveal that gaps in the first genome assembly were largely associated with these trs.
the inclusion of pacbio reads combined with the use of multiple assembly programs drastically improved the atlantic cod genome assembly by successfully resolving long trs.
the high frequency of heterozygous trs within or in the vicinity of genes in the genome indicate a considerable standing genomic variation in atlantic cod populations, which is likely of evolutionary importance.
the sequence contiguity of this assembly is increased fifty-fold and the proportion of gap-bases has been reduced fifteen-fold.
we show that 21% of the trs across the assembly, 19% in the promoter regions and 12% in the coding sequences are heterozygous in the sequenced individual.
since then, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have led to a multitude of assemblies generated for complex genomes, although many of these are of a fragmented nature with a significant fraction of bases in gaps.
compared to other vertebrates, the assembly contains an unusual high density of tandem repeats .
