in this paper we show how a comprehensive, integrated and automated workbench for genotype and phenotype integration can facilitate and improve the hypothesis generation process underlying modern genetic studies.
we present the design and architecture of the phenotype miner, a software system able to flexibly manage phenotypic information, and its extended functionalities to retrieve genotype information from external repositories and to relate it to phenotypic data.
linking genotypic and phenotypic information is one of the greatest challenges of current genetics research.
