gpc differs greatly among barley genotypes and is also variable across different environments.
in this study,  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley genotypes were used for a genome-wide association study  and a multi-platform candidate gene-based association analysis, in order to identify the molecular markers associated with gpc.
the gwas and candidate gene based-association study may be effectively used to determine the genetic variation of gpc in barley.
tibetan wild barley had higher gpc than cultivated barley.

the significant correlation between gpc and diastatic power , and malt extract confirmed the importance of gpc in determining malt quality.
the dart markers and the polymorphism of hvnam genes identified in this study are useful in developing high quality barley cultivars in the future.
there was a significant correlation between haplotypes of hvnam <dig>  hvnam <dig> and gpc in barley.
grain protein content  is an important quality determinant for barley used as malt, feed as well as food.
it is imperative to understand the genetic control of barley gpc and identify the genotypes with less variation under the different environments.
diversity arrays technology  markers associated with barley gpc were detected by gwas.
hvnam genes could play a role in controlling barley gpc.
in addition, gwas revealed two hvnam genes as the candidate genes controlling gpc.
