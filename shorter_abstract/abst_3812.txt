however, the substrate specificity of the nsds and the molecular mechanism of histones h <dig> and h <dig> recognition and methylation have not yet been established.
in this study, we quantified in vitro mono-, di- and tri- methylations on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> by the carboxyl terminal domain  of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig> and nsd <dig>  using histone as substrate.
the nsd family of hmtases comprised of three members  are oncogenes aberrantly expressed in several cancers, suggesting their potential to serve as novel therapeutic targets.
herein, we investigated the in vitro mechanisms of histones h <dig> and h <dig> recognition and modifications by the catalytic domain of nsd family members.
histone lysine methylation has a pivotal role in regulating the chromatin.
next, we used a molecular modelling approach and docked 6-mer peptides h3k <dig> a.a. 1-7; h3k <dig> a.a. 5-11; h3k <dig> a.a. 23-29; h3k <dig> a.a. 32-38; h3k <dig> a.a. 75-81; h4k <dig> a.a. 16- <dig> with the catalytic domain of the nsds to provide insight into lysine-marks recognition and methylation on histones h <dig> and h <dig>
we discuss the relevance of our findings for the development of nsd inhibitors amenable for novel chemotherapies.
