target gene response in gli1-/-2-/- imefs was severely reduced while gli2-/-3-/- imefs were incapable of ligand-induced transcriptional response.
this study provides fundamental characterizations of the transcriptional and non-transcriptional hh responsiveness of a battery of gli-null imefs.
however, we found that both gli1-/-2-/- and gli2-/-3-/- imefs exhibited robust leukotriene synthesis-dependent migration responses to hh ligand, demonstrating that this response is not transcriptionally-dependent.
we previously characterized the individual and cooperative roles of the gli proteins in hh target gene regulation using a battery of primary embryonic fibroblasts from gli null mice.
moving forward, these cell lines should prove a valuable tool set to study the unique functional regulation of the gli proteins in a hh-responsive cell-type.
here, we describe the establishment of spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast  cell lines lacking single and multiple gli genes.
these non-clonal cell lines recapitulate the unique ligand mediated transcriptional response of primary mefs.
