class xi myosins are related to animal and fungal myosin class v that are responsible for movement of particular vesicles and organelles.
little information is available concerning the remaining  <dig> class xi myosins.
myosins are molecular motors that carry cargo on actin filaments in eukaryotic cells.
although comparable constructs lacking the motor domain result in a dominant negative effect on organelle motility in animal systems, the plant organelles remained motile.
chimeric genes incorporating tail regions of myosin xi- <dig> , myosin xi- <dig> , myosin xi- <dig> , myosin xi- <dig> , myosin xi- <dig>  and myosin xi- <dig>  were expressed transiently.
tail cropping experiments demonstrated that the coiled-coil region was required for specific localization and shorter tail regions were inadequate for targeting.
<dig> myosin xi tails, extending from the coiled-coil region to the c-terminus, label specific vesicles and/or organelles when transiently expressed as yfp fusions in plant cells.
seventeen myosin genes have been identified in the nuclear genome of arabidopsis.
the myosin genes can be divided into two plant-specific subfamilies, class viii with four members and class xi with  <dig> members.
cdnas corresponding to the tail region of  <dig> myosin genes were generated and incorporated into a vector to encode yfp-myosin tail fusion proteins lacking the motor domain.
despite the absence of a motor domain, the fluorescently-labeled organelles were motile in most cells.
none of the  <dig> yfp-myosin tail fusions interacted with chloroplasts, and only one yfp-tail fusion appeared to sometimes co-localize with fluorescent proteins targeted to golgi and mitochondria.
