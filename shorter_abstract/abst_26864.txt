the presence of a local inversion  of one pair of the duplicated c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci and a previously described dinucleotide tandem repeat locus  has been located within an intron of the sk12vl gene.
the central, or class iii, region of the major histocompatibility complex  is an important gene rich sub-region of the mhc of mammals and contains many loci implicated in disease processes and potential productivity traits.
as a prelude to identifying mhc loci associated with productivity traits in sheep, we have used bac and cosmid libraries of genomic dna to generate a physical map of the sheep mhc class iii region.
twenty eight sheep genes were identified in  <dig> bac clones which spanned approximately  <dig> kbp of a chromosomal region adjacent to the class i region of the sheep mhc and which therefore covers most, if not all, of the class iii of the sheep mhc.
cosmid mapping permitted a more detailed mapping of the complement genes present in the class iii and showed a local inversion  of one pair of the duplicated complement c <dig> and cyp <dig> loci.
this report provides a physical map covering â‰ˆ <dig> kbp of the class iii of the sheep mhc together with a snp panel which will facilitate disease and productivity association studies.
the relative positions of  <dig> of these genes was established as well as two additional groups of genes for which the intragroup order was not known.
