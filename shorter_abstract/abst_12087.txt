our results demonstrate that the dynamic array is an excellent genotyping system for medium-throughput multiplexing , which is simple to use and combines rapid throughput with excellent call rates, high concordance and low cost.
there is a need for systems allowing medium multiplexing  with high throughput, which can efficiently and cost-effectively generate genotypes for a very large sample set .
we demonstrate the use of a nanofluidic integrated fluidic circuit  - based genotyping system for medium-throughput multiplexing known as the dynamic array, by genotyping  <dig> individual human dna samples on  <dig> different snp assays, using nanoliter volumes of reagents.
the experimental set up is very simple, with a time-to-result for each sample of about  <dig> hours.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  have emerged as the genetic marker of choice for mapping disease loci and candidate gene association studies, because of their high density and relatively even distribution in the human genomes.
this is also important for those who work on high throughput genotyping in non-model systems where off-the-shelf assays are not available and a flexible platform is needed.
