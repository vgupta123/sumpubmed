consequently, the mobile fraction of many of the new genomes has not been analyzed in detail or compared with that of other genomes sequenced with different methods, which could shed light into the understanding of genome and te evolution.
we have sequenced a new d. buzzatii genome  that complements the d. buzzatii reference genome  already published, and compared their te contents with that of d. mojavensis.
here we compare the te content of three genomes: d. buzzatii st- <dig>  j- <dig>  and d. mojavensis.
tes in d. buzzatii are less abundant than in d. mojavensis, as expected according to the genome size and te content positive correlation.
transposable elements , being repetitive sequences, are often misassembled, especially in the genomes sequenced with short reads.

tes accumulate in the dot chromosomes and proximal regions of d. buzzatii and d. mojavensis chromosomes.
between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the d. buzzatii st- <dig> genome is made up of tes, between  <dig> and  <dig>  % of d. buzzatii j- <dig> genome, while tes represent  <dig>  % of the d. mojavensis genome.
we also report a significantly higher te density in d. buzzatii and d. mojavensis x chromosomes, which is not expected under the current models.
helitrons are the most abundant order in the three genomes.
however, tes alone do not explain the genome size difference.
to be able to compare genomes sequenced with different technologies, we developed a coverage-based method and applied it to the d. buzzatii st- <dig> and j- <dig> genome.
many new drosophila genomes have been sequenced in recent years using new-generation sequencing platforms and assembly methods.
our easy-to-use correction method allowed us to identify recently active families in d. buzzatii st- <dig> belonging to the ltr-retrotransposon superfamily gypsy.
