in this study, we identified tomato nf-y genes by analyzing the tomato genome sequence using bioinformatics approaches, and characterized their chromosomal distribution, gene structures, phylogenetic relationship and expression patterns.
functional studies involving suppression of nf-y gene expression using virus induced gene silencing  indicated that five nf-y genes, including two members of the nf-yb subgroup  and three members of the nf-ya subgroup , influence ripening.
the results indicated that five nf-y transcription factors play roles in tomato fruit ripening.
in this study, the evolutionary relationship between arabidopsis thaliana and tomato  nf-y genes was examined to predict similarities in function.
fruit ripening is a complex developmental process that depends on a coordinated regulation of numerous genes, including ripening-related transcription factors , fruit-related micrornas, dna methylation and chromatin remodeling.
we also examined their biological functions in regulating tomato fruit via vigs and subcellular localization analyses.
in addition, subcellular localization analyses using nf-y proteins fused to a green fluorescent protein  reporter showed that the three nf-ya proteins accumulated in the nucleus, while the two nf-yb proteins were observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.
this information provides a platform for further investigation of their biological functions.
furthermore, through gene expression analysis,  <dig> tomato nf-y genes were identified as candidate regulators of fruit ripening.
however, little attention has been given to members of the large nf-y tf family in this regard, although genes in this family are known to have important functions in regulating plant growth, development, and abiotic or biotic stress responses.
