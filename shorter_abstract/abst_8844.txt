transgenic wild tobacco plants  expressing heterologous genes coding for antimicrobial peptides displayed an erratic and variable occurrence of transgene silencing.
to shed light on the progress of methylation establishment, we successively sampled leaf tissues from different stages during plant development and found a rapid increase in 35s promoter methylation during vegetative growth .
we focused on three independently transformed lines  as they rapidly lost the expression of the resistance marker and down-regulated transgene expression by more than  <dig> fold after only one plant generation.
a transgene can be epigenetically silenced by a process called rna directed dna methylation , which can be seen as a heritable loss of gene expression.
a secondary callus regeneration step could interfere with the establishment of gene silencing and we found successfully restored transgene expression in the offspring of several regenerants.
a secondary callus regeneration step provides a convenient way to rescue transgene expression without causing undesirable morphological effects, which is essential for experiments that use transformed plants in the analysis of ecologically important traits.
despite their broad usage, many aspects of unwanted transgene silencing throughout plant development are still poorly understood.
the levels of de novo methylation were inherited by the offspring without any visible discontinuation.
de novo methylation of the transgenes was acquired solely during vegetative development and did not require a generational change for its establishment or enhancement.
genetically modified plants are widely used in agriculture and increasingly in ecological research to enable the selective manipulation of plant traits in the field.
the unpredictability of the gene silencing process requires a thorough selection and early detection of unstable plant lines.
