these results indicate that gr binding to 3β-hsd promoter is involved in the breed-dependent 3β-hsd expression in the liver of piglets.
in the present study, we used preweaning purebred male large white  and erhualian  piglets as model to investigate the breed difference in the expression and regulation of 3β-hsd gene in porcine liver.
the hepatic expression of 3β-hsd mrna was significantly lower  in ehl piglets compared to that in lw piglets.
the nucleoprotein contents of ar , gr  and phospho-ser211gr  were significantly higher in the liver of ehl piglets.
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay demonstrated significantly lower binding of gr, but not ar or c/ebpβ, to 3β-hsd gene promoter in ehl piglets .
significant breed differences were detected for the hepatic expression of transcription factors such as androgen receptor , glucocorticoid receptor , and ccaat/enhancer binding protein β .
serum concentrations of steroid hormones differ significantly between breeds in pigs, however the molecular mechanism regulating hepatic 3β-hsd expression in different breeds of pigs is poorly understood.
