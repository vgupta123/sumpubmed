we completed the cdna sequences with race method.
we then showed the tissue expression profiles of bm yellow protein family genes by rt-pcr.
in view of genetic evolution, the whole bm yellow protein family composes a monophyletic group, which is distinctly separate from drosophila melanogaster and apis mellifera.
the protein of each member possesses a mrjp domain and a putative cleavable signal peptide consisting of a hydrophobic sequence.
using the yellow protein sequence in drosophila melanogaster to blast silkworm est database, we found a gene family composed of seven members with a conserved mrjp domain each and named it yellow protein family of bombyx mori.
a bombyx mori yellow protein family is found to be composed of at least seven members.
the major royal jelly proteins/yellow  family possesses several physiological and chemical functions in the development of apis mellifera and drosophila melanogaster.
the low homogeneity and unique pattern of gene expression by each member among the family ensure us to prophesy that the members of bm yellow protein family would play some important physiological functions in silkworm development.
