the majority of the saudi-arab mitochondrial dna lineages  have a western asia provenance.
the saudi arabian group showed greatest similarity to other arabian peninsula populations  and to levantine populations.
saudi arabs had only a minority sub-saharan africa component , similar to the specific north-african contribution .
in addition, a small indian influence  was also detected.
although the still large confidence intervals, the coalescence and phylogeography of  <dig> haplogroup  matches a neolithic expansion in saudi arabia.
a total of  <dig> mtdna saudi arab lineages were analyzed for hvsi/ii sequences and for haplogroup confirmatory coding diagnostic positions.
nearly all the main western asia haplogroups were detected in the saudi sample, including the rare u <dig> clade.
genetic studies of the arabian peninsula are scarce even though the region was the center of ancient trade routes and empires and may have been the southern corridor for the earliest human migration from africa to asia.
