this study demonstrated that integration of gene-level associations with cms could yield statistically significant findings to offer valuable biological insights  and suggest high confidence candidates for subsequent analyses.
four consensus modules  were discovered by cm-ipinbpa, and were functionally annotated using the pathway analysis tool enrichr.
the influence of genetic variation on these csf biomarkers has been investigated in candidate or genome-wide association studies .
gene-level p-values were obtained by vegas <dig>  genes with p-value ≤  <dig>  were mapped on to a protein-protein interaction  network .
the intersection of four cms forms a common subnetwork of  <dig> genes, including those related to tau phosphorylation , amyloid beta production , and ad .
the genome-wide network analysis yielded  <dig> enriched cms that share not only genes related to tau phosphorylation or amyloid beta production but also multiple genes enriching several kegg pathways such as alzheimer’s disease, colorectal cancer, gliomas, renal cell carcinoma, huntington’s disease, and others.
