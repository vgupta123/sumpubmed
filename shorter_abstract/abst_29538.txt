in this study, we sequenced the genomes of two field specimens from each of the two subtypes and conducted a comparative genomic analysis of the obtained sequences with those from the only fully sequenced cryptosporidium parvum genome.
the high sequence conservation between c. parvum and c. hominis genomes and significant differences in copy numbers of medle family secreted proteins and insulinase-like proteases indicate that telomeric gene duplications could potentially contribute to host expansion in c. parvum.
these genomes had complete synteny in gene organization and  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> % nucleotide sequence similarities to the published genomes of c. parvum and c. hominis, respectively.
several major insertions and deletions were seen between c. hominis and c. parvum genomes, involving mostly members of multicopy gene families near telomeres.
the sequence similarity among specimens of the two dominant outbreak subtypes and genetic recombination in chromosome  <dig>  especially around the putative virulence determinant gp <dig> region, suggest that genetic recombination plays a potential role in the emergence of hyper-transmissible c. hominis subtypes.
the four c. hominis genomes were highly similar to each other and divergent from the reference iaa25r <dig> genome in some highly polymorphic regions.
within the species, iba10g <dig> is the most virulent subtype responsible for all c. hominis–associated outbreaks in europe and australia, and is a dominant outbreak subtype in the united states.
altogether,  <dig> - <dig>  mb of cryptosporidium sequences in 45– <dig> assembled contigs were obtained from the four specimens, representing  <dig> - <dig> % coverage of the expected genome.
major sequence differences among the four specimens sequenced in this study were in the 5′ and 3′ ends of chromosome  <dig> and the gp <dig> region, largely the result of genetic recombination.
