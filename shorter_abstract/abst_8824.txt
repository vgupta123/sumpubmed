polychromatic flow cytometry is a popular technique that has wide usage in the medical sciences, especially for studying phenotypic properties of cells.
the high-dimensionality of data generated by flow cytometry usually makes it difficult to visualize.
this paper describes a new method, sanjay, for visualizing high-dimensional flow cytometry datasets.
we describe a new algorithmic technique that uses a symbolic decision procedure to automatically synthesize low-dimensional projections of flow cytometry data that typically have a high number of dimensions.

a natural solution is to project the data from the original high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space while approximately preserving the overall relationship between the data points.
our algorithm is the first application, to our knowledge, of using automated theorem proving for automatically generating highly-accurate, low-dimensional visualizations of high-dimensional data.
our experimental results show that sanjay also outperforms the random projections technique in terms of the distortions in the projections.
this technique uses a decision procedure to automatically synthesize two-dimensional and three-dimensional projections of the original high-dimensional data while trying to minimize distortion.
