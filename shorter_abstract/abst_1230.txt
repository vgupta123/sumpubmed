we tested if acceleration of synd <dig> shedding takes place in vitro upon treatment of epithelial cells with b. anthracis hemolysins, as well as in vivo during anthrax infection in mice.
the concerted acceleration of shedding by several virulence factors could represent a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to disruption of epithelial or endothelial integrity, hemorrhage, edema and abnormal cell signaling during anthrax infection.
inhibition experiments favor a hypothesis that activities of tested bacterial shedding inducers converge on the stimulation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the syk family, ultimately leading to activation of cellular sheddase.
it has been recently reported that major pathogens staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa accelerate a normal process of cell surface syndecan- <dig>  ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage due to the production of shedding-inducing virulence factors.
the isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins anlb  and anlo , as well as clna  cause accelerated shedding of synd <dig> and e-cadherin from epithelial cells and compromise epithelial barrier integrity within a few hours.
individual components of lt, lethal factor and protective antigen are inactive with regard to shedding.
