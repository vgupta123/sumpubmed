a number of search methods have been introduced over the years.
finally, independent validation on chip-seq data showed that the odv and npv methods significantly outperformed the other compared methods.
extensive cross-validation experiments showed that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the ungapped likelihood under positional background method, a state-of-the-art method, and the widely-used position-specific scoring matrix method.
we further demonstrated that motif subtypes of a tf can be readily identified in this framework and two variants called the k npv and k odv methods benefited significantly from motif subtype identification.
computational approaches to transcription factor binding site identification have been actively researched in the past decade.
learning from known binding sites, new binding sites of a transcription factor in unannotated sequences can be identified.
however, one can rarely find one single method that performs the best on all the transcription factors.
instead, to identify the best method for a particular transcription factor, one usually has to compare a handful of methods.
hence, it is highly desirable for a method to perform automatic optimization for individual transcription factors.
we proposed to search for transcription factor binding sites in vector spaces.
this framework allows us to identify the best method for each individual transcription factor.
we further introduced two novel methods, the negative-to-positive vector  and optimal discriminating vector  methods, to construct query vectors to search for binding sites in vector spaces.
