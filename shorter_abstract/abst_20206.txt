a comprehensive experimental work shows that the bound is indeed useful to induce accurate and sparse multiclass classifiers for microarray data samples.
critical to gene selection is the availability of estimates about the maximum number of genes that can be handled by any classification algorithm.
a novel bound on the maximum number of genes that can be handled by binary classifiers in binary mediated multiclass classification algorithms of microarray data samples is presented.
the bound suggests that high-dimensional binary output domains might favor the existence of accurate and sparse binary mediated multiclass classifiers for microarray data samples.
multiclass classification of microarray data samples with a reduced number of genes is a rich and challenging problem in bioinformatics research.
in addition, the performance of most classifiers is tightly linked to the effectiveness of mandatory gene selection methods.
