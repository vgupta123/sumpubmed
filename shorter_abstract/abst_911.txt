we identify  <dig> ‘loss-of-function’ and  <dig>  ’deleterious’ coding variants, some of which carry homozygous genotypes in the sequenced genome; the associated phenotypes include pharmacogenomic traits such as greater triglyceride lowering ability with fenofibrate treatment, and requirement of high warfarin dosage to elicit anticoagulation response.
in this work, we report whole genome sequence of a kuwaiti native from persian subgroup at >37x coverage.
the kuwait genome project an initiative to sequence individual genomes from the three subgroups of kuwaiti population namely, saudi arabian tribe; “tent-dwelling” bedouin; and persian, attributing their ancestry to different regions in arabian peninsula and to modern-day iran .
we report, for the first time, reference genome resource for the population of persian ancestry.
intergenome comparisons based on shared disease-causing variants, positions the sequenced genome between asian and european genomes in congruence with geographical location of the region.
<dig>  non-coding snps associate with  <dig> phenotype traits: in congruence with medical history of the participant for type  <dig> diabetes and β-thalassemia, and of participant’s family for migraine,  <dig>  type  <dig> diabetes,  <dig>  β-thalassemia, and  <dig>  migraine variants are seen in the genome.
such efforts on populations under-represented in global genome variation surveys help augment current knowledge on human genome diversity.
on comparison, bead arrays perform better than sequencing platforms in correctly calling genotypes in low-coverage sequenced genome regions however in the event of novel snp or indel near genotype calling position can lead to false calls using bead arrays.
the resource provides a starting point for designing large-scale genetic studies in peninsula including kuwait, and persian population.
