these data show that tsad and lck may interact through several different domains and that lck tsad interaction occurs in cd4+ t cells ex vivo.
several transcript variants of tsad mrna exist, but their biological significance remains unknown.
alternative splicing of exon  <dig> encoding aa239– <dig> results in loss of the majority of protein interaction motives of tsad and yields truncated tsad molecules with altered ability to modulate lck activity.
the activation induced t cell specific adapter protein , encoded by sh2d2a, interacts with and modulates lck activity.
here we examined expression of sh2d2a transcripts in activated cd4+ t cells and used the sh2d2a variants as tools to identify functionally important regions of tsad.
tsad was found to interact with lck in human cd4+ t cells ex vivo.
all five sh2d2a transcripts were found to be expressed in cd <dig> stimulated cd4+ t cells.
the sh2d2a exon  <dig> encoding tsad aa 239– <dig> was found to harbour information essential not only for tsad interaction with lck, but also for tsad modulation of lck activity and translocation of tsad to the nucleus.
