the scope of this study was to develop an approach for de novo assembly of the carrot mitochondrial genome using next generation sequence data from total genomic dna.
pcr amplification and sequence analysis across different apiaceae species revealed consistent conservation of this fragment in the mitochondrial genomes and an insertion in daucus plastid genomes, giving evidence of a mitochondrial to plastid transfer of dna.
this study confirmed that whole genome sequencing is a practical approach for de novo assembly of higher plant mitochondrial genomes.
the approach used here could be used more broadly to sequence and assemble mitochondrial genomes of diverse species.
sequence analysis of organelle genomes has revealed important aspects of plant cell evolution.
mitochondrial intergenic sequence analysis allowed detection of a fragment of dna specific to the carrot plastid genome.
southern hybridization demonstrated recombination across two large repeats.
in addition, a new aspect of intercompartmental genome interaction was reported providing the first evidence for dna transfer into an angiosperm plastid genome.
development of a new bioinformatic tool allowed visualizing contig connections and elucidation of the de novo assembly.
sequencing data from a carrot  <dig> whole genome library were used to develop a de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome.

identification of the plastid genome sequence allowed organelle genome comparison.
sequence similarity with a retrotransposon element suggests a possibility that a transposon-like event transferred this sequence into the plastid genome.
