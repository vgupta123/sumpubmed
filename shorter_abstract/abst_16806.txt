a general pattern of correlated evolution appears between writer and eraser domains.
each ptm type is associated with domain families that apply the modification , remove the modification  and bind to the modified sites  together called toolkit domains.
this ptm functions as a membrane anchor and is involved in a range of cellular processes.
protein palmitoylation entails the addition of a palmitoyl fatty acid to a cysteine residue.
one writer family and two erasers families are known for protein palmitoylation.
we constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees and using gene tree rearrangement and tree reconciliation inferred their evolutionary histories in terms of duplication and loss events.
we identified lineages where the families expanded or contracted and found that the evolutionary histories of the families are correlated.
the results show that the erasers were invented first, before the origin of the eukaryotes.
these co-evolution patterns could be used in new methods for interaction prediction based on phylogenies.

the evolutionary origin and diversification remains largely understudied, except for tyrosine phosphorylation.
we constructed a high-quality profile hidden markov model  of each family, searched for protein family members in fully sequenced genomes and subsequently constructed phylogenetic distributions of the families.
in this work we unravel the evolutionary history of these writer and eraser families.
