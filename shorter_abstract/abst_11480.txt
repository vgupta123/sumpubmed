saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two ff domain proteins, prp <dig>  a component of the u <dig> snrnp, and ypr152c, a protein of unknown function.
the ff domain is conserved across all eukaryotes and usually acts as an adaptor module in rna metabolism and transcription.
here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the ff domains of yeast prp <dig>  we show that the c-terminal two ff domains of prp <dig> are dispensable.
deletion of additional ff domains is lethal.
the first ff domain of prp <dig> binds to u <dig> protein luc <dig> in yeast two-hybrid and gst pulldown experiments.
ff domains  <dig> and  <dig> bind to snu <dig>  another known u <dig> protein.
our data suggests that the n-terminal ff domains are critical for these interactions.
