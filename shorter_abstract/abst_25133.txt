beside neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques are the major histological hallmarks of alzheimer’s disease  being composed of aggregated fibrils of β-amyloid .
we demonstrated that the approach of animal immunization and subsequent phage display based antibody selection is applicable to generate highly specific anti β-amyloid scfvs that are capable of accurately discriminating between minute conformational differences.
during the underlying fibrillogenic pathway, starting from a surplus of soluble aβ and leading to mature fibrils, multiple conformations of this peptide appear, including oligomers of various shapes and sizes.
the affinities of the antibodies to various aβ <dig> aggregates as well as their ability to interfere with fibril formation and disaggregation of preformed fibrils were determined.
three of the obtained antibodies target the n-terminal part of aβ <dig> although with varying epitopes, while another scfv binds to the α-helical central region of the peptide.
to further investigate the fibrillization of β-amyloid and to have tools at hand to monitor the distribution of aggregates in the brain or even act as disease modulators, it is essential to develop highly sensitive antibodies that can discriminate between diverse aggregates of aβ.
