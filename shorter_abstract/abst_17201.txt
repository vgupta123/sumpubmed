in order to expose viral strategies, network motif analysis was carried out showing reoccurring patterns in virus-host dynamics.
we conclude that during the evolution of hiv, some patterns of interaction have been selected for resulting in a system where virus proteins preferably interact with central human proteins for direct control and with proteasomal proteins for indirect control over the cellular processes.
hiv infection results in a reprioritization of cellular processes reflected by an increase in the relative importance of transcriptional machinery and proteasome formation.
inferred network motifs show significant over-representation of positive and negative feedback patterns between virus and host.
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has launched the hiv- <dig> human protein interaction database in an effort to catalogue all published interactions between hiv- <dig> and human proteins.
our analyses show that human proteins interacting with hiv form a densely connected and central sub-network within the total human protein interaction network.
in order to systematically investigate these interactions functionally and dynamically, we have constructed an hiv- <dig> human protein interaction network.
finally, the patterns described by network motifs illustrate how virus and host interact with one another.
