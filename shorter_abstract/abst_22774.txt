furthermore, pairings of an episode of wheel running and subsequent confinement in a specific environment can establish a conditioned place preference .
given the involvement of dopamine systems in mediating effects of pavlovian stimuli on appetitive behavior, a role of dopamine in mediating aftereffect-induced cpp seems plausible.
rats lever-press for access to running wheels suggesting that wheel running by itself is reinforcing.
repeated pairings of the aftereffect of wheel running with a specific environment creates a learned association between aftereffect and environment and, in turn, a preference for that environment.
this finding implies that the reinforcing effects of wheel running outlast the actual occurrence of physical activity, a phenomenon referred to as aftereffect of wheel running.
in line with earlier studies, our results demonstrate that rats displayed a conditioned preference for environments paired with the aftereffect of wheel running and further show that the magnitude of cpp was not related to the wheel running rate.
aftereffect-induced cpp involves pavlovian conditioning, i.e.
furthermore, we found that flupenthixol  reduced locomotor activity but did not attenuate the expression of an aftereffect-induced cpp.
