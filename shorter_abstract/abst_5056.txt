we propose a backward elimination iterative distance correlation  procedure to select the smallest subset of snps that guarantees sufficient prediction accuracy, while also solving the unclear threshold issue for traditional feature screening approaches.
be-idc accommodates both the prediction accuracy and the computational speed that are highly demanded in the genomic selection.
out of  <dig>  snps, be-idc selected four influential snps, and confirmed the same frigida gene that was reported by two other traditional methods.

verified through six simulations, the adaptive threshold estimated by the be-idc performed uniformly better than fixed threshold methods that have been used in the current literature.
although the dimension of the entire genome can be extremely large, only a parsimonious set of influential snps are correlated with a particular complex trait and are important to the prediction of the trait.
efficiently and accurately selecting these influential snps from millions of candidates is in high demand, but poses challenges.
