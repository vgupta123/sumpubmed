the new transcriptomes offer comprehensive sequence and dge profiling data for a dynamic view of transcriptomic variation during bud dormancy in pear.
bud dormancy is a critical developmental process that allows perennial plants to survive unfavorable environmental conditions.
pear is one of the most important deciduous fruit trees in the world, but the mechanisms regulating bud dormancy in this species are unknown.
because genomic information for pear is currently unavailable, transcriptome and digital gene expression data for this species would be valuable resources to better understand the molecular and biological mechanisms regulating its bud dormancy.
a total of  <dig>   unigenes were annotated using public protein databases with a cut-off e-value above 10- <dig>  we mainly compared gene expression levels at four time-points during bud dormancy.
these data provided a basis for future studies of metabolism during bud dormancy in non-model but economically-important perennial species.
seven genes were randomly selected to confirm their expression levels using quantitative real-time pcr.
