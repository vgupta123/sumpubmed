by using specific antibodies, we found that tc <dig> protein from epimastigote extracts participates in complexes with the poly  probe as well as with the universal minicircle sequence , a related repeated sequence found in maxicircle dna, and the telomeric repeat.
the dynamics of tc <dig> subcellular localization observed during the cell cycle and life stages support a major role for tc <dig> related to kdna replication and maintenance.
tc <dig> of trypanosoma cruzi has been isolated as a single stranded dna binding protein with high specificity for the poly  sequence.
to further understand the function of this protein in trypanosoma cruzi, we examined its in vitro binding to biologically relevant  enriched sequences, its expression and subcellular localization during the cell cycle and through the parasite life stages.
though tc <dig> is constitutively expressed through non-replicating and replicating life stages of t. cruzi, its subcellular localization in the unique parasite mitochondrion changes according to the cell cycle stage.
