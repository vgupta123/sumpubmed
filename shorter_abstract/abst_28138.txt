in this study, we retrospectively assessed the detected cnvs in a total of  <dig> chd cases  and a 92-case research cohort from shanghai children’s medical center ) and conducted a genotype-phenotype analysis.
the high clinical diagnostic yield of cma in this study provides supportive evidence for cma as the first-line genetic diagnostic tool for chd patients.
the diagnostic yield of cma for syndromic chd was  <dig> - <dig> % , whereas the diagnostic yield for isolated chd was  <dig> - <dig> %.
these regions are considered as novel chd loci.
currently, patients with chd are routinely offered chromosomal microarray  testing, but the diagnostic yield of cma on chd patients has not been extensively evaluated based on a large patient cohort.
based on the bch cohort, the overall diagnostic yield of cma testing for chd patients was  <dig> - <dig> % .

we further identified  <dig> genes as the most likely novel chd candidate genes through gene prioritization analysis.
the cnvs detected in our study suggest a number of chd candidate genes that warrant further investigation.
furthermore, genes encompassed in pathogenic/likely pathogenic cnvs were prioritized by integrating several tools and public data sources for novel chd candidate gene identification.
