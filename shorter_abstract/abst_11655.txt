functional annotation of the locus revealed the presence of numerous resistance gene homologs  belonging to the r <dig> gene family  organized into a total of  <dig> discrete physical clusters, three of which were conserved across s. tuberosum and tomato.
this study confirmed that, in contrast to the wild species r2ghs, which have evolved through extensive sequence exchanges between paralogs, gene conversion was not a major force for differentiation in s. tuberosum r2ghs, and orthology/paralogy relationships have been maintained via a slow accumulation of point mutations in these genotypes.
r-gene sequences mostly differentiate by accumulating point mutations and gene conversion events.
evidence to date indicates the occurrence of a fast evolutionary mode characterized by gene conversion events at the locus in these genotypes.
phylogenetic analysis showed clear orthology/paralogy relationships between s. tuberosum r2ghs but not in r2ghs cloned from solanum wild species.
s. tuberosum and solanum lycopersicum r2ghs evolved mostly through duplication and deletion events, followed by gradual accumulation of mutations.
in plant genomes, nb-lrr based resistance  genes tend to occur in clusters of variable size in a relatively small number of genomic regions.
