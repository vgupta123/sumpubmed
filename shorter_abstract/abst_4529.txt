we proposed tumor necrosis factor α , lactoferrin  and macrophage-expressed lysozyme  genes as potential dna markers in the improvement of immunity to mastitis.
a statistical analysis of associations between tnf-α and ltf genes and immunity to mastitis were performed using three models: 1) a parity-averaged model including only additive effects of the genes; 2) a parity-averaged model including both additive and epistatic effects of the genes; and 3) a parity-specific model including only additive effects of the genes.
one major problem in dairy cattle husbandry is the prevalence of udder infections.
due to the very low frequency of mlyz allele t, the gene was excluded from further analysis.
