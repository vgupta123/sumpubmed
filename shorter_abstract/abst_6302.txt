sequence analyses of unigenes revealed four potential groups: hydrolases, cell envelope associated proteins , candidate effectors and other proteins.
for a selected subset of ceaps and candidate effectors, semiquantitative rt-pcr showed that these transcripts were either expressed constitutively in both in vitro and in planta or induced during plant infection.
eleven candidate effector genes were identified based on features common to characterized fungal effectors, i.e.
c. truncatum likely secretes an arsenal of proteins that are implicated in maintaining a compatible interaction with its host.
some of these proteins may have a role in establishing compatible interaction with the host plant.
using potato virus x  based transient expression assays, we showed that one of the candidate effectors, i. e. contig  <dig> that encodes a cerato-platanin  domain containing protein, unlike cp proteins from other fungal pathogens was unable to elicit a hypersensitive response .
nearly 39% of the ests were predicted to encode proteins of fungal origin and among these,  <dig> ests were predicted to contain n-terminal signal peptides  in their deduced open reading frames .
a directional cdna library was constructed from mrna isolated from infected lens culinaris leaflet tissues displaying the biotrophy-necrotrophy switch of c. truncatum and  <dig> expressed sequence tags  with an average read of >  <dig> bp from the 5-prime end were generated.
the current study catalogues proteins putatively secreted at the in planta biotrophy-necrotrophy transition of c. truncatum.
transition from biotrophy to a destructive necrotrophic phase called the biotrophy-necrotrophy switch is critical in symptom development.
