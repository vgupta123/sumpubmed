in addition, we showed prominence in the performance of hgpec compared to other tools for prioritization of candidate disease genes.
a case study on prediction of novel breast cancer-associated genes and diseases shows the abilities of hgpec.
this app can prioritize candidate genes and diseases by employing a heterogeneous network consisting of a network of genes/proteins and a phenotypic disease similarity network.
here, we developed a cytoscape app, namely hgpec, based on a random walk with restart algorithm on a heterogeneous network of genes and diseases.

finding gene-disease and disease-disease associations play important roles in the biomedical area and many prioritization methods have been proposed for this goal.
based on the rankings, novel disease-gene and disease-disease associations can be identified.
taken together, our app is expected to effectively predict novel disease-gene and disease-disease associations and support network- and rank-based visualization as well as biomedical evidences for such the associations.
among them, approaches based on a heterogeneous network of genes and diseases are considered state-of-the-art ones, which achieve high prediction performance and can be used for diseases with/without known molecular basis.
these associations can be supported with network- and rank-based visualization as well as evidences and annotations from biomedical data.
