an evoprint reveals with near base-pair resolution those sequences that are essential for gene function.
we describe here evoprinterhd, a 2nd-generation comparative genomics tool that automatically generates from a single input sequence an enhanced view of sequence conservation between evolutionarily distant species.
finally, evoprinterhd incorporates options that allow for  re-initiation of the analysis using a different genome's aligning region as the reference dna to detect species-specific changes in less-conserved regions,  rapid extraction and curation of conserved sequences, and  for bacteria, identifies unique or uniquely shared sequences present in subsets of genomes.
currently available for  <dig> nematode,  <dig> mosquito,  <dig> drosophila,  <dig> vertebrate,  <dig> staphylococcus and  <dig> enteric bacteria genomes, evoprinterhd employs a modified blat algorithm , which detects up to 75% more conserved bases than identified by the blat alignments used in the earlier evoprinter program.
an evodifferences profile is also generated to portray conserved sequences that are uniquely lost in any one of the orthologs.
evoprinterhd is a fast, high-resolution comparative genomics tool that automatically generates an uninterrupted species-centric view of sequence conservation and enables the discovery of conserved sequences within rearranged dna.
