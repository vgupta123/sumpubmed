interestingly, the emergence of some animal hect e3s precedes the origin of key cellular systems that they regulate  and it can be deduced that distantly related hect proteins have been independently co-opted to perform similar roles.
in this study, i analyze the patterns of diversification of hect e3s since animals emerged in order to provide the right framework to understand the functional data available for proteins of this family.
i show that the current classification of hect e3s into three groups  is fundamentally incorrect.
first, the existence of a "single-hect e3s" group is not supported by phylogenetic analyses.
sequence and structural analyses show that animal hect e3s can be naturally classified into  <dig> subfamilies.
this may contribute to explain why distantly related hect e3s are involved in the genesis of multiple types of cancer.
hect ubiquitin ligases  are key components of the eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system and are involved in the genesis of several human diseases.
the complex evolutionary history of hect ubiquitin ligases in animals has been deciphered.
the most appropriate model animals to study them and new theoretical and experimental lines of research are suggested by these results.
