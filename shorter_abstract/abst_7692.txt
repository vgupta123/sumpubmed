an understanding of the transcriptional responses following injury is needed to identify key players of heart tissue repair, as well as potential targets for boosting this property in humans.
next, we performed independent validations of expression responses with qpcr in a cryoinjury model.
their transcriptional activities are reproducible in different in vivo models of cardiac injury.

we investigated amputation and cryoinjury in vivo models of heart damage in the zebrafish through unbiased, integrative analyses of independent molecular datasets.
across in vivo models, the top candidates showed highly concordant responses at  <dig> and 3 days post-injury, which highlights the predictive power of our analysis strategies and the possible biological relevance of these genes.
for example, ptgis and ca <dig> were overexpressed, while usp2a, a regulator of the p <dig> pathway, was down-regulated in our in vivo models.
amputation and cryoinjury models are key research tools for understanding injury response and regeneration in vivo.
zebrafish is a clinically-relevant model of heart regeneration.
top candidates are significantly involved in cell fate specification and differentiation, and include heart failure markers such as periostin, as well as potential new targets for heart regeneration.
we identified genes with potential critical roles in the response to cardiac damage in the zebrafish.
