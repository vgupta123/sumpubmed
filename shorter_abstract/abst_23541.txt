drugs, along with co-occurring symptoms are connected with edges weighted by temporal distance and frequency.
at over  <dig> million posts per day, twitter is a commonly used social media platform.
the ubiquity of day-to-day personal information exchange on twitter makes it a promising target for data mining for ade identification and intervention.
we present a deg integration model as a powerful formalism for the analysis of drug-effect relationships that is general enough to accommodate diverse data sources, yet rigorous enough to provide a strong mechanism for ade identification.
the second deg is constructed by mining the history of twitter users.
the first deg is constructed from the drug-effect relationships found in fda package inserts as recorded in the sider database.
additionally, we employ our method to discover several ades which, though present in medical literature and twitter-streams, are not represented in the sider databases.
we use dictionary-based information extraction to identify medically-relevant concepts in tweets.
we construct individual degs on two data sources.
three technical challenges are central to this problem:  identification of salient medical keywords in  tweets,  mapping drug-effect relationships, and  classification of such relationships as adverse or non-adverse.
the proposed approach can identify adverse drug effects with high accuracy with precision exceeding 85 % and f <dig> exceeding 81 %.
we use a bipartite graph-theoretic representation called a drug-effect graph  for modeling drug and side effect relationships by representing the drugs and side effects as vertices.
