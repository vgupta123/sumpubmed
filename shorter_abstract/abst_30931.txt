in this study, we investigated nucleotide requirements in the distal 5'- and 3' exon regions, ebs-ibs interactions and δ-δ' pairing for excision of the group iib intron rmint <dig> in vivo.
our results contribute to understand how group ii introns spread in nature, and might facilitate the use of rmint <dig> in gene targeting.
in addition, we provide evidence for the occurrence of canonical δ-δ' pairing and its importance for the intron excision in vivo.
the intron-encoded protein  assists the splicing of the intron in vivo and remains bound to the excised intron lariat rna in a ribonucleoprotein particle  that promotes intron mobility.
