one of the virulence factors of p. gingivalis is capsular polysaccharide .
to examine the role of the cps in host-pathogen interactions we constructed an insertional isogenic p. gingivalis knockout in the epimerase-coding gene epsc that is located at the end of the cps biosynthesis locus.
these experiments provide the first evidence that p. gingivalis cps acts as an interface between the pathogen and the host that may reduce the host's pro-inflammatory immune response.
we used the epsc mutant, the w <dig> wild type strain and the complemented mutant to challenge human gingival fibroblasts to examine the immune response by quantification of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> transcription levels.
for each of the cytokines significantly higher expression levels were found when fibroblasts were challenged with the epsc mutant compared to those challenged with the w <dig> wild type, ranging from two times higher for il-1β to five times higher for il- <dig>
the higher virulence of encapsulated strains may be caused by this phenomenon which enables the bacteria to evade the immune system.
k <dig> capsule biosynthesis could be restored by in trans expression of an intact epsc gene.
