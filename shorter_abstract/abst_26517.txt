analysis of physicochemical cell surface characteristics reflected by zeta potential and adhesion to hexadecane showed that an increase in eps gave a less negative, more hydrophilic surface and reduced autoaggregation.
eps also affected biofilm formation, but here the quantity of eps produced was not the only determinant.
we have assessed the effect of changes in eps production on cell surface characteristics that may affect the ability of l. johnsonii to colonise the poultry host and exclude pathogens.
this study showed that manipulation of eps production in l. johnsonii fi <dig> can affect properties which may improve its performance as a competitive exclusion agent, but that positive changes in adhesion may be compromised by a reduction in the ability to survive stress.
a reduction in eps production increased bacterial adhesion to chicken gut explants, but made the bacteria less able to survive some stresses.
