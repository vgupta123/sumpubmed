this is the first report of high-density genetic map construction and gene mapping in wax gourd, which will be served as an invaluable tool for gene mapping, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, comparative mapping and draft genome assembling of wax gourd.
although wax gourd is a widely distributed vegetable of cucurbitaceae and has important medicinal and health value, no genetic map has been constructed because of the lack of efficient markers.
in our present study, we constructed a high-density genetic map by using slaf-seq and identified a locus controlling pericarp color in wax gourd.
and finally,  <dig>  of the polymorphic markers were selected for genetic map construction, and  <dig> linkage groups  were generated.

the average sequencing depth was  <dig>  in the maternal line ,  <dig>  in the parental line , and  <dig>  in each f <dig> individual.
when filtering low-depth slaf tags, a total of  <dig>  high-quality slafs were detected, and  <dig>  of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of  <dig>  %.
high-density map is a valuable tool for genetic and genomic analysis.
and based on the newly constructed high-density map, a single locus locating on chromosome  <dig> was identified for controlling the pericarp color of wax gourd.
the inheritance of pericarp color was also studied, which showed that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene.
