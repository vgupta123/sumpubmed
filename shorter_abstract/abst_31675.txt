in addition, perturbed expression of the upr sensors and inducers in the htoraΔedrosophila brains resulted in a significantly reduced life span of the flies.
taken together, these data show that htoraΔe in drosophila brains may activate the upr and increase the expression of hsp <dig> to compensate for the toxic effects caused by htoraΔe in the brains.
furthermore, the types and quantities of proteins present in the anti-hsc <dig> positive microsomes in the htoraΔe brains were different from those of the htorawt brains.
the alteration of transcripts of inositol-requiring enzyme- <dig> -dependent spliced x box binding protein  <dig>  several er chaperones, a nucleotide exchange factor, autophagy related protein 8b  and components of the er associated degradation  pathway and increased expression of the xbp1-enhanced green fluorescence protein  in htoraΔe brains strongly indicated the activation of the unfolded protein response .
the physiological consequences included an increased susceptibility to oxidative and er stress compared to normal htorawt flies.
to investigate the unknown molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying dyt <dig> dystonia, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis.
