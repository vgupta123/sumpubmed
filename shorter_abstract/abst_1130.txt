the characterization of amphioxus cyp <dig> expression, function, and regulation by ra signaling demonstrated that, despite the independent origins of cyp <dig> duplicates in amphioxus and vertebrates, they convergently assume two main roles during development: ra-dependent patterning and protection against fluctuations of ra levels.
in an effort to characterize the evolutionary diversification of ra catabolism, we studied the cyp <dig> genes of the cephalochordate amphioxus , a basal chordate with a vertebrate-like genome that has not undergone the massive, large-scale duplications of vertebrates.
altogether, this work reveals the evolutionary origins of the ra-dependent regulation of cyp <dig> genes and highlights convergent functions for cyp <dig> enzymes that originated by independent duplication events, hence establishing a novel selective mechanism for the genomic retention of gene duplicates.
our analysis suggested that in amphioxus ra-dependent patterning is sustained by cyp26- <dig>  while ra homeostasis is mediated by cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig>  furthermore, comparisons of the regulatory regions of cyp <dig> genes of different bilaterian animals indicated that a cyp26-driven negative feedback system was present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes, but not in that of bilaterians.
in parallel to ra synthesis, a negative feedback loop controlled by ra catabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome p <dig> subfamily  <dig>  is crucial.
during embryogenesis, tight regulation of retinoic acid  availability is fundamental for normal development.
the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster thus represents a useful model to assess adaptive evolutionary changes of the ra signaling system following gene duplication.
in the present study, we found that amphioxus also possess three cyp <dig> genes  that are clustered in the genome and originated by lineage-specific duplication.
