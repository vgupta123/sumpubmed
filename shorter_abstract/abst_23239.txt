the purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and phenotype of treg cells in htlv- <dig> asymptomatic carriers and in htlv-1-associated neurological disease  patients, and to correlate with measures of t cell activation.
we also observed a significantly lower proportion of ctla-4+ treg cells  in subjects with ham/tsp patients compared to healthy controls.
ki- <dig> expression was negatively correlated to the frequency of ctla-4+ treg cells in ham/tsp only, although ki- <dig> expression was inversely correlated with the percentage of cd127low treg cells in healthy control subjects.
finally, the proportion of cd127low treg cells correlated inversely with htlv- <dig> proviral load.
taken together, the results suggest that treg cells may be subverted in ham/tsp patients, which could explain the marked cellular activation, spontaneous cytokine production, and proliferation of cd4+ t cells, in particular those expressing the cd25highcd127low phenotype.
treg cells represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention for patients with htlv-1-related neurological diseases.
we were able to confirm that htlv-i drives activation, spontaneous ifnÎ³ production, and proliferation of cd4+ t cells.
