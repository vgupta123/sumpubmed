this study confirms the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> play a critical role in the development and progression of increased peritoneal epithelial permeability in severe ohss.
using western blot and short-circuit current  techniques, we investigate the potential coactions of analysis in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  and aquaporin  <dig>  on the hyper permeability of body cavity peritoneal epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of ohss.
the rats develop ohss symptoms, with the up regulation of both cftr and aqp <dig> expression and enhanced cftr channel activity in peritoneal epithelial cells, can also be mimicked by administration of estrogen, alone in ovariectomized rats.
it is characterized by increased vascular permeability and substantial fluid shift with accumulation in the body cavity.
besides, aqp <dig> inhibitor, hgcl <dig>  can suppress cftr channel activity.
ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome  is an iatrogenic complication associated with fertility drugs.
administration of progesterone suppresses cftr activity, ohss symptoms as well as cftr and aqp <dig> expression.
therefore, antisera against cftr or aqp <dig> to ohss animals may result in alleviation of the symptom.
