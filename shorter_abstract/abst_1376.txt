ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a super-xerophytic broadleaf evergreen wood, is an ecologically important foundation species in desert ecosystems and exhibits substantial drought tolerance in mid-asia desert.
thus, high throughput transcriptome sequencing from a. mongolicus root is helpful to generate a large amount of transcript sequences for gene discovery and molecular marker development.
de novo assembly of transcript sequences produced by next-generation sequencing technologies offers a rapid approach to obtain expressed gene sequences for non-model organisms.
there are insufficient transcriptomic and genomic data in public databases for understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the drought tolerance of a. mongolicus.
our sequence collection represents a major transcriptomic resource for a. mongolicus, and the large number of genetic markers predicted should contribute to future research in ammopiptanthus genus.
we further analyzed the gene expression profiles of  <dig> putative genes involved in drought tolerance using quantitative real-time pcr  assay.
these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets.
the potential drought stress related transcripts identified in this study provide a good start for further investigation into the drought adaptation in ammopiptanthus.
root plays an important role in water absorption of plant.
