we have generated nine synthetic poly-adenylated rna transcripts that correspond to previously reported oncogenic gene fusions.
oncogenic fusion genes underlie the mechanism of several common cancers.
these synthetic rnas were spiked at known molarity over a wide range into total rna prior to construction of next-generation sequencing mrna libraries to generate rna-seq data.
fusion-sequence specific detection differences indicate that for applications where specific sequences are being investigated, additional constructs may be added to provide quantitative data that is specific for the sequence of interest.
however, absence of a publicly available gene-fusion focused rna-seq data impedes comparative assessment and collaborative development of novel gene fusions detection algorithms.
the community can leverage and augment this publicly available data to further collaborative development of analytical tools and performance assessment frameworks for gene fusions from next-generation sequencing data.

next-generation sequencing based rna-seq analyses have revealed an increasing number of recurrent fusions in a variety of cancers.
the proposed method of designing multiple gene-fusion constructs over a wide range of molarity allows granular performance analyses of multiple fusion-detection algorithms.
