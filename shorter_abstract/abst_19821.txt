hair cells are important for maintaining our sense of hearing and balance.
therefore, the generation of hair cells, possibly from induced pluripotent stem  cells, is important for regenerative therapy and studies of inner ear diseases.
we generated hair cells from mouse ips cells using an established stepwise induction protocol.
certain soluble factors from mouse utricle stromal cells might be important for induction of hair cells from ips cells.
clarification of the molecular mechanisms underlying inner ear disorders is also impeded by the anatomical limitation of experimental access to the human inner ear.
finally, the cells were co-cultured with three kinds of mouse utricle tissues: stromal tissue, stromal tissue + sensory epithelium, and the extracellular matrix of stromal tissue.
first, ips cells were differentiated into the ectodermal lineage by floating culture.
hair cell-like cells were induced from mouse ips cells using mouse utricle stromal tissues.
hair cell-like cells were successfully generated from ips cells using mouse utricle stromal tissues.
however, no hair cell-like cells with hair bundle-like structures were formed using other tissues.

next, they were treated with basic fibroblast growth factor to induce otic progenitor cells.
