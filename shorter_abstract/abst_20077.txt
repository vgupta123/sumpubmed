in veterinary medicine and along the meat and milk production line, only limited data were so far available on mr-cns characteristics.
multiresistant cns strains might become an emerging problem for veterinary medicine.
s. sciuri and s. fleurettii thereby predominated in livestock, btm and minced meat samples, whereas s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus predominated in human samples.
for species identification of mr-cns isolated from different origins, maldi-tof ms proved to be a fast and reliable tool and is suitable for screening of large sample amounts.
after two-step enrichment and growth on chromogenic agar, mr-cns were detected in  <dig> % of samples from livestock and chicken carcasses,  <dig> % of samples from bulk tank milk and minced meat, and  <dig> % of human samples.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of mr-cns, to identify the detected staphylococci to species level, and to assess the antibiotic resistance profiles of isolated mr-cns strains.
using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry ,  <dig> selected mr-cns strains belonged to seven different species .
