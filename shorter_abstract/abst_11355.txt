features of a dna sequence can be found by compressing the sequence under a suitable model; good compression implies low information content.
we apply such a model to find features across chromosomes of cyanidioschyzon merolae.
the exploration of long information sequences in linear time and space is fast and the saved results are self documenting.
whereas compressing a sequence y in the context of another x can find what new information x gives about y. this paper presents a methodology for performing comparative analysis to find features exposed by such models.
linear space complexity is important when exploring long dna sequences of the order of millions of bases.
various examples illustrate the methodology, finding features for sequences alone and in different contexts.
from a linear dna sequence, a compression model can produce a linear information sequence.
