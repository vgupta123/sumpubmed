electron microscopy showed more adherent bacteria in association with membranous pseudopodia in the tigr <dig> strain.
streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the availability of effective pneumococcal vaccines.
most strikingly, âˆ†sp_ <dig> which was predicted to contain a b-cell epitope and revealed significant attenuation in adherence, appeared to be expressed as a part of an operon that includes the gene encoding the cytoplasmic pore-forming toxin and vaccine candidate, pneumolysin.
operons for cell wall phosphorylcholine incorporation , manganese transport  and phosphate utilization  were up-regulated in both strains on exposure to epithelial cells.
we used a combination of adherence assays, mutagenesis and functional genomics to identify novel factors involved in adherence.
by contrasting these processes in two pneumococcal strains, tigr <dig> and g <dig>  we showed that adherence and invasion capacities vary markedly by strain.
