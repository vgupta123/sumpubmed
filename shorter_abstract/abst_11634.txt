hypoxia is a critical aspect of the glioma microenvironment and has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to various therapies.
we show that mir-210-3p promotes hypoxic survival and chemoresistance in gbm cells and targets a negative regulator of hypoxic response, hif3a.
recent studies strongly suggest that micrornas act as critical mediators of the hypoxic response.
with this study, we present the first detailed analysis of small rna transcriptome of cell line u87mg, a grade iv glioma cell line, and its alteration under hypoxic condition.
interestingly, certain hypoxia-induced mirnas are also known to be over-expressed in gbm tumors, suggesting that hypoxia may be one of the factors involved in establishing the mirna signature of gbm.
transcription factor binding sites for hypoxia inducible factor  <dig> a  were identified in the promoter region  of  <dig> hypoxia-induced mirnas.
mir-210-3p levels were found to be high in gbm patient samples and showed good correlation with the known hypoxia markers ca <dig> and vegf.
hif-1a over-expression and silencing studies show regulation of specific mirnas, including mir-210-3p, to be hif1a dependent.
we thus hypothesized their prominent role in hypoxia resistance in glioblastoma  and aimed to identify those.
additionally, a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were discovered by the analysis of deep sequencing data and three of these were found to be differentially expressed under hypoxia.
