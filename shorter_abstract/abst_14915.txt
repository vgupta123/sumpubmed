moreover, efficient synthesis and utilization of intracellular glutamate were noticed in strain  <dig> at 37°c, revealing glutamate as the nitrogen source for validamycin biosynthesis.
strain  <dig> seemed to have evolved with specific genomic components to facilitate the thermo-regulated validamycin biosynthesis.
at 37°c, a glutamate dehydrogenase was transcriptionally up-regulated, and further proved its involvement in validamycin production by gene replacement.
furthermore, a sarp-family regulatory gene with enhanced transcription at 37°c was identified and confirmed to be positively involved in the thermo-regulation of validamycin production by gene inactivation and transcriptional analysis.
transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> % of coding sequences was increased at 37°c, including biosynthetic genes for validamycin and other three secondary metabolites.
the  <dig> ,684-bp genome of strain  <dig> was completely sequenced and composed of a linear chromosome, a  <dig> -kb linear plasmid, and a  <dig> -kb circular plasmid.
compared with other streptomyces genomes, the chromosome of strain  <dig> has a smaller core region and shorter terminal inverted repeats, encodes more α/β hydrolases, major facilitator superfamily transporters, and mg2+/mn2+-dependent regulatory phosphatases.
