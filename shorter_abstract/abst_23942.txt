electroporation parameters such as number of pulses, voltage and amount of plasmid dna were optimized and it was found that  <dig> pulses of  <dig> v·cm- <dig> at  <dig> μg of plasmid dna per fish increased the luciferase expression 10-fold compared to controls.
electroporation parameters for optimum transfection of adult zebrafish with tweezer type electrode were presented.
in this study we investigated the effect of electroporation on expression of transgenes in 3– <dig> month old adult zebrafish.
to establish the utility of adult zebrafish as a system for transient transfections, the strength of the promoters was compared in a <dig> cells and adult zebrafish after electroporation.
the relative strengths of the promoters were found to be similar in cell lines and in adult zebrafish.
electroporation after dna injection enhances gene expression 10-fold in adult zebrafish.
application of electrical pulses at the site of injection was demonstrated to improve transgene expression in muscle tissue.
enhanced reporter gene expression upon electroporation allowed comparison of strengths of the promoters in vivo in zebrafish.
similar enhancement in transgene expression was also observed in indian carp .
