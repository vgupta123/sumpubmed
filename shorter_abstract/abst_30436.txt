in order to explore the full species discrimination potential of coi, we sequenced the barcoding region of the coi gene of a range of economically important tephritid species and complemented these data with all genbank and bold entries for the systematic group available as of january  <dig>  we explored the limits of species delimitation of this barcode fragment among  <dig> putative tephritid species and established operational taxonomic units , between which discrimination is reliably possible.
we found that although several species cannot be differentiated based on the genetic diversity observed in coi and hence form composite otus, 85% of all otus correspond to described species.
because our snp panels are developed based on all currently available sequence information and rely on a minimal pairwise difference of three snps, they are highly reliable and hence represent an important resource for developing taxon-specific diagnostic assays.

for selected cases, possible explanations that may cause composite otus are discussed.
rapid and reliable identification of quarantine pests is essential for plant inspection services to prevent introduction of invasive species.
<dig> base pairs long sequence of the 5′end of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i , enables differentiation of a very wide range of arthropods.
furthermore, to enable future development of rapid diagnostic assays based on this sequence information, we characterized all single nucleotide polymorphisms  and established “near-minimal” sets of snps that differentiate among all included otus with at least three and four snps, respectively.
