in animals, the biogenesis of some lipoprotein classes requires members of the ancient large lipid transfer protein  superfamily, including the cytosolic large subunit of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein , vertebrate apolipoprotein b , vitellogenin , and insect apolipophorin ii/i precursor .
neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods, of conserved sequence motifs and the presence of three common conserved domains: an n-terminal large lipid transfer module marker for lltp, a duf <dig> domain of unknown function in their central region exclusively shared with apolp-ii/i and apob, and a von willebrand-factor type d domain at their c-terminal end.
involvement in lipid metabolism and as egg yolk precursor protein, and neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, e.g.
the structural and phylogenetic data presented indicate that the major egg yolk precursor protein of decapod crustaceans is surprisingly closely related to insect apolp-ii/i and vertebrate apob and should be known as apolipocrustacein  rather than vtg.
in most oviparous species, vtg, a large glycolipoprotein, is the main egg yolk precursor protein.
in addition, we determined that the main egg yolk precursor protein of decapod crustaceans show an overall greater sequence similarity with apolp-ii/i than other lltp, including vtgs.
these lltp may arise from an ancient duplication event leading to paralogs of vtg sequences.
involvement in clotting cascade and immune response, of extracellular lltp members.
this close association is supported by the phylogenetic analysis, i.e.
these protein-coding nuclear genes may be used to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the major arthropod groups, especially the pancrustacea-major splits.
