to adapt to the high-altitude area, extremely harsh climate, and hypoxic environment that the tibetan cashmere goat lives in, this goat has developed distinct phenotypic traits compared to lowland breeds.
among these genes, the most evident one was endothelial pas domain protein  <dig> , which has been previously reported to be involved in complex oxygen sensing and significantly associated with high-altitude adaptation of human, dog, and grey wolf.
however, the genetic components underlying this phenotypic adaptation remain largely unknown.
the variants in cardiovascular system-related genes may explain the observed phenotypic adaptation of the tibetan cashmere goat.
the great majority of snps showed low genetic differentiation among populations; however, approximately 2-3Â % of the loci showed more genetic differentiation than expected under a selectively neutral model.
we obtained  <dig>  autosomal snps through exome sequencing of  <dig> cashmere goats located at a wide geographic range, including the tibetan plateau and low-altitude regions in china.
genes associated with cardiovascular system development were significantly enriched in our study.
the tibetan cashmere goat , one of the most ancient breeds in china, has historically been a critical source of meat and cashmere production for local farmers.
