this study represents the first report of adjuvant-free vaccines utilizing aβ peptides carrying diverse mutations in the t-cell epitope.
ig isotyping indicated that adjuvant-free vaccination with peptides drove an adequate th <dig> response.
our study demonstrated that an adjuvant-free vaccine with different aβ peptides can be an effective and safe vaccination approach against ad.
the development of a vaccine with mutant aβ peptides that avoids the use of an adjuvant may result in an effective and safer human vaccine.
all peptides tested showed high antibody responses, were long-lasting, and demonstrated good memory response.
mutant peptides induced different inflammation responses as evidenced by cytokine profiles.
a recent human clinical trial of an alzheimer's disease  vaccine using amyloid beta  1– <dig> plus qs- <dig> adjuvant produced some positive results, but was halted due to meningoencephalitis in some participants.
these largely positive results provide encouragement for the future of the development of human vaccinations for ad.
