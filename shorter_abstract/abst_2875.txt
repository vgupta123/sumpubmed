we examined the distribution of short cyclic loops on the surface of a large number of proteins, especially membrane or extracellular proteins.
examining the conservation of short disulphide bonded loops in proteins, we find a small but significant increase in conservation inside these loops compared to surrounding residues.
available three-dimensional structures highlighted a number of disulphide-bonded loops responsible for the majority of the likely binding interactions in a variety of protein complexes, due to their location at protein-protein interfaces.
we identify a subset of these loops that exhibit a high relative conservation, particularly among peptide hormones.
such structurally independent peptides may be useful as biologically active templates for the development of novel modulators of protein-protein interactions.
we find that disulphide-bonded loops at protein-protein interfaces may, but do not necessarily, show biological activity independent of their parent protein.
they may retain biological activity outside their parent proteins.
we conclude that short disulphide-bonded loops are found in a wide variety of biological interactions.
