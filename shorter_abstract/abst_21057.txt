we quantified the amount of transcriptome binding that occurred in cross-species, organ complexity and intraspecific variation hybridization studies.
intraspecific variation in transcriptome expression is evaluated and discussed.
finally, bac hybridizations are demonstrated as a rapid and accurate means to identify gene content.
the est databases presently contain over  <dig>  sequences from over  <dig> salmonid cdna libraries derived from a wide variety of tissues and different developmental stages.
we have analyzed and evaluated the utility of a microarray containing  <dig>   salmonid cdnas in a variety of potential experimental settings.
we show the potential of the use of the microarray in a variety of experimental settings through hybridization studies that examine the binding of targets derived from different organs and tissues.
we validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the 16k microarray over a wide range of teleosts, even for transcriptome targets from species distantly related to salmonids.
we have developed and fabricated a salmonid microarray containing cdnas representing  <dig>  genes.
the genes spotted on the array have been stringently selected from atlantic salmon and rainbow trout expressed sequence tag  databases.
we also developed a methodology to rapidly identify and confirm the contents of a bacterial artificial chromosome  library containing atlantic salmon genomic dna.
