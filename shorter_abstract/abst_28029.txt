an important example is multigroup data collected over different experimental groups, such as data collected from distinct stages of a disease process.
tuning parameters have been preset at theoretically optimal values freeing the user from such specifications.
the bam approach uses a special inferential regularization known as spike-and-slab shrinkage that provides an optimal balance between total false detections and total false non-detections.
bamarray™ is a graphically oriented java-based software package that implements the bam method for detecting differentially expressing genes in multigroup microarray experiments .
a graphical suite is a core feature of the product and includes diagnostic plots for assessing model assumptions and interactive plots that enable tracking of prespecified gene lists to study such things as biological pathway perturbations.
bamarray™ is user friendly platform independent software that effectively and efficiently implements the bam methodology.
bamarray™ provides estimates for gene differential effects and automatically estimates data adaptive, optimal cutoff values for classifying genes into biological patterns of differential activity across experimental groups.
the high throughput nature of these arrays creates an enormous wealth of information, but also poses a challenge to data analysis.
this translates into more reproducible differential calls.
classifying patterns of differential activity is greatly facilitated by a data adaptive cutoff rule and a graphical suite.
inferential problems become even more pronounced as experimental designs used to collect data become more complex.
we have developed a method specifically addressing these issues termed bayesian anova for microarrays .
