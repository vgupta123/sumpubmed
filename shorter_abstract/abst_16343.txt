fourth, we score the generated structures using a novel fitness function which favors closed or holo structures.
by iterating the second through fourth steps we systematically minimize the fitness function, thus predicting the conformational change required for small ligand binding for five well studied proteins.
second, we apply an euler rotation to one of the domains about the hinge point.
often the 3d structure of the protein is available in some conformation, but binding the ligand of interest may involve a large scale conformational change which is difficult to predict with existing methods.
we demonstrate that the method in most cases successfully predicts the holo conformation given only an apo structure.
