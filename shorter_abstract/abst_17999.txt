using the dmdtoolkit we showed that the accuracy of predicting dmd versus bmd raised about 3% in all types of dystrophin mutations when compared with previous methods.
previously, the reading-frame rule was used to predict dmd versus bmd.
we utilized several additional molecular genetic rules or patterns such as “ambush hypothesis”, “hidden stop codons” and “exonic splicing enhancer ” to predict the expressed clinical phenotypes as dmd versus bmd.
dystrophinopathy is one of the most common human monogenic diseases which results in duchenne muscular dystrophy  and becker muscular dystrophy .
since early diagnosis and treatment results in better clinical outcome in dmd it is essential to establish accurate early diagnosis of dmd to allow efficient management.
a computer software “dmdtoolkit” was developed to visualize the structure and to predict the functional changes of mutated dystrophin protein.
mutations in the dystrophin gene are responsible for both dmd and bmd.
however, the clinical phenotypes and treatments are quite different in these two muscular dystrophies.
here, we report a novel molecular method to improve the accuracy of predicting clinical phenotypes in dystrophinopathy.
it also assists statistical prediction for clinical phenotypes.
