dexamethasone  is used clinically before operations to prevent allergic reactions; regulatory t cells  are believed to be associated with negative immune response, which play an important role in alleviating allergic reactions.

it was found that  <dig>  % of all sensitized mice experienced allergic symptoms.
these cells may play a key role in alleviating the immune response in ce-induced anaphylactic shock.
in addition, the mice in dex group were treated with 10 mg/kg dex by intraperitoneal injection 30 min before being sensitized.
in this study, c57bl/ <dig> mice were divided into uninfected group, untreated group and dex group which were inoculated with protoscoleces from e. granulosus and sensitized using a cyst fluid suspension to induce anaphylactic shock.
the levels of ige, ige/igg, and ige/igg <dig> were significantly higher in both untreated group and dex group.
the proportion of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + treg cells relative to cd4+ treg cells, and the levels of interleukin- <dig>  and tumor growth factor-β  were significantly higher in dex group.
however, the association of treg cells with dex remains unknown.
cystic echinococcosis , caused by infection with echinococcus granulosus larvae, is a potentially life-threatening disease in humans.
anaphylactic shock caused by ce is very dangerous, and is highly prevalent during surgery.
the protective effect of dex may be due to treg cell upregulating il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> levels, and inhibiting helper t cell  <dig> cytokines.
