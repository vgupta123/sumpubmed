psanr and pslar transcript profiles, pa localization, and pa accumulation patterns suggest that a pool of pa subunits are produced in specific seed coat cells early in development to be used as substrates for polymerization into pas.
three cdnas encoding anthocyanidin reductase , leucoanthocyanidin reductase , and dihydroflavonol reductase  were isolated.

chemical analyses of pas from seeds of three pea cultivars demonstrated cultivar variation in pa composition.
significant variation in seed coat pa composition was found within the pea cultivars, making pea an ideal system to explore pa biosynthesis.
proanthocyanidins  accumulate in the seeds, fruits and leaves of various plant species including the seed coats of pea , an important food crop.
pas were localized to the ground parenchyma and epidermal cells of pea seed coats.
psanr and pslar transcripts were most abundant earlier in seed coat development.
despite the competent pslar activity in vitro, expression of pslar driven by the arabidopsis anr promoter in wild-type and anr knock-out arabidopsis backgrounds did not result in pa synthesis.
next-generation sequencing of ‘courier’ seed coat cdna produced a seed coat-specific transcriptome.
this was followed by maximum pa accumulation in the seed coat.
biochemically competent recombinant psanr and pslar activities were consistent with the pea seed coat pa profile composed of both cis- and trans-flavan-3-ols.
