the combined estimates define the differential distribution of the query motif within the dataset and by inference are used to quantify the magnitude of the direct rnai transcription effect.
in each instance sbse unambiguously identified the most likely location of the direct rnai effects for each of the differential gene expression profiles.
these analyses indicate that mirna with conserved seed regions may share minimal biological activity and that sbse can be used to differentiate sirnas of similar efficacy but with different off-target signalling potential.
the key assumption implemented in sbse is that both direct regulation of transcription by mirna, and sirna off-target interference, can be estimated using the differential distribution of an rnai sequence  motif in a ranked 3' untranslated region  sequence repository.
sbse uses common microarray summary statistics  and a simple bayesian analysis to estimate how the rnai agent dictated the observed differential expression profile.
