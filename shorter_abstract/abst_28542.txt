the routine analysis, however, is very time consuming and expensive as it is carried out manually by trained personnel.
phytoplankton communities are often used as a marker for the determination of fresh water quality.
it integrates the segmentation of the organisms from the background, the calculation of a large range of features, and a neural network for the classification of imaged organisms into different groups of plankton taxa.
the software package is published as free software and is available to anyone to help make the analysis of water quality more reproducible and cost effective.
the implemented automated microscopy and the new open source image analysis system - planktovision - showed classification results that were comparable or better than existing systems and the exclusion of non-plankton particles could be greatly improved.
a novel open source system for the automated recognition of phytoplankton by the use of microscopy and image analysis was developed.
the analysis of samples containing  <dig> different taxa showed an average recognition rate of  <dig> % and an average error rate of  <dig> %.
