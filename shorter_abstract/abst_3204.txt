histological studies revealed details of infection, colonisation and host response and indicate that hair cells are important sites of infection.
don appears to function as a virulence factor in bd as it does in wheat.
the ability of fusarium graminearum and fusarium culmorum to infect a range of bd tissues was examined in various bioassays which showed that both species can infect all bd tissues examined, including intact foliar tissues.
bd is the first reported plant species to allow successful infection on intact foliar tissues by fhb-causing fusarium species.
susceptibility to fusarium and don was assessed in two bd ecotypes and revealed variation in resistance between ecotypes.
fusarium species cause fusarium head blight  and other important diseases of cereals.
this study aims to assess the interaction between the most prevalent fhb-causing fusarium species and bd in order to develop and exploit bd as a genetic model for fhb and other fusarium diseases of wheat.
brachypodium distachyon  has been proposed as a new monocotyledonous model species for functional genomic studies in grass species.
bd is proposed as a valuable model for undertaking studies of fusarium head blight and other fusarium diseases of wheat.
