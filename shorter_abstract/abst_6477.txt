use of fluorogenic model peptides of diverse specificities failed to show peptidase activity with recombinant mycobacterial clpp <dig> or clpp <dig>  however, we found that clpp <dig> had a proteolytic activity responsible for its own cleavage after the arg <dig> residue and cleavage of clpp <dig> after the ala <dig> residue.
in addition, we showed that the absence of any peptidase activity toward model peptides was not due to an obstruction of the entry pore by the n-terminal flexible extremity of the proteins, nor to an absolute requirement for the clpx or clpc atpase complex.
finally, we also found that removing the putative propeptides of clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> did not result in cleavage of model peptides.
deleting the amino-terminal extremity of clpp <dig> and clpp <dig>  promoted the assembly in higher order oligomeric species, suggesting that the flexible n-terminal extremity of mycobacterial clpps participated in the destabilization of interaction between heptamers.
despite the conservation of a ser protease catalytic triad in their primary sequences, mycobacterial clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> do not have conventional peptidase activity toward peptide models and display an unusual mechanism of self-assembly.
the concomitant presence of both clpp <dig> and clpp <dig> did not result in tetradecameric assembly.
caseinolytic proteases  are barrel-shaped self-compartmentalized peptidases involved in eliminating damaged or short-lived regulatory proteins.
