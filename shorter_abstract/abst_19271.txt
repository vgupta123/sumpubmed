the data management and analytical functions of icover are implemented in r, therefore the software can be easily installed on any system for which r is available.
its visualization window is composed of two connected and interactive main views, including a parallel coordinates view and a dimensionality reduction plot.
we present icover, the interactive contig-bin verification and refinement tool, which allows the visualization of genome bins.
to demonstrate icover’s utility, we used it to refine disparate genome bins automatically generated using metabat, concoct and mycc for an anaerobic digestion metagenomic  dataset.
icover is an open source software package that allows curation of disparate genome bins generated with automatic binning algorithms.
out of  <dig> refined genome bins,  <dig> were characterized with higher completeness and lower contamination in comparison to their respective, automatically generated, genome bins.
metagenomic analyses result in a large number of genomic fragments  that need to be grouped  in order to reconstruct draft microbial genomes.
more specifically, icover allows curation of bin assignments based on multiple binning algorithms.
recent advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for much deeper exploitation of natural and engineered microbial communities, and to unravel so-called “microbial dark matter” .
