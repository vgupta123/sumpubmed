here we develop a new contact map predictor  that uses support vector machines to predict medium- and long-range contacts.
svmcon recently participated in the seventh edition of the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction  experiment and was evaluated along with seven other contact map predictors.
svmcon yields good performance on medium- to long-range contact predictions and can be modularly incorporated into a structure prediction pipeline.
svmcon integrates profiles, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact potentials, and other useful features.
svmcon was ranked as one of the top predictors, yielding the second best coverage and accuracy for contacts with sequence separation >=  <dig> on  <dig> de novo domains.
in spite of steady progress over the past decade, contact prediction remains still largely unsolved.
we describe svmcon, a new contact map predictor that uses svms and a large set of informative features.
