this study further shows that the dominant-negative elk- <dig> mutant is a valuable tool to study elk-1-mediated gene transcription.
a comparison between the signaling cascades induced by thrombin or carbachol showed no differences, except that signal transduction via m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors required the transactivation of the egf receptor, while thrombin signaling did not.
additionally, thrombin stimulation leads to an activation of stimulus-responsive transcription factors in different cell types, indicating that the gene expression pattern is changed in thrombin-stimulated cells.
the signaling cascade connecting thrombin stimulation with egr- <dig> gene expression required elevated levels of cytosolic ca2+, the activation of diacylgycerol-dependent protein kinase c isoenzymes, and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase .
stimulation of the cells with thrombin triggered the phosphorylation of the transcription factor elk- <dig>  expression of a dominant-negative mutant of elk- <dig> completely prevented egr- <dig> expression in stimulated 39m1- <dig> cells, indicating that elk- <dig> or related ternary complex factors connect the intracellular signaling cascade elicited by activation of protease-activated receptors with transcription of the egr- <dig> gene.
in the nucleus, ternary complex factors function as key proteins linking the intracellular signaling cascade with enhanced transcription of the egr- <dig> gene.
this study shows that stimulus-transcription coupling in thrombin-treated lung fibroblasts relies on the elevation of the intracellular ca2+-concentration and the activation of pkc and erk.
