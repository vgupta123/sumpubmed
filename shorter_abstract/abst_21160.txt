apart from the programming language itself, all other components are also open source, freely available tools: light-weight php scripts and the apache web server.
because mgrid utilizes only matlab, light-weight php scripts and the apache web server, installation and configuration are very simple.
mgrid is an open source environment.
transparent, load-balanced distribution of user-defined matlab toolboxes and rapid prototyping of many simple parallel applications can now be done with a single easy-to-use matlab command.
matlab, a powerful and productive language that allows for rapid prototyping, modeling and simulation, is widely used in computational biology.
mgrid's client-side interface is an easy-to-use native matlab toolbox that transparently executes user-defined code on remote machines .
mgrid augments the usual process distribution seen in other similar distributed systems by adding facilities for user code distribution.
existing distributed computing environments like the distributed computing toolbox, matlabmpi, matlab*g and others allow for the remote  execution of matlab commands with varying support for features like an easy-to-use application programming interface, load-balanced utilization of resources, extensibility over the wide area network, and minimal system administration skill requirements.
run-time variables are automatically packed and distributed with the user-defined code and automated load-balancing of remote resources enables smooth concurrent execution.
