the converse however was not true, as cd individuals gain no rare advantage when introduced into an oa population.
female mate choice may be adaptive when males exhibit heritable genetic variation at loci encoding resistance to infectious disease.
taken together, the results suggest that, when rare, oa is the best strategy for parasite evasion .
the consequence of oa increasing in the population, however, is to reduce the parasite driven genotype oscillations and facilitate the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium at the disease-resistance loci.
a similar result was obtained when the oa strategy was introduced into populations practicing cd mate choice.
this leads to a neutrally stable situation in which different strategies have equal fitness, and suggests that multiple forms of mate choice may be expected to occur in populations at risk from infectious disease.
empirical studies suggest that both forms of mate choice exist, but little is known about the potential for natural selection to shape the two strategies in nature.
we used computer simulation models to examine the evolutionary fates of the two forms of mate choice in populations at risk for infection by debilitating parasites.
we found that populations exhibiting random mating  can be invaded and replaced completely by individuals practicing cd type mate choice.
