although the scale of the constructed map covers approximately only one-fourth of the m. grisea's proteome, it is the first ppi map for this crucial organism and will therefore provide new insights into the functional genomics of the rice blast fungus.
the pathogenicity proteins and their interacting partners in the entire network were then used to construct a subnet called a pathogenicity network.
using a well-recognized interolog approach, we have predicted  <dig>  interactions among  <dig>  m. grisea proteins.
finally, it has been established that secreted proteins in m. grisea interact with fewer proteins.
we predicted the ppis of m. grisea and compiled them into a database server called mpid.
thus far, large-scale ppi mapping projects have not been implemented for the rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea, which is responsible for the most severe rice disease.
these secreted proteins and their interacting partners were also compiled into a network of secreted proteins, which may be helpful in constructing an interactome between the rice blast fungus and rice.
focusing on the network topology of proteins encoded by known pathogenicity genes, we have found that pathogenicity proteins tend to interact with higher numbers of proteins.
these data may provide further clues for the study of these pathogenicity proteins.
