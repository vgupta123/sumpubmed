we show that irf <dig> binds at proximal or distant isg sites twice as often as stat <dig>  increasing to sixfold at the mhc class i locus.
dual binding sites at remote or proximal enhancers distinguished isgs that were responsive to ifnÎ³ versus cell-specific resistant isgs, which showed fewer and mainly single binding events.
we show that in silico prediction of snp effects accurately reflects altered binding both in vitro and in vivo.
surprisingly, inducibility in one cell type predicted isg-responsiveness in other cells.
these data reveal broad cooperation between stat <dig> and irf <dig>  explain cell type specific differences in isg-responsiveness, and identify genetic variants that may participate in the pathogenesis of immune disorders.
