we propose that the conserved exon junctions constitute potential sites for sequence/function modifications, and that rrm binding proteins, whose function relies upon plastic rna-protein interactions, may have played an important role in brain evolution.
remarkably, three of the conserved exon junctions are both close to structural elements, involved respectively in protein-rna interactions and in the regulation of sub-cellular localization, and in the vicinity of diverse sequence variations.
in an attempt to understand the history of this family, we searched for orthologs in eleven completely sequenced genomes, including those of humans, d. melanogaster and c. elegans, for which cdnas are available.
the remaining genes show remarkable conservation of their exon organization, and their products most resemble fne and rbp <dig>  proteins encoded by the two elav paralogs of drosophila.
its members encode structurally conserved neuronal proteins with three rna recognition motifs  but they paradoxically act at diverse levels of post-transcriptional regulation.
the drosophila gene embryonic lethal abnormal visual system  is the prototype of a gene family present in all metazoans.
