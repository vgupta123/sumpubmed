deep sequencing technology has enabled discovery of a novel 16-nt rna sequence in total rna from human brain that we propose is derived from rnu <dig>  an rna component of spliceosome assembly.
thus rnu <dig> could function both as a component of spliceosome assembly and as inhibitor of production of the essential, spliceosome protein coded by sfrs <dig>  beyond this example, a general procedure is needed for systematic discovery of multiple alignments of sequencing, splicing, and rna folding data.
small rnas are known to regulate diverse gene expression processes including translation, transcription, and splicing.
among small rnas, the micrornas  of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  undergo biogeneses including primary transcription, rna excision and folding, nuclear export, cytoplasmic processing, and then bioactivity as regulatory agents.
