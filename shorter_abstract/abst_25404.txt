motifs are patterns found in biological sequences that are vital for understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc.
they are helpful in finding transcriptional regulatory elements, transcription factor binding sites, and so on.
in this paper, we propose a fast algorithm that can solve the well-known challenging instances of pms:  and .
in this paper we focus on exact algorithms only.
all the known exact algorithms for pms take exponential time in some of the underlying parameters in the worst case scenario.
but it does not mean that we cannot design exact algorithms for solving practical instances within a reasonable amount of time.
in particular, our proposed algorithm takes about  <dig> hours on the challenging instance  and about  <dig> hours on the challenging instance .
pms <dig> can tackle the large challenging instances  and .
the pms problem has been well investigated and shown to be np-hard.
any algorithm for pms that always finds all the -motifs on a given input set is called an exact algorithm.
no prior exact algorithm could solve these instances.
one of them is -motif search ).
many facets of the motif search problem have been identified in the literature.
the algorithm has been run on a single  <dig> ghz pc with 3gb ram.
we present an efficient algorithm pms <dig> that uses some novel ideas and combines them with well-known algorithm pms <dig> and pmsprune.
