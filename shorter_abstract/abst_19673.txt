access to these data is mostly by text based methods using gene names; however, gene annotation is neither complete, nor fully systematic between organisms, and is also not generally stable over time.
three applications were built to explore the proposed method: accessing image data, literature and gene names.
applied to literature searches it facilitated retrieval of mostly high relevance references.
searches are initiated with the sequence of the user's gene of interest, which is searched against a database of sequences associated with the target data.
the matching  target data are returned directly to the user's browser, organised by sequence similarity.
sequence similarity searches are found in existing gene oriented databases, but mostly give indirect access to non-sequence data via navigational links.
this work was motivated by the need to provide better access to large numbers of in situ images, and the observation that such image data were usually associated with a specific gene sequence.
the method worked well for the intended application in image data management.
comparison with text based searches of the image data set showed the accuracy of the method.
we propose a method for non-sequence data retrieval based on sequence similarity, which removes dependence on annotation and text searches.
non-sequence gene data  can be found in many different public databases.
this method makes a powerful and useful addition to existing methods for searching gene data based on text retrieval or curated gene lists.
this provides some challenges for text based access, especially for cross-species searches.
