a few of them were related to antibiotics inactive against clostridium spp.
c. clostridioforme 90a <dig> contained the vanb-type tn <dig> operon conferring vancomycin resistance.
in order to better characterize the two species and to obtain information on their antibiotic resistance genes, we analyzed the genomes of six strains of c. bolteae and six strains of c. clostridioforme, isolated from human infection.
the acetyl-coa pathway, similar to that of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a major butyrate producer in the human gut, was only found in c. clostridioforme.
clostridium bolteae and clostridium clostridioforme, previously included in the complex c. clostridioforme in the group clostridium xiva, remain difficult to distinguish by phenotypic methods.
the genomes of c. clostridioforme were smaller, between  <dig> and 5927 kb, and contained  <dig> to  <dig> cdss.
the genomes of c. bolteae contained lactose operons involving pts system and complex regulation, which contribute to phenotypic differentiation from c. clostridioforme.
overall antimicrobial resistance genes were similar within a species, but strain-specific resistance genes were found.
most of the resistance genes detected in both species were previously characterized in other bacterial species.

the genome length of c. bolteae varied from  <dig> to 6398 kb, and  <dig> to  <dig> cdss were detected.
we discovered a new group of genes coding for rifampin resistance in c. bolteae.
c. bolteae 90b <dig> was resistant to phenicols and linezolide in producing a 23s rrna methyltransferase.
genomic comparison of c. bolteae and c. clostridiofrome revealed functional differences in butyrate pathways and in flagellar systems, which play a critical role within human microbiota.
some were part of mobile genetic elements suggesting that these commensals of the human microbiota act as reservoir of antimicrobial resistances.
these bacteria, prevailing in the human intestinal microbiota, are opportunistic pathogens with various drug susceptibility patterns.
