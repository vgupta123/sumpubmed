an exciting application of genetic network is to predict phenotypic consequences for environmental cues or genetic perturbations.
using yeast sporulation as a model system, we have assembled a genetic network from literature and exploited boolean network to predict sporulation efficiency change upon deleting individual genes.
we have also shown that a hybridized genetic network reconstructed from both temporal microarray data and literature is able to achieve a satisfactory prediction accuracy of the same quantitative phenotypes.
this case study illustrates the value of predicting quantitative phenotypes based on genetic network and provides a generic approach.
however, de novo prediction for quantitative phenotypes based on network topology is always a challenging task.
in addition, computational analysis reveals the robustness and hysteresis of the yeast sporulation network and uncovers several patterns of sporulation efficiency change caused by double gene deletion.
