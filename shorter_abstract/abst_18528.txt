investigation of yebc-like proteins in eukaryotes suggested that they may have originated from yebc_ii proteins and evolved a new function as a specific translational activator in mitochondria.
different holliday junction resolution systems and enzymes have been characterized from all three domains of life.
finally, additional phylum-specific genes associated with holliday junction resolution were predicted.
overall, our data provide new insights into the basic mechanism of holliday junction resolution and homologous recombination in bacteria.
only yebc_i proteins may play an important role in regulating ruvabc gene expression in bacteria.
homologous recombination is a fundamental cellular process that is most widely used by cells to rearrange genes and accurately repair dna double-strand breaks.
in this study, we conducted comparative genomics studies to identify a novel dna-binding protein, yebc, which may serve as a key transcriptional regulator that mainly regulates the gene expression of ruvabc resolvasome in bacteria.
further phylogenetic analysis of yebc protein sequences revealed two functionally different subtypes: yebc_i and yebc_ii.
it may result in the formation of a critical intermediate named holliday junction, which is a four-way dna junction and needs to be resolved to allow chromosome segregation.
