to explore the molecular genetic consequences of such a niche we subjected human  mscs to a po <dig> of 4Â mmhg and analyzed global gene expression and alternative splicing  by genome-exon microarray and rt-qpcr, and phenotype by western blot and immunostaining.
the results reveal that severe hypoxia imposes markedly different patterns of gene regulation of mscs compared with more moderate hypoxia.
this is the first study to report hypoxia-regulation of as in stem/progenitor cells and the first molecular genetic characterization of msc in a hypoxia-induced quiescent immobile state.
there was a coordinate induction of  <dig> out of  <dig> acidic keratins that along with other epithelial and cell adhesion markers implies a partial mesenchymal to epithelial transition.
functional assignments revealed unique profiles of gene expression with complex regulation of differentiation, extracellular matrix, intermediate filament and metabolic marker genes.
parallel analyses of a publicly available as study on human umbilical vein endothelial cells  showed that there was a strong cell-specific component with only  <dig> genes commonly regulated in hmscs and huvecs and  <dig> common differentially spliced genes.
we conclude that severe hypoxia confers a quiescent phenotype in hmscs that is reflected by both the transcriptome profile and gene-specific changes of splicosome actions.
the endosteum of the bone marrow provides a specialized hypoxic niche that may serve to preserve the integrity, pluripotency, longevity and stemness of resident mesenchymal stem cells .
