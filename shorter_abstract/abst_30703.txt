to investigate the structure-function of mttop <dig> and to target its activity for development of new tb therapy, it is desirable to have a rapid genetic assay for its catalytic activity, and potential bactericidal consequence from accumulation of its covalent complex.
the dna relaxation and cleavage complex accumulation of m. tuberculosis topoisomerase i can be measured with genetic assays in e. coli, facilitating rapid analysis of its activities, and discovery of new tb therapy targeting this essential enzyme.
the absence of cysteine residues in the mttop <dig> enzyme makes it an attractive system for introduction of potentially informative chemical or spectroscopic probes at specific positions via cysteine mutagenesis.
we show that plasmid-encoded recombinant mttop <dig> can complement the temperature sensitive topa function of e. coli strain as <dig>  moreover, expression of mttop1-g <dig> s enzyme with the toprim mutation that inhibits dna religation results in sos induction and loss of viability in e. coli.
one such mutant of mttop <dig> was utilized for fluorescence probe incorporation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurement with fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide substrate.
these cysteine substitution mutants were confirmed to have retained the relaxation activity.
