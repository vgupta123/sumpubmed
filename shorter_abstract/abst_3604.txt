blood samples were analysed for complete blood count, biochemical profile, venous blood gas, blood lipopolysaccharide  and lps-binding proteins .
a canonical discriminant analysis  was used to classify the animals into four ruminal ph classes  using haemoglobin, mean platelet volume, β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and reduced haemoglobin.
ruminal acidosis is responsible for the onset of different pathologies in dairy and feedlot cattle, but there are major difficulties in the diagnosis.
although additional studies are necessary to confirm the reliability of these discriminant functions, the use of plasma variables in a multifactorial model appeared to be useful for the evaluation of ruminal acidosis severity.
ruminal ph values were continuously measured using wireless sensors and compared with ph measurements obtained by rumenocentesis.
the regression coefficient comparing the ruminal ph values, obtained using the two methods, was  <dig>  .
feeding the ct, ms and hs led to differences in the time spent below the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ph thresholds and in several variables, including dry matter intake , ruminal nadir ph , mean ruminal ph , haemoglobin level , platelet count , hco3-  and lbp .
this study modelled the data obtained from various blood variables to identify those that could indicate the severity of ruminal acidosis.
