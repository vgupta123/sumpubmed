in this work we introduce a new statistical learning strategy, mi <dig> that addresses three common issues in previous methods simultaneously:  handling of continuous variables,  detection of more complex three-way relationships and  better differentiation of causal versus confounding relationships.
unlike control methods, mi <dig> effectively differentiated true causal models from confounding models.
in addition, mi <dig> significantly outperformed the control methods, including bayesian networks, classical two-way mutual information and a discrete version of mi <dig>  we then used mi <dig> and control methods to infer a regulatory network centered at the myc transcription factor from a published microarray dataset.
the mi <dig> network showed that limited sets of regulatory mechanisms are employed repeatedly to control the expression of large number of genes.
mi <dig> recovered major myc cofactors, and revealed major mechanisms involved in myc dependent transcriptional regulation, which are strongly supported by literature.
overall, our work demonstrates that mi <dig> outperforms the frequently used control methods, and provides a powerful method for inferring mechanistic relationships underlying biological and other complex systems.
probability based statistical learning methods such as mutual information and bayesian networks have emerged as a major category of tools for reverse engineering mechanistic relationships from quantitative biological data.
we test the mi <dig> algorithm using both synthetic and experimental data.
models selected by mi <dig> were numerically and biologically distinct from those selected by control methods.
