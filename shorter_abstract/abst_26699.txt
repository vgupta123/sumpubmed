this gene-by-gene analysis reveals a wide range of genes related to both virulence behaviour and the strain differences that have been relatively recently acquired from other sequence backgrounds.
these findings highlight the central role of the availability of homologous substrates in evolution mediated by horizontal exchange, and suggest that some components of the supposedly stable 'core genome' may actually be favoured targets for integration of foreign sequences because of their degree of conservation.
in addition, clear examples of horizontal exchange in genes associated with 'core' metabolic functions were identified, supported by differences between the sequenced strains, including: ftsk, xerd and pola.
these frequently involve single genes or small numbers of genes that are not associated with transposases or bacteriophage genes, nor with inverted repeats typically used as markers for horizontal transfer.
this approach has been used to analyze the two available genome sequences of h. pylori.
in this study we describe a new methodology combining aspects of established signature analysis with textual analysis approaches.
new implementations of signature analysis that can be applied on a gene-by-gene basis for the identification of horizontally acquired sequences are described.
