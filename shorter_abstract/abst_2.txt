the goal of many proteomics experiments is to determine the abundance of proteins in biological samples, and the variation thereof in various physiological conditions.
we compare the results of our alignment method to pepper and openms, and compare alignment accuracy achieved by different versions of our method utilizing various data characteristics.
alignment methods should be flexible enough to utilize all available data, particularly with recent advancements in experimental separation methods.
we present a method to address one of the essential steps in proteomics data processing - the matching of peptide measurements across samples.
our method results in increased match recall rates and similar or improved mismatch rates compared to pepper and openms feature-based alignment.
we also show that the inclusion of drift time and product ion information results in higher recall rates and more confident matches, without increases in error rates.
based on the results presented here, we argue that the incorporation of ion mobility drift time and product ion information are worthy pursuits.
prior to analyzing these information-rich datasets, raw data must undergo several computational processing steps.
we describe a novel method for label-free proteomics data alignment with the ability to incorporate previously unused aspects of the data, particularly ion mobility drift times and product ion information.
