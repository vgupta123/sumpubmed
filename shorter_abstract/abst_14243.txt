induced defense response in alexandrium thus can directly affect further species interactions by reducing phenotypic variation and can result in genotype-dependent ecological trade-offs.
our results show that the grazer cues diminish phenotypic variability in a population by driving the phenotype towards a common defended morphotype.
we compared the expression of the known inducible defensive traits paralytic shellfish toxin content, and chain length.
we further showed that the expression of the sxta gene that initiates the paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis pathway does not correlate with an observed increase in the paralytic shellfish toxin analogue saxitoxin, and that toxin induction differs in its physiological characteristics in both strains.
here we analysed the plastic response towards a grazer of two genotypes of the marine dinoflagellate alexandrium fundyense, evaluated the similarity of this response and discuss potential strain-specific trade-offs.
plastic responses often modify a suite of traits and can be triggered by both abiotic and biotic changes.
