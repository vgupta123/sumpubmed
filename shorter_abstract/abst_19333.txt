we have previously described the construction of a herpes simplex virus  <dig>  bac and the use of an allele replacement strategy to construct hsv- <dig> recombinants.
finally, we incorporate the lambda phage recombination sites directly into an hsv- <dig> bac vector for direct recombination of gene cassettes using the phage lambda clonase-driven recombination reaction.
this strategy enables any dna fragment containing the phage attl recombination sites to be efficiently inserted into the attr sites of the allele replacement vector using phage lambda clonase.
such modified genomes have potential uses in understanding viral pathogenesis, gene identification and characterization, and the development of new viral vectors and vaccines.
here we describe the incorporation of a phage lambda recombination system into an allele replacement vector.
we also describe how the incorporation of egfp into the allele replacement vector can facilitate the selection of the desired cross-over recombinant bacs when the allele replacement reaction is a viral gene deletion.
together, these improvements to the techniques of hsv bac mutagenesis will facilitate the construction of recombinant herpes simplex viruses and viral vectors.
while the bac mutagenesis procedure is a powerful method to generate hsv- <dig> recombinants, particularly in the absence of selective marker in eukaryotic culture, the mutagenesis procedure is still difficult and cumbersome.
