we make the first report of induction of a nod-like receptor family member in response to salmonella endotoxin in chicken macrophages.
the focus of this study is kinetic and global transcriptional analysis of the chicken macrophage response to in vitro stimulation with endotoxin from salmonella typhimurium- <dig>
the nfkbia, il1b, il <dig> and ccl <dig> genes were consistently induced at all times after endotoxin treatment.
qpcr demonstrated that endotoxin exposure significantly affected the mrna expression of il1b, il <dig>  il <dig>  and tlr <dig>  but not il <dig> and ifng in hd  <dig> cells.
bacteria require endotoxin, a complex lipopolysaccharide, for outer membrane permeability and the host interprets endotoxin as a signal to initiate an innate immune response.
as above using an in vitro model of chicken response to endotoxin, our data revealed the kinetics of gene networks involved in host response to endotoxin and extend the known complexity of networks in chicken immune response to gram-negative bacteria such as salmonella.
nlrc <dig> , an intracellular receptor, was induced in hd <dig> cells treated with endotoxin.
the induction of nfkbia, il1b, il <dig>  ccl <dig> genes is a consistent signature of host response to endotoxin over time.
ingenuity pathway analysis showed that 10% of the total de genes were involved in inflammatory response.
three,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the total de inflammatory response genes were significantly differentially expressed with endotoxin stimulation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hps, respectively.
