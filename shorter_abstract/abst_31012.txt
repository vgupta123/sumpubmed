the manatee chromosome painting data confirm that the associations 1/ <dig> and 5/ <dig> phylogenetically link afrotherian species and show that afrotheria is a natural clade.
recent phylogenomic results place sirenia in afrotheria and with elephants and rock hyraxes in paenungulata.
here we report on the chromosome painting of the florida manatee.
sirenia  have no evolutionary relationship with other marine mammals, despite similarities in adaptations and body shape.
it would be useful to test these conclusions with chromosome painting in hyraxes.
the human autosomal and x chromosome paints delimited a total of  <dig> homologous segments in the manatee genome.
the syntenies of other human chromosomes were disrupted in the manatee genome into two to five segments.
the hybridization pattern revealed that  <dig>  associations of human chromosome segments are found in the manatee genome: 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  2/ <dig> , 3/ <dig> , 3/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  10/ <dig> , 11/ <dig>  12/ <dig> , 14/ <dig>  16/ <dig> and 18/ <dig>
if afrotherians are not at the root of the eutherian tree, then the 10/12/ <dig> association could be one of a suite of derived associations linking afrotherian taxa.
the synteny of nine of the  <dig> human autosomal chromosomes  and the x chromosome were found intact in the manatee.
sirenia and hyracoidea are the two afrotherian orders as yet unstudied by comparative molecular cytogenetics.
if afrotheria is basal to eutherians, this association could be part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype.
