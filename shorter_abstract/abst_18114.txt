several methods have been developed to handle missing values in microarray data, but it is unclear how applicable these methods are to e-map data because of their pairwise nature and the significantly larger number of missing values.
we compare local and global imputation approaches across a variety of distinct e-map datasets, showing that both are competitive and preferable to filling in with zeros.
the datasets resulting from e-map experiments typically take the form of a symmetric pairwise matrix of interaction scores.
in addition we show that these methods are effective in an e-map from a different species, suggesting that pairwise imputation techniques will be increasingly useful as analogous epistasis mapping techniques are developed in different species.
we address the problem of missing value imputation for e-maps, and suggest the use of symmetric nearest neighbor based approaches as they offer consistently accurate imputations across multiple datasets in a tractable manner.
therefore our method potentially expands the number of mapped epistatic interactions.
epistatic miniarray profiling  is a high-throughput approach capable of quantifying aggravating or alleviating genetic interactions between gene pairs.
an effective method for imputing interactions would therefore increase the types of possible analysis, as well as increase the potential to identify novel functional interactions between gene pairs.
