in particular, three unigenes  encoding fatty acid desaturase with high expression levels in the fast oil accumulation stage compared with the initial stage of seed development were identified.
in  <dig>  seeds from p. ostii have been identified as novel resource of α-linolenic acid  for seed oil production and development in china.

however, the molecular mechanism on biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in tree peony seeds remains unknown.
these data lay the foundation for further understanding of molecular mechanism responsible for lipid biosynthesis and the high unsaturated fatty acids  accumulation.
in this study, lipid accumulation contents were measured using gc-ms methods across developing tree peony seeds, which exhibited an extraordinary ala content  in p. ostii mature seeds.
tree peony  is known for its excellent ornamental and medicinal values.
this study provides the first comprehensive genomic resources characterizing tree peony seeds gene expression at the transcriptional level.
using this data we identified  <dig> unigenes that may be involved in de novo fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.
a total of  <dig> million 100-bp paired-end reads were generated from six libraries, which identified  <dig>  contigs.
