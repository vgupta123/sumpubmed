further, the complex segregation analysis provides suggestive evidence that addison's disease in the portuguese water dog is inherited under the control of a single, autosomal recessive locus.
in particular, the heritability and mode of inheritance have not been defined for the portuguese water dog although addison's is known to be prevalent in the breed.
the analyses present clear evidence that establishes addison's disease as an inherited disorder in the portuguese water dog with an estimate of heritability of  <dig>  ; there were no differences in risk for disease across sexes .
the high heritability and mode of inheritance of addison's disease in the portuguese water dog should enable the detection of segregating markers in a genome-wide scan and the identification of a locus linked to addison's.
addison's disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, has been reported in many individual dogs, although some breeds exhibit a greater incidence than the population as a whole.
