our data provide an important insight into the mechanistic regulation and function of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and their isomirs in barley under different p conditions.
many antisense srnas of mir <dig> and a few for mir <dig> were also detected, but they did not seem to be regulated by p. intriguingly, the lowest expressed member, hvu-mir399k, had four-fold more antisense srnas than sense srnas, and furthermore under p sufficiency, the antisense srnas are more frequent than the sense srnas.
however, the response of mir <dig> and mir <dig> to p conditions in barley has not been investigated.
we identified a potential regulatory network among mir <dig>  its target hvpho <dig> and target mimics hvips <dig> and hvips <dig> in barley under p-deficient and p-sufficient conditions.
in this study, we investigated the expression profiles of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in barley  under p-deficient and p-sufficient conditions.
surprisingly, a few small rnas  derived from the single-stranded loops of the hairpin structures of mir399b and mir399e- <dig> were also found to be able to cleave their predicted targets in vivo.
