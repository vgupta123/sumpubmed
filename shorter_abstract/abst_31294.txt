we also found that the use of cppls with codon representation gave significantly better classification results than both imm with protein  and with dna .
further, although the mean performance was similar, the variation of cppls performance on codon representation was significantly smaller than for imm .
comparisons between the methods were performed on dna, codon and protein sequences with highly conserved genes taken from several species with different genomic properties.
in this respect, we promote a novel multivariate method known as canonical powered partial least squares  as an alternative to the commonly used interpolated markov model .
