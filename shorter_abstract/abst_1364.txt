however, separation of time scales and disparity in species population, two common features of intracellular networks, make stochastic simulation of such networks computationally prohibitive.
in addition, we introduce the computational singular perturbation  method as a means of systematically partitioning fast and slow networks and computing relaxation times for convergence.
while recent work has addressed each of these challenges separately, a generic algorithm that can simultaneously tackle disparity in time scales and population scales in stochastic systems is currently lacking.
we use several prototype and biological examples, including a gene expression model displaying bistability, to demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and applicability of the hymsmc method.
in the face of such evidence, it is important that intracellular networks are simulated with stochastic algorithms that can capture molecular fluctuations.
the proposed hymsmc method blends stochastic singular perturbation concepts, to deal with potential stiffness, with a hybrid of exact and coarse-grained stochastic algorithms, to cope with separation in population sizes.
