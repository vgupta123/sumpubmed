the propensity for host switching, and thus the potential for invasive behaviour, is found in a. crassus, a. novaezelandiae and a. papernai, and thus may be common to the group.
anguillicolidae yamaguti,  <dig> is a family of parasitic nematode infecting fresh-water eels of the genus anguilla, comprising five species in the genera anguillicola and anguillicoloides.
genetic diversity within the african species anguillicoloides papernai was suggestive of cryptic taxa, as was the finding of distinct lineages of anguillicoloides novaezelandiae in new zealand and tasmania.
the described species may hide cryptic taxa, identified here by dna taxonomy, and this dna barcoding approach may assist in tracking species invasions.
anguillicoloides crassus is of particular importance, as it has recently spread from its endemic range in the eastern pacific to europe and north america, where it poses a significant threat to new, na√Øve hosts such as the economic important eel species anguilla anguilla and anguilla rostrata.
