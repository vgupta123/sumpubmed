the future use of ostreococcus tauri and physcomitrella patens as biological models should allow us to obtain a better insight into the functional importance of wox <dig> og genes.
atwox <dig> appeared to affect the floral transition.
a mutational insertion upstream of the atwox <dig> homeodomain sequence led to abnormal root development, a delay in the floral transition and premature anther differentiation.
in arabidopsis thaliana, atwox <dig> was dynamically expressed during primary and lateral root initiation and development, in gynoecium and during embryo development.
the wox <dig> og contained the most conserved plant wox proteins including the only wox detected in the highly proliferating basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism ostreococcus tauri.
our data provide evidence in favor of the wox <dig> og as the clade containing the most conserved wox genes and established a functional link to organ initiation and development in arabidopsis, most likely by preventing premature differentiation.
the wuschel related homeobox  family proteins are key regulators implicated in the determination of cell fate in plants by preventing cell differentiation.
compared to atwox <dig>  the gene expression profile of atwox <dig> was restricted to the early stages of lateral root formation and specific to developing anthers.
hence, we first validated the limits of the wox <dig> orthologous group  using the occurrence of other clade specific signatures and conserved intron insertion sites.
secondly, a functional analysis using expression data and mutants was undertaken.
a recent wox phylogeny, based on wox homeodomains, showed that all of the physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii wox proteins clustered into a single orthologous group.
a large expansion of the wox family was observed after the separation of mosses from other land plants and before monocots and dicots have arisen.
