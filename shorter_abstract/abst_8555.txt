app automates the processing of proteomics tasks such as peptide identification, validation and quantitation from lc-ms/ms data and allows easy integration of many separate proteomics tools.
additionally, app logs execution information on all executed tasks and generated results, simplifying information management and validation.
mass spectrometry analyses of complex protein samples yield large amounts of data and specific expertise is needed for data analysis, in addition to a dedicated computer infrastructure.
the modular nature of app allows complex workflows to be managed and distributed, speeding up throughput and setup.
