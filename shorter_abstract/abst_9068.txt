these novel αdenv-grpi introns provide a striking alternative to other rna based approaches for the transgenic suppression of denv in transformed mosquito cells and tissues.
notably, these results show that the αdenv-grpi 9v <dig>  designed to be active against all forms of dengue virus, effectively targeted the denv- <dig> ngc genome in a sequence specific manner.
dengue viruses  are one of the most important viral diseases in the world with approximately  <dig> million infections and  <dig>  deaths each year.
we have successfully targeted two different uracil bases on the positive sense genomic strand within the highly conserved 5'-3' cyclization sequence  region common to all serotypes of denv with our αdenv-grpis.
the effectiveness of these αdenv-grpis to target infecting denv genomes is also validated in transfected or transformed aedes mosquito cell lines upon infection with unattenuated denv- <dig> ngc.
analysis shows that our αdenv-grpis have the ability to effectively trans-splice the denv genome in situ.
the current lack of an approved tetravalent vaccine and ineffective insecticide control measures warrant a search for alternatives to effectively combat denv.
several anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  were designed and tested for their ability to target denv- <dig> ngc genomes in situ.
