hepatitis b virus  infections play an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma .
we conclude that hbx may act as the promoting factor by inhibiting dna repair causing dna damage and accumulation of errors, thereby contributing to hcc development.
hbx is known to interact with dna helicase components of tfiih, a basal transcriptional factor and an integral component of dna excision repair.
yeast and mammalian cells expressing hbxwt conferred hypersensitivity to uv irradiation, which is interpreted as a basic deficiency in nucleotide excision repair.
in this study, the functional relevance of this association was further investigated in the context to dna repair.
by site-directed mutagenesis hbx's critical residues for interaction with tfiih were identified.
