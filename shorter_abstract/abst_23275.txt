this induction occurs despite the presence of amino acids in the growth medium and is a unique response to xylulose, not triggered by naturally available carbon sources.
we discuss the possible implications of our results for explaining how cells maintain the balance between supply and demand of amino acids during growth in evolutionary ‘familiar’ vs. ‘novel’ conditions.
we previously reported that growth on xylulose induces the expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes in multiple natural yeast isolates.
furthermore, the reduction in amino-acid biosynthesis gene expression on xylulose was tightly correlated with the improvement in growth rate, suggesting that internal depletion of amino-acids presented a major bottleneck limiting growth in xylulose.
notably, the most significant change in gene expression was the loss of amino acid biosynthesis gene induction.
propagating these strains for ~ <dig> generations on xylulose significantly improved their growth rate.
