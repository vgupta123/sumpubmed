although large amount of ppis data for different species has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, current ppi pairs obtained with experimental methods cover only a fraction of the complete ppi networks, and further, the experimental methods for identifying ppis are both time-consuming and expensive.
hence, it is urgent and challenging to develop automated computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict ppis.
protein-protein interactions  play crucial roles in the execution of various cellular processes and form the basis of biological mechanisms.
we present here a novel hierarchical pca-eelm  model to predict protein-protein interactions only using the information of protein sequences.
the ensembling of extreme learning machine removes the dependence of results on initial random weights and improves the prediction performance.
experimental results demonstrate that proposed pca-eelm outperforms the svm method by 5-fold cross-validation.
in the proposed method,  <dig> protein pairs retrieved from the dip database were encoded into feature vectors by using four kinds of protein sequences information.
