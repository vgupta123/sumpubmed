chromowave generated multi-chromosomal pattern featuring low expression in chromosomes 1p,  <dig>  9q,  <dig>   <dig>  and 19q.
in this study, fish data showed that monosomy was frequently associated with diffuse low gene expression on chromosome 1p and 19q but not on chromosomes  <dig>  9q,  <dig> and  <dig>  comparative genomic hybridisation, allelic polymorphism analysis and methylation studies are in progress in order to identify the various mechanisms involved in this multi-chromosomal expression pattern.
fish analysis indicated that monosomy 1p and 19q was a frequent feature of tumours displaying the chromowave pattern but that allelic loss on chromosomes  <dig>  9q,  <dig> and  <dig> was much less common.
expression microarrays represent a powerful technique for the simultaneous investigation of thousands of genes.
this pattern was not only statistically robust but also clinically relevant as it was predictive of favourable outcome.
the ability to detect expression changes of spatially related genes and to map their position on chromosomes makes chromowave a valuable screening method for the identification and display of regional gene expression changes of clinical relevance.
