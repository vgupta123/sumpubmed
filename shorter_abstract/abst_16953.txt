finally the ms data and the labeling information it contains have to be assembled into a data format usable by flux analysis software .
it represents the core framework for a standardized workflow and data processing.
this tool streamlines the transfer of data from extraction via correction tools to 13c-flux software by processing ms data from stable isotope labeling experiments.
before and after data correction, several checks can be performed to ensure accurate data.
however, before the mass spectrometric data can be used it has to be corrected for biases caused by naturally occurring stable isotopes, by the analytical technique employed, or by the biological sample itself.
it allows the correction of large and heterogeneous ms datasets for the presence of naturally occurring stable isotopes, initial biomass and several mass spectrometry effects.
here we describe ims2flux, software developed to automate, standardize and connect the data flow between mass spectrometric measurements and flux analysis programs.
metabolic flux analysis has become an established method in systems biology and functional genomics.
in order to facilitate high-throughput metabolic flux analysis, the automation of multiple steps in the analytical workflow is necessary.
the corrected data may be returned in a variety of formats including those used by metabolic flux analysis software such as 13cflux, openflux and 13cflux <dig>
the most common approach for determining intracellular metabolic fluxes is to utilize mass spectrometry in combination with stable isotope labeling experiments.
