in cultured neonatal rats rgcs, the mtt assay showed that glutamate induced a concentration- and time-dependent toxicity.
bis-tacrine and memantine prevented glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively.
our results showed that bis-tacrine had neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced rgcs damage in vitro and in vivo, possibly through the drug's anti-nmda receptor effects.
we tested the effects of bis-tacrine against glutamate-induced rat rgcs damage in vitro and in vivo.
in vivo, tunel analysis and retrograde labeling analysis found that pretreatment with bis-tacrine induced a significant neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced rgcs damage.
