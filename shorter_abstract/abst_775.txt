phylogenetic tree of mca catalytic p <dig> domains coincides well with the domain structure and the phylogenies based on 16s rrna.
cyanobacteria are an ancient group of photoautotrophic prokaryotes with wide variations in genome size and ecological habitat.
the existence and quantity of mca genes in unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria are a function of the genome size and ecological habitat.
mcas have been identified in several prokaryotes, fungi and plants; however, knowledge about cyanobacterial metacaspases still remains obscure.
a total of  <dig> putative mcas were identified, which are abundant in filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria and acaryochloris marina mbic  <dig> and absent in all prochlorococcus and marine synechococcus strains, except synechococcus sp.
ten types and a total of  <dig> additional domains were identified, most of which involves in signal transduction.
pcc  <dig>  the cys-his dyad of caspase superfamily is conserved, while mutations  are also detected in some cyanobacteria.
apoptotic related nacht domain was also found in two cyanobacterial mcas.
mcas of family α and β seem to evolve separately and the recruitment of wd <dig> additional domain occurs later than the divergence of the two families.
metacaspases  are cysteine proteinases that have sequence homology to caspases and play essential roles in programmed cell death .
