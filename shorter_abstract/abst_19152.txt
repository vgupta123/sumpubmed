several curcin genes have been identified in the jatropha genome.
in addition, the c <dig> mrna transcripts were undetectable in the endosperm of t <dig> seeds of l <dig> and l <dig>  the results demonstrated that the expression of the c <dig> gene was specifically down-regulated or silenced by the double-stranded rna-mediated rna interference generated from the rnai cassette.
despite this promising application, jatropha seeds contain two major toxic components, namely phorbol esters and curcins.
the c <dig> protein content in endosperm of l <dig> and l <dig> seeds was greatly reduced or undetectable, while the c2a proteins in young leaves of t0- <dig> and t0- <dig> plants were unaffected.
these compounds would reduce commercial value of seed cake and raise safety and environment concerns on jatropha plantation and processing.
a marker-free rnai construct carrying a Î²-estradiol-regulated cre/loxp system and a c <dig> promoter-driven rnai cassette for c <dig> gene was made and used to generate marker-free transgenic rnai plants to specifically silence the c <dig> gene in the endosperm of j. curcas.
plants of transgenic line l <dig>  derived from t0- <dig>  carry two copies of marker-free rnai cassette, whereas plants of l <dig>  derived from t0- <dig>  harbored one copy of marker-free rnai cassette and three copies of closely linked and yet truncated hpt genes.
the c <dig> promoter-driven rnai cassette for the c <dig> gene in transgenic plants was functional and heritable.
the marker-free transgenic plants and curcin-deficient seeds developed in this study provided a solution for the toxicity of curcins in jatropha seeds and addressed the safety concerns of the marker genes in transgenic plants on the environments.
among which, the curcin  <dig>  gene is identified to be specifically expressed in endosperm, whereas the curcin 2a  is mainly expressed in young leaves.
both c <dig> transcripts and c <dig> proteins were greatly down-regulated or silenced in the endosperm of transgenic j. curcas.
