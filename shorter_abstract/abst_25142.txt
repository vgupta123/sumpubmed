sublethal doses of tnt and rdx had no significant effects on the survival and growth of earthworms, but significantly reduced cocoon and juvenile counts.
sublethal doses of tnt and rdx affected many biological pathways from innate immune response to oogenesis, leading to reduced reproduction without affecting survival and growth.
a complex interaction between mixtures of rdx and tnt was observed at the gene expression level that requires further study of the dynamics of gene expression and reproductive activities in e. fetida.
the reduced effects on gene expression in the mixture exposure suggest that rdx might interact in an antagonistic manner with tnt at the gene expression level.
lethality, growth and reproductive endpoints were measured.
the disagreement between gene expression and reproduction results may be attributed to sampling time, absence of known reproduction-related genes, and lack of functional information for many differentially expressed transcripts.
in order to understand the joint effects of tnt and rdx on earthworms, an important ecological and bioindicator species at the molecular level, we sampled worms  exposed singly or jointly to tnt  and rdx  for  <dig> days and profiled gene expression in an interwoven loop designed microarray experiment using a 4k-cdna array.
