our results implicate a conserved role of a wnt5/fz <dig> signaling pathway in islet formation during pancreatic development.
we report a novel role of wnt signaling in organogenesis using the formation of the islet during pancreatic development as a model tissue.
we used the advantages of the zebrafish to visualize and document this process in living embryos and demonstrated that insulin-positive cells actively migrate to form an islet.
we used morpholinos , sequence-specific translational inhibitors, and time-lapse imaging analysis to show that the wnt- <dig> ligand and the fz- <dig> receptor are required for proper insulin-cell migration in zebrafish.
