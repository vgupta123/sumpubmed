these amino acid substitutions conferred different levels of rifampicin resistance.
we found parallel mutations within the rpob gene encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase.
one prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance.
until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments.
the resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment.
beneficial mutations play an essential role in bacterial adaptation, yet little is known about their fitness effects across genetic backgrounds and environments.
however, the rpob mutations had different fitness effects across three genetic backgrounds and six environments.
their fitness effects depend on the environment and the genetic background, providing glimpses into the prevalence of epistasis and pleiotropy.
in this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of escherichia coli b that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for  <dig> generations at high temperature .
we describe resistance mutations that are not necessarily costly in the absence of antibiotics or compensatory mutations but are highly beneficial at high temperature and low glucose.
