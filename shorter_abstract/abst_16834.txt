pa- <dig> has been demonstrated to have better activity under anaerobic condition at  <dig>  μg/ml, indicating an optimized dose that is required for overcoming the detoxifying mechanisms of m. tuberculosis and inducing its death.
in this context, pa- <dig> was analyzed for its activity against latent tuberculosis under anaerobic conditions and compared with rifampicin  and pyrazinamide .
pa- <dig> at an optimum concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml showed enhanced bactericidal activity, resulting in 0 cfu/ml growth when compared to rif and pza at normal ph and anaerobic condition.
further docking studies revealed that a combinatorial structure of pa- <dig> conjugated with moxifloxacin  has the highest binding affinity with the wild type and mutant ddn receptor.
to contain this situation, new anti-tuberculosis drugs and reduced treatment regimens are imperative.
