the most conserved pattern was observed at the amino acid level: strong alanine over-representation was observed at the second amino acid position of highly expressed proteins.
although the sequence requirements for translation initiation regions have been frequently analysed, usually the highly expressed genes are not treated as a separate dataset.
in addition to the detailed analysis of the nucleotide and codon frequencies we compared the n-termini of highly expressed proteins to the n-termini of all proteins coded in the genome.
