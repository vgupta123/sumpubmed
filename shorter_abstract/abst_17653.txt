we were able to elucidate and describe the genomic structure and the transcription of a functional stk <dig> gene within the subclass palaeognathae, but we could only find degenerate remnants of stk <dig> in all neognath birds analyzed.
within the subclass palaeognathae we analyzed the white-throated tinamou , the african ostrich  and the emu .
for the african ostrich we were able to generate a  <dig>  bp long genomic contig and an mrna sequence that encodes a protein showing highly significant similarity to stk <dig> proteins from other vertebrates.
in this study we analyzed the genomic locus and expression of stk <dig> in the class aves, using a combination of large scale next generation sequencing data analysis and traditional pcr.
this led us to the conclusion that stk <dig> became a unitary pseudogene in the evolutionary history of the class aves at the paleognath-neognath branch point during the late cretaceous period about  <dig> million years ago.
in contrast, in all  <dig> neognath birds analyzed, we could not find evidence for the existence of a functional copy of stk <dig> or its expression.
it has been shown to phosphorylate vimentin and might play a role in spermatogenesis and organ ontogenesis.
we hypothesize that the pseudogenization of stk <dig> might have become fixed in neognaths due to either genetic redundancy or a non-orthologous gene displacement and present potential candidate genes for such an incident.
