we sequenced, annotated and compared draft genomes of p. rettgeri, p. sneebia, p. alcalifaciens, and p. burhodogranariea.
the presence of t3ss islands in all of the genomes reveal that their presence is not sufficient to indicate virulence towards d. melanogaster, since some of the t3ss-bearing isolates are known to cause little mortality.
we compared the genomes of these isolates to draft genomes of four providencia isolated from the human gut and found that the core genome size does not substantially change upon inclusion of the human isolates.
we found that these providencia species share a large core genome, but also possess distinct sets of genes that are unique to each isolate.
the providencia species examined here are characterized by high degree of genomic similarity which will likely extend to other species and isolates within this genus.
these bacterial species that were all originally isolated as infections of wild drosophila melanogaster and have been previously shown to vary in virulence to experimentally infected flies.
bacteria belonging to the genus providencia have been isolated from numerous and varied environments.
