despite multiple studies have attempted to identify candidate n protein regions involved in rna binding and protein multimerization for tospovirus using yeast two-hybrid systems  and site-directed mutagenesis, the tospovirus ribonucleocapsids  remains largely uncharacterized at the molecular level and the lack of structural information prevents detailed insight into these interactions.
crucially, the interaction model proposed here for grsv n is further corroborated by the all available mutational studies on tswv  n, so far.
here we used the nucleoprotein structure of lacv  and molecular dynamics simulations to access the structure and dynamics of the nucleoprotein from tospovirus grsv .
in addition, the proposed model may shed light on the mechanisms of rnp shaping and could allow the identification of essential amino acid residues as potential targets for tospovirus control strategies.
our data will help designing further and more accurate mutational and functional studies of tospovirus n proteins.
tospovirus is a plant-infecting genus within the family bunyaviridae, which also includes four animal-infecting genera: hantavirus, nairovirus, phlebovirus and orthobunyavirus.
