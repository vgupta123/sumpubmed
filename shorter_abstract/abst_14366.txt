the cpdnas of b. plumosa and t. expeditiones are amongst the smallest and most gene dense chloroplast genomes in the core chlorophyta.
the presence of bacterial genes, including genes typically found in mobile elements, suggest that these have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer, which may have been facilitated by the occurrence of obligate intracellular bacteria in these siphonous algae.

we present the complete cpdnas of bryopsis plumosa and tydemania expeditiones, as well as a re-annotated cpdna of b. hypnoides, which was shown to contain a higher number of genes than originally published.
a 13 kb region was identified with several freestanding open reading frames  of putative bacterial origin, including a large orf  closely related to bacterial rhs-family genes.
the cpdna of b. hypnoides differs from that of b. plumosa mainly in the presence of long intergenic spacers, and a large trna region.
the cpdna of t. expeditiones is  <dig>  bp long and contains  <dig> unique genes.
little is known about the diversity of chloroplast genomes  in this group, and about the possible consequences of intracellular bacteria on genome composition of the host.
the cpdna of b. plumosa is  <dig>  bp long and contains  <dig> unique genes.
as in b. plumosa, several regions were identified with orfs of possible bacterial origin, including genes involved in mobile functions , and orfs showing close similarity with bacterial dna methyltransferases.
