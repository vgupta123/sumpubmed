the presence of apoptotic processes was observed in all the  <dig> groups; while anti-apoptotic processes only existed in  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups.
additionally, according to node degree, network comparison identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> important genes or proteins  in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups, respectively.
the process of apoptosis stimulation by external signals, among the top  <dig> processes, was consistently enriched in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h groups;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> processes overlapped between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups,  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, and  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups, respectively.
the jaccard similarity index revealed a higher level of similarity between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups than that between  <dig> h and  <dig> h groups.
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury may simultaneously result in functional variation of multiple genes/pathways.
our study aimed to systematically analyze the time-dependent variation in the expression of multiple pathways and networks within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
by uploading  <dig> ischemia-related genes into the metacore software, the variation in the expression of multiple pathways and networks in  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury had been analyzed.
time-dependent treatment can be utilized to reduce apoptosis, which may activate anti-apoptotic pathways within  <dig> h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
