a total of  <dig> target genes were predicted for the differentially expressed mirnas, including several genes that have been reported to be implicated in proanthocyanidins  accumulation.
in addition, dka-mir396g and mir2911a may regulate their target genes associated with glucosylation and insolubilization of tannin precursors.
in this study, two small rna libraries established using â€˜eshi no.
micrornas  have been shown to play key roles in regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level, but mirnas associated with natural deastringency of chinese pollination-constant nonastringent persimmon  have never been identified.
all of these mirnas might play key roles in the regulation of astringency in persimmon fruits under normal development conditions.
expression profiles of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were validated by stem loop qrt-pcr.
among them, mir395p-3p and mir858b may regulate bhlh and myb, respectively, which are influenced by spl under the control of mir156j-5p and in turn regulate the structural genes involved in pa biosynthesis.
in addition, two transcription factors, a grf and a bhlh, were experimentally confirmed as the targets of dka-mir <dig> and dka-mir <dig>  respectively.
based on sequence similarity and hairpin structure prediction,  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified using persimmon transcriptome data.
