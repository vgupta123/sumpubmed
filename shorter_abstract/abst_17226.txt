increased expression in males was confirmed in  <dig> of  <dig> by qpcr using cdna from the whole telencephalon; all of these appeared to be located on the z sex chromosome.
six of the genes also showed increased expression in one or more of the song control nuclei of males at post-hatching day  <dig>  although the function of half of the genes is presently unknown, we have identified three as: 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type iv, methylcrotonyl-coa carboxylase, and sorting nexin  <dig>
the present study examined the potential role for sex-biased gene expression during development of sexually dimorphic singing behavior and associated song nuclei in juvenile zebra finches.
recent evidence suggests that some sex differences in brain and behavior might result from direct genetic effects, and not solely the result of the organizational effects of steroid hormones.
a microarray screen revealed more than  <dig> putative genes  exhibiting sex differences in the telencephalon of developing zebra finches.
