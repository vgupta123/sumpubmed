in this study we investigated pollen-mediated gene flow from transgenic to nontransgenic switchgrass in a 3-year field experiment performed in oliver springs, tennessee, u.s.a. using a modified nelder wheel design.
however, these data suggest pollen-mediated gene flow is likely to occur up to, at least,  <dig> m. this study gives baseline data useful to determine isolation distances and other management practices should transgenic switchgrass be grown commercially in relevant environments.
gene flow from transgenic cultivars would likely be of regulatory concern.

to assess pollen movement, pollen traps were placed at  <dig> m intervals from the pollen-source plot in the four cardinal directions extending to  <dig> m,  <dig> m,  <dig> m, and  <dig> m to the north, south, west, and east, respectively.
to assess pollination rates, nontransgenic ‘alamo 2’ switchgrass clones were planted in pairs adjacent to pollen traps.
in these experiments we found transgenic pollen movement and hybridization rates to be inversely associated with distance.
genetic engineering has been used to alter cell walls for more facile bioprocessing and biofuel yield.
transgenic progeny production detected in each pollen-recipient plot decreased with increased distance from the edge of the transgenic plot .
the frequency of transgenic progeny detected in the eastward plots  ranged from  <dig> % at  <dig> m to  <dig> % at  <dig> m.
in the eastward direction there was a 98% decrease in ofp pollen grains from  <dig> to  <dig> m from the pollen-source plot .
the planted area  contained sexually compatible pollen source and pollen receptor switchgrass plants.
one hundred clonal switchgrass ‘alamo’ plants transgenic for an orange-fluorescent protein  and hygromycin resistance were used as the pollen source; whole plants, including pollen, were orange-fluorescent.
it is wind-pollinated and considered to be an obligate outcrosser.
