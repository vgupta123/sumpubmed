a total of  <dig> unigenes ,  <dig> % of which were novel in chickpea, were derived by cluster assembly and sequence alignment of  <dig> ests.
gene ontology functional classification terms , were retrieved for  <dig>  sequences, and  <dig> sequences were further annotated with  <dig> enzyme commission  codes and were mapped to  <dig> different kegg pathways.
these results can be used to identify suitable targets for manipulating the drought-tolerance trait in chickpea.
in addition, expression status of  <dig> unigenes in response to terminal drought stress was evaluated using macro-array .
our study compares not only genes that are up- and down-regulated in a drought-tolerant genotype under terminal drought stress and a drought susceptible genotype but also between the bulks of the selected rils exhibiting extreme phenotypes.
more than 50% of the genes identified have been shown to be associated with drought stress in chickpea for the first time.
we generated expressed sequence tags  by suppression subtraction hybridization  to identify differentially expressed genes in drought-tolerant and -susceptible genotypes in chickpea.
chickpea  is an important grain-legume crop that is mainly grown in rainfed areas, where terminal drought is a major constraint to its productivity.
est libraries were generated by ssh from root and shoot tissues of ic <dig>  and icc  <dig>  exposed to terminal drought conditions by the dry down method.
this study not only serves as resource for marker discovery, but can provide a better insight into the selection of candidate genes  associated with drought tolerance.
ssh libraries were also constructed by using  <dig> sets of bulks prepared from the rna of root tissues from selected recombinant inbred lines   for the extreme high and low root biomass phenotype.
