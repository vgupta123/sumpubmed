these data give us insight into how snps impact gene regulation and support the notion that peripheral blood may be a reliable correlate of physiological processes in other tissues.
we saw significant overlap of meqtls between ancestral groups, developmental stages, and tissue types, with the highest rates of overlap within the four brain regions.
these methylation quantitative trait loci  influence methylation across extended genomic regions and may underlie direct snp associations or gene-environment interactions.
we explored this by analyzing seven datasets that varied by ancestry , developmental stage , and tissue type  with genome-wide dna methylation and snp data.
individual genotypes at specific loci can result in different patterns of dna methylation.
most meqtls mapped to intronic regions, although a limited number appeared to occur in synonymous or nonsynonymous coding snps.
we hypothesized that the detection of meqtls varies with ancestral population, developmental stage, and tissue type.
compared with a random group of snps with comparable frequencies, meqtls were more likely to be 1) represented among the most associated snps in the wtccc bipolar disorder results and 2) located in microrna binding sites.
we tested for meqtls by constructing linear regression models of methylation levels at each cpg site on snp genotypes within 50Â kb under an additive model controlling for multiple tests.
