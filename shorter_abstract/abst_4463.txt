their increasing drug resistance prompts us to search for prominent antigens to develop vaccines against enterococci.
we cultured large batches of each strain, isolated sufficient quantities of polysaccharides, analyzed their chemical structures, and compared their antigenic specificity.
the heteroglycans are not immunogenic by themselves but conjugation to protein carriers significantly enhanced their ability to induce antibodies.
the six clinical strains of enterococci express abundant, strain-specific cell-surface heteroglycans.
three classes of polysaccharides were isolated from each strain, including a polyglucan, a teichoic acid, and a heteroglycan composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, mannosamine, and glucosamine.
yields of the teichoic acids were generally low.
given the success of polysaccharide-based vaccines against various bacterial pathogens, we isolated and characterized the immunochemical properties of polysaccharide antigens from five strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium.
these polysaccharides may provide a molecular basis for serological typing of enterococcal strains and antigens for the development of vaccines against multi-drug resistant enterococci.
the six heteroglycans are structurally different as evidenced by nmr spectroscopy.
