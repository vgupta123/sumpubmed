moreover, it is designed to reduce execution time of the specific steps required for a complete analysis using distributed processes and parallelized software.
it is conceived to run on low requiring hardware components, to fulfill increasing demand, typical of the data used, and scalability at affordable costs.
the results are organized in a suitable data warehouse to provide a starting point to mine expressed sequence datasets.
the pipeline presented here has been developed to perform an exhaustive and reliable analysis on est data and to provide a curated set of information based on a relational database.
because of the advances in biotechnologies, ests are daily determined in the form of large datasets.
the collected information is useful for investigations on data quality and on data information content, enriched also by a preliminary functional annotation.
