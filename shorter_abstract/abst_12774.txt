this software lends itself to a "divorced" hdx approach in which ms/ms-confirmed peptide libraries are built via nano or standard esi without source modification, and hdx is performed via lc-maldi using a standard maldi-tof.
to our knowledge, software tools to automate data processing and analysis from sample fractionating  mass-spectrometry-based hdx workflows are not publicly available.
a semi-automated spectral-segment editor includes a semi-automated or automated assessment of the quality of all spectral segments as they are pooled across an xic peak for summing, centroid mass determination, building of rates plots on-the-fly, and automated back exchange correction.
the resulting deuterium uptake rates plots from various experiments can be averaged, subtracted, re-scaled, error-barred, and/or scatter-plotted from individual spectral segment centroids, compared to solvent exposure and hydrogen bonding predictions and receive a color suggestion for 3d visualization.
isotope-shift re-interrogation of library search results allows quick assessment of the extent of deuteration from peaklist data alone.
based on an experiment-wide template, and taking an ab initio approach to chromatographic and spectral peak finding, initial data processing is based on accurate mass-matching to fully deisotoped peaklists accommodating, in ms/ms-confirmed peptide library searches, ambiguous mass-hits to non-target proteins.
during raw spectrum editing, each spectral segment is validated in real time, consistent with the manageable spectral numbers resulting from lc-maldi experiments.
an integrated data pipeline  has been developed for the processing of lc-maldi-derived hdx data.
"tof2h" provides a comprehensive hdx data analysis package that has accelerated the processing of lc-maldi-based hdx data in the authors' lab from weeks to hours.
