gene ontologies of the differentially expressed genes revealed a wide range of functions and processes.
advanced analyses including anova, principal component analysis, and hierarchal clustering provided a global synopsis of gene expression relationships among the different developmental stages of the schistosome parasite.
the findings provide a comprehensive database of gene expression in an important human pathogen, including transcriptional changes in genes involved in evasion of the host immune response, nutrient acquisition, energy production, calcium signalling, sphingolipid metabolism, egg production and tegumental function during development.
microarray analysis was used to profile developmental gene expression in the asian species, schistosoma japonicum.
gene expression profiles were linked to the major environmental settings through which the developmental stages of the fluke have to adapt during the course of its life cycle.
in addition, stage-specific, differentially expressed genes were identified that were involved in numerous biological pathways and functions including calcium signalling, sphingolipid metabolism and parasite defence.
their life cycle is characterised by distinct parasitic and free-living phases involving mammalian and snail hosts and freshwater.
