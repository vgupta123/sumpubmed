to overcome these problems, we designed the streamlined isomut tool which can be readily adapted to experimental scenarios where the goal is the identification of experimentally induced mutations in multiple isogenic samples.
isomut has already been successfully applied in multiple recent studies to find unique, treatment induced mutations in sets of isogenic samples with very low false positive rates.

most standard tools either require numerous in-house post filtering steps with scarce documentation or take an unpractically long time to run.
however, most of the routinely used mutation calling algorithms are not optimised for the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples, or for non-human experimental model systems with no reliable databases of common genetic variations.
using  <dig> isogenic samples, reliable cohorts of validated mutations were created for testing purposes.
these types of studies provide an important contribution to determining the mutagenic effect of environmental agents or genetic defects, and isomut turned out to be an invaluable tool in the analysis of such data.
