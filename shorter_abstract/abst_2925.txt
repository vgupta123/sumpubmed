intranasal administration is a noninvasive and valid method for delivery of neuropeptides into the brain, to bypass the bbb.
intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> reduces infarct volume, improves functional recovery and enhances neurogenesis in mice after stroke.
intranasal treatment of tgf-β <dig> shows significant improvement in neurological function and reduction of infarct volume compared with control animals.
the number of brdu-incorporated cells in the svz and striatum was significantly increased in the tgf-β <dig> treated group compared with control animals at each time point.
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  labeling was performed at  <dig> days after middle cerebral artery occlusion .
the modified neurological severity scores  test was used to evaluate neurological function, and infarct volumes were determined from hematoxylin-stained sections.
we investigated the effect of treatment with intranasal transforming growth factor-β <dig>  on neurogenesis in the adult mouse svz following focal ischemia.
tgf-β <dig> treated mice had significantly less tunel-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum than that in control groups.
the effect of neurotrophic factors in enhancing stroke-induced neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone  is limited by their poor blood-brain barrier  permeability.
in addition, numbers of brdu- labeled cells coexpressed with the migrating neuroblast marker doublecortin  and the mature neuronal marker neuronal nuclei  were significantly increased after intranasal delivery of tgf-β <dig>  while only a few brdu labeled cells co-stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein .
intranasal tgf-β <dig> may have therapeutic potential for cerebrovascular disorders.
