in this paper we present evidence showing that two plant staphylococcal-like nucleases belong to a new, as yet unidentified class of eukaryotic nucleases, characterized by unique plasma membrane localization.
a study of microarray experiments and endogenous nuclease activity revealed that expression of can <dig> gene correlates with different forms of programmed cell death, while the can <dig> gene is constitutively expressed.
the identification of this class of nucleases indicates that plant cells possess additional, so far uncharacterized, mechanisms responsible for dna and rna degradation.
bioinformatic and experimental data presented in this paper indicate that two arabidopsis staphylococcal-like nucleases, named can <dig> and can <dig>  are anchored to the cell membrane via n-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation modifications.
the activity of degradative nucleases responsible for genomic dna digestion has been observed in all kingdoms of life.
plant degradative nucleases that have been studied so far belong mainly to the s1-type family and were identified in cellular compartments containing nucleic acids or in the organelles where they are stored before final application.
the potential functions of these nucleases in relation to their unique intracellular location are discussed.
it is believed that the main function of dna degradation occurring during plant programmed cell death is redistribution of nucleic acid derived products such as nitrogen, phosphorus and nucleotide bases.
however, the explanation of how degraded dna components are exported from the dying cells for further reutilization remains open.
