using computer simulations, we assessed the accuracy of the new approach for different read lengths over a variety of data sets and phylogenetic trees.
we found the accuracy of the new method to be good and comparable to existing maximum likelihood  approaches.
without using heuristics, the new approach efficiently finds the optimal placement of the unknown read in a reference phylogenetic tree given a sequence alignment for the taxa in the tree.
in particular, we found that the consensus assignments based on me and ml approaches are more correct than either method individually.
this is true even when the statistical support for read assignments was low, which is inevitable given that individual reads are often short and come from only one gene.
a central problem of computational metagenomics is determining the correct placement into an existing phylogenetic tree of individual reads  obtained using next-generation sequencing of dna samples from a mixture of known and unknown species.
correct placement allows us to easily identify or classify the sequences in the sample as to taxonomic position or function.
