our results strongly suggested that these newly discovered genes encode locust ors and the differential expression patterns of lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> implied distinct functions.
these results may offer insights into locust olfaction and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of insect chemoreception.
these four putative or genes encoded proteins with amino acids of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively.
however, ors in the locust—a hemimetabolous model insect and the most important insect crop pest—have not yet been identified, hindering our understanding of locust olfaction.
odorant receptors  in insects have been identified, particularly in the holometabolous model drosophila, and some of them have been functionally studied.
olfaction in animals is important for host localization, mating and reproduction in heterogeneous chemical environments.
furthermore, some of the labelled neurons could be attributed to the basiconic sensilla, but lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig> were expressed in different subtypes.
here, we report for the first time four putative ors in locusta migratoria: lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig>  lmigor <dig> and lmigor <dig>
in situ hybridization demonstrated that the lmigor1antisense probe labelled olfactory receptor neurons  in almost all segments of the antenna, but only a few segments housed orns expressing lmigor <dig>  the number of neurons labelled by lmigor <dig> antisense probes in each antennal segment was much greater  than that labelled by lmigor <dig> probes .
all ors were tissue-specifically expressed in olfactory organs, without sex-biased characteristics.
