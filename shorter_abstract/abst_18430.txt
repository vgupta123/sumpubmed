we hypothesize that the 5s gene integration within the 35s unit might have repeatedly occurred during plant evolution, and probably once in asteraceae.
dominant linked rdna genotype was found within three large groups in subfamily asteroideae: tribe anthemideae , tribe gnaphalieae  and in the "heliantheae alliance" .
here we aim to reveal the origin, distribution and mechanisms leading to the linked organisation of rdna in the asteraceae by analysing unit structure , gene copy number  and chromosomal position  of 5s and 35s rrna genes in ~ <dig> species representing the family diversity and other closely related groups.
our results indicate that nearly 25% of asteraceae species may have evolved unusual linked arrangement of rrna genes.
in flowering plants and animals the most common ribosomal rna genes  organisation is that in which 35s  and 5s genes are physically separated occupying different chromosomal loci.
thus, in plants, fundamental changes in intrinsic structure of rdna units, their copy number and chromosomal organisation may occur within relatively short evolutionary time.
however, recent observations established that both genes have been unified to a single 35s-5s unit in the genus artemisia , a genomic arrangement typical of primitive eukaryotes such as yeast, among others.
