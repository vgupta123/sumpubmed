alternative splicing of exons in a pre-mrna transcript is an important mechanism which contributes to protein diversity in human.
sequence analysis of our predicted exons confirms the presence of known splicing regulatory sequences.
our comparison of several alternative methods shows that an exon-skipping score based on neighboring junctions best discriminates between positive and negative controls.
this work describes a new method for analyzing exon-junction arrays, identifies sequence motifs that are specific for alternative and constitutive splicing and suggests a role for several known splicing factors and their motifs in developmental regulation.
in this work, we introduce a new method for predicting alternatively skipped exons from exon-junction arrays.
