these three bacterial families were also significantly more abundant  in lean subjects  < 25) than in obese subjects , which is consistent with previously published results.
in addition, the abundances of these three families were positively correlated with each other and comprised a correlative network with  <dig> other bacterial families.
finally, the results implied that the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae, along with several other bacterial components that together comprised a correlative network, contributed to a phenotype characterized by a high frequency of bowel movements and a lean body type.
in japan, a variety of traditional dietary habits and daily routines have developed in many regions.
to characterize the japanese gut microbiota and identify the factors shaping its composition, we conducted 16s metagenomics analysis of fecal samples collected from healthy japanese adults residing in various regions of japan.
we collected fecal samples from  <dig> healthy japanese adults .
heatmap and biplot analyses based on the bacterial family composition of the fecal microbiota showed that subjects’ region of residence or gender were not strongly correlated with the general composition of the fecal microbiota.
in the whole subject population, the scores for bowel movement frequency were significantly correlated with the abundances of christensenellaceae, mogibacteriaceae, and rikenellaceae in the fecal microbiota .
however, a previously reported correlation between bmi and bowel movement frequency was not observed.

the present study showed that the composition of the fecal microbiota of healthy japanese adults at the national level was not strongly correlated with subjects’ area of residence or gender.
although clustering analysis for the whole cohort did not reveal any distinct clusters, two enterotype-like clusters were observed in the male, but not the female, subjects.
the effects of these behaviors, and the regional differences in the composition of the gut microbiota, are yet to be sufficiently studied.
in addition, enterotype partitioning was ambiguous in this cohort of healthy japanese adults.
