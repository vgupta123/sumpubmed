hybridization differences caused by target sequence differences can be a confounding factor in analyzing gene expression on microarrays, lead to false positives and reduce power to detect real expression differences.
when detecting  <dig> % of known snp/indels in mouse expression data, we obtain at most  <dig> % false positives.
at the same level of false positives, best previous method detected  <dig> %.
we also show that probes with differing binding affinity both hinder differential expression detection and introduce artifacts in cancer-healthy tissue comparison.
detection and removal of such probes should be a routine step in affymetrix data preprocessing.
using completely mouse genomes we determined type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  errors with high accuracy and we show that our method routinely outperforms previous methods.
we prepared an r bioconductor compatible package to detect, characterize and remove such probes in affymetrix 3â€™ivt and exon-based arrays on the basis of correlation of signal intensities from probes within probe sets.
