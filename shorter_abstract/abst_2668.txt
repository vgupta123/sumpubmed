compared with the combined pairwise alignments, this proposed mucha method generally reduced computational costs with improving the quality of the alignment.
in contrast to the increasing number of the successful genome projects, there still remain many orphan metabolites for which their synthesis processes are unknown.
metabolites, including these orphan metabolites, can be classified into groups that share the same core substructures, originated from the same biosynthetic pathways.
we developed an efficient multiple graph alignment method named as mucha , specialized for finding metabolic building blocks.
this method showed the strength in finding metabolic building blocks with preserving the relative positions among the substructures, which is not achieved by simply applying the frequent graph mining techniques.
there already have been many reports on the multiple graph alignment techniques to find the conserved chemical substructures in relatively small molecules.
therefore, it is proposed that, for any given group of metabolites, finding the core substructure and the branched substructures can help predict their biosynthetic pathway.
mucha successfully find building blocks of secondary metabolites, and has a potential to complement to other existing methods to reconstruct metabolic networks using reaction patterns.
