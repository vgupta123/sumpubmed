further studies are needed to determine other factors that influence specifically the solubilization of arsenic in the bioleaching system such as: ph, dissolved oxygen concentration, redox potentials, nature of concentrate and temperature among others.
proper conditions of solubilization of arsenic during bioleaching are key features to improve the percentage  of arsenic removal.
it was also found that ferric chloride and carbon dioxide decreased the arsenic dissolution rate.
the effect of addition of ferric chloride during the arsenic bioleaching resulted in a decrease of the solubilized arsenic in the system.
calculated dilution rates were relatively small .
the maximum rate of arsenic dissolution in the concentrate was found using the following levels of factors: small surface area of particle exposure, low pulp density, injecting air and adding  <dig> k medium to the system.
the maximum rate of arsenic dissolution in the concentrate was found using; small surface area of particle exposure, low pulp density, injecting air and adding  <dig> k medium to the system.
the increase in pulp density generates a decrease in the dissolved arsenic concentration.
the presence of co <dig> is associated to the decrease in arsenic dissolution.
bioleaching kinetic data of arsenic solubilization were used to estimate the dilution rate for a continuous culture.
so far the most studied microorganism in bioleaching is acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.
there are a few studies about the benefit of metals of low value through bioleaching.
