one implication of these results is to further support the idea that cyclin a has important functions in s-phase entry as well as in mitosis.
each of these has distinct, as well as partially overlapping functions, in ensuring that cyclin e and de2f <dig> are kept in check.
the unexpectedly complex network of regulation may reflect the importance of cells being uniformly ready to respond to the inductive signals that coordinate retinal differentiation.
most differentiating cells are arrested in g1-phase of the cell cycle and this proliferative quiescence appears important to allow differentiation programmes to be executed.
we find that an overlapping set of cell cycle inhibitors combine to form an efficient barrier to cell cycle progression.
