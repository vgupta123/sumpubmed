uropathogenic e. coli  represent the majority of uti isolates and are a diverse group of bacteria that utilize a variety of virulence factors to establish infection of the genitourinary tract.
while further examination of cnf- <dig> may reveal a role in uti pathogenesis, our data casts doubt on the role of cnf- <dig> in the pathogenesis of upec uti.
as with other infections, different models and approaches are needed to elucidate the contribution of cnf <dig> to e. coli uti.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
urinary tract infections  are among the most common and costly infections in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.
to date, there have been conflicting reports on the role of cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of e. coli urinary tract infections.
we found no alterations in bacterial burden with the loss of cnf <dig>  whereas loss of the virulence factor fimh decreased bacterial burdens.
