the agreement between the melting curve simulations for different species of naegleria and cryptosporidium and the complex melting profiles generated in vitro using syto <dig> verified that the complex melting profile of pcr amplicons was solely the result of dna dissociation.
meltsim and poland were used to screen sequences from a putative toxin gene in two different species of cyanobacteria and identify regions exhibiting diagnostic melting profiles.
dna melting curve analysis using double-stranded dna-specific dyes such as syto <dig> produce complex and reproducible melting profiles, resulting in the detection of multiple melting peaks from a single amplicon and allowing the discrimination of different species.
we compare the melting curves of several naegleria and cryptosporidium amplicons generated in vitro with in silico dna melting simulations using the programs poland and meltsim., then test the utility of these programs for assay design using a genetic marker for toxin production in cyanobacteria.
the syto <dig> melting curve profiles of three species of naegleria and two species of cryptosporidium were similar to poland and meltsim melting simulations, excepting some differences in the relative peak heights and the absolute melting temperatures of these peaks.
refinements in the simulation parameters would be required to account for the effect of the intercalating dye and salt concentrations used in real-time pcr.
the assay was used to accurately type twenty seven cyanobacterial dna extracts in vitro.
whilst neither poland nor meltsim simulation programs were capable of exactly predicting dna dissociation in the presence of an intercalating dye, the programs were successfully used as tools to identify regions where melting curve differences could be exploited for diagnostic melting curve assay design.
