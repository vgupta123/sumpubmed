validation of a subset of the most highly differentiated snps using sanger sequencing demonstrated that several of them also were differentiated between an independent set of individuals of each subspecies.
these snps were clustered in two chromosome regions that are likely to be influenced by divergent selection between the subspecies and that could potentially be associated with adaptations to their different migratory strategies.
out of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  with a minimum sequencing depth of eight reads from each of two subspecies-specific pools, only  <dig> showed high differentiation, confirming previous studies showing that most of the genetic variation is shared between the subspecies.
reads that were mapped to intergenic regions were generally located close to predicted genes and possibly located in uncharacterized untranslated regions .
here we used  <dig> sequencing of brain-derived transcriptomes from two differentially migrating subspecies of the willow warbler phylloscopus trochilus to detect genes potentially underlying traits associated with migration.
our study represents the first large-scale sequencing analysis aiming at detecting genes underlying migratory phenotypes in birds and provides new candidates for genes potentially involved in migration.
several of these traits have been shown to possess a strong heritable component in birds, but little is known about their genetic architecture.
animal migration requires adaptations in morphological, physiological and behavioural traits.
