the studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of fad2-1a gene activity and a non-synonymous snp in the coding sequence of fab2c caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines m <dig> and fam94- <dig>  respectively.
the collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.
discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement.
our results showed that  <dig>  distinct transcripts from  <dig>  annotated genes were expressed in seeds.
variation in seed oil composition and content among soybean varieties is largely attributed to differences in transcript sequences and/or transcript accumulation of oil production related genes in seeds.
in an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil content.
effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted.
as a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated rna-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits.
