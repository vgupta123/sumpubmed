we analysed the effect of partial triplication of the mmu <dig> segment on global gene expression in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of ts1cje mice at  <dig> time-points: postnatal day  <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>
these findings suggest over-expression of interferon receptor may lead to over-stimulation of jak-stat signaling pathway which may contribute to the neuropathology in ts1cje or ds brain.
the ts1cje mouse model of down syndrome  has partial triplication of mouse chromosome  <dig> , which is partially homologous to human chromosome  <dig>  these mice develop various neuropathological features identified in ds individuals.
of these, only  <dig> degs were identified as common to all three brain regions and  <dig> were located in the triplicated segment.
the role of interferon mediated activation or inhibition of signal transduction including jak-stat signaling pathway has been well characterized in various biological processes and disease models including ds but information pertaining to the role of this pathway in the development and function of the ts1cje or ds brain remains scarce and warrants further investigation.
functional clustering analysis of the  <dig> degs identified interferon-related signal transduction as the most significantly dysregulated pathway in ts1cje postnatal brain development.
rt-qpcr and western blotting analysis showed both ifnar <dig> and stat <dig> were over-expressed in p <dig> ts1cje cerebral cortex and cerebellum as compared to wild type littermates.
a total of  <dig> degs were identified from the cerebellum,  <dig> from the hippocampus and  <dig> from the cerebral cortex.
we validated  <dig> selected degs from the cerebral cortex ,  <dig> degs from the cerebellum  and  <dig> degs from the hippocampus .
gene expression profiling identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes , selected from various spatiotemporal comparisons, between ts1cje and disomic mice.
