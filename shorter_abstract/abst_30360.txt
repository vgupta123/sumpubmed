moreover, currently no crystal structure of complexes bound with pgh <dig> has been reported.
the results closely match with available experimental data.
prostaglandin h <dig>  is a common precursor for the synthesis of five different prostanoids via specific prostanoid synthases.
shape and physico-chemical properties of the pgh <dig> binding sites of the four prostanoid synthases were analyzed and compared in order to understand the molecular basis of the specificity.
however this common pattern is not statistically unique and is not specific enough to distinguish between proteins that can or cannot bind pgh <dig>  a large scale search in astral data bank, a non redundant protein data bank, for a similar pattern showed the uniqueness of each of the pgh <dig> binding site in these synthases.
