these elements have been found to have diverse functions, including enhancer activities in developmental processes.
here, we identified a wide range of ultraconserved elements common to distant species, from primitive aquatic organisms to terrestrial species with complicated body systems, including some novel elements conserved in fruit fly and human.
we identified large numbers of ultraconserved elements across distant species.
furthermore, species composition and flanking genes of clusters showed lineage-specific patterns.
in addition to a well-known association with developmental genes, these dna elements have a strong association with genes implicated in essential cell functions, such as epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, detoxification, innate immunity, and sensory reception.
interestingly, we observed that ultraconserved elements clustered by sequence similarity.
our findings indicate that these ultraconserved elements are not the exclusive property of higher modern eukaryotes, but rather transmitted from their metazoan ancestors.
