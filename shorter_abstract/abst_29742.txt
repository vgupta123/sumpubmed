although high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid system and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry are widely used in model organisms, the progress of protein-protein interactions detection in plants is rather slow.
protein-protein interaction data of prin are based on the interologs of six model organisms where large-scale protein-protein interaction experiments have been applied: yeast , worm , fruit fly , human , escherichia coli k <dig> and arabidopsis thaliana.
in addition, go annotation, subcellular localization information and gene expression data are also mapped to our network for validation.
prin is the first well annotated protein interaction database for the important model plant oryza sativa.
protein-protein interactions play a fundamental role in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of biomolecular function, signal transductions and metabolic pathways of living organisms.
with this motivation, our work presents a computational approach to predict protein-protein interactions in oryza sativa.
finally, a user-friendly web interface was developed to offer convenient database search and network visualization.
to better understand the interactions of proteins in oryza sativa, we have developed prin, a predicted rice interactome network.
it has greatly extended the current available protein-protein interaction data of rice with a computational approach, which will certainly provide further insights into rice functional genomics and systems biology.
