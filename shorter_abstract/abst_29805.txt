mate preferences, however, were asymmetric, with n. lepida females mating preferentially with conspecifics and n. bryanti females showing no preference by species.
patterns of mate choice in this woodrat system appear to be strongly impacted by body size and aggressive behavior.
sympatric females were less likely to mate than allopatric females, due in part to an increase in aggressive interactions.
however, even in the absence of aggression, courtship led to mating less often in sympatric females, suggesting they were choosier or had lower sexual motivation than allopatric females.
we compared preferences of females from both allopatric and sympatric sites.
sympatric animals are larger and more aggressive, traits that are likely under strong ecological selection across the sharp resource gradient that characterizes the contact zone.
however, our results suggest that these traits that are likely favored in competitive interactions between the species also impact reproductive interactions.
for sympatric animals, rates of aggression were markedly higher than for allopatric animals and reduced affiliative and reproductive behavior in our trials.
female mate preferences may be under strong selection in zones of contact between closely related species because of greater variation in available mates and the potential costs of hybridization.
we studied female mate preferences experimentally in a zone of secondary contact between desert and bryantâ€™s woodrat  in the southern foothills of the sierra nevada of california.
combined with our previous findings of post-zygotic isolation in this system, this study suggests that multiple isolating mechanisms contribute to the rate of genetic exchange between these species when they come into contact, and that these mechanisms are the result of selection on traits that are important in a range of ecological and reproductive interactions.
