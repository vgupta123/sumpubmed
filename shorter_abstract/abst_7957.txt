here the authors present a pipeline for identifying disease specific gene-drug interactions using cnv  and clinical data from the tcga  project.
the copy number and clinical data were then used to preform survival analysis on a gene by gene basis on sub-populations of patients exposed to a given drug.
several gene-drug interactions are identified, where the copy number of a gene is associated to survival of a patient exposed to a certain drug.
while the pipeline produced several possible interactions where increased survival is linked to normal or increased copy number of a given gene for patients treated with a given drug, no instance of low copy number or full deletion was linked to increased survival.
with the advent of large scale biological data collection for various diseases, data analysis pipelines and workflows need to be established to build frameworks for integrative analysis.
two cancer types were selected for analysis, lgg  and gbm , due to the possible progression from lgg to gbm in some cases.
the development of this pipeline shows a promising utility to identify possible beneficial gene-drug interactions that could improve patient survival and may illustrate some of the problems inherent in this kind of analysis on these data.
