the database was then linked to an open-access web tool and to public databases.
it also enables users to easily link the information available from the array producer with data in public databases, without the need of additional bioinformatics tools or pipelines.
here we present snpchimp v. <dig>  a solution to these issues for the six major livestock species .
original data was collected directly from snp array producers and specific international genome consortia, and stored in a mysql database.
in recent years, the use of genomic information in livestock species for genetic improvement, association studies and many other fields has become routine.
snpchimp v. <dig> ensures fast access to the database  and the possibility of annotating snp array data in a user-friendly fashion.
in recognition of the open-access use of ensembl resources, snpchimp v. <dig> was officially credited as an ensembl e!mpowered tool.
