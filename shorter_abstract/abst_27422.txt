these findings highlight a valuable but complex biotic and abiotic stress response to real-world, multidimensional contamination which could, in part, help explain why crops such as willow can produce uniquely high biomass yields on challenging marginal land.
over 45 % of differentially expressed genes originated from foreign organisms, the majority from the two-spotted spidermite, tetranychus urticae.
salix purpurea ‘fish creek’ trees were pot-grown in soil from a former petroleum refinery, either lacking or enriched with c10-c <dig> phcs.
a cheap solution, which can help restore biodiversity and bring land back to productivity, is cultivation of high biomass yielding willow trees.
the meta-transcriptomic pattern of expression suggests a cross-tolerance mechanism whereby abiotic stress resistance systems provide improved biotic resistance.
plant transcripts involved in the polypropanoid pathway, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , had greater expression in contaminated trees whereas most resistance genes showed higher expression in non-contaminated trees.
