here we present a redescription of this taxon based on more complete material, including new details of the head and posterior portion of the trunk, informed by the results of experimental decay of extant onychophorans.
the type material of h. inopinata, however, leaves much of the crucial anatomy unknown.
h. inopinata is indeed best resolved as a stem-onychophoran, but lacks several key features of modern velvet worms including, crucially, those that would suggest a terrestrial mode of life.
the presence of h. inopinata in the carboniferous demonstrates the survival of a cambrian marine morphotype, and a likely post-carboniferous origin of crown-onychophora.
helenodora inopinata, from the mazon creek lagerstätte of illinois , has been proposed as an intermediate between the “weird wonders” of the cambrian seas and modern terrestrial predatory onychophorans.
our analysis also demonstrates that taphonomically informed tests of character interpretations have the potential to improve phylogenetic resolution.
