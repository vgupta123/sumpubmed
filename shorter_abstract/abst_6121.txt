our study shows that the reconstructed genetic network regulating metabolism in e. coli is hierarchical, modular, and largely acyclic, with environmental variables controlling the root of the hierarchy.
we study the system level dynamical properties of the genetic network of escherichia coli that regulates its metabolism, and show how its design leads to biologically useful cellular properties.
we have studied how the attractors of the boolean dynamical system constructed from this database depend on the initial condition of the genes and on various environmental conditions corresponding to buffered minimal media.
elucidating the architecture and dynamics of large scale genetic regulatory networks of cells is an important goal in systems biology.
we find that the system exhibits homeostasis in that its attractors, that turn out to be fixed points or low period cycles, are highly insensitive to initial conditions or perturbations of gene configurations for any given fixed environment.
this architecture makes the cell highly robust to perturbations of gene configurations as well as highly responsive to environmental changes.
at the same time the attractors show a wide variation when external media are varied implying that the system mounts a highly flexible response to changed environmental conditions.
the twin properties of homeostasis and response flexibility are achieved by this dynamical system even though it is not close to the edge of chaos.
