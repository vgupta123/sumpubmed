in addition, elucidating ortholog relationships between distantly related genomes is challenging because of the lower sequence similarity.
starting from domain information, it first assigns protein groups according to their domain architectures and further identifies orthologs within those groups with much reduced complexity.
supported by domain composition, which usually directly related with protein function, dodo could facilitate orthologs detection across distantly related genomes.
the output results of dodo are highly comparable with other known ortholog databases.
an efficient ortholog detection pipeline dodo  is created on the basis of domain architectures in this study.
therefore, an efficient ortholog detection method that can deal with large number of distantly related genomes is desired.
here dodo is shown to detect orthologs between two genomes in considerably shorter period of time than traditional methods of reciprocal best hits and it is more significant when analyzed a large number of genomes.
dodo provides a new efficient pipeline for detection of orthologs in a large number of genomes.
therefore, ortholog identification is useful in annotations of newly sequenced genomes.
with rapidly increasing number of sequenced genomes, constructing or updating ortholog relationship between all genomes requires lots of effort and computation time.
