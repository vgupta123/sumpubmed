ninety percent of the animals reacted positively to the tuberculin cervical comparative intradermal test performed at  <dig> weeks post-infection.
although 60% of the animals were bovine reactors at week  <dig>  avian ppd-biased responses returned at week  <dig>  after challenge with m. caprae, the ifn-γ responses radically changed to show predominant bovine ppd-biased responses from week  <dig> onward.
evaluation of interferon-γ  secretion induced by avian and bovine tuberculins  showed a predominant avian ppd-biased response in the vaccinated group from week  <dig> post-vaccination onward.
our results suggest a degree of interference of ptb vaccination with current tb diagnostics that can be fully mitigated when using new diva reagents.
furthermore, post-mortem analysis showed reductions in tuberculous lesions and bacterial burden in some vaccinated animals, particularly expressed in terms of the degree of extrapulmonary dissemination of tb infection.
however, vaccination against paratuberculosis  in goats is often allowed even when its effect on tb diagnosis has not been fully evaluated.
