structural comparison between bacterial cueo and fungal laccases has suggested that a charged residue glu  in cueo replaces the corresponding residue phe in fungal laccases at the gate of the tunnel connecting type ii copper to the protein surface and an extra α-helix  near the type i copper site covers the substrate binding pocket and might compromise the electron transfer from substrate to type i copper.
the α-helix  may not only block access to the type i copper site but also play a role in substrate specificities of bacterial mcos.
to test this hypothesis, several mutants were made in klebsiella sp.
<dig> multicopper oxidase, which is highly homologous to e. coli cueo with a similarity of 90% and an identity of 78%.
deleting α-helix  resulted in the formation of inactive inclusion body when the mutant Δα351- <dig> was expressed in e. coli.
kinetic studies showed the α351-380m mutant gave very low km values for dmp, abts and sgz,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and 7-fold less than those for the wild type.
its slightly larger kcat/km values for three substrates mainly come from the decreased km.
in addition, kcat/km values were increased,  <dig> -fold for dmp, similar for abts and 3-fold for sgz.
the α351-380m mutant was active, and displayed a far-uv cd spectrum markedly different from that for wild-type enzyme.
the α351-380m mutant catalyzing oxidation of the phenolic substrate dmp effectively would be very useful in green chemistry.
the e106f mutant gave smaller km  and kcat  values for all three substrates dmp, abts and sgz as compared with those for the wild-type enzyme.
another mutant α351-380m was then made via substitution of seven amino acid residues in the α-helix  region.
the glu residue at position  <dig> appears not to be the only factor affecting the copper binding, and it may also play a role in maintaining enzyme conformation.
