most friesian horses reach their anaerobic threshold during a standardized exercise test  which requires lower intensity exercise than daily routine training.
young friesian horses do reach their anaerobic threshold during a set which requires lower intensity than daily routine training.
the majority of horses showed a significant training response based upon longitudinal follow-up of bla.
a significantly decreased bla level after cantering was noticeable in week  <dig> in seta, whereas in setb only as of week  <dig>  in seta a very strong correlation for bla and average hr at trot was found throughout the entire training period, not for canter.
setb alternated short episodes of canter with trot and walk, lacking long episodes of cantering, as applied in seta.
following parameters were monitored: blood lactic acid  after cantering, average heart rate  in trot and maximum hr in canter.
longitudinal follow up of bla and not of hr is suitable to assess training response.
two different sets  were applied during a 2Â month training period of  <dig> young friesian dressage horses.
in the current study, horses that started with the lowest fitness level, showed the largest training response.
bla after cantering was significantly higher in seta compared to setb and maximum hr in canter was significantly higher in seta compared to setb.
setb is best suited as a template for daily training in the aerobic window.
horses with the lowest fitness at start, displayed the largest training response.
