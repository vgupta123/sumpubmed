organization and syntenic analysis revealed the genomic distribution and collinear relationships of the r2r3-brmybs.
myb proteins include highly conserved n-terminal myb repeats  and various c-terminal sequences that confer extensive functions.
the r2r3-, 3r- and atypical myb proteins in chinese cabbage formed  <dig> subgroups based on domain similarity and phylogenetic topology.
however, the functions of most myb genes are unknown, and have been little studied in chinese cabbage.
here, we analyzed  <dig>  r2r3-myb genes from chinese cabbage  and anchored them onto the  <dig> chromosomes and three subgenomes.
synonymous nucleotide substitution  analysis showed that the chinese cabbage myb dna-binding domain is under strong purifying selection.
