thiamine pyrophosphate  is a cofactor for 2-hydroxyacyl-coa lyase  <dig> , a peroxisomal enzyme essential for the Î±-oxidation of phytanic acid and 2-hydroxy straight chain fatty acids.
because of the crucial role of the cofactor tpp, we reanalyzed its subcellular localization in rat liver.
this study was undertaken to get a better insight into these issues and to shed light on the role of tpp in peroxisomal metabolism.
our results clearly indicate that mammalian peroxisomes do contain tpp but that no pyrophosphorylation of thiamine occurs in these organelles, implying that thiamine must enter the peroxisome already pyrophosphorylated.
little is known about the transport of metabolites and cofactors across the peroxisomal membrane and no peroxisomal thiamine or tpp carrier has been identified in mammals yet.
so far, hacl <dig> is the only known peroxisomal tpp-dependent enzyme in mammals.
however, tpk activity was exclusively recovered in the cytosol.
