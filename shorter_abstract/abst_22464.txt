pr <dig>  and a monooxygenase gene identified in this study, mo <dig>  are preferentially up-regulated in the compatible interaction.
in contrast, glip <dig>  which encodes a secreted lipase, and diox <dig>  a pathogen-response related dioxygenase, are preferentially up-regulated in the incompatible interaction.
the results show that dig is not only more susceptible, but demonstrate that its interaction with a. brassicicola has a specific transcriptional signature.
the interaction of arabidopsis with alternaria brassicicola provides a model for disease caused by necrotrophs, but a drawback has been the lack of a compatible pathosystem.
this study examines an ecotype, dijon g , which is considered sensitive to a. brassicicola.
to ask whether dig is merely more sensitive to the pathogen or, rather, interacts in distinct manner, we identified genes whose regulation differs between col- <dig> and dig challenged with a. brassicicola.
