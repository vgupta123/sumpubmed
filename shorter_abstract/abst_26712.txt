to overcome these drawbacks, we constructed an escherichia coli lycopene production strain that does not carry a plasmid or an antibiotic marker.
the replacement of native appy promoter with a t <dig> promoter, and the deletion of the iclr gene in e. coli cbw  <dig> further improved lycopene production.
this was achieved using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution, a high gene copy expression system.
a lycopene hyper-producer e. coli strain that does not carry a plasmid or antibiotic marker was constructed using triclosan-induced chromosomal evolution.

however, for biotechnological applications, plasmid-based expression systems are not suitable because of genetic instability, and the requirement for constant selective pressure to ensure plasmid maintenance.
plasmid-based overexpression of genes has been the principal strategy for metabolic engineering.
the engineered strain demonstrated high genetic stability in the absence of the selective agent during fermentation.
