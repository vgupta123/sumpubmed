further examination in this latter group identified  <dig> children with pid ;  <dig>  had genetically defined pid, representing  <dig> different diagnoses, and another  <dig>  had a clinically defined pid - common variable immunodeficiency.
no additional pid patient was identified from the evaluation of laboratory results in children not included in the study.
the most common infection was recurrent otitis media.
in addition, results of these immunological analyses in other children from the same area and time period were evaluated.
immunological analyses results for about two thirds of the patients were outside age-related reference intervals.
primary immunodeficiency diseases  comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders mainly characterized by increased susceptibility to infections.
the initial analysis consisted of complete blood counts with analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations , measurement of immunoglobulins , and assessment of the complement system .
the aims of this study were to estimate the occurrence rate of pid in the paediatric  population of southern sweden  and to describe their demographic, clinical and immunological characteristics.
the occurrence rate of pid was about  <dig> new cases per year in this population.
the median age at diagnosis was  <dig>  years .
during a period of 4 years, in four paediatric speciality clinics in skåne county in southern sweden, children being seen for infections and fulfilling specific criteria were evaluated according to a predefined examination schedule.
