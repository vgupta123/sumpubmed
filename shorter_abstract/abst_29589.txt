our results indicated that diverse set of wheat mirnas were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress and could function in wheat responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses.
to test whether mirnas play roles in regulating response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, by using solexa high-throughput sequencing we cloned the small rna from wheat leaves infected by preponderant physiological strain erysiphe graminis f. sp.
tritici  or by heat stress treatment.
we found that  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress, respectively.
micrornas  are a class of small non-coding regulatory rnas that regulate gene expression by guiding target mrna cleavage or translational inhibition.
