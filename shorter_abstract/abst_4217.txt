a. succinogenes lacks a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as a glyoxylate pathway, and it appears to be able to transport and degrade about twenty different carbohydrates.
the fact that the a. succinogenes genome encodes uptake and degradation pathways for a variety of carbohydrates reflects the variety of carbohydrate substrates available in the rumen, a. succinogenes's natural habitat.
the genomes of a. succinogenes and its closest known relative, mannheimia succiniciproducens, were compared for the presence of known pasteurellaceae virulence factors.
it also suggests that many different carbon sources can be used as feedstock for succinate production by a. succinogenes.
the lack of pathogenicity of these two succinogens is an exciting prospect, because comparisons with pathogenic pasteurellaceae could lead to a better understanding of pasteurellaceae virulence.
the genome sequence contains  <dig>  dna uptake signal sequence repeats and a nearly complete set of natural competence proteins, suggesting that a. succinogenes is capable of natural transformation.
both species appear to lack the virulence traits of toxin production, sialic acid and choline incorporation into lipopolysaccharide, and utilization of hemoglobin and transferrin as iron sources.
described here is the  <dig>  mb a. succinogenes genome sequence with emphasis on a. succinogenes's potential for genetic engineering, its metabolic attributes and capabilities, and its lack of pathogenicity.
both a. succinogenes and m. succiniciproducens genome sequences lack many of the virulence genes used by their pathogenic pasteurellaceae relatives.
actinobacillus succinogenes naturally converts sugars and co <dig> into high concentrations of succinic acid as part of a mixed-acid fermentation.
perspectives are also given on the conservation of a. succinogenes genomic features in other sequenced pasteurellaceae.
