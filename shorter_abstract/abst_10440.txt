this study indicated that tlr <dig> signaling and its downstream molecules along with certain cytokines play a key role in acute liver injury in young chickens.
lps injection induced significantly higher alt activity, severe fatty degeneration, necrotic symptoms, ballooning degeneration, congestion, enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration in liver sinusoids, decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis and significant up-regulation in tlr <dig> and its downstream molecules  expression at different time points.
hence, our findings provided novel information about the histopathological, proliferative and apoptotic alterations along with changes in alt and caspase- <dig> activities associated with acute liver injury induced by salmonella lps in avian species.
the present investigation was therefore carried out to evaluate these alterations in tlr <dig> signaling pathway during acute liver injury in young chickens.
after intraperitoneal injection of lps or saline, liver samples were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120Â h  and the microstructures were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin  staining.
however, immuno-pathological changes during tlr <dig> signaling under lps stress in acute liver injury is poorly understood in avian species.
proliferative cell nuclear antigen , single stranded dna  and tlr <dig> protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry.
alanine aminotransferase  and caspase- <dig> enzyme activity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
gene expressions of pcna, caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  tlr <dig> and its downstream molecules were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
lipopolysaccharide  induces acute liver injury and the complex mechanisms include the activation of toll like receptor  <dig>  signaling pathway in many species.
