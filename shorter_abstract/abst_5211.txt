finally, support vector regression  is adopted to construct a real value asa predictor.
experimental results demonstrate that the features produced by the proposed selection process are informative for asa prediction.
experimental results based on a widely used benchmark reveal that the proposed method performs best among several of existing packages for performing asa prediction.
this study enhances the pssm-based features for real value asa prediction by considering the physicochemical properties and solvent propensities of amino acid types.
prediction of protein solvent accessibility, also called accessible surface area  prediction, is an important step for tertiary structure prediction directly from one-dimensional sequences.
we propose a systematic method for identifying residue groups with respect to protein solvent accessibility.
furthermore, the feature selection mechanism incorporated in this study can be applied to other regression problems using the pssm.
however, the states of solvent accessibility are not well-defined in real protein structures.
thus, a number of methods have been developed to directly predict the real value asa based on evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrix .
traditionally, predicting solvent accessibility is regarded as either a two-  or three-state  classification problem.
