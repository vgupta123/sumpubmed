moreover, potential applications of dna molecules condensed by means of knotting remain to be explored.
with this biological system, dna molecules of varying length and sequence can be shaped into very complex and heterogeneous knotted forms.
the formation of dna knots is common during biological transactions.
we constructed dna cosmids as small as  <dig> kb and introduced them inside p <dig> capsids.
over  <dig> Î¼g of knotted cosmid were typically obtained from  <dig> liter of bacterial culture.
such cosmids were then recovered as a complex mixture of highly knotted dna circles.
we demonstrate here that this mechanism is not restricted to the viral genome.
these molecules can be produced in preparative amounts suitable for systematic studies and applications.
we had previously shown that circularization of the  <dig>  kb linear dna of phage p <dig> inside its viral capsid generates complex knots by the effect of confinement.
