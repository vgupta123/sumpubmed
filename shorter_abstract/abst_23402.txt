in the case of seed tissue, trypsin protein digestion results offer good databank coverage.
a total of 22% of all database peptides have a pi value of less than  <dig>  and 25% of them have a pi value between  <dig> and  <dig>  based on the detection range of typical nanouplc-mse experiments, i.e.,  <dig> to  <dig> da,  <dig> proteins will not be identified.
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for analyzing protein contents and possible expression modifications in gmos.
seed proteins represent  <dig> % of the protein database entries.
at the peptide level, trypsin-digested seed proteins represent only  <dig> % of the theoretical uniprot peptide database.
the proteomic profile of the embrapa br- <dig> seed lacks certain described proteins relative to the profiles of transgenic soybeans reported in other works.
the theoretical uniprot peptide database has  <dig>  entries, and  <dig>  peptides have molecular weights of greater than  <dig> da.
the uniprot database has many duplicate entries that may result in false protein homolog associations when using nanouplc-mse analysis.
nanouplc-mse experiments provide good protein coverage within a peptide error of  <dig> ppm and a wide mw detection range from  <dig> to  <dig> da.
here, we present an assessment of the peptide and protein identification and quantification of soybean seed embrapa br <dig> cultivar contents using nanouplc-mse and provide a comparison to the theoretical tryptic digestion of soybean sequences from uniprot database.
78% of the identified proteins correspond to all glycinin and beta-conglycinin chains.
a second digestion enzyme should be used depending on the tissue or proteins to be analyzed.
