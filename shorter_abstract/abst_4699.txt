late epcs were enriched with proliferation and angiogenesis genes, participating in endothelial tubulogenesis and hence neovascularization.
epcs are rare and therefore optimizing isolation and culture is required before they can be applied as part of clinical therapies.
currently epcs are defined as either early and late epcs based on their biological properties and their time of appearance during in vitro culture.
early epcs expressed abundant inflammatory cytokines and paracrine angiogenic factors, thereby promoting angiogenesis in a paracrine manner.
transcription factors involved in epc stemness were pinpointed in early epcs  and in late epcs .
we compared the gene profiles of early/late epcs to their ancestors cd133+ or cd34+ stem cells and to matured endothelial cells pinpointing novel biomarkers and stemness genes.
endothelial progenitor cells  play a fundamental role in post-natal vascular repair.
the detailed mrna expression profiles and functional module analysis for different epcs will help the development of novel therapeutic modalities targeting cardiovascular disease, tumor angiogenesis and various ischemia-related diseases.
