we offer mausdb to the scientific community as open source software to provide a system for storage of data from functional genomics projects in a well-structured, easily accessible form.
the system is successfully used as the primary mouse and data management tool of the german mouse clinic and other mouse facilities.
large-scale, comprehensive and standardized high-throughput mouse phenotyping has been established as a tool of functional genome research by the german mouse clinic and others.
a database application has been developed for the german mouse clinic in order to meet all requirements mentioned above.
we present mausdb, the german mouse clinic web-based database application that integrates standard mouse colony management, phenotyping workflow scheduling features and mouse phenotyping result data management.
thus, central storage and integrated management of mouse phenotype data, genotype data, metadata and linked external data are highly important.
it links mouse phenotype data with genotype data, metadata and external data such as public web databases, which is a prerequisite for comprehensive data analysis and mining.
