quantitative label-free proteomics of  <dig> apoplastic secretome samples  in combination with genome-wide transcript analysis by  <dig> microarrays  were used to capture changes in protein abundance and gene expression at  <dig>   <dig> and 72Â hours after inoculation with p. infestans.
in order to get global molecular understanding of one of the most important crop diseases worldwide, we investigated compatible and incompatible interactions between phytophthora infestans and potato .
components induced only during incompatible interactions, which are candidates for hypersensitive response initiation, include a kunitz-like protease inhibitor, transcription factors and an rcr3-like protein.
more secreted proteins had lower abundance in the compatible interaction compared to the incompatible interactions.
we used the two most field-resistant potato clones under swedish growing conditions, which have the greatest known local diversity of p. infestans populations, and a reference compatible cultivar.
half of the differentially abundant proteins showed a corresponding change at the transcript level.
many putative hypersensitive and effector-target proteins were single representatives of large gene families.
in summary, over  <dig> transcripts and  <dig> secreted proteins changed in abundance in at least one time point, illustrating the dynamics of plant responses to a hemibiotroph.
