parkinson's disease  is characterized at the cellular level by a destruction of neuromelanin -containing dopaminergic cells and a profound reduction in striatal dopamine.
in addition, they potently triggered t cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, showing that dc activation was functional to induce a primary t cell response.
in this study we tested whether nm is being recognized by dendritic cells , the major cell type for inducing t- and b-cell responses in vivo.
in contrast, dam, which lacks the protein and lipid components of nm but mimics the dopamine-melanin backbone of nm, had only very little effect on dc phenotype and function.
murine dcs were treated with nm of substantia nigra  from human subjects or with synthetic dopamine melanin .
this recognition of nm by dcs is a prerequisite to trigger an adaptive autoimmune response directed against nm-associated structures.
dcs effectively phagocytized nm and subsequently developed a mature phenotype .
our data provide a rationale for an autoimmune-based pathomechanism of pd with nm as the initial trigger.
