additional isolates  and nine veterinary samples were characterized using the algorithm which resulted in their placement into three distinct genomic groups.
from this data, an algorithm was created utilizing four primer pairs that allows for differentiation of unknown isolates into five genomic groups.
this algorithm may ultimately help to determine the relatedness between known and unknown isolates of c. burnetii.
isolates nine mile phase ii, nine mile rsa  <dig>  nine mile baca, scottish, ohio, australian qd, henzerling phase i, henzerling phase ii, m <dig>  kav, pav, q <dig>  q <dig> and wav were tested by pcr and compared to 9mi/i.
further, a method for differentiation of c. burnetii isolates into one of five genomic groups was created.
sequencing was used to determine the exact differences in isolates which lacked specific is elements or produced pcr products of differing size.
