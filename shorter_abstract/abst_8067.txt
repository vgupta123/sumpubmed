enzyme assays revealed that lipase immobilized on pd-mnps displayed enhanced ph and thermal stability compared to free lipase.
furthermore, lipase immobilized on pd-mnps was easily isolated from the reaction medium by magnetic separation and retained more than 70% of initial activity after  <dig> repeated cycles of enzyme reaction followed by magnetic separation.
a facile method of lipase immobilization was developed in this study, by the use of polydopamine coated magnetic nanoparticles .
immobilization of enzyme onto magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles via poly-dopamine film is economical, facile and efficient.
