our aim was not to confirm the traditional use, but rather to determine activity of extracts.
haemonchus contortus is the singular most important helminth responsible for major economic losses in small ruminants.
based on the cytotoxicity results c. anisata was the least toxic with an lc <dig> of  <dig>  mg/ml, while cyathea dregei was the most toxic plant with an lc <dig> of  <dig>  mg/ml.
in the larval development assay the h. trifoliata extract was the most effective with an ec <dig> of  <dig>  mg/ml followed by l. sericea .
the c. anisata extract had the best selectivity index with a value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the two assays, followed by h. trifoliata and l. sericea with values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> .
heteromorpha trifoliata, maesa lanceolata and leucosidea sericea had ec <dig> values of  <dig>  mg/ml,  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml respectively for the egg hatch assay.
clausena anisata;  and clerodendrum glabrum;  extracts were also active.
the c. dregei extract had the worst selectivity index with a value of  <dig>  for both assays.
because it is cheaper and more reproducible to evaluate the activity of plant extracts, than doing animal studies, the activity of acetone leaf extracts of thirteen plant species used traditionally in ethnoveterinary medicine in south africa were determined using the egg hatch assay and the larval development test.
the activities in the larval development test were generally lower in most plant species than the egg hatch assay.
extracts of three plant species i.e.
the use of plants and plant extracts as a possible source of new anthelmintics has received more interest in the last decade.
