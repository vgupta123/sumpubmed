epidemiological models often use information on host social contacts to predict the potential impact of infectious diseases on host populations and the efficiency of control measures.
it can be difficult, however, to determine whether social contacts are actually meaningful predictors of transmission.

we discuss our results in the light of the species’ ecology and propose scent-marking, a type of social contact not considered in previous epidemiological studies, as a likely route of transmission between groups.
however, further studies are needed to explicitly test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the relative roles of direct contact and environmental transmission in pathogen transfer.
no antibiotic resistance was found, suggesting low rates of e. coli spillover from humans into this arboreal species.
intergroup encounter rate and a measure of space-use sharing provided equally potent explanations for type sharing between social groups when closely related sts were taken into account, whereas animal age, sex and dispersal history had no influence.
we investigated the role of host social structure in the transmission of escherichia coli in a wild population of primates, verreaux’s sifakas .
we show that patterns of e. coli transmission reflect the social structure of this group-living lemur species.
using multilocus sequence typing , we compared genetic similarities between e. coli isolates from different individuals and groups to infer transmission pathways.
