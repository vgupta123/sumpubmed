micrornas are small endogenously expressed non-coding rna molecules that regulate target gene expression through translation repression or messenger rna degradation.
diana-microt  <dig>  is an algorithm for microrna target prediction which is based on several parameters calculated individually for each microrna and combines conserved and non-conserved microrna recognition elements into a final prediction score, which correlates with protein production fold change.
specifically, for each predicted interaction the program reports a signal to noise ratio and a precision score which can be used as an indication of the false positive rate of the prediction.
the diana-microt  <dig>  prediction results are available online in a user friendly web server at
