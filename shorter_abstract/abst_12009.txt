recognition of bacteria and their locations was achieved using a pattern-based approach and domain lexical resources.
for the detection of environment locations, we propose a new approach that combines lexical information and the syntactic-semantic analysis of corpus terms to overcome the incompleteness of lexical resources.
we have shown that the combination of semantic analysis and domain-adapted resources is both effective and efficient for event information extraction in the bacteria biotope domain.
official evaluation results show that it achieves the best performance of participating systems.
bacteria location relations extend over sentence borders, and we developed domain-specific rules for dealing with bacteria anaphors.
we plan to adapt the method to deal with a larger set of location types and a large-scale scientific article corpus to enable microbiologists to integrate and use the extracted knowledge in combination with experimental data.
we participated in the bionlp  <dig> bacteria biotope  task with the alvis system.
bacteria biotopes cover a wide range of diverse habitats including animal and plant hosts, natural, medical and industrial environments.
the high volume of publications in the microbiology domain provides a rich source of up-to-date information on bacteria biotopes.
new developments since then have increased the f-score by  <dig>  points.
