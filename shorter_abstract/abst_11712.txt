we utilized a genotyping protocol that uses  <dig> amplicon sequencing to characterize the mhc class i in the endangered loggerhead sea turtle  and to investigate their evolution at multiple relevant levels of organization.
mhc class i genes revealed signatures of trans-species polymorphism across several reptile species.
we also found that individuals carrying an intermediate number of mhc class i alleles are larger than those with either a low or high number of alleles.
to fight against parasites and pathogens, genetic diversity of the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex  are particularly important.
in evolutionary and conservation biology, parasitism is often highlighted as a major selective pressure.
in the studied loggerhead turtle individuals, it results in the maintenance of two ancient allelic lineages.

multiple modes of evolution seem to maintain mhc diversity in the loggerhead turtles, with relatively high polymorphism for an endangered species.
