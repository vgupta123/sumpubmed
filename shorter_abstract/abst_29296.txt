instead, we saw that nmd-targets are strongly enriched with g nucleotides upstream of the termination codon, and even more so along their 3’utr.
this is particularly true for transcripts lacking an exon junction complex  along their 3’ untranslated region , and thus degrade through the ejc-independent nmd pathway.
we examined many features characterizing these transcripts, and compared them to nmd-insensitive transcripts, as well as to a group of transcripts that are destabilized following nmd repression .

it is not fully understood how a termination codon is recognized as premature  by the nonsense-mediated decay  machinery.
we suggest that high g content around the termination codon impedes translation termination as a result of mrna folding, thus triggering nmd.
we also suggest that high g content in the 3’utr helps to activate nmd by allowing for the accumulation of upf <dig>  or other nmd-promoting proteins, along the 3’utr.
