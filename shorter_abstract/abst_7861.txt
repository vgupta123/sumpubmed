peste des petits ruminants  is an endemic and highly contagious disease in small ruminants of pakistan.
results demonstrated in this study expanded the information on the genetic nature of different pprv population circulating in small ruminants.
phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced n genes  indicated the grouping of all the sequences in lineage iv along with pprv strains from asian and middle east.
a total of  <dig> blood samples from five different flocks were tested with real-time pcr for the presence of pprv genome.
the samples detected positive in real-time pcr  were subjected to conventional pcr for the amplification of the nucleoprotein  gene.
such information is essential to understand genetic nature of pprv strains throughout the country.
