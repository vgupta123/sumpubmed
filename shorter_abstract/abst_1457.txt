appropriate kinetic equations, based upon reaction rate laws, must be constructed and parameterized for each reaction.
the complex test-and-evaluation cycles that can be involved during kinetic model construction would thus benefit from automated methods for rate law assignment.
we present a high-throughput algorithm to automatically suggest and create suitable rate laws based upon reaction type according to several criteria.
the criteria for choices made by the algorithm can be influenced in order to assign the desired type of rate law to each reaction.
this algorithm is implemented in the software package sbmlsqueezer  <dig>  in addition, this program contains an integrated connection to the kinetics database sabio-rk to obtain experimentally-derived rate laws when desired.
automated methods have simplified the network reconstruction process, but building kinetic models for these systems is still a manually intensive task.
