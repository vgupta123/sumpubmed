in this study, we evaluated the stability of various references during retinoic acid-induced  differentiation of hes cells.
our results show that some of the commonly used reference genes are actually not amongst the most stable loci during hes cell differentiation promoted by retinoic acid.
out of  <dig> candidate references, beta-2-microglobulin, ribosomal protein l13a and alu repeats are found to be the most stable for this experimental set-up.
selecting stably expressed reference genes is essential for proper reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis.

moreover, a novel normalization strategy based on expressed alu repeats is validated for use in hes cell experiments.
