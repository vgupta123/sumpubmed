cold-pcr was found to increase the sensitivity of hrm analysis of pooled samples, but worked best with small amplicons.
examination of qmc-pcr demonstrated that primary pcr products for further analysis could be produced from variable levels of genomic dna.
hrm analysis of ppag and pptfl <dig> coding regions in  <dig> peach cultivars found one polymorphic site in each gene.
we examined the application of two hrm modifications, cold-pcr and qmc-pcr, to the mutation scanning of genes in peach, prunus persica.
natural snps in exons of target peach genes were discovered by hrm analysis of cultivars from a southeastern us breeding program.
pptfl <dig> and ppag snps were used to examine approaches to increase hrm throughput.
technical advances developed to improve clinical diagnostics can play a role in the targeted mutation breeding of crops.
