hat has several advantages over previous methods: i) as there is no single cut-off level for probe-intensity, hat can detect regions-of-interest at various thresholds, ii) it can detect regions-of-interest of any size, iii) it is independent of probe-resolution across the genome, and across tiling-array platforms and iv) it employs a single user defined parameter: the significance level.
a major challenge in the analysis of tiling-array data is to define regions-of-interest, i.e., contiguous probes with increased signal intensity  in a region.
we have developed hypergeometric analysis of tiling-arrays , and first evaluated its performance for tiling-array datasets from a chromatin immunoprecipitation study on chip  for the identification of genome-wide dna binding profiles of transcription factor cebpa .
subsequently, data from a retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen were used to examine the performance of hat among different applications of tiling-array datasets.
we demonstrate that hat has increased specificity for analysis of tiling-array data in comparison with the alternative method, and that it accurately detects regions-of-interest in two different applications of tiling-arrays.
regions-of-interest are detected by computing the hypergeometric-probability, while controlling the family wise error.
currently, no standard criteria are available to define these regions-of-interest as there is no single probe intensity cut-off level, different regions-of-interest can contain various numbers of probes, and can vary in genomic width.
