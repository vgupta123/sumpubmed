we compared the sequences of these minicircles to determine the content and characteristics of their chloroplast genomes.
the features include further protein coding genes, unusual rrna genes, which we show are transcribed, and the first examples of trna genes from peridinin-containing dinoflagellate chloroplast genomes.
comparative analysis of minicircle sequences has allowed us to identify previously unrecognised features of dinoflagellate chloroplast genomes, including additional protein and rna genes.
the retention of certain trna genes in the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome has important implications for models of chloroplast-mitochondrion interaction.
the chloroplast rrna gene sequences are radically different from those in other organisms, and in many ways resemble the rrna genes found in some highly reduced mitochondrial genomes.
we also made comparisons with minicircles which had been obtained from heterocapsa triquetra, another peridinin-containing dinoflagellate.
in this study we present a comparison of sets of minicircle sequences from three dinoflagellate species.
peridinin-containing dinoflagellates have a highly reduced chloroplast genome, which is unlike that found in other chloroplast containing organisms.
unusually the genes believed to be remaining in the chloroplast genome are found on small dna 'minicircles'.
