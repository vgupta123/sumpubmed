the not-n algorithm has been incorporated into the "minimum snps" computer program and used to derive genetic markers diagnostic for multilocus sequence typing-defined clonal complexes, hepatitis c virus  subtypes, and phylogenetic clades defined by comparative genome hybridization  data for campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica and clostridium difficile.
the best results to date have been obtained with cgh data from several bacterial species, and hcv sequence data.
here we describe the not-n algorithm, which is designed to identify small sets of genetic markers diagnostic for user-specified subsets of known genetic variants.
rather not-n analysis is designed to underpin assays that provide 0% false negatives, which is very important for e.g.
not-n analysis is effective for identifying small sets of genetic markers diagnostic for microbial sub-groups.
