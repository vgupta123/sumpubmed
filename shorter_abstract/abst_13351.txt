the expression of g protein and phospholipase c signaling molecules in this organ is consistent with chemosensory detection being via a g-protein-coupled signaling mechanism.
representatives of each subfamily are restricted to or differentially expressed in the rhinophore and oral tentacles, suggesting that they encode functional chemoreceptors and that these olfactory organs sense different chemicals.
phylogenetic analyses show that the novel aplysia g-protein coupled receptor-like proteins represent three distinct monophyletic subfamilies.
secondary signaling component proteins gαq, gαi, and gαo are also expressed in the rhinophore sensory epithelium.
the novel rhodopsin g-protein coupled receptor-like gene subfamilies identified here do not have closely related identifiable orthologs in other metazoans, suggesting that they arose by a lineage-specific expansion as has been observed in chemosensory receptor families in other bilaterians.
these candidate chemosensory receptors are expressed and often restricted to rhinophores and oral tentacles, lending support to the notion that water-borne chemical detection in aplysia involves species- or lineage-specific families of chemosensory receptors.
here we show that novel multi-transmembrane proteins with similarity to rhodopsin g-protein coupled receptors are expressed in sensory epithelia microdissected from the aplysia rhinophore.
