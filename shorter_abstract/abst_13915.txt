the rapid conversion of oleoyl-dhea into circulating dhea-sulfate was investigated using stomach, liver and intestine homogenates; which hydrolysed oleoyl-dhea optimally near ph  <dig>  duodenum and ileum contained the highest esterase activities.
the oral administration of oleoyl-dhea in order to extend dhea plasma availability has not been proved effective, since the ester is rapidly hydrolysed, probably in the intestine itself, and mainly converted to dhea-sulfate at least in females.
dehydroepiandrosterone  released by adrenal glands may be converted to androgens and estrogens mainly in the gonadal, adipose, mammary, hepatic and nervous tissue.
the kinetics of appearance of the label in plasma was unrelated to sex; the pattern being largely coincident with the levels of dhea-sulfate only in females, and after  <dig> h undistinguishable from the results obtained using labelled dhea gavages; in the short term, practically no lipophilic dhea label was found in plasma.
the intestinal and liver esterases were differently activated by taurocholate and showed different ph-activity patterns than cholesterol esterase, suggesting that oleoyl-dhea can be hydrolysed by a number of esterases in the lumen , in the intestinal wall and the liver.
after  <dig> h only a small fraction of the label remained in the rat organs, with a different sex-related distribution pattern coincident for oleoyl- and free- dhea gavages.
tritium-labelled oleoyl-dhea was given to wistar male and female rats by gastric tube.
