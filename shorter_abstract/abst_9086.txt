annotated transcript models are hosted in a public data repository and thus can be easily accessed or loaded into genome browsers.
however, as this tissue is quite unique and equine gene annotation is largely derived from computational predictions, there are likely yet uncharacterized transcripts that may be involved in the etiology of laminitis.
rt-pcr of  <dig> selected assemblies confirmed structure and expression in lamellar tissue.
in order to create a novel annotation resource, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of sagittal lamellar sections from one control and two laminitis affected horses.
whole transcriptome sequencing of the three samples resulted in  <dig> million reads.
transcriptome sequencing represents a powerful tool to expand on equine annotation and identify novel targets for further laminitis research.
laminitis, the structural failure of interdigitated tissue that suspends the distal skeleton within the hoof capsule, is a devastating disease that is the second leading cause of both lameness and euthanasia in the horse.
