at the mrna level the observed distribution patterns agree with the mouse model.
our observation suggests a possible role of cdx <dig> in the process of epigenetic regulation of embryonic cell fate.
nanog appeared at the morula stage and was located in the cytoplasm forming characteristic rings around the nuclei.
there is an intriguing possibility that for proper lineage determination certain transcription factors  may need to occupy specific regions of chromatin prior to its activation in the interphase nucleus.
to gain an insight into these processes we have studied protein and mrna distribution during the crucial stages of bovine development.
protein distribution of lineage specific markers oct <dig>  nanog, cdx <dig> were analysed in 5-cell, 8â€“ <dig> cell, morula and blastocyst stage embryos.
preimplantation bovine development is emerging as an attractive experimental model, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying trophoblast /inner cell mass  segregation in cattle.
interestingly, we have observed in a small proportion of embryos  that cdx <dig> immunolabelling overlapped with mitotic chromosomes.
cdx <dig> initially co-localised with oct <dig>  but at the blastocyst stage a clear lineage segregation could be observed.
icm/te mrna levels were compared in hatched blastocysts and included: oct <dig>  nanog, fn- <dig>  klf <dig>  c-myc, rex <dig>  cdx <dig>  krt- <dig> and gata <dig>
