here, we have developed an assay with precise spatial and temporal control of an infrared laser stimulus that targets one-fifth of the worm’s body and quantifies multiple aspects of the worm’s escape response.
this midbody response is probabilistic, producing either a backward, forward or pause state after the stimulus.
through high resolution quantitative behavioral analysis, we have comprehensively characterized the c. elegans escape response to noxious thermal stimuli applied along its body, and found a novel midbody response.
we further identified the nociceptor pvd as required to sense noxious heat at the midbody and can spatially differentiate localized thermal stimuli.
c. elegans performs a reflexive reversal or forward locomotory response when presented with noxious stimuli at the head or tail, respectively.
we have mapped the behavioral receptive field of thermal nociception along the entire body of the worm, and show a midbody avoidance behavior distinct from the head and tail responses.
at the midbody, the worm is sensitive to a change in the stimulus location as small as 80 μm.
analyses of mutants suggest the possibility that trpv channels and glutamate are involved in facilitating the midbody noxious response.
we identified pvd as the thermal nociceptor for the midbody response using calcium imaging, genetic ablation and laser ablation.
