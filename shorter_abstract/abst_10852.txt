using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , multilocus sequence typing , and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat sequence  analysis , the present work examines the genetic diversity of the endemic and epidemic a. baumannii clones isolated in a single hospital over a twelve-year period.
the present results demonstrate the persistence of several endemic pfge types in the hospital, the involvement of some of them in outbreaks, and the inter hospital transmission of extensively drug-resistant st- <dig> and st- <dig>
pfge analysis of  <dig> a. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex isolates detected  <dig> a. baumannii endemic/epidemic pfge types  that grouped into five clusters: ee1-ee <dig>  ee <dig>  ee <dig>  ee <dig> and ee12-ee <dig>  the mlst sequence type  distributions were: international clone ii  60%, international clone iii   <dig> %, st- <dig>  <dig> %, and st- <dig>  <dig> %.
the large  vntr marker profiles were fully concordant with the detected sts, and concordant with  <dig> up to  <dig> pfge types.
imipenem resistance was detected in five pfge types; the prevalence of the blaoxa-58-like and blaoxa-40-like genes was 60% and 40% respectively.
the wide diversity of mlva small -markers, however, did not permit clustering.
nosocomial outbreaks of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii are of worldwide concern.
pfge proved to be a vital tool for analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of the clones.
