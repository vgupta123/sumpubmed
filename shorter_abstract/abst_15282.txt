the capacity of marine species to survive chronic heat stress underpins their ability to survive warming oceans as a result of climate change.
this work provides preliminary insights into the response of p. maximus to chronic heat stress and provides a basis for future studies examining the tipping points and energetic trade-offs of scallop culture in warming oceans.
network analysis of these results indicated a pivotal role for gapdh and ap- <dig> signalling pathways.
individuals were maintained at three different temperatures  for 56 days, representing control conditions, maximum environmental temperature and extreme warming, with individuals sampled at seven time points.
data also suggested a remodelling of the cell structure, as revealed by the differential expression of genes involved in the cytoskeleton and cell membrane and a reduction in dna repair.

they also indicated the diversion of energetic metabolism towards the mobilization of lipid energy reserves to fuel the increased metabolic rate at the higher temperature.
