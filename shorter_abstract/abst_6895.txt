blman5_ <dig> possesses a novel low affinity carbohydrate binding module  specific for soluble mannan and displays the highest catalytic efficiency reported to date for a gh <dig> mannanase owing to a very high kcat  and a low km  using locust bean galactomannan as substrate.
blman5_ <dig> is evolved for efficient deconstruction of soluble mannans, which is reflected by an exceptionally low km and the presence of an atypical low affinity cbm, which increases binding to specifically to soluble mannan while causing minimal decrease in catalytic efficiency as opposed to enzymes with canonical mannan binding modules.
surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed the binding of the cbm <dig> to manno-oligosaccharides, albeit with slightly lower affinity than the catalytic module of the enzyme.
members of this new subfamily lack an aromatic residue mediating binding to insoluble cellulose in canonical cbm <dig> members consistent with the observed low mannan affinity.
the novel cbm of blman5_ <dig> mediates increased binding to soluble mannan based on affinity electrophoresis.
here, we report the biochemical properties of the first family  <dig> subfamily  <dig> glycoside hydrolase  mannanase from the probiotic bacterium bifidobacterium animalis subsp.
certain human gut microbiota members including health-promoting bifidobacterium spp.
