finally, there was an increase in glutamate/creatine  in str in wt mice treated with donepezil.
significant differences were observed in the metabolic pattern of app/ps <dig> mice in both str and ctx/hipp before and after donepezil treatment using multivariate data analysis, evidencing a significant treatment effect.
a significant decrease in the metabolic ratio taurine/creatine  was related to donepezil treatment  in app/ps <dig> mice in both brain regions.
consequently, the app/ps <dig> mouse model reflects important features of the neurochemical profile in humans.
donepezil improves cognitive functions in ad patients.
the app/ps <dig> mouse coexpresses the mutated forms of human Î²-amyloid precursor protein  and mutated human presenilin  <dig> .
metabolites were quantified using the lcmodel and the final analysis was done using multivariate data analysis.
the aim of this study was to investigate if multivariate data analysis could detect changes in the pattern of the metabolic profile after donepezil treatment.
multivariate data analysis can detect changes in the metabolic profile in app/ps <dig> mice after donepezil treatment.
in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy  was performed in fronto-parietal cortex and hippocampus  and in striatum .
a treatment effect was also seen in wild type  mice in str.
changes in tau/tcr and tcho/tcr could possibly be related to changed cholinergic activity caused by donepezil treatment.
