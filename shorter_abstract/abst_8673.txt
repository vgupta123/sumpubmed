in addition, we have shown that the extracted pairs strongly correlate with both drug target genes and therapeutic classes, therefore may have high potential in drug discovery.
the large-scale, accurate, machine-understandable drug-disease treatment knowledge base that is resultant of our study, in combination with pairs from structured databases, will have high potential in computational drug repurposing tasks.
we demonstrated that our simple pattern-learning relationship extraction algorithm is able to accurately extract many drug-disease pairs from the free text of biomedical literature that are not captured in structured databases.
however, much of this information is buried in free text and not captured in any existing databases.
the large body of published biomedical research articles and clinical case reports available on medline is a rich source of fda-approved drug-disease indication as well as drug-repurposing knowledge that is crucial for applying fda-approved drugs for new diseases.
our algorithm achieved a precision of  <dig>  and a recall of  <dig>  in extracting all pairs, and a precision of  <dig>  and a recall of  <dig>  in extracting frequent pairs.
in this study, we developed a simple but highly accurate pattern-learning approach to extract treatment-specific drug-disease pairs from  <dig> million biomedical abstracts available on medline.
the goal of this study is to extract a large number of accurate drug-disease treatment pairs from published literature.
