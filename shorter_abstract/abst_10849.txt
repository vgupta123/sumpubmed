however, it is challenging to obtain structures more accurate than the single best templates by either combining information from multiple templates or by modeling regions that vary among templates or are not covered by any templates.
we introduce galaxytbm, a new tbm method in which the more reliable core region is modeled first from multiple templates and less reliable, variable local regions, such as loops or termini, are then detected and re-modeled by an ab initio method.
application of galaxytbm to casp <dig> targets demonstrates that accurate protein structure prediction is possible by use of a multiple-template-based approach, and ab initio modeling of variable regions can further enhance the model quality.
protein structures can be reliably predicted by template-based modeling  when experimental structures of homologous proteins are available.
the accuracy of the initial core modeling is enhanced by focusing on more conserved regions in the multiple-template selection and multiple sequence alignment stages.
additional improvement is achieved by ab initio modeling of up to  <dig> unreliable local regions in the fixed framework of the core structure.
