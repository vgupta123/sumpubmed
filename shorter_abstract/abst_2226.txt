however, the narrow genetic base in cucumber makes it difficult for constructing high-density genetic maps.
a high-resolution genetic map containing  <dig>  snps was constructed for cucumber spanning  <dig>  cm.
<dig> scaffolds were anchored to the snp-based genetic map covering 46%  of the cucumber genome .
this  <dig> -locus map would likely facilitate genetic mapping of complex qtl loci controlling fruit yield, and the orientation of draft genome scaffolds.

a total of  <dig>  gb raw data and  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads were generated to develop  <dig>  high-quality slafs, out of which  <dig>  were polymorphic.
we report herein the development of evenly dispersed snps across cucumber genome, and for the first time an snp-based saturated linkage map.
alignment of the snp markers to draft genome scaffolds revealed two mis-assembled scaffolds that were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
the development of massively parallel genotyping methods and next-generation sequencing  technologies provides an excellent opportunity for developing single nucleotide polymorphisms  for linkage map construction and qtl analysis of horticultural traits.
an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals was developed from an intra-varietal cross between cc <dig> and nc <dig>  genomic dnas extracted from two parents and 148 f <dig> individuals were subjected to high-throughput sequencing and slaf library construction.
nine qtls for fruit length and weight were detected, a qtl designated fl <dig>  explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.
the average distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm.
