the efficiency of the byl was tested using three model proteins: enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  and two versions of luciferase.
in dialysis reactions, the byl yielded about 400 μg/ml eyfp, representing up to 50% more of the target protein than the promega wge, and equivalent to the amount using 5prime wge system.
the protein yield in batch and dialysis reactions using byl was much higher than that of a commercial promega wge preparation, achieving a maximum yield of 80 μg/ml of eyfp and 100 μg/ml of luciferase, compared to only 45 μg/ml of eyfp and 35 μg/ml of luciferase in wges.
due to the high yield and the short preparation time the byl represents a remarkable improvement over current eukaryotic cell-free systems.
eukaryotic counterparts such as wheat germ extract  and rabbit reticulocyte lysate  may improve solubility and promote the correct folding of eukaryotic multi-domain proteins that are difficult to express in bacteria.
