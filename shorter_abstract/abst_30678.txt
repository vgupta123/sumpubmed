gypsy moth-feeding on individual leaves of p. trichocarpa trees resulted in induced volatile emission from damaged leaves, but not from undamaged adjacent leaves.
eleven tps genes  could be isolated from gypsy moth -damaged p. trichocarpa leaves and heterologous expression in escherichia coli revealed tps activity for ten of the encoded enzymes.
our data indicate that the formation of herbivore-induced volatile terpenes in p. trichocarpa is mainly regulated by transcript accumulation of multiple tps genes and is likely mediated by jasmonates.
moreover, the concentration of jasmonic acid and its isoleucine conjugates as well as pttps <dig> gene expression were exclusively increased in the damaged leaves, suggesting that no systemic induction occurred within the tree.
although the volatile blend is dominated by mono- and sesquiterpenes, there is much to be learned about their formation in poplar.
as a response to caterpillar feeding, poplar releases a complex mixture of volatiles which comprises several classes of compounds.

analysis of tps transcript abundance in herbivore-damaged leaves and undamaged control leaves showed that seven of the genes, pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  were significantly upregulated after herbivory.
the specific local emission of volatiles from herbivore-damaged leaves might help herbivore enemies to find their hosts or prey in the tree canopy.
