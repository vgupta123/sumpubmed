bph-responsive transcript profiles were distinct between resistant and susceptible plants and between the early stage  and late stage .
these results increase our understanding of plant–insect interactions and can be used to protect against this destructive agricultural pest.
the key defense mechanism was related to jasmonate signaling, ethylene signaling, receptor kinase, mapk cascades, ca2+ signaling, pr genes, transcription factors, and protein posttranslational modifications.
four jacalin-related lectin proteins genes and one lrr protein gene were found constitutively expressed in resistant parent and considered the candidate genes of bph <dig>  the transcriptomes of resistant bph <dig> introgression line and the susceptible recipient line were analyzed using high-throughput rna sequencing.
nevertheless, molecular mechanism of the resistance remain unclear.

we analyzed  <dig>  bc2f <dig> plants of cross between susceptible rice tn <dig> and the recombinant inbred line ri <dig> that carrying the bph <dig> gene from original resistant donor b <dig>  bph <dig> was mapped to a  <dig>  cm region on chromosome  <dig>  which is 210-kb in the reference genome of nipponbare.
sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome  clones that span the bph <dig> region revealed that the physical size of bph <dig> region in resistant rice b <dig> is 580-kb, much bigger than the corresponding region in the reference genome of nipponbare.
the expression profiles of predicted genes were analyzed.
there were  <dig> predicted genes in the bph <dig> region in resistant rice.
our work combined bac and rna sequencing to identify candidate genes of bph <dig> and revealed the resistance mechanism that it mediated.
