after creating and analyzing a database of human antibody sequences, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the humanness of therapeutic antibodies, and found that increased humanness score is correlated with decreased immunogenicity of antibodies.
multiple forms of antibody therapeutics are in use today that differ in the amount of human sequence present in both the constant and variable regions, where antibodies that are more human-like usually have reduced immunogenicity in clinical trials.
here we present a method to quantify the humanness of the variable region of monoclonal antibodies and show that this method is able to clearly distinguish human and non-human antibodies with excellent specificity.
our results reveal that in most cases humanizing an antibody and confirming the humanness of the final form may be sufficient to eliminate immunogenicity issues to the same extent as using fully human antibodies.
we further discovered a surprisingly similarity in the immunogenicity of fully human antibodies and humanized antibodies that are more human-like based on their humanness score.
we created a public website to calculate the humanness score of any input antibody sequence based on our human antibody database.
