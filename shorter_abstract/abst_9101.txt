they permit the user to represent the transport and transformation of chemical species and to define inhibitory and stimulatory dependencies.
software tools that model and simulate the dynamics of biological processes and systems are becoming increasingly important.
such guis are based on symbolic or graphical notations used to describe, interact and communicate the developed models.
typically, these graphical notations are geared towards conventional biochemical pathway diagrams.
narrator's gui is based on an expressive graphical notation which forms an integral part of the co-dependence methodology.
behind the user-friendly gui, narrator hides a flexible feature which makes it relatively easy to map models defined via the graphical notation to mathematical formalisms and languages such as ordinary differential equations, the systems biology markup language or gillespie's direct method.
narrator is a software tool facilitating the development and simulation of biological systems as co-dependence models.
it is specifically intended for users aiming to construct and simulate dynamic models of biology without recourse to extensive mathematical detail.
a critical weakness of existing tools is their lack of supporting an integrative representation of transport, transformation as well as biological information processing.
the co-dependence methodology complements the representation of species transport and transformation together with an explicit mechanism to express biological information processing.
thus, co-dependence models explicitly capture, for instance, signal processing structures and the influence of exogenous factors or events affecting certain parts of a biological system or process.
