we test the algorithm both on synthetic networks and on microarray expression profiles.
several methods have been developed to infer gene networks from steady-state data, much less literature is produced about time-course data, so the development of algorithms to infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area.
here we report the adaptation of the aracne algorithm to infer gene regulatory networks from time-course data, so that, the resulting network is represented as a directed graph.
in order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory.
it just tries to extract dependencies between two genes at different time delays, providing a measure of these dependencies in terms of mutual information.
our results are compared with aracne itself and with the ones of two previously published algorithms: dynamic bayesian networks and systems of odes, showing that timedelay-aracne has good accuracy, recall and f-score for the network reconstruction task.
one of main aims of molecular biology is the gain of knowledge about how molecular components interact each other and to understand gene function regulations.
in this paper we show how the aracne  algorithm can be used for gene regulatory network inference in the case of time-course expression profiles.
the basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to detect time-delayed dependencies between the expression profiles by assuming as underlying probabilistic model a stationary markov random field.
