synteny analysis of similar genes revealed that the synteny of protospacers matched the synteny of homologous genes.
a user-friendly database containing protospacers and detailed information of the sites was developed and is available for public use at the grape-crispr website .
with the exception of the ngg type, they were abundantly present in the grape genomes.
among them,  <dig> , <dig> target sites were mapped to specific genomic locations and  <dig> , <dig> were found to be highly specific.
five pam types, tgg, agg, ggg, cgg and ngg, were observed.
in this study, we identified and characterized five types of crispr/cas <dig> target sites in the widely cultivated grape species vitis vinifera and developed a user-friendly database for editing grape genomes in the future.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> potential crispr/cas <dig> target sites were identified from grape genomes in this study.
protospacers and pams were found to distribute uniformly and abundantly in the grape genomes.
grape genomes harbour millions of potential crispr/cas <dig> target sites.
among other functions, the database allows users to identify and select multi-protospacers for editing similar sequences in grape genomes simultaneously.
