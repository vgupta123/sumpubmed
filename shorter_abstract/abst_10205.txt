d-glucuronyl-c5-epimerase  is a key hs chain modifying enzyme that catalyses the conversion of glucuronic acid into iduronic acid, a biosynthetic step that enhances hs biological activity.
heparan sulfate  is an ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix that binds and modulates the activity of growth factors, cytokines and proteases.
by monitoring the expression of well characterized marker genes during gastrulation, we have found that misexpression of glce causes a dose-dependent expansion of the ventral structures, whereas protein knockdown using targeted antisense morpholino oligonucleotides promotes axis dorsalization.
glce activity is an important determinant of of dorso-ventral axis formation and patterning in zebrafish.
the results obtained further corroborate the concept that hs encodes information that affect morphogenesis during early vertebrate development.
at later developmental stages the epimerases are expressed widely throughout gastrulation and then become restricted to the hindbrain at  <dig> h post-fertilization.
transcripts for both proteins were detected in fertilized zebrafish embryos prior to the onset of zygotic transcription indicating their maternal origin.
