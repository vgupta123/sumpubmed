this technique can resolve very complex genotypes into their constituent haplotypes; it defined all the alleles at  <dig> snp in exon  <dig> of the ovine drb <dig> mhc locus in a sample of  <dig> rams.
sequencing has the advantage of identifying novel polymorphic sites but where all snp sites have been identified this novel procedure can resolve all alleles and haplotypes and identify novel combinations of polymorphisms.
it provides a high degree of internal quality control, as each pcr product is represented in duplicate on the bead array, and each snp is tested against multiple partners.
we have developed a multiplex double amplification refractory mutation system combined with solid phase pcr on fluorescently labelled beads.
