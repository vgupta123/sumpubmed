several aphid-induced changes were compromised in the aos mutant, particularly genes connected to regulation of transcription, defence responses and redox changes.
due to jasmonate-triggered pre-activation of fou <dig>  its transcriptional profile in non-challenged plants mimicked the induction of defence responses in wt.
thus, in plants lacking jasmonates many of the defence-related responses induced by infestation in wt plants are impaired.
aphid attack induces the jasmonic acid signalling pathway, but very little is known about the specific impact jasmonates have on the expression of genes that respond to aphid attack.
additional activation of fou <dig> upon aphid attack was therefore limited.
we have evaluated the function that jasmonates have in regulating arabidopsis thaliana responses to cabbage aphid  by conducting a large-scale transcriptional analysis of two mutants: aos, which is defective in jasmonate production, and fou <dig>  which constitutively induces jasmonic acid biosynthesis.
insect fitness experiments revealed that the physiological consequences of fou <dig> mutation contributed to more effective protection against b. brassicae.
however, aos mutation does not seem to affect aphid performance when the density of b. brassicae populations on plants is low and aphids are free to move around.
nevertheless, jasmonate signalling that is induced by infestation is important in mediating resistance to phloem feeders.
this analysis enabled us to determine which genes' expression patterns depend on the jasmonic acid signalling pathway.
analysis of transcriptional profiles of wt, aos and fou <dig> plants revealed that the expression of more than  <dig> genes is dependent on jasmonate status, regardless of external stimuli.
