biomedical literature includes an enormous amount of textual descriptions of biological entities, their interactions and results of related experiments.
relation extraction is an essential procedure in literature mining.
our method is designed as a sieve-based system and uses linear-chain conditional random fields and rules for relation extraction.
we observe that all relation extraction sieves contribute to the predictive performance of the proposed approach.
furthermore, sieves with conditional random fields can be trained on arbitrary text data and hence are applicable to broad range of relation extraction tasks and data domains.

to enable extraction of distant relations using first-order models, we transform the data into skip-mention sequences.
analysis of distances between different mention types in the text shows that our choice of transforming data into skip-mention sequences is appropriate for detecting relations between distant mentions.
we develop a computational approach for extraction of gene regulatory networks from textual data.
the sieve-based architecture simplifies the system as new sieves can be easily added or removed and each sieve can utilize the results of previous ones.
following the shared task, we conducted additional analysis using different system settings that resulted in reducing the reconstruction error of bacterial sporulation network from  <dig>  to  <dig> , measured as the slot error rate between the predicted and the reference network.
linear-chain conditional random fields, along with appropriate data transformations, can be efficiently used to extract relations.
the current challenge is the development of information extraction procedures that can directly infer more complex relational structures, such as gene regulatory networks.
