white spot syndrome  is a viral disease that affects most of the commercially important shrimps and causes serious economic losses to the shrimp farming industry worldwide.
in addition, the ests reported in this study provide a rich source for identification of novel genes in shrimp.
our data suggest that several basic cellular metabolic processes are likely to be affected, including oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis, the glycolytic pathway, and calcium ion balance.
a database containing all the sequence data and analysis results is accessible at .
comparative est analyses suggested that, in postlarval shrimp, wssv infection strongly modulates the gene expression patterns in several organs or tissues, including the hepatopancreas, muscle, eyestalk and cuticle.
a group of immune-related chitin-binding protein genes is also likely to be strongly up regulated after wssv infection.
this study suggests that wssv infection modulates expression of various kinds of genes.
in this study, we used an expressed sequence tag  approach to observe global gene expression changes in white spot syndrome virus -infected postlarvae of penaeus monodon.
the predicted gene expression pattern changes not only reflect the possible responses of shrimp to the virus infection but also suggest how wssv subverts cellular functions for virus multiplication.
