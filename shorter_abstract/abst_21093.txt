an in vivo assay indicated that gsno treatment reduced the progression of pcv <dig> infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of pcv2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral dna copies in serum samples.
gsno also improved the growth performance and immune organs  of the pcv2-infected mice to some degree.
this study was conducted to investigate the antiviral activity of no generated from s-nitrosoglutathione , during pcv <dig> infection of pk- <dig> cells and balb/c mice.
our data demonstrate that the no-generating compound gsno suppresses pcv <dig> infection in pk- <dig> cells and balb/c mice, indicating that no and its donor, gsno, have potential value as antiviral drugs against pcv <dig> infection.
