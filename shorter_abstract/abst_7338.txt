of the total  <dig>  transcript derived fragments  obtained using cdna-aflp with  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig>   displayed altered expression patterns after inoculation, of which  <dig> showed up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated.
of the  <dig> reliable tdfs,  <dig> homologous to genes known to play a role in disease/defense, signal transduction or uncharacterized genes were further selected for validation of cdna-aflp expression patterns using qrt-pcr analyses.
results confirmed the altered expression patterns of  <dig>  genes revealed by the cdna-aflp technique.
the results show that cdna-aflp is a reliable technique for studying expression patterns of genes involved in the wheat-stripe rust interactions.
genes involved in compatible interactions between wheat and the stripe rust pathogen were identified and their expression patterns were determined.
tritici is a fungal pathogen causing stripe rust, one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide.
blast searching of the wheat stem rust fungus genome database identified  <dig> tdfs possibly from the stripe rust pathogen, of which  <dig> were validated of the pathogen origin using pcr-based assays followed by sequencing confirmation.
in spite of its economic importance, little is known about the molecular basis of compatible interaction between the pathogen and wheat host.
<dig> tdfs produced reliable sequences after sequencing of  <dig> tdfs selected, of which  <dig>  had known functions through blast searching the genbank database.
in this study, we identified wheat and p. striiformis genes associated with the infection process by conducting a large-scale transcriptomic analysis using cdna-aflp.
the present study should be helpful in elucidating the molecular basis of the infection process, and identifying genes that can be targeted for inhibiting the growth and reproduction of the pathogen.
majority of the latter group had predicted gene products involved in energy , signal transduction , disease/defence  and metabolism .
