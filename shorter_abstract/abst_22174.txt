the problem can be formulated as a linear program, a convex optimization problem, for which efficient algorithms are available that can treat large data sets efficiently and uncertainties in data or model parameters.
numerical methods based on linear programming can therefore help determine efficiently the network structure of biological systems from large data sets.
it also produces a network structure that can explain the real experimental data of l. lactis and is similar to the one found in the literature.
for this purpose, we make use of the observation that biochemical networks are in general 'sparse' and minimize the 1-norm of the decision variables  while constraints keep the error between data and the network dynamics small.
the presented methodology is able to predict with accuracy and efficiency the connectivity structure of a chemical reaction network with mass action kinetics and of a gene regulatory network from simulation data even if the dynamics of these systems are non-polynomial  and uncertainties in the data are taken into account.
determining the interaction topology of biological systems is a topic that currently attracts significant research interest.
the emphasis of our methodology is on determining the interconnection topology rather than the specific reaction constants and it takes into account the necessary properties that a chemical reaction network should have â€“ something that techniques based on linearization can not.
such nonlinear models make the problem of determining the connectivity of biochemical networks from time-series experimental data much harder.
the overall objective of this work is to provide methods to increase our understanding of complex biochemical systems, particularly through their interconnection and their non-equilibrium behavior.
