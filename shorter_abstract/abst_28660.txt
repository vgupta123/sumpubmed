additionally, sequence curation, alignment and assessment of the results of phylogenetic analysis are made particularly difficult by the potential for a given gene in a given species to be unrepresented, or to be represented by multiple or partial sequences.
by extracting sequences on the basis of both annotation and blast similarity, it ensures that all available sequence data can be brought to bear on a phylogenetic problem, but remains fast enough to cope with many thousands of records.
we have developed a software package, taxman, that largely automates the processes of sequence acquisition, consensus building, alignment and taxon selection to facilitate this type of phylogenetic study.
our results indicate that an automated phylogenetic workbench can be a useful tool when correctly guided by user knowledge.
supermatrices  can yield more phylogenetic signal than individual genes.
by using the stored aligned sequences, large concatenated multiple sequence alignments can be generated rapidly for a subset and output in analysis-ready file formats.
by automatically assisting in the selection of the best subset of taxa to address a particular phylogenetic problem, taxman greatly speeds up the process of generating multiple sequence alignments for phylogenetic analysis.
sequences are extracted from the genbank files on the basis of annotation and sequence similarity.
however, manually assembling such datasets for a large taxonomic group is time-consuming and error-prone.
phylogenetic analysis of large, multiple-gene datasets, assembled from public sequence databases, is rapidly becoming a popular way to approach difficult phylogenetic problems.
trees resulting from phylogenetic analysis can be stored and compared with a reference taxonomy.
taxman can automatically determine the best subset of taxa to examine phylogeny at a given taxonomic level.
