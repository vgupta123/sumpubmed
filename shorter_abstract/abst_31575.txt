these regulatory elements often respond to specific chemicals.
applying the currently developed method on a larger scale, by selecting and comparing an extended set of sequences, might allow the sequence rules underlying the activity of cis-acting regulatory peptides to be identified.
by introducing synonymous and non-synonymous mutations we have shown that at least in the case of erythromycin the sequences act at the peptide level.
the method is based on the Î²-lactamase gene containing a random sequence inserted into the beginning of the orf.
several cis-acting regulatory sequences functioning at the level of mrna or nascent peptide and specifically influencing transcription or translation have been described.
we have developed a method that allows us to select cis-acting regulatory sequences that respond to diverse chemicals.
