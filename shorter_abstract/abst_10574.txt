an identity by state analysis divided all the samples into three clusters; most of the c. carpio strains formed the largest cluster.
we have developed an array for c. carpio with  <dig>  snps and evaluated its performance using samples from various strains of c. carpio.
c. carpio is an important aquaculture species that accounts for nearly 14% of freshwater aquaculture production worldwide.
the snps used on the array were selected from two resources: the transcribed sequences from rna-seq data of four strains of c. carpio, and the genome re-sequencing data of five strains of c. carpio.
to evaluate the snp array,  <dig>  c. carpio samples were collected and tested.
we also evaluated our snp array on  <dig> samples from eight species related to c. carpio, with from  <dig>  to  <dig>  polymorphic snps.
the carp snp array described here is the first high-throughput genotyping platform for c. carpio.
our evaluation of this array indicates that it will be valuable for farmed carp and for genetic and population biology studies in c. carpio and related species.
a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been identified in common carp  but, as yet, no high-throughput genotyping platform is available for this species.

analysis of the linkage disequilibrium on all samples and on three domestic c.carpio strains revealed that the latter had the longer haplotype blocks.
