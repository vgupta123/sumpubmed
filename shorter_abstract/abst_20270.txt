incomplete digestion during the tag formation process may allow for multiple tags to be generated from a given mrna transcript.
three new hierarchical models, which directly embed a model for the variation in tag formation probability, are proposed and their associated bayesian inference algorithms are developed.
the consequences of tag formation bias are discussed in the context of testing differential expression.
several bayesian inference algorithms that account for tag formation effects are compared with the dpb algorithm providing clear evidence of superior performance.
calculations demonstrate the potential for false positive and negative findings due to variation in tag formation probabilities across samples when testing for differential expression.
taking this bias into account should allow more of the available data to be used leading to increased statistical power.
as a result, the observed tag counts represent a biased sample of the actual transcript pool.
the multivariate nature of the approach easily allows both univariate and joint tests of differential expression.
