with this unique group of transgenic hd nonhuman primates , we profiled over  <dig>  transcripts from peripheral blood collected over a 2Â year timespan from hd monkeys and age-matched wild-type control monkeys.
messenger rnas with expression patterns which diverged with disease progression in the hd monkeys considerably facilitated our search for transcripts with diagnostic or therapeutic potential in the blood of human hd patients, opening up a new avenue for clinical investigation.
development of animal models amenable to longitudinal examination enables distinct disease-associated mechanisms to be identified.
molecular instability, a core component in neurological disease progression, can be comprehensively evaluated through longitudinal transcriptomic profiling.
here we report the first longitudinal study of transgenic monkeys with genomic integration of various lengths of the human htt gene and a range of polyq repeats.
