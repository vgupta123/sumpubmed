staphylococcus aureus immunodominant surface antigen b  elicits an immune response during septicemia and is generally classified as a virulence factor, but its biological function remains completely undefined.
because extracellular dna has been shown to play a role in biofilm formation, we investigated the biofilm-forming capacity of an isogenic isab deletion mutant but we found that isab did not contribute to biofilm formation under any conditions tested.
in an attempt to identify staphylococcal rna-binding proteins, we designed an rna affinity chromatography assay and subsequently isolated isab.
isab is an extracellular nucleic acid binding protein, with little to no sequence specificity, but its role in virulence remains unclear.
gel shift analysis confirmed the rna binding activity but revealed that isab bound to any nucleic acid without sequence specificity.
