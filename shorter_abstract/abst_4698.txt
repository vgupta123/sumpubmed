buffaloes in treatment group were injected with oxytocin before each milking  for milk let down; whereas, animals in control group were milked naturally without oxytocin injection.
oxytocin injection in lactating buffaloes resulted in elevated oxidative stress by increasing the total homocysteine and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and decreasing enzymatic activities of antioxidant enzymes including paraoxonase- <dig> and arylesterase; that might render the animals to poor productive and reproductive potential.
oxytocin has been reported for a wide range of adverse effects in different species of lactating animals.
the present study was aimed to evaluate the adverse effects of oxytocin on biomarkers of oxidative stress in buffaloes.
results showed significantly higher levels  of tos, thcy and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity in lactating buffaloes injected with oxytocin as compared to those of control group.
both the groups were assessed for oxidative stress biomarkers.
treatment and control groups, each containing  <dig> buffaloes.
