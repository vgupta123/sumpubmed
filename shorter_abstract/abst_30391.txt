b-cell epitopes have been studied extensively due to their immunological applications, such as peptide-based vaccine development, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.
in this work, based on the antigen’s primary sequence information, a novel linear b-cell epitope prediction model was developed using the multiple linear regression .
despite several decades of research, the accurate prediction of linear b-cell epitopes has remained a challenging task.
a 10-fold cross-validation test on a large non-redundant dataset was performed to evaluate the performance of our model.

to alleviate the problem caused by the noise of negative dataset,  <dig> experiments utilizing  <dig> sub-datasets were performed.
moreover, a web server epmlr has been developed for linear b-cell epitope prediction: http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/epitope/epmlr/.
we have presented a reliable method for the identification of linear b cell epitope using antigen’s primary sequence information.
we achieved overall sensitivity of  <dig> %, precision of  <dig> % and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of  <dig> .
