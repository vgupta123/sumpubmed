mass sequence data of chinese bayberry was obtained and the expression profiles were examined during fruit ripening.
however, research at the molecular level is limited by a lack of sequence data.
the present study was designed to obtain transcript sequence data and examine gene expression in bayberry developing fruit based on rna-seq and bioinformatic analysis, to provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit quality changes during ripening.
rna-seq generated  <dig>  g raw data, which was then de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp.
all genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were up-regulated during the fruit ripening processes, concurrent with color change.
using pathway mapping and expression profiles, the molecular mechanisms for changes in fruit color and taste during ripening were examined.
important changes in carbohydrate and acid metabolism in the ripening fruit are likely associated with expression of sucrose phosphate synthase  and glutamate decarboxylase .
chinese bayberry  is an important subtropical fruit crop and an ideal species for fruit quality research due to the rapid and substantial changes that occur during development and ripening, including changes in fruit color and taste.
this provides a reference for the study of complicated metabolism in non-model perennial species.
go comparisons between the unigenes of these two types and interactive pathways  analysis found that energy-related metabolism was enhanced, and catalytic activity was increased.
the unigenes were annotated, providing a platform for functional genomic research with this species.
