this analysis revealed that obese zebrafish and mammals share common pathophysiological pathways related to the coagulation cascade and lipid metabolism.
furthermore, several regulators were identified in zebrafish and mammals, including apoh, il- <dig> and il-1β in the coagulation cascade, and srebf <dig>  pparα/γ, nr1h <dig> and lep in lipid metabolism.
we established a zebrafish model of dio that shared common pathophysiological pathways with mammalian obesity.
zebrafish were fed under these dietary protocols for  <dig> weeks.
the zebrafish overfed with artemia exhibited increased body mass index, which was calculated by dividing the body weight by the square of the body length, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatosteatosis, unlike the control zebrafish.
the increased body weight and plasma triglyceride level were improved by calorie restriction.
the dio zebrafish can be used to identify putative pharmacological targets and to test novel drugs for the treatment of human obesity.
we also performed comparative transcriptome analysis of visceral adipose tissue from dio zebrafish, dio rats, dio mice and obese humans.
calorie restriction for  <dig> weeks was applied to zebrafish after the 8-week overfeeding period.
the other group of zebrafish was fed with artemia sufficient to meet their energy requirements .
the purpose of this study was to establish a zebrafish model of diet-induced obesity .
