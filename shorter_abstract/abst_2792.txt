as a proof of principle, we used crispr-cas <dig> to disrupt the coding sequence of the homeobox gene, evx <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells.
we were able to identify both homozygous and heterozygous evx <dig> mutants, as well as mixed clones, which must be identified to maintain the integrity of subsequent experiments.
this relatively new technology has already been used in a large number of ‘loss of function’ experiments in cultured cells.
crispr-cas <dig> is a revolutionary genome editing technique that allows for efficient and directed alterations of the eukaryotic genome.
we screened  <dig> crispr-cas <dig> transfected clones simultaneously by next-generation sequencing on the ion torrent pgm.
