however, how expression divergence between tandemly duplicated genes has emerged and maintained remain unclear.
the accumulation of ctcf-binding sites drives expression divergence of tandemly duplicated genes.
after tandem duplication events, ctcf-binding sites gradually accumulate between paralogs.
this phenomenon was not observed for non-paralogous adjacent genes.
this process is likely targeted by natural selection.
we demonstrate that ccctc-binding factor , the master epigenetic regulator and the only known insulator protein in humans, has played a predominant role in generating divergence in both expression profiles and expression levels between adjacent paralogs in the human genome.
