despite the chloride anion is involved in fundamental biological processes, its interactions with proteins are little known.
the analysis of a non-redundant set  of  <dig> high resolution  crystal structures that contain at least one chloride anion shows that the first coordination spheres of the chlorides are essentially constituted by hydrogen bond donors.
the results of these analyses are useful in interpreting, describing, and validating new protein crystal structures that contain chloride anions.
although the most common coordination number is  <dig>  the coordination stereochemistry is closer to the expected geometry when the coordination number is  <dig>  suggesting that this is the coordination number towards which the chlorides tend when they interact with proteins.
amongst the side-chains positively charged, arginine interacts with chlorides much more frequently than lysine.
in particular, we lack a systematic survey of its coordination spheres.
