the assemblies were generated using various input parameter values, and were completed more efficiently by re-using compatible intermediate results.
however, assemblies of physical map data are sensitive to input parameters, which describe noise inherent in the data collection process.
physical mapping of dna with restriction enzymes allows for the characterization and assembly of much longer molecules than is feasible with sequencing.
these assemblies were assayed for contiguity, internal consistency, and accuracy.
although highly accurate assemblies were found, contiguity and internal consistency metrics were poor predictors of accuracy.
