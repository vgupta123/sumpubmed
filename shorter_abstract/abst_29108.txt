evidence of secondary mechanoreceptors in some tunicates, the proposed sister group of vertebrates, has recently led to the hypothesis that vertebrate and tunicate secondary sensory cells share a common origin.
hair cells are vertebrate secondary sensory cells located in the ear and in the lateral line organ.
secondary sensory cells were described in detail in two tunicate groups, ascidians and thaliaceans, in which they constitute an oral sensory structure called the coronal organ.
our study clearly shows that the circumoral ring is the appendicularian homologue of the coronal organ of other tunicate taxa.
we described the ultrastructure of the circumoral organ in two appendicularian species, oikopleura dioica and oikopleura albicans, and thus taxonomically completed the data collection of tunicate secondary sensory cells.
using light and electron microscopy we could demonstrate that the mechanosensory organ called the circumoral ring is composed of secondary sensory cells.
to understand the evolution of secondary sensory cells in tunicates, we performed a cladistic analysis using morphological data.
we constructed a matrix consisting of  <dig> characters derived from detailed ultrastructural studies in  <dig> tunicate species and used a cephalochordate and three vertebrate species as outgroups.
the cladistic analysis enabled us to reconstruct the features of the putative ancestral hair cell in tunicates, represented by a simple monociliated cell.
