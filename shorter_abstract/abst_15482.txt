using rnaseq, we profiled differential gene expression between the brains of territorial males, sneaker males, and females to study the molecular signatures of male dimorphism.
we found that more genes were differentially expressed between the two male phenotypes than between males and females, suggesting that during the reproductive period phenotypic plasticity is a more important factor in differential gene expression than sexual dimorphism.
social dominance is important for the reproductive success of males in many species.
previously suggested candidate genes for social dominance in the context of alternative mating strategies seem to be predominantly species-specific.
this is the first genome-wide study for a molecular non-model species in the context of alternative mating strategies and provides essential information for further studies investigating the molecular basis of social dominance.

we present a list of novel genes which are differentially expressed in tripterygion delaisi.
the territorial male overexpresses genes related to synaptic plasticity and the sneaker male overexpresses genes involved in differentiation and development.
