they have been used in the analysis of large molecular datasets such as microarray data, next generation sequencing, and other genomic datasets to reveal pleiotropic and multigenic contributions to phenotypic outcomes.
the genetic and molecular basis for many intermediate and end stage phenotypes in model systems such as c. elegans and d. melanogaster has long been known to involve pleiotropic effects and complex multigenic interactions.
many model systems lack species specific organized phenotype based gene sets to enable high throughput analysis of large molecular datasets.
these phenotypic gene set collections will contribute to the understanding of complex phenotypic outcomes in these model systems.
here, we describe two novel collections of gene sets in c. elegans and d. melanogaster that are based exclusively on genetically determined phenotypes and use a controlled phenotypic ontology.
phenotypic based gene sets in both c. elegans and d. melanogaster are developed, characterized, and shown to be useful in the analysis of large scale species-specific genomic datasets.
in addition, we demonstrate the utility of these gene sets in systems analysis and in analysis of gene expression-based molecular datasets and show how they are useful in analysis of genomic datasets connecting multigenic gene inputs to complex phenotypes.
