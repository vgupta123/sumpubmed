to identify genes expressed during early infection stages, in this study we constructed a cdna library with rna isolated from urediniospores of p. striiformis f. sp.
the rest  <dig> % unisequences had no significant homologs in genbank.
several of these ests shared significant homology with known fungal pathogenicity or virulence factors, such as hesp <dig> of the flax rust and pmk <dig>  gas <dig>  and gas <dig> of the rice blast fungus.
although it is critical to understand molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in the wheat stripe rust fungus for developing novel disease management strategies, little is known about its genome and gene functions due to difficulties in molecular studies with this important pathogen.
our data indicated that these genes were highly expressed in germinated urediniospores and may play important roles in fungal-plant interactions during early infection stages in the wheat stripe rust fungus.
we selected six ests  for assaying their expression patterns during urediniospore germination and wheat infection by quantitative real-time pcr.
tritici were identified by est analysis.
all of them had the highest transcript level in germinated urediniospores and a much less transcript level in un-germinated urediniospores and infected wheat tissues .
the transcript level of ps <dig> increased at later infection stages .
about  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the resulting  <dig> unisequences were homologous to functionally characterized proteins and hypothetical proteins, respectively.
genes expressed in germinated urediniospores of p. striiformis f. sp.
six of them were confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr assays to be highly expressed in germinated urediniospores.
