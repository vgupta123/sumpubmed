we conclude that rrna transcription in b. burgdorferi is complex and regulated both by growth phase and by the stringent response but not by temperature-modulated growth rate.
similar amounts of rrna were produced in exponential phase at both temperatures, and rrna was down-regulated in stationary phase at either temperature.
at 34°c, there were no differences in growth rate or in accumulation of total protein, dna and rna in b <dig> cultured in barbour-stoenner-kelly -h whether rabbit serum was present or not.
rt-pcr of b. burgdorferi n <dig> and b <dig> revealed three rrna region transcripts: 16s rrna-alanine transfer rna ; trnaile; and both sets of 23s-5s rrna.
dna per cell was higher in cells in exponential as compared to stationary phase at either temperature; protein per cell was similar at both temperatures in both phases.
interestingly, a relbbu deletion mutant unable to generate ppgpp did not down-regulate rrna at transition to stationary phase in serum-containing bsk-h at 34°c, similar to the relaxed phenotype of e. coli rela mutants.
