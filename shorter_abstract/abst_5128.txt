we identified ten novel meiotically-active promoters; which, along with their homologs, are prime candidates to specifically drive gene expression during meiosis in plants and can thus provide important tools for meiosis study and crop breeding.
so far, only a few meiotically-active promoters have been reported.
in a screen for meiotically-active promoters, we examined ten promoter sequences that are associated with novel meiotic candidate genes.
characterization of regulatory regions revealed that these meiotically-active promoters possessed conserved motifs and motif arrangement.
furthermore, the examination of homologs of the corresponding genes within green plants points to a great potential of applying the information from arabidopsis to other species, especially crop plants.
as conventional ubiquitous promoters are neither tissue-specific nor efficient in driving gene expression in meiocytes, promoters with high meiotic activities are potential candidates for manipulating the recombination process.
some of the promoters unite optimal properties which are invaluable for meiosis-directed studies such as delivering specific gene expression in early meiosis i and/or meiosis ii.
homologous recombination, together with selection, laid the foundation for traditional plant breeding.
