however, given the challenging farm environment of a restless cow, correct foetus ageing was achieved for only 21% of the correctly diagnosed pregnant cows.
our aim is to present the pilot study and proof of concept of a new non invasive technique to sense the presence and age  of the foetus by recording the electrical and audio signals produced by the foetus heartbeat using an array of specialized sensors embedded in a stand alone handheld prototype device.
pregnancy testing in cattle is commonly invasive requiring manual rectal palpation of the reproductive tract that presents risks to the operator and pregnancy.
the device was applied to the right flank  of more than  <dig> cattle from  <dig> different farms, including pregnant and not pregnant, a diversity of breeds, and both dairy and beef herds.
