second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data.
they are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights.
cellnoptr features different logic formalisms, from boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework.
models built with cellnoptr are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease.
