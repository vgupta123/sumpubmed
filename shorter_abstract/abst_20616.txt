each data manipulation step has roll-back abilities, allowing for return to previous steps of the data analysis process.

we present a windows-based application, slim-filter designed to interactively examine the statistical properties of sequencing reads produced by illumina genome analyzer and to perform a broad spectrum of data manipulation tasks including: filtration of low quality and low complexity reads; filtration of reads containing undesired subsequences ; excluding duplicated reads ; and sorting reads by copy numbers allowing for easy access and manual editing of the resulting files.
slim-filter is organized as a sequence of windows summarizing the statistical properties of the reads.
the presented windows-based application has been developed with the goal of providing individual investigators with integrated sequencing reads analysis, curation, and manipulation capabilities.
furthermore, such services are often performed using specialized computational facilities.
slim-filter is written in c++ and is compatible with fasta, fastq, and specialized as file formats presented in this manuscript.
the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies has made it possible for individual investigators to generate gigabases of sequencing data per week.
