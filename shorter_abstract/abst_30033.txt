in this study, we evaluated distribution, evolutionary history, and function of indels found by comparing syntenic regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes.
these results suggest that genome plasticity is a major force behind speciation events separating the great ape lineages.
we defined three major classes of these indels, using local structure analysis:  those indels found uniquely without additional copies of indel sequence in the surrounding  region,  those with at least one exact copy found nearby, and  those with similar but not identical copies found locally.
among these classes, we encountered a high number of exactly repeated indel sequences, most likely due to recent duplications.
using local sequence context, we predicted origins and phylogenetic relationships of gene-impacting indels in primate species.
a subset of indels from coding regions was experimentally validated and their impacts were predicted based on direct sequencing in several human populations as well as chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and two subspecies of orangutans.
coding sequences and splice sites contained significantly fewer of these indels than expected from random expectations, suggesting that selection is a factor in limiting their persistence.
specifically, we identified  <dig>  indels of  <dig> bp or greater in a ~ <dig> mb alignment between human and chimpanzee chromosome  <dig>  after the exclusion of those in repetitive dna,  <dig>  or 23% of indels still remained.
this group was characterized according to the local or genome-wide repetitive nature, size, location relative to genes, and other genomic features.
there are substantial differences in representation of indel classes among genomic elements, most likely caused by differences in their evolutionary histories.
understanding structure and function of human genome requires knowledge of genomes of our closest living relatives, the primates.
