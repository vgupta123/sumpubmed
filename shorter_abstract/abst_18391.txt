the snps were identified in sequence alignments of  <dig>  different amplicons obtained from the  <dig> boars and containing coding regions of genes derived from expressed sequence tags  and genomic shotgun sequences.
in addition, the linkage to the rh-map of microsatellites makes it suitable for comparison to other qtl studies.
the gene order was validated through comparisons to the cytogenetic and/or physical location of  <dig> genes, linkage to evenly spaced microsatellite markers as well as previously reported conserved synteny.
the linkage map presented here shows high accuracy in gene order.
the female and male maps were estimated to  <dig> .
to identify the actual genes, which control these traits, a map based on gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphism  markers is highly valuable.
genetic linkage maps are necessary for mapping of mendelian traits and quantitative trait loci .
in this study, the snps were genotyped in a large family material comprising more than  <dig>  piglets derived from  <dig> duroc boars crossed with  <dig> danish landrace/danish large white sows.
linkage maps of all  <dig> porcine autosomes were constructed based on  <dig> gene-associated and six porcine est-based snps.
the pedigree family network as well as the large amount of meiotic events provide good reliability and make this map suitable for qtl and association studies.
