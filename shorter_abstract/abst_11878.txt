network analysis of the transcription factors expressed in the gastrointestinal
order to provide comprehensive coverage of the known pig transcriptome.
array was used to generate a genome-wide expression atlas of pig tissues derived
respect to the known physiology of mammalian tissues and cells.
discuss the expression signatures associated with the gastrointestinal tract, an
to man, we provide a major new resource for understanding gene expression with
transcriptome where transcripts are grouped according to their expression pattern,
