significant alteration of the hard fecal microbiota does not appear to be a considerable adverse effect expected in rabbits treated for 21 days with oral meloxicam at a dose of 1 mg/kg.
within firmicutes, clostridia was the dominant class, accounting for 76% of operational taxon units .
analgesia is often indicated in rabbits undergoing surgical procedures or suffering from various painful conditions and the most common adverse effects associated with nsaids occur in the gastrointestinal tract .
in general, there were only few differences observed between time points and different rabbits at the phylum level.
a total of 2589912 v <dig> rrna gene sequences passed all quality control filters.
the gastrointestinal tract of rabbits harbors dense and diverse microbiota.
samples of hard feces were collected from six rabbits treated with meloxicam  on days  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  next generation sequencing of v <dig> 16s rrna gene products was performed.
a significant change was observed in the relative abundance of proteobacteria over the  <dig> time points .
the objective of this study was to determine the potential effect of long-term  meloxicam administration on the fecal bacterial microbiota in healthy rabbits.
