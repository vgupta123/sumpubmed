we performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis on serum samples from naturally-metamorphosing rana catesbeiana from tadpoles to froglets using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.
we observed extensive remodelling of five core metabolic pathways: arginine and purine/pyrimidine, cysteine/methionine, sphingolipid, and eicosanoid metabolism and the urea cycle, and found evidence for a major role for lipids during this postembryonic process.
during anuran metamorphosis, the aquatic tadpole undergoes drastic morphological changes and remodelling of tissues and organs to become a froglet.
total and aqueous metabolite extracts were obtained from each serum sample to select for nonpolar and polar metabolites, respectively, and selected metabolites were validated by running authentic compounds.
the majority of the detected metabolites  showed statistically significant abundance changes  between metamorphic stages.
thyroid hormones are required to initiate the process, but the mechanism whereby the many requisite changes are coordinated between organs and tissues is poorly understood.
