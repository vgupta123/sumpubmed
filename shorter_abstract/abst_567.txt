related “sls-like” toxins have been characterized in select strains of clostridium and listeria, with homologous clusters bioinformatically identified in a variety of other species.
sls is a member of the thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin  family of natural products.
in this work, we assessed the hemolytic activity of a series of c-terminally truncated sls peptides expressed in sls-deficient s. pyogenes.
streptolysin s  is a cytolytic virulence factor produced by the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococcus species.

a pcr-based screen demonstrated that sls-like clusters are substantially more prevalent in bbsl than inferred from publicly available genome sequences.
the mutagenesis data described herein indicate that the minimal cytolytic unit of sls encompasses the nph region of the core peptide.
although unable to restore hemolysis in sls-deficient s. pyogenes, a bbsl sls-like precursor peptide was converted to a cytolysin using purified sls biosynthetic enzymes.
among the spirochaete clusters, naturally truncated sls-like precursors were found in the genomes of three lyme disease-causing borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato  strains.
we propose that this conserved region represents the defining feature of the sls-like tomm family.
interestingly, this region is found in all characterized tomm cytolysins, as well as the novel putative tomm cytolysins we discovered.
we demonstrate the cytolytic potential of a bbsl sls-like precursor peptide, which has a core region of similar length to the sls minimal cytolytic unit, when modified with purified sls biosynthetic enzymes.
