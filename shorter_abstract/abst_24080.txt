in this paper we present a general framework, i.e.
to better understand the common features and differences between various methods, and to evaluate their impact on the results of gene expression analysis, we describe a class of models, referred to as generalized probe models , which encompass various currently available methods.
the comparison shows that, on a genome-wide scale , different methods yield similar results if the same probe measures are chosen.
we demonstrate that the dissimilar results stem primarily from different choice of probe measures, rather than other factors.
using an empirical dataset, we compared different formulations of gpms, and gpms with three other commonly used methods, i.e.
these methods differ in the choice of probe measure , summarizing multiple probe intensities into a gene expression value, and analysis of differential gene expression.
