mass spectrometry spectra, widely used in proteomics studies as a screening tool for protein profiling and to detect discriminatory signals, are high dimensional data.
then we use support vector machines for classification.
we improved previous known results on the problem on the same data, with the advantage that the proposed method has an unsupervised feature selection phase.
a large number of local maxima  have to be analyzed as part of computational pipelines aimed at the realization of efficient predictive and screening protocols.
the area under the roc curve of the best selected model is  <dig> .
