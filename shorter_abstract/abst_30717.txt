the identification and analysis of additional molecular markers not affected by lgt should continue defining the emerging picture of a genuine phylogenetic core for the third domain of life.
however, it is still a matter of debate whether lateral gene transfers  may affect the components of genomic cores, preventing their use to retrace species evolution.
the concept of a genomic core, defined as the set of genes ubiquitous in all genomes of a monophyletic group, has become crucial in comparative and evolutionary genomics.
this concerned methanopyrus kandleri, whose placement remained strongly biased in the transcription tree due to its above average evolutionary rates, and could not be counterbalanced due to the lack of availability of closely related and/or slower-evolving relatives.
our results strongly support the existence of a core of proteins that has evolved mainly through vertical inheritance in archaea, and carries a bona fide phylogenetic signal that can be used to retrace the evolutionary history of this domain.
this may be due either to undetected lgt and/or to a lack of sufficient phylogenetic signal in the datasets.
to our knowledge, this is the first report of evidence that the phylogenetic signal harbored by components of the archaeal translation apparatus is confirmed by additional markers belonging to a second molecular system .
the resulting trees were largely congruent, showing that informational gene components of the archaeal genomic core belonging to two distinct molecular systems contain a coherent signal for archaeal phylogeny.
