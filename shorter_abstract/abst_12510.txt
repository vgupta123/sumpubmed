detailed gene information regarding the exon-intron organization, size, distribution and transcription orientation in the genome revealed that many sp/sph loci are closely situated on the same scaffold, indicating the frequent occurrence of gene duplications in this large gene family.
n. lugens causes extensive damage to rice by sucking rice phloem sap, which results in hopper burn .
having a fully sequenced genome for n. lugens allows us to perform in-depth analysis of the gene structures, reveal the evolutionary relationships and predict the physiological functions of sp genes.
our findings provide comprehensive gene sequence resources and expression profiles of the n. lugens sp and sph genes, which give insights into clarifying the potentially functional roles of these genes in the biological processes including development, digestion, reproduction and immunity.
the gene expression profiles revealed new findings with regard to how sps/sphs respond to bacterial infections as well as their tissue-, development- and sex-specific expressions.
the genome- and transcriptome-wide analysis identified  <dig> putative sp  and sph  genes in n. lugens.
