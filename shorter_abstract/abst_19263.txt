an insertion mutation into gsha, encoding a glutamate cysteine ligase involved in glutathione biosynthesis, generated a strain called p. stutzeri ts44-gsha <dig>  this mutant strain was complemented with a plasmid carrying gsha to generate strain p. stutzeri ts44-gsha-c. the transcription of gsha, the two superoxide dismutase -encoding genes sodb and sodc as well as the catalase-encoding gene kate was monitored because gsha-encoded glutamate cysteine ligase is responsible for the biosynthesis of glutathione  and involved in the cellular stress defense system as are superoxide dismutase and catalase responsible for the conversion of ros.
compared to the wild type p. stutzeri ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c, the mutant p. stutzeri ts44-gsha <dig> had a lower gsh content and exhibited an increased content of total ros and h2o <dig> and increased the sb oxidation rate.
based on the results, we propose that a disruption of the pathway involved in ros-protection allowed h2o <dig> to accumulate.
in addition to the previously reported enzyme mediated sb oxidation, the mechanism of bacterial oxidation of sb to sb includes a non-enzymatic mediated step using h2o <dig> as the oxidant.
in addition, the cellular content of total ros and in particular h2o <dig> was analyzed.
a positive linear correlation was found between the sb oxidation rate and the h2o <dig> content , indicating that the accumulated h2o <dig> is correlated to the increased sb oxidation rate.

currently, little is known about the mechanisms underlying bacterial sb resistance and oxidation.
in this study, tn <dig> transposon mutagenesis was conducted in the sb-oxidizing strain pseudomonas stutzeri ts <dig> to isolate the genes responsible for sb resistance and oxidation.
