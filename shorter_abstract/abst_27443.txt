to do this, a limited amount of colonies from a test library are sequenced and tested.
specifically, the errors are calculated thanks to the complementarity of dna, which means that a mutation has a complementary mutation on the other sequence.
however, the calculations of the mutational spectrum are severely affected by the limited sample sizes.

additionally, in the case of determining the mean number of mutations per sequence it does so by fitting to a poisson distribution, which is more robust than calculating the average in light of the small sampling size.
in the case of an error-prone pcr library, the spectrum of the identified mutations — the proportions of mutations of a specific nucleobase to another— is calculated enabling the user to make more informed predictions on library diversity and coverage.
