additionally, we observed strong association of serum uric acid concentrations with variants in following candidate genes in the 3p <dig> region; inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor, type  <dig> , contactin  <dig> , decapping mrna 1a ; transglutaminase  <dig>  and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor   <dig>   and evidence of cis-regulation for itpr <dig> transcripts.
elevated sua concentrations have been linked to increased risk for gout, kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease whereas reduced serum uric acid concentrations have been linked to multiple sclerosis, parkinson’s disease and alzheimer’s disease.
our results confirm the importance of the chromosome 3p <dig> locus and genetic variants in this region in the regulation of serum uric acid concentrations.
previously, we identified a novel locus on chromosome 3p <dig> affecting serum uric acid concentrations in mexican americans from san antonio family heart study.
as a follow up, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data in an extended cohort of  <dig> mexican americans from multigenerational families of the san antonio family heart study and the san antonio family diabetes/gallbladder study.
univariate genetic analysis indicated serum uric acid concentrations to be significant heritable , and linkage analysis of serum uric acid concentrations confirmed our previous finding of a novel locus on 3p <dig>  in the extended sample.
