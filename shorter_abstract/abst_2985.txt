readily identifiable homologues of the gene host range factor- <dig> , which appears to be involved in the susceptibility of l. dispar to npv infection, were not present in lyxymnpv.
two genes  were homologous to other baculoviruses, and four unique lyxymnpv orfs  were identified in the lyxymnpv genome, including a gag-like gene that was not reported in baculoviruses.
the lyxymnpv genome encoded  <dig> bro genes compared with  <dig> in ldmnpv, which occupied more than 8% of the lyxymnpv genome.
the gene content and gene order of lyxymnpv were similar to those of ldmnpv, with  <dig> orfs identified as homologous to those reported in the ldmnpv genome.
outbreaks of the casuarina moth, lymantria xylina swinehoe , which is a very important forest pest in taiwan, have occurred every five to  <dig> years.
the genome of lyxymnpv consists of  <dig>  bases, has a g+c content of  <dig> % and contains  <dig> putative open reading frames .
thirteen homologous regions  were identified containing  <dig> repeated sequences composed of 30-bp imperfect palindromes.
ldmnpv-like virus has also been isolated from lymantria xylina larvae but lyxymnpv was more virulent than ldmnpv-like virus both in ntu-ly and iplb-ld-652y cell lines.
lyxymnpv  is highly virulent to the casuarina moth and has been investigated as a possible biopesticide for controlling this moth.
the gene parity plot analysis, percent identity of the gene homologues and a phylogenetic analysis suggested that lyxymnpv is a group ii npv that is most closely related to ldmnpv but with a highly distinct genomic organisation.
