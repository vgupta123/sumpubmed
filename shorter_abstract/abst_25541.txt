we performed a cdna microarry experiment including rna from samples with high expected differential gene expression termed "high contrasts"  compared to self-self hybridization, and optimized a pipeline to maximize the number of genes found to be differentially expressed in the "high contrasts" rna samples by estimating the false discovery rate  using a null distribution obtained from the self-self experiment.
our optimizing method is highly applicable to both long oligo-probe microarrays which have become commonly used for well characterized organisms such as man, mouse and rat, as well as to cdna microarrays which are still of importance for organisms with incomplete genome sequence information such as many bacteria, plants and fish.
the purpose of the present work is to report the optimization of several steps in the microarray process both in laboratory practices and in data processing using criteria that do not rely on external standards.
the effects of blocking reagent dose, filtering, and background corrections methodologies were investigated.
in our experiments a dose of  <dig> ng lna  dt blocker, no background correction and weight based filtering gave the largest number of differentially expressed genes.
the choice of background correction method had a stronger impact on the estimated number of differentially expressed genes than the choice of filtering method.
the results show that hcssm can be a useful and simple approach to optimize microarray procedures without including external standards.
the measurement of gene expression using microarray technology is a complicated process in which a large number of factors can be varied.
