further optimisations of the workflow included the use of phosphorothioate oligos to reduce primer degradation and primer dimer formation, and employing statistical models to predict read yield from initial template dna concentration to avoid intermediate quantification of pcr products.
over time, we found that this setup results in pcr artefacts such as primer dimers and pcr-mediated recombination, which may necessitate repeat typing.

amplicon-based ngs hla genotyping workflows have become the workhorse in high-volume tissue typing of registry donors.
here, we report on our experiences in genotyping the hla, ccr <dig>  abo, rhd and kir genes using a direct amplicon sequencing approach on illumina miseq and hiseq  <dig> instruments.
split workflows for low- and high-dna-concentration samples helped alleviate these problems and reduced average per-locus repeat rates from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.
initially a simple three-step workflow based on nanofluidic chips in conjunction with 4-primer amplicon tagging was used.
<dig> % of all alleles for the targeted hla loci  were typed at high resolution or better.
at the dkms life science lab, next generation sequencing  has been used for ultra-high-volume high-resolution genotyping of hla loci for the last three and a half years.
finally, despite the populations typed at dkms life science lab being relatively homogenous genetically, an analysis of  <dig>  million donors processed between january  <dig> and may  <dig> led to the discovery of  <dig>  distinct novel hla alleles.
