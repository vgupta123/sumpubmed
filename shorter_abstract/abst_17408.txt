phylogenetic analyses including cas from genomes of all non-bilaterian phyla suggest multiple gene losses and duplications and presence of several cas in the last common ancestor of metazoans.
these evolutionary patterns likely facilitated the numerous events of independent recruitment of cas into biomineralization within metazoa.
by characterizing their expression patterns, we could link two cas  to the process of calcite spicule formation in both studied species.
little is known about the molecular mechanisms of their synthesis, but inhibition studies suggest an essential role of cas.
among porifera –the oldest animal phylum with the ability to produce skeletal elements– only the class of calcareous sponges can build calcitic spicules, which are the extracellular products of specialized cells, the sclerocytes.
the complex evolutionary history of the ca family is driven by frequent gene diversification and losses.
in order to gain insight into the evolution and function of cas in biomineralization of a basal metazoan species, we determined the diversity and expression of cas in the calcareous sponges sycon ciliatum and leucosolenia complicata by means of genomic screening, rna-seq and rna in situ hybridization expression analysis.
additionally, calcareous sponges possess acatalytic cas related to human cas x and xi, suggesting an ancient origin of these proteins.
we identified two key biomineralization enzymes from the ca-family in calcareous sponges and propose their possible interaction in spicule formation.
