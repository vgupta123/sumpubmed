here, we present a highly accurate probabilistic algorithm, which is an extension of the genomic next-generation universal mapper to accommodate bisulfite sequencing data , that addresses the computational problems associated with aligning bisulfite sequencing data to a reference genome.
the software runs on multiple threads and multiple processors to increase the alignment speed.
dna methylation has been linked to many important biological phenomena.
however, sequencing reads from bisulfite-converted dna can vary significantly from the reference genome because of incomplete bisulfite conversion, genome variation, sequencing errors, and poor quality bases.
therefore, it is often difficult to align reads to the correct locations in the reference genome.
furthermore, bisulfite sequencing experiments have the additional complexity of having to estimate the dna methylation levels within the sample.
