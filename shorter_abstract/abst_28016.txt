this suicide vector has the potential to establish a safe and effective gene therapy approach to exclusively eliminate hiv- <dig> infected cells before infectious virus particles are released.
regulated expression of suicide genes is a powerful tool to eliminate specific subsets of cells and will find widespread usage in both basic and applied science.
a promising example is the specific elimination of human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infected cells by ltr-driven suicide genes.
the success of this approach, however, depends on a fast and effective suicide gene, which is expressed exclusively in hiv- <dig> infected cells.
we tested truncated bid , a human pro-apoptotic protein that induces apoptosis very rapidly and efficiently, as suicide gene for gene therapy against hiv- <dig> infection.
when tbid was introduced into the hiv- <dig> ltr-based, tat- and rev-dependent transgene expression vector plred2r, very efficient induction of apoptosis was observed within  <dig> hours, but only in the presence of both hiv- <dig> regulatory proteins tat and rev.
