we sequenced rna prepared from three normal human retinas and characterized the retinal transcriptome at an unprecedented level due to the increased depth of sampling provided by the rna-seq approach.
to our knowledge, this is the first application of rna capture to perform large-scale validation of novel transcriptome features.
we used a non-redundant reference transcriptome from all of the empirically-determined human reference tracks to identify annotated and novel sequences expressed in the retina.
the retina is a complex tissue comprised of multiple cell types that is affected by a diverse set of diseases that are important causes of vision loss.
we detected  <dig>  novel alternative splicing events, including  <dig>  novel exons,  <dig>  3′ and 5′ alternate splice sites, and  <dig>  exon skipping events.
for example, the novel exons detected increase the number of identified exons by 3%.
in total, these analyses provide extensive detail about a previously uncharacterized level of transcript diversity in the human retina.
further, 15-36% of the novel splicing events maintain an open reading frame, suggesting they produce novel protein products.
using a high-throughput rna capture approach to validate  <dig>  of these novel transcriptome features we found that 99% of the putative novel events can be reproducibly detected.
these data represent a significant addition to the annotated human transcriptome.
we also identified  <dig> potential novel genes.
