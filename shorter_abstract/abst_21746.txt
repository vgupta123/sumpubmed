we assembled a new morphological matrix based on rhizome anatomy, and used network analyses to establish phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant members of modern osmundaceae.
osmunda pulchella is likely a precursor of the osmundastrum lineage.
recent molecular phylogenies indicate that osmunda is paraphyletic and needs to be separated into osmundastrum and osmunda s.str.
here, however, we describe an exquisitely preserved jurassic osmunda rhizome  that combines diagnostic features of both osmundastrum and osmunda, calling molecular evidence for paraphyly into question.
molecular evidence for paraphyly is ambiguous: a previously unrecognized signal from spacer sequences favours an alternative root placement that would resolve osmunda s.l.
finally, we integrated morphological and molecular data-sets using the evolutionary placement algorithm.
the classification of royal ferns  has long remained controversial.
osmunda pulchella and five additional jurassic rhizome species show anatomical character suites intermediate between osmundastrum and osmunda.
the recently proposed root placement in osmundaceae—based solely on molecular data—stems from possibly misinformative outgroup signals in rbcl and atpa genes.
our evolutionary placement analysis identifies fossil species as probable ancestral members of modern genera and subgenera, which accords with recent evidence from bayesian dating.
