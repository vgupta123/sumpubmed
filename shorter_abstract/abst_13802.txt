secondary infection and protease activity causing melting of the corneal stroma are always concerns in patients with corneal ulcers.
corneal collagen cross-linking , induced by illumination of the corneal stroma with ultraviolet light  after instillation of riboflavin  eye drops, introduces crosslinks which stabilize melting corneas, and has been used to successfully treat infectious ulcerative keratitis in human patients.
corneal ulcers are one of the most common eye problems in the horse and can cause varying degrees of visual impairment.
therefore we decided to study if cxl can be performed in sedated, standing horses with ulcerative keratitis with or without stromal melting.
two horses were diagnosed with mycotic,  <dig> with bacterial and  <dig> with aseptic ulcerative keratitis.
one horse with fungal ulcerative keratitis and severe uveitis was enucleated  <dig> days after treatment due to panophthalmitis.
we did not observe any deleterious effects attributed to riboflavin or uva irradiation per se during the follow-up, neither in horses with infectious nor aseptic ulcerative keratitis.
these data support that cxl can be performed in the standing horse, but further studies are required to compare cxl to conventional medical treatment in equine keratitis and to optimize the cxl protocol in this species.
one horse developed a bacterial conjunctivitis the day after cxl, which was successfully treated with topical antibiotics.
nine horses, aged  <dig> month to  <dig> years  were treated with a combination of cxl and medical therapy.
