the major difficulty for its application is that the number of possible phylogenies grows exponentially with the number of taxa analyzed and the minimum evolution principle is known to belong to the np
in this paper, we introduce an ant colony optimization  algorithm to estimate phylogenies under the minimum evolution principle.
we show that the aco algorithm is potentially competitive in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms for the minimum evolution principle.
