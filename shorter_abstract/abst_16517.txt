the 3d structural model of lipc <dig> revealed the open y-type active site.
three predictive cell-bound lipases, lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig>  from burkholderia sp.
lipa-inactivation and lipc24-inactivation decreased the total cell-bound lipase activity of burkholderia sp.
the cell-bound lipase activity from burkholderia sp.
zyb <dig> were cloned and expressed in e. coli.
however, there is no report in the literature on the component or the gene sequence of the cell-bound lipase from this species.
qualitative analysis of the cell-bound lipase would help to illuminate the regulation mechanism of gene expression and further improve the yield of the cell-bound lipase by gene engineering.
besides lipa and lipc <dig>  other type of the cell-bound lipases  should exist.

the whole-cell lipase from burkholderia cepacia has been used as a biocatalyst in organic synthesis.
lipa displayed 96Â % amino acid sequence identity with the known extracellular lipase.
lipc <dig> was a novel lipase and displayed different enzymatic characteristics and structural model with lipa.
zyb <dig> originated from a multi-enzyme mixture with lipa as the main component.
2013h0021shu zhengyu natural science funds for distinguished young scholar of fujian provinceno.
both lipa and lipc <dig> displayed the lipase activity.
