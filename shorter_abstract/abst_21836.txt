rna-seq  technology were applied to comparatively examine the different roles of locust fat body and hemocytes, the two major contributors to the insect immune response, in defense against m. acridum.
analysis of differentially expressed locust genes revealed  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated, and  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated transcripts in the fat body and hemocytes, respectively after inoculation with m. acridum spores.
these data indicate that locust fat body and hemocytes adopt different strategies in response to m. acridum infection.
fat body gene expression after m. acridum challenge appears to function mainly through activation of innate immune related genes, energy metabolism and development related genes.
go  enrichment analysis showed membrane biogenesis related proteins and effector proteins significantly differentially expressed in hemocytes, while the expression of energy metabolism and development related transcripts were enriched in the fat body after fungal infection.
the fungal insect pathogen, metarhizium acridum, is a specialized locust pathogen that has been used as a potent mycoinsecticide for locust control.
hemocyte responses attempt to limit fungal infection primarily through regulation of membrane related genes and activation of cellular immune responses and release of humoral immune factors.
the migratory locust, locusta migratoria manilensis, is an immensely destructive agricultural pest that forms a devastating and voracious gregarious phase.
fat body and hemocyte, responses to challenge by this fungus.
of these,  <dig> and three were differentially expressed in the insect fat body or hemocytes after infection, respectively.
of differential expressed transcripts post challenge,  <dig> were found in both the fat body and hemocytes, including the lmlys <dig> lysozyme, representing a microbial cell wall targeting enzyme.
