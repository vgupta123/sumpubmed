mitochondrial protein coding gene phylogenies strongly support a variety of previously established eukaryotic groups, but fail to resolve the relationships among higher-order eukaryotic lineages.
cryptophytes are unusual in that they possess four genomesâ€“a host cell-derived nuclear and mitochondrial genome and an endosymbiont-derived plastid and 'nucleomorph' genome.
thus far, a single complete mitochondrial genome sequence has been determined for the cryptophyte rhodomonas salina.
here, the second complete mitochondrial genome of the cryptophyte alga hemiselmis andersenii ccmp <dig> is presented.
comparison of the h. andersenii and r. salina mitochondrial genomes reveals a number of cryptophyte-specific genomic features, most notably the presence of a large repeat-rich intergenic region.
the h. andersenii mtdna shares a number of features in common with the genome of the cryptophyte rhodomonas salina, including general architecture, gene content, and the presence of a large repeat region.
adjacent to these repeats are  <dig> copies of palindromic sequences predicted to form stable dna stem-loop structures.
the h. andersenii mtdna is  <dig>  bp in size and encodes  <dig> structural rnas and  <dig> protein-coding genes, all located on the same strand.
however, the h. andersenii mtdna is devoid of inverted repeats and introns, which are present in r. salina.
comparative analyses of the suite of trnas encoded in the two genomes reveal that the h. andersenii mtdna has lost or converted its original trnk gene and possesses a trns-derived 'trnk', which appears unable to produce a functional trna.
however, unlike r. salina, the h. andersenii mtdna does not possess introns and lacks a lys-trna, which is presumably imported from the cytosol.
