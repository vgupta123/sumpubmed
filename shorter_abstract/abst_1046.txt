the presence of sucrose did not noticeably change the regulation of these genes in 400- vs. 100-microns and/or 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms tested by real-time rt-pcr.
the most cariogenic bacteria, mutans streptococci, are common inhabitants of a dental biofilm community.
the expression of those genes was not radically changed in the mutant strain compared to wild-type bacteria in planktonic condition.
comparative transcriptome analyses indicated that expression of  <dig> genes was differentially altered in 400- vs. 100-microns depth and  <dig> genes in 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms.
in this study, dna-microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the thickness of s. mutans biofilms.
only  <dig> s. mutans genes showed differential expression in both 400- vs. 100-microns and 200- vs. 100-microns biofilms.
these findings reveal genes associated with the thickness of biofilms of s. mutans.
<dig> genes expression in luxs- bacteria in biofilm vs. planktonic environments.
furthermore, we analyzed the expression profile of selected biofilm thickness associated genes in the luxs- mutant strain.
as sucrose is a predominant factor in oral biofilm development, its influence was evaluated on selected genes expression in the various depths of biofilms.
