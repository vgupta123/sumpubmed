we determined the crystal structures of pfuhjm, in two apo-states and two nucleotide bound forms, at resolutions of  <dig> – <dig>  Å. the overall structures and the local conformations around the nucleotide binding sites are almost the same, including the side-chain conformations, irrespective of the nucleotide-binding states.
previous biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that pfuhjm preferentially binds to fork-related y-structured dnas and unwinds their double-stranded regions, suggesting that this helicase is a functional counterpart of the bacterial recq helicase, which is essential for genome maintenance.
it belongs to helicase superfamily  <dig>  and shares homology with the human dna polymerase Θ , hel <dig>  and drosophila mus <dig> proteins, which are involved in dna repair.
our present structures allowed reasonable homology model building of the helicase region of human polΘ, indicating the strong conformational conservation between archaea and eukarya.
