most notably myeloid derived suppressor cells , defined by co-expression of cd66b+ and cd15+, hla-drdim and cd14− phenotype, were undetectable in frozen samples.
this comparative analysis revealed significant reduction of expression levels of multiple markers upon cryopreservation.
in addition, detection of common leukocyte lineage markers using mc and fc detection confirmed that these methodologies are comparable in cell subset identification.
these results suggest that optimization and evaluation of cryopreservation protocols is necessary for accurate biomarker discovery in frozen tumor specimens.
initial longitudinal studies with frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells  showed minimal mc inter-assay variability over nine independent runs.
recent advancements in mass cytometry  have facilitated detection of over  <dig> markers, utilizing high resolving power of mass spectrometry .
this study examined an analytical and operational feasibility of mc for an in-depth immunophenotyping analysis of the tumor microenvironment, using the commercial cytof™ instrument, and further interrogated challenges in managing the integrity of tumor specimens.
