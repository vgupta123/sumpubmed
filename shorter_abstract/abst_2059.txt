this biofilm growth is highly undesirable in most cases as biofilms can cause degradation of the instruments and its performance along with contamination of the samples being processed in those systems.
this novel method of biofilm removal is currently in the early stage of development.
upon ignition, the al nanoparticles react with thv-220a exothermically, producing high temperatures  for an extremely brief period  that destroys the biofilm underneath.
the current “offline” biofilm removal methods are effective but labor intensive and generates waste streams that are toxic to be directly disposed.
biofilms occur on a wide variety of surfaces including metals, ceramics, glass etc.
and often leads to accumulation of large number of various microorganisms on the surfaces.
