no studies in the dog to date have found a possible influence of a specific colour locus associated with deafness.
the present study is intended to evaluate the heritability of deafness in the jack russell terrier , characterize the mode of inheritance, and evaluate the existence of a sex, coat colour, or coat texture influence on the expression of sensorineural deafness.
complex segregation analysis revealed a model of a single locus with a large effect on the binary measure of hearing loss is not supported.
while the absence of a clear mode of inheritance complicates genetic dissection of deafness in the jrt, the assembling of this pedigree provides a tool for eventually defining the genetic bases of this disorder.
this is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to characterize a genetic component responsible for deafness in the jrt.
long suspected of having a genetic basis, the search for loci with a pronounced influence in the expression of hearing loss in the dog has yet to be successful.
the influence of coat colour in the incidence of jrt deafness was statistically significant, indicating that dogs with more white are more likely to be deaf.
the influence of sex or coat texture was not statistically significant in the incidence of jrt deafness.
in an attempt to characterize the mode of inheritance of deafness in the jrt, a model of a single locus with a large effect on hearing loss is not supported with this data.
there appears to be an influence of coat colour on the expression of deafness.
