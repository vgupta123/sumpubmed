in conclusion, our study establishes that expression of the cit operons in e. faecalis is controlled by ccr via ccpa-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
in enterococcus faecalis the genes encoding the enzymes involved in citrate metabolism are organized in two divergent operons, citho and oadhdb-citcdefx-oada-citmg .
furthermore, sequence analysis of the cith/oadh intergenic region revealed the presence of three putative catabolite responsive elements .
we found that they are all active and able to bind the ccpa/p-ser-hpr complex, which downregulates the expression of the cit operons.
early studies indicated that citrate and glucose could not be co-metabolized suggesting some form of catabolite repression, however the molecular mechanism remained unknown.
it is partially relieved in a ccpa-deficient e. faecalis strain indicating that a ccpa-independent mechanism is also involved in regulation of the two operons.
in this study, we observed that the citho promoter is repressed in the presence of sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotranserase system .
this activation is mediated by binding of the gntr-like transcriptional regulator  to the cis-acting sequences located in the cit intergenic region.
