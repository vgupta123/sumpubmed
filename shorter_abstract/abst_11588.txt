though experimental results show that the hybrid approach designed to exploit the complementary prediction powers of distinctive supervised learning algorithms works more effectively than conventional approaches, there exists a large room for further improvement with respect to the achieved performance.
proteins are dynamic macromolecules which may undergo conformational transitions upon changes in environment.
experimental results show that the overall performance delivered by the hybrid predictor proposed in this article is superior to the performance delivered by the existing predictors.
the experimental results with an independent testing data set show that the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of delivering sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>  under the high-sensitivity mode, while delivering sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>  under the high-specificity mode.
furthermore, the case study presented in this article demonstrates that the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of providing the biologists with valuable clues about the functional sites in a protein chain.
in this article, we propose a novel approach to design a sequence-based predictor for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins.
the random forest design and the multi-stage design.
furthermore, it is of interest to investigate the effects of incorporating lately-developed machine learning approaches, e.g.
one category of predictors attempts to identify conformationally flexible regions through analysis of protein tertiary structures.
as the availability of protein tertiary structures is generally limited, the design of predictors that work completely based on sequence information is crucial for advances of molecular biology research.
as it has been observed in laboratories that protein flexibility is correlated to essential biological functions, scientists have been designing various types of predictors for identifying structurally flexible regions in proteins.
as conformational transition plays a key role in carrying out several essential types of biological functions, the design of more advanced predictors for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins deserves our continuous attention.
the novelty in the design stems from incorporating two classifiers based on two distinctive supervised learning algorithms that provide complementary prediction powers.
in this respect, there are two major categories of predictors.
the proposed hybrid predictor provides the users with two optional modes, namely, the high-sensitivity mode and the high-specificity mode.
