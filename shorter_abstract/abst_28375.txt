bisulfite sequencing is the most efficient single nucleotide resolution method for analysis of methylation status at whole genome scale, but improved quality control metrics are needed to better standardize experiments.
we demonstrate several quality control checkpoints at the library preparation, pre-sequencing, post-sequencing, and post-alignment stages, which should prove useful in determining sample and processing quality.
for informatics analysis, we propose a series of optimization steps including the utilization of the mitochondrial genome as a qc standard, and we assess the validity of using duplicate reads for coverage statistics.
we demonstrate technical improvements for library preparation and bioinformatic analyses that can be done in standard laboratories.
at the sequencing stage, we thoroughly test the benefits of pooling non-bis dna library with bis-libraries and find that bisseq libraries can be pooled with a high proportion of non-bis dna libraries with minimal impact on bisseq output.
we also determine that including a significant portion of non-bisulfite converted dna with bisulfite converted dna has a minimal impact on usable bisulfite read output.
we also introduce a progressive pcr method for optimal library amplification and size-selection.
