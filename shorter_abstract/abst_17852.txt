we conclude that the complement pathway of innate immunity and the hepicidin antimicrobial peptide may play important roles in the defense of epinephelus coioides larvae against v. alginolyticus, and the immune response may activate at 4Â h after bacterial infection.
these results implicate the complement pathway signal pathway in immunity during v. alginolyticus infection at early developmental stages, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the immune response to vibrio infection in epinephelus coioides.
vibrio infection affected the expression of genes involved in complementation, coagulation cascades, pathogen  infection, phagosome activity, antigen processing, and the antigen presentation pathway.
to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the immune response to v. alginolyticus in epinephelus coioides larvae, we used high-throughput deep sequencing technology to study the effect of infection on gene expression.
a total of  <dig> epinephelus coioides genes were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ;  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were subsequently identified, in  <dig> categories .
orange-spotted grouper  with protogynous hermaphroditic features are one of the most economically important aquaculture species in taiwan.
