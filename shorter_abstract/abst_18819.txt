a set of micrornas was differentially expressed after renal damage, among them mir- <dig>  which was up-regulated.
in contrast, fish are able to generate new nephrons even in adulthood and thus provide a good model to study renal tubular regeneration.
here, we investigated the early response after gentamicin-induced renal injury, using the short-lived killifish nothobranchius furzeri.
together with functional data this suggests that mir- <dig> acts as a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic factor in the context of kidney regeneration in fish.

for the first time we show its functional involvement in regeneration indicating that fast proliferation and reduced apoptosis are important for efficient renal tubular regeneration.
