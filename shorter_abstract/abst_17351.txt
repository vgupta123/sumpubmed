we have developed combiner: core module biomarker identification with network exploration.
in a complex disease, the expression of many genes can be significantly altered, leading to the appearance of a differentially expressed "disease module".
we applied combiner to three benchmark breast cancer datasets for identifying prognostic biomarkers.
some of these genes directly correspond to the disease phenotype, , while others represent closely-related first-degree neighbours in gene interaction space.
for prognostic and diagnostic purposes, it is crucial to be able to separate the group of "driver" genes and their first-degree neighbours,  from the general "disease module".
furthermore, we constructed a global regulatory network intertwining several functional clusters and uncovered  <dig> confident "driver" genes of breast cancer metastasis.
combiner can efficiently and robustly identify disease core module genes and construct their associated regulatory network.
combiner-derived biomarkers exhibited 10-fold higher reproducibility than other methods, with up to 30-fold greater enrichment for known cancer-related genes, and 4-fold enrichment for known breast cancer susceptible genes.
more than 50% and 40% of the resulting biomarkers were cancer and breast cancer specific, respectively.
