the first step of this approach involved manual collection of maximum data derived from large-scale  gene expression studies, pertaining to mammalian testis.
it has the ability to provide a clear expression status  for most genes, in the testis tissue, under several specific physiological/experimental conditions and/or cell-types.
the expression information obtained from the newly developed database mostly agreed with results from multiple small-scale studies on selected genes.
to overcome such limitations, we have taken up a new strategy to predict gene expression patterns using available information, for one tissue at a time.
unfortunately, it has not been possible to make maximum use of available gene expression data.
manual compilation of gene expression data, which can be a painstaking process, followed by a consensus expression status determination for specific locations and conditions, can be a reliable way of making use of the existing data to predict gene expression patterns.
the gene-lists collected this way in turn were exploited to derive a 'consensus' expression status for each gene, across studies.
for example, it is not possible to obtain a list of genes that are expressed in certain conditions.
in the recent years, there has been a rise in gene expression profiling reports.
these data have been compiled into a mammalian gene expression testis-database .
this process resulted in a richer collection of gene expression data compared to other databases/resources, for multiple testicular conditions.
a comparative analysis showed that mgex-tdb can retrieve the gene expression information more efficiently than other commonly used databases.
mgex-tdb provides expression information for  <dig> different combinations of specific locations and conditions in humans ,  <dig> in mice  and  <dig> in rats .
