the larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella are now established as model hosts for pathogens that infect insects or humans.
to build on our previously-reported comprehensive g. mellonella transcriptome, here we describe the identification and analysis of development and immunity-related mirnas, thus providing valuable additional data to promote the use of this model host for the analysis of complex processes.
to screen for mirnas that are differentially expressed in g. mellonella  during metamorphosis or  following infection with the entomopathogenic bacterium serratia entomophila or  with the parasitic fungus metarhizium anisopliae, we designed a microarray containing more than  <dig> insect mirna probe sequences.
this is the first study to identify mirnas that are predicted to regulate genes expressed during metamorphosis or in response to infection in the lepidopteran model host g. mellonella.
we also identified mirnas that were expressed in response to infection with bacterial or fungal pathogens, and one mirna that may act as a candidate mediator of trans-generational immune priming.

we confirmed the co-expression of selected mirnas  with their predicted target mrnas in last-instar larvae, pre-pupae and pupae by rt-pcr.
we identified mirnas that were significantly expressed in pre-pupae , pupae  and last-instar larvae infected with m. anisopliae  in comparison with untreated last-instar larvae which were used as a reference.
