a plausible explanation was proposed, that the highly expressed pgk-neo cassette in the original line might have up-regulated the neighbouring olig <dig> gene, compensating for loss of olig <dig>  however, this was not tested, so the importance of olig <dig> for oligodendrocyte development has remained unclear.
however, a subsequent study of the same line following removal of pgk-neo  found severe disruption of oligodendrocyte production, myelination failure and early postnatal lethality.
both lines had a mild phenotype featuring slightly delayed oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation but no long-term effect.
olig <dig> and olig <dig>  encoding closely related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, were originally identified in screens for glial-specific genes.
olig <dig> and olig <dig> are both expressed in restricted parts of the neuroepithelium of the embryonic spinal cord and telencephalon and subsequently in oligodendrocyte lineage cells throughout life.
in the spinal cord, olig <dig> plays a crucial role in the development of oligodendrocytes and motor neurons, and both cell types are lost from olig <dig> null mutant mice.
