through the comprehensive study of eqtl in the human colon, this study identified novel target genes for ibd- and crc-associated genetic variants.
genome-wide association studies  have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with diseases of the colon including inflammatory bowel diseases  and colorectal cancer .
overall, among colon cis-eqtl, there was significant enrichment for gwas variants for ibd  and crc as well as type  <dig> diabetes and body mass index.
<dig>  significant cis-eqtl, corresponding to  <dig> independent signals, were identified at a false discovery rate  of  <dig> .
however, the functional role of many of these snps is largely unknown and tissue-specific resources are lacking.

moreover, bioinformatic characterization of colon eqtl provides a tissue-specific tool to improve understanding of biological differences in diseases between different ethnic groups.
expression quantitative trait loci  mapping identifies target genes of disease-associated snps.
erap <dig>  adcy <dig>  inpp5e, uba <dig>  sfmbt <dig>  nxpe <dig> and rexo <dig> were identified as target genes for ibd-associated variants.
<dig>  million imputed snps were tested for their associations with  <dig>  expression probes representing  <dig>  unique genes.
enrichment of colon eqtl near transcription start sites and for active histone marks was demonstrated, and eqtl with high population differentiation were identified.
this study provides a comprehensive eqtl map of distal colonic samples obtained from  <dig> healthy african americans and demonstrates their relevance for gwas of colonic diseases.
