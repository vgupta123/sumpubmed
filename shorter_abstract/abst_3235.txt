as tes may contribute to improved rice growth and grain quality, it is of pivotal significance for worldwide food security and biomass production.
this study demonstrate that the cultivation of rice has led to distinct genomic distribution of tes, and that certain rice traits are closely associated with te distribution patterns.
hence, the results provide means to better understand te-dependent rice traits and the potential to genetically engineer rice for better performance.
transposable elements  are prominent features in many plant genomes, and patterns of tes in closely related rice species are thus proposed as an ideal model to study tes roles in the context of plant genome evolution.

notably, tes were largely depleted from genomic regions that corresponded to genes in the cultivated species, while this was not the case for their wild relatives.
we analyzed three cultivated rice species and their closest five wild relatives for distribution and content of tes in their genomes.
despite that the three cultivar rice species contained similar copies and more total tes, their genomes contained much longer tes as compared to their wild relatives.
hence, cultivated rice species have more similar te distributions among their genes as compared to their closest wild relatives.
we, furthermore, exemplify how genes that are conferring important rice traits can be regulated by te associations.
