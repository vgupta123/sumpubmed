the role of il- <dig> and pre-tcr signaling during t cell development has been well characterized in murine but not in human system.
in this study, we investigated the importance of optimal il- <dig> and pre-tcr signaling during adult human t cell development.
il- <dig> removal at various time points during t cell development promoted a slight increase of dp cells; however, these cells did not differentiate further and underwent cell death.

using a modified op9-dl <dig> culture ectopically expressing il- <dig> and fms-like tyrosine kinase  <dig> ligand , we demonstrated enhanced t cell precursor expansion.
upon pre-tcr stimulation, the il- <dig> deprived t precursors differentiated into cd3+tcrαβ+dp cells and further matured into functional cd <dig> t cells, albeit displayed a skewed tcr vβ repertoire.
