systemic administration of either tak- <dig>  or fps-zm <dig>  prevented hmgb <dig> induced abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity while only intravesical tlr <dig> antagonist pretreatment  had this effect.
therefore, we investigated whether intravesical administration of specific hmgb <dig> redox forms caused abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity, micturition changes, and bladder inflammation in female c57bl/ <dig> mice 24 hours post-administration.
disulfide hmgb <dig> elicited abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity 24 hours after intravesical  instillation.
in contrast, all-thiol hmgb <dig> did not produce abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity in any of the doses tested .

stimulation of protease activated receptor  <dig>  in the urothelium results in bladder pain through release of urothelial high mobility group box- <dig> .
we subsequently tested whether the effects of intravesical disulfide hmgb <dig>  were prevented by systemic  or local  administration of either a tlr <dig> antagonist  or a rage antagonist .
bladder pain is a prominent symptom in several urological conditions .
understanding the mechanism of bladder pain is important, particularly when the pain is not accompanied by bladder pathology.
hgmb <dig> has two functionally active redox states  and it is not known which form elicits bladder pain.
the disulfide form of hmgb <dig> mediates bladder pain directly  through activation of tlr <dig> receptors in the bladder.
thus, tlr <dig> receptors are a specific local target for bladder pain.
both hmgb <dig> redox forms caused micturition changes only at the highest dose tested  while eliciting mild bladder edema and reactive changes at all doses.
moreover, we determined which of the specific hmgb <dig> receptors, toll-like receptor  <dig>  or receptor for advanced glycation end products , mediate hmgb1-induced changes.
