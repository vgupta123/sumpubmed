the results of our network-based procedure were in good agreement with published gold standard sets of cancer genes and were shown to complement and expand frequency-based driver analyses.
in addition, it can employ correlations of mutation patterns in pairs of genes.
the software used in this work and the global network of functional couplings are publicly available at http://research.scilifelab.se/andrej_alexeyenko/downloads.html.
it probabilistically evaluates 1) functional network links between different mutations in the same genome and 2) links between individual mutations and known cancer pathways.
on the other hand, three sequence-based methods applied to the same data yielded poor agreement with each other and with our results.
the method was used to analyze genomic alterations in two tcga datasets, one for glioblastoma multiforme and another for ovarian carcinoma, which were generated using different approaches to mutation profiling.
the both sets also included extended chromosomal regions with synchronous duplications or losses of multiple genes.
we introduce a framework for detecting driver mutations via functional network analysis, which is applied to individual genomes and does not require pooling multiple samples.
in somatic cancer genomes, delineating genuine driver mutations against a background of multiple passenger events is a challenging task.
we review the difference in driver proportions discovered by different sequencing approaches and discuss the functional roles of novel driver mutations.
