a phylogenetic tree was constructed and showed these repertoires include a large number of families and subfamilies.
nevertheless, the evidence is strong, and includes the donor and acceptor splice junction sequences; also, the positions of these genes in the phylogenetic tree indicate that they constitute subfamilies well apart from non-or g protein-coupled receptor families.
to help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable phenotypic diversity displayed by cichlids, the genome sequences of o. niloticus, p. nyererei, h. burtoni, n. brichardi and m. zebra were recently determined.
we performed an exhaustive tblastn search of the five cichlid genomes to identify their or repertoires as completely as possible.
the cichlid repertoires thereby extracted contained large numbers of complete genes , a small numbers of pseudogenes and many “edge genes” corresponding to incomplete genes located at the ends of contigs.
it also allowed the identification of a large number of or analogues between cichlids with very high amino-acid identity .
these ors share all identified properties common to all fish ors; however, the large number of families and subfamilies, each containing few ors implies that they have evolved more rapidly.
