xml formatted output enables easy conversion of results to various formats suitable for statistic analysis.
comprehensive analysis of properties of large data sets lead to new information useful in the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites.
we found that piada produced more satisfactory results than comparable algorithms implemented in psaia.
generally, the integration of a variety of methods enables psaia to offer easier automation of analysis and greater reliability of results.
results are generated in either tabular or xml format.
results from smaller data sets demonstrated the influence of geometry on protein interaction sites.
psaia  was developed to compute geometric parameters for large sets of protein structures in order to predict and investigate protein-protein interaction sites.
in a straightforward fashion and for large sets of protein structures, psaia enables the calculation of protein geometric parameters and the determination of location and type for protein-protein interaction sites.
psaia can be used either via a graphical user interface or from the command-line.
