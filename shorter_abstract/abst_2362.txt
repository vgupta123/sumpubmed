biologically useful rna  was extracted in at least one of three attempts of each protocol in 86â€“100% of older and 100% of recently archived  samples.
if a chosen protocol fails to extract biologically useful rna from a given sample in a first attempt, another attempt and then another protocol should be tried before excluding the case from molecular analysis.
the development of protocols for rna extraction from paraffin-embedded samples facilitates gene expression studies on archival samples with known clinical outcome.
using three spin column purification-based protocols and one magnetic bead-based protocol, total rna was extracted in triplicate, generating  <dig> rna extraction experiments.
rna quality from ten year old ffpe samples was similar to that extracted from months old samples, but quantity and success rate were generally higher for the months old group.
rna extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tissue is problematic due to chemical modifications and continued degradation over time.
all protocols extracted rna from ten year old ffpe samples with a minimum rin of  <dig> .
short rna fragments up to  <dig> bp were assayable by rt-pcr for g6pd in all ten year old and months old tissues tested, but none of the ten year old and only 43% of months old samples showed amplification if the targeted fragment was  <dig> bp.
rna fragment size was assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  for the housekeeping gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , testing primer sets designed to target rna fragment sizes of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp.
gene expression of g6pd could be measured in all samples, old and recent, using rt-pcr primers designed for rna fragments up to  <dig> bp.
