the results have also provided useful information about the structure and function of est protein.
in recent years, cold-active esterases have received increased attention due to their attractive properties for some industrial applications such as high catalytic activity at low temperatures.
ests was a novel cold-active and salt-tolerant esterase and half-life of mutant 1-d <dig> was enhanced by  <dig>  times compared with wt.
thermal inactivation analysis showed that the t1/ <dig> value of ests was 50 min at 50 °c  after 1 h incubation.
ests was cold active and retained ~92 % of its original activity at 0 °c.
cd spectrum showed that the secondary structure of wt and 1-d <dig> are more or less similar, but an increase in β-sheets was recorded, which enhanced the thermostability of mutant protein.
ests is also quite stable in high salt conditions and displayed better catalytic activity in the presence of 4 m nacl.
to improve the thermo-stability of ests, variants of ests gene were created by error-prone pcr.
