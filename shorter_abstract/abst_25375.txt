these results indicate that unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig> are novel candidates for target genes transactivated by pax <dig>  furthermore, our results suggest the interesting possibility that pax <dig> regulates anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain via activation of cyp26b <dig>  an enzyme that metabolizes retinoic acid.
the transcription factor pax <dig> is essential for the development of the central nervous system and it exerts its multiple functions by regulating the expression of downstream target molecules.
gene ontology analyses of the differentially expressed molecules demonstrated that pax <dig> is involved in various signal transduction pathways where it regulates the expression of many receptors, signaling molecules, transporters and transcription factors.
comparison of quadruplicate microarray experiments using two computational methods allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes that have relatively small fold changes or low expression levels.
the up- or down-regulation of these genes was further confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr.
