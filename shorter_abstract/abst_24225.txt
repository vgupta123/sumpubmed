the encounter-dilution effect provides protection when the probability of detection of a group does not increase in proportion to group size , so that predators do not offset the encounter effect by attacking more members of the group .
these results demonstrate that the encounter-dilution effect provided by living in a group can be enhanced by extra-materials that act as decoy for natural enemies.
such a decoy mechanism could be present in aphid colonies in which aphid exuviae are recognised and attacked by aphidiine wasps.
we conducted a behavioural study to evaluate the effect of exuviae on parasitoid patch residence time and egg allocation in experimental aphid patches with or without exuviae.
while parasitism rate was not significantly lower in patches with exuviae when the parasitoid left the patch, the time wasted by parasitoids to handle exuviae did influence the patch residence time.
