linear regression models are used to quantitatively predict drug resistance, the phenotype, from the hiv- <dig> viral genotype.
furthermore, for etravirine  a better performance was seen on two years of unseen data.
compared to standard stepwise regression we were able to reduce the number of mutations in the reverse transcriptase  inhibitor models as well as the number of interaction terms accounting for synergistic and antagonistic effects.
we successfully identified and validated novel nnrti resistance associated mutations by developing parsimonious resistance prediction models in which repeated cross-validation within the stepwise regression was applied.
however, we originally selected linear regression as the preferred method for its transparency as opposed to other techniques such as neural networks.
the resistance association of novel variants at known nnrti resistance positions:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and of mutations at positions not previously linked with nnrti resistance:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was confirmed by phenotyping site-directed mutants.
