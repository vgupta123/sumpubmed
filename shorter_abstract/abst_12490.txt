zea was proved to exert a wide range of unwanted side effects, but its mechanism of action, particularly at duodenum levels, remains unclear.
as expected, we observed a significant alteration of immune response related genes, mapk  pathways or toll-like receptors .
zea is able to activate not only the immune response related genes, but also those relate to colorectal carcinogenesis.
ipa analysis showed various altered key cellular and molecular pathways.
the gene expression data were further extrapolated the results to their human orthologues and analyzed the data in the context of human health using ipa .
using agilent microarray technology, we found that gene expression pattern was significantly affected by zea exposure, considering a 2-fold expression difference as a cut-off level and a p-value <  <dig> .
the effects can be more dramatic when connected with the exposure to other environmental toxic agents or co-occurrence with different microorganisms.
our data demonstrate that zea has a complex effect at duodenum level.
zearalenone  is a secondary metabolite produced by fusarium species.
about  <dig> genes  were extrapolated to their human orthologues.
