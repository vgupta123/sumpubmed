a bioinformatic analysis revealed some interesting observations:  the density of introns in 5'utrs is similar to that in cdss but much higher than that in 3'utrs;  the 5'utr introns are preferentially located close to the initiating atg codon;  introns in the 5'utrs are, on average, longer than introns in the cdss and 3'utrs; and  5'utr introns have a different nucleotide composition to that of cds and 3'utr introns.
in the ef1α-a <dig> gene, the presence of a long intron in the 5'utr is sufficient to enhance gene expression in plants in a size dependent manner.
furthermore, we show that the 5'utr intron of the a. thaliana ef1α-a <dig> gene affects the gene expression and the size of the 5'utr intron influences the level of gene expression.
