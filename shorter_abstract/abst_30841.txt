in hippocampus, we observed that the distribution of the oxidative enzyme pdh was enriched in the neurons of the stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum of ca <dig> through ca <dig>  whereas the glycolytic enzyme ldh- <dig> was enriched in astrocytes of the stratum moleculare, the alveus and the white matter, revealing not only cellular, but also regional, selective distributions.
in this article, we show, with monoclonal antibodies applied to post-mortem human brain tissues, that the typically glycolytic isoenzyme of lactate dehydrogenase  is selectively present in astrocytes, and not in neurons, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase  is mainly detected in neurons and barely in astrocytes.
the two key enzymatiques systems required for the production of these monocarboxylates are lactate dehydrogenase  that catalyses the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that irreversibly funnels pyruvate towards the mitochondrial tca and oxydative phosphorylation.
at the regional level, the distribution of the ldh- <dig> immunoreactive astrocytes is laminar and corresponds to regions of maximal 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the occipital cortex and hippocampus.
the fact that ldh- <dig> immunoreactivity was high in astrocytes and occurred in regions where the highest uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was observed suggests that glucose uptake followed by lactate production may principally occur in these regions.
