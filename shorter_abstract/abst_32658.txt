many biomedical relation extraction systems are machine-learning based and have to be trained on large annotated corpora that are expensive and cumbersome to construct.
we developed a knowledge-based relation extraction system that requires minimal training data, and applied the system for the extraction of adverse drug events from biomedical text.
a knowledge-based approach can be successfully used to extract adverse drug events from biomedical text without need for a large training set.
the performance of the system was evaluated on the ade corpus, consisting of  <dig> abstracts with manually annotated adverse drug events.
when the system was compared with a machine-learning system, jsre, on a subset of the sentences in the ade corpus, our knowledge-based system achieved an f-score that is  <dig> percentage points higher than the f-score of jsre trained on  <dig> abstracts, and still  <dig> percentage points higher than jsre trained on 90% of the corpus.
the system consists of a concept recognition module that identifies drugs and adverse effects in sentences, and a knowledge-base module that establishes whether a relation exists between the recognized concepts.
the knowledge base was filled with information from the unified medical language system.
whether use of a knowledge base is equally advantageous for other biomedical relation-extraction tasks remains to be investigated.
