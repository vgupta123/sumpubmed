this study employs a novel sexually mature minipig model to investigate the initial histopathological changes following vaginal infection with chlamydia trachomatis serovar d.
the histopathological changes were characterized by a subepithelial inflammation consisting of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, followed by an increase in the number of plasma cells within the sub-epithelial stroma of the vagina.
in this study, we observe a similar pattern of local immune response/inflammation following experimental inoculation suggesting this porcine model shows promise as a model for translational chlamydia research.
due to its often asymptomatic course, there is limited knowledge about the initial changes in the genital tract following infection.
a vaginal inoculation resulted in an infection primarily affecting the lower genital tract.
