in pca plot, the tibetan and mongolian groups were clustered as expected; however, duolang and kazakh  were segregated.
based on the results presented here, we propose that chinese native sheep can be divided into two genetic groups: the thin type , and the fat type .
herein, we aimed to evaluate the population structure and genome selection among  <dig> individuals from ten representative chinese indigenous sheep breeds: ujimqin, hu, tong, large-tailed han and lop breed ; duolang and kazakh ; and diqing, plateau-type tibetan, and valley-type tibetan breed .
we analyzed the population using principal component analysis , structure and a neighbor-joining -tree.
in the nj-tree, the tibetan group formed an independent branch and the kazakh and mongolian groups were mixed.
we also identified known candidate genes such as bmpr1b, msrb <dig>  and three genes  that influence lambing percentage, ear size and coat phenotypes, respectively.
we also identified important genes that drive valuable phenotypes in chinese indigenous sheep, especially pdgfd, which may influence fat deposition in fat type sheep.
two consecutive selection regions in duolang sheep were obviously different to other breeds.
traditionally, chinese indigenous sheep were classified geographically and morphologically into three groups: mongolian, kazakh and tibetan.
we then used the di statistic approach to reveal selection in chinese indigenous sheep breeds.
we detected three strong selection windows involving three functional genes: rxfp <dig>  ppp1cc and pdgfd.
pdgfd, one of the four subfamilies of pdgf, which promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes, was significantly selected in fat type breeds by the rsb  approach.
