when using naïve bayesian inference, it was possible to correctly predict the optimal temperature range with a matthews correlation coefficient of up to  <dig> .
the predictive performance of these protein families were compared to those of  <dig> basic sequence features .
this study found a total of  <dig> protein families useful for distinction between three thermophilicity classes .
the best predictive performance was always achieved by including protein families as well as structural features, compared to either of these alone.
this study shows that protein families associated with specific thermophilicity classes can provide effective input data for thermophilicity prediction, and that the naïve bayesian approach is effective for such a task.

being able to accurately predict this based on a genomic sequence, would thus allow for an efficient and targeted search for production organisms, reducing the need for culturing experiments.
