three regions of the sequenced isolate were scarcely represented in the metagenome thus appearing to vary among co-occurring s. ruber cells.
the genomic organisation of s. ruber variable genomic regions showed a number of convergences with genomic islands of marine microbes studied, being largely involved in variable cell surface traits.
this variation at the level of cell envelopes in an environment devoid of grazing pressure probably reflects a global strategy of bacteria to escape phage predation.
these metagenomic islands showed evidence of extensive genomic corruption with atypically low gc content, low coding density, high numbers of pseudogenes and short hypothetical proteins.
salinibacter ruber is the only bacterium that inhabits this environment in significant numbers.
this kind of analysis reveals the presence of metagenomic islands, i.e.
in order to establish the extent of genetic diversity in natural populations of this microbe, the genomic sequence of reference strain dsm  <dig> was compared to metagenomic fragments recovered from climax saltern crystallizers and obtained with  <dig> sequencing technology.
highly variable regions among the different lineages in the population.
saturated brines are extreme environments of low diversity.
