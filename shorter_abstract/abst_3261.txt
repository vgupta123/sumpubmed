furthermore, utilizing our newly developed method, we applied pharmacological inhibition of different isoforms of pi 4-kinase to reveal a role for a distinct pool of pi4p, synthesized by pi4kiiiÎ±, in er-to-pm trafficking.
phosphoinositides have been shown to mediate distinct biological functions in cells, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate , in particular, has emerged as a key regulator of biosynthetic trafficking.
taken together, these findings provide evidence that a specific pool of pi4p plays a role in biosynthetic trafficking of two different classes of proteins from the er to the golgi complex.
we demonstrated that our method can be used to assess the trafficking of both type- <dig> transmembrane and gpi-linked proteins, and that it can accurately monitor the pharmacological disruption of biosynthetic trafficking with brefeldin a, a well-documented inhibitor of early biosynthetic trafficking.
