homology analysis supported the expression of  <dig> hbaqp genes in at least one of the examined tissues.
furthermore, deep sequencing of the laticifer transcriptome in the form of latex revealed a key role of several pip subfamily members in the laticifer water balance, and qrt-pcr analysis showed diverse expression patterns of laticifer-expressed hbaqp genes upon ethephon treatment, a widely-used practice for the stimulation of latex yield.
this study provides an important genetic resource of hbaqp genes, which will be useful to improve the water use efficiency and latex yield of hevea.
functional prediction based on the analysis of the aromatic/arginine  selectivity filter, frogerâ€™s positions and specificity-determining positions  showed a remarkable difference in substrate specificity among subfamilies.
natural rubber, an important industrial raw material, is specifically synthesized in laticifers located inside the rubber tree  trunk.
the phylogenetic analysis assigned these aqps to five subfamilies, including  <dig> plasma membrane intrinsic proteins ,  <dig> tonoplast intrinsic proteins ,  <dig> nod26-like intrinsic proteins ,  <dig> small basic intrinsic proteins  and  <dig> x intrinsic proteins .
in this study,  <dig> full-length aqp genes were identified from the rubber tree genome.
due to the absence of plasmodesmata, the laticifer water balance is mediated by aquaporins .
