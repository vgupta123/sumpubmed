we demonstrate that pipes improves over existing methods on distinguishing between in vivo bound and unbound sequences using chip-seq data for  <dig> mouse tfs.
we provide a systematic map of computationally predicted tissue-specific binding targets for  <dig> mouse tfs across  <dig> tissue/cell types.
such comprehensive resource is useful for researchers studying gene regulation.
in addition, our predictions are in good agreement with current knowledge of tissue-specific tf regulation.
pipes integrates in vitro protein binding microarrays , sequence conservation and tissue-specific epigenetic  information.
experimental methods to study in vivo binding, including chip-chip and chip-seq, can only study one transcription factor in a single cell type and under a specific condition in each experiment, and therefore cannot scale to determine the full set of regulatory interactions in mammalian transcriptional regulatory networks.
