in this study, pkcθ knockdown  myotubes had reduced inhibitory insulin receptor substrate- <dig> ser <dig> phosphorylation, enhanced myoblast differentiation and cell fusion, and increased rates of protein synthesis as determined by  phenylalanine incorporation.
herein, we report novel findings that protein kinase c theta  regulates myoblast differentiation via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate- <dig> and erk1/ <dig>

cellular signaling regulating the myogenic program and protein synthesis are complex and intertwined.
myotubes lacking pkcθ had increased rates of protein synthesis and enhanced myotube development despite reduced activation of the canonical anabolic-signaling pathway.
inhibition of the erk kinase, mek1/ <dig>  impaired differentiation and cell fusion in control cells.
differentiation was preserved in pkcθshrna cells treated with a mek1/ <dig> inhibitor, although cell fusion was blunted, indicating pkcθ regulates differentiation via irs <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  and this occurs independently of mek1/ <dig> activation.
further investigation of pkcθ regulated signaling may reveal important interactions regulating skeletal muscle health in an insulin resistant state.
phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate- <dig> ser632/ <dig> and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/ <dig>  was increased in pkcθshrna cells, with no change in erk <dig> phosphorylation, highlighting a pkcθ-regulated myogenic pathway.
inhibition of pi3-kinase prevented cell differentiation and fusion in control cells, which was attenuated in pkcθshrna cells.
