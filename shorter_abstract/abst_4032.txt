we demonstrated the utility of our methodology by the construction of a non-polar pila mutation in nthi strain  <dig> and complementation of the mutation with a plasmid containing the pila gene.
a plasmid derived from pls <dig> with a temperature sensitive replicon expressing the flp recombinase gene under the control of the tet operator/repressor was constructed.
however, new methodology was required in order to construct unmarked non-polar mutations in poorly expressed genes whose products are required for transformation.
a cassette containing a spectinomycin resistance gene and an rpsl gene flanked by frt sites was constructed.
utilization of this approach allowed us to readily generate unmarked non-polar mutations in nthi genes.
we have adapted the lambda red/flp-recombinase-mediated strategy used in e. coli for use in nthi.
a pcr amplicon containing  <dig> base pairs of dna homologous to the 5' and 3' ends of the gene to be disrupted and the cassette was generated, then recombineered into the target nthi gene, cloned on a plasmid, using the lambda recombination proteins expressed in e. coli dy <dig>  thus, the gene of interest was replaced by the cassette.
the recombinase recognizes the frt sites and eliminates the antibiotic cassette by site-specific recombination, creating the unmarked non-polar mutation.
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  is a gram-negative bacterium that causes otitis media in children as well as other infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract in children and adults.
