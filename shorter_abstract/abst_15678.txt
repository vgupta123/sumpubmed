moreover, software tools , calculating transcription factor binding probabilities, estimating epigenetic modification enriched regions or determining single nucleotide polymorphism increase this amount of position-specific dna-related data even further.
moreover, it focuses on optimizing relating single lookups as range request, which are needed permanently for computations in bioinformatics.
we use standard desktop hardware as test environment.
the test setting considers two biological data sets.
