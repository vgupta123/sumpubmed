altogether, high-throughput microrna profiling, functional analysis with synthetic mimics and molecular characterization of modulated pathways strongly suggest that specific downregulation of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p, coupled to upregulation of their targets as igf1rβ and tnfα, is a major determinant of mammalian pancreatic α cells resistance to apoptosis induction by cytokines.
the molecular bases of mammalian pancreatic α cells higher resistance than β to proinflammatory cytokines are very poorly defined.
we also characterized the alterations of αtc1- <dig> cells microrna transcriptome after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines.

through high-throughput real-time pcr, we analyzed the steady state microrna transcriptome of murine pancreatic α  and β  cells: their comparison demonstrated significant differences.
we focused our study on two micrornas, mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p, which were:  specifically expressed at steady state in αtc1- <dig>  but not in βtc <dig> or ins- <dig> cells;  significantly downregulated in αtc1- <dig> cells after treatment with cytokines in comparison to untreated controls.
micrornas are master regulators of cell networks, but only scanty data are available on their transcriptome in these cells and its alterations in diabetes mellitus.
