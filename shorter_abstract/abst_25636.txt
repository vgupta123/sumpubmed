numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that glp- <dig> analogues have a range of neuroprotective properties.
our results suggest that these novel incretin analogues cross the bbb and show physiological activity and neurogenesis in the brain, which may be of use as a treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
type  <dig> diabetes is a risk factor for alzheimer's disease , most likely linked to an impairment of insulin signalling in the brain.
therefore, if glp- <dig> analogues can cross the blood brain barrier, diffuse through the brain to reach the receptors and most importantly activate them, their neuroprotective effects may be realized.
we measured the kinetics of crossing the blood brain barrier , activation of the glp-1r by measuring camp levels, and physiological effects in the brain on neuronal stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis.
liraglutide and lixisenatide enhanced camp levels in the brain, with lixisenatide being more effective.
