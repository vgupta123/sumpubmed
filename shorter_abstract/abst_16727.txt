we designed a his-tagged capture elisa based on lysate from genetically engineered cho cells for detection of antibodies to insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  a novel tumor antigen.
a genetically engineered cell lysate based elisa can be amenable to standardization and can detect increased levels of antibody immunity to tumor-associated antigen in cancer patients compared to non tumor-bearing healthy controls.
we performed technical and preliminary clinical validation studies, including comparison to a standard indirect elisa based on commercially prepared recombinant antigen.
as newly identified antigens are incorporated into a variety of clinical trials, standardization of immunologic monitoring methods becomes increasingly important.
furthermore, significantly greater levels of igfbp- <dig> antibody immunity were found in cancer patients compared to normal controls .
in comparison to western blot analysis, his-tag and indirect elisa accurately identified 88% and 93% of samples, respectively.
