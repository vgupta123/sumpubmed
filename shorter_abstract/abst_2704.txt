an extended response was found for agp which occurred at a point when the infection was likely to have been transforming from an acute to a chronic phase.
caseous lymphadenitis  is a disease of small ruminants caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.
acute phase proteins  such as haptoglobin  serum amyloid a  and α <dig> acid glycoprotein  are produced by the liver and released into the circulation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.
the serum concentrations of hp, saa and agp were raised in sheep in an experimental model of cla.
the results suggest that agp could have a role as a marker for chronic conditions in sheep.
the concentration in serum of hp, saa and agp in  <dig> sheep challenged with  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of c. pseudotuberculosis showed significant increases  compared to  <dig> unchallenged control sheep.
thereafter, their concentrations fell with no significant difference to those of the control sheep by day  <dig> p.i.. in contrast, the serum agp concentration in infected sheep continued to rise to a peak of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l on day  <dig> p.i., after which a slow decline occurred, although the mean concentration remained significantly higher  than the control group up to  <dig> days p.i.. specific igg to phospholidase d of c. pseudotuberculosis became detectable at  <dig> days p.i.
the concentration of hp in serum increases in experimental cla but it is not known if saa and agp respond in parallel or have differing response profiles.
