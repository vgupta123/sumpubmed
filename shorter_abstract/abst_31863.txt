we tested bactimas on time-lapse movies of mycobacterium smegmatis and achieved at least 10-fold reduction of processing time compared to manual analysis.
measurements are extracted from images in a configurable, automated fashion and an sqlite database is used to store, retrieve, and exchange all acquired data.
the software is designed for extracting and visualizing quantitative data from bacterial time-lapse movies.
the presented software simplifies quantitative analysis of time-lapse movies overall and is currently the only available software for the analysis of mycobacteria-like cells.
we illustrate the power of the visualization tool by showing heterogeneity of both icl expression and cell growth atop of a lineage tree.
the software available to date for analyzing image sequences from time-lapse microscopy works only for certain bacteria and under limited conditions.
unfortunately, many organisms of interest have these characteristics, and analyzing their image sequences has been limited to time consuming manual processing.
bactimas uses a semi-automated approach where the user defines initial cells, identifies cell division events, and, if necessary, manually corrects cell segmentation with the help of user-friendly gui and incorporated imagej application.
finally, the bactimas can generate configurable lineage tree visualizations and export data as csv files.
