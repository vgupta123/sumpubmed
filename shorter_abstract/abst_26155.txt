most likely, the high repeat content in these genomes have played an important role in this rearrangement process.
analysis of the complete genomes of three different phytophthora species, using a newly developed approach, unveiled a large number of small duplicated blocks, mainly consisting of two or three consecutive genes.
the fact that we find many small blocks of duplicated genes indicates that the genomes of phytophthora species have been heavily rearranged following the wgd.
further analysis of these duplicated genes and comparison with the known gene and genome duplication history of ten other eukaryotes including parasites, algae, plants, fungi, vertebrates and invertebrates, suggests that the ancestor of p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum most likely underwent a whole genome duplication .
oomycetes of the genus phytophthora are pathogens that infect a wide range of plant species.
however, as we show here, our newly developed strategy to identify very small duplicated blocks might be a useful approach to uncover ancient polyploidy events, in particular for heavily rearranged genomes.
previous analyses of phytophthora genomes uncovered many genes, large gene families and large genome sizes that can partially be explained by significant repeat expansion patterns.
as a consequence, the paucity of retained larger duplicated blocks has greatly complicated previous attempts to detect remnants of a large-scale duplication event in phytophthora.
