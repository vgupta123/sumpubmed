in addition, a fast desolvation scoring permits the screening of millions of conformations at low computational cost, without compromising accuracy.
knowledge-based experimental restraints can be easily included to reduce computational times during sampling and improve success rates, and the method can be extended in the future to include flexibility of the side-chains.
we have tested the method on a standard benchmark of unbound structures and we can find near-native solutions in 100% of the cases.
protein-protein interactions are fundamental for the majority of cellular processes and their study is of enormous biotechnological and therapeutic interest.
after applying a new fast filtering scheme based on residue-based desolvation, in combination with ftdock plus pydock scoring, near-native solutions are found with rank â‰¤  <dig> in 39% of the cases.
in recent years, a variety of computational approaches to the protein-protein docking problem have been reported, with encouraging results.
although this kind of strategy has shown some of the most successful results in the capri blind test http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri, more efforts need to be applied.
thus, the sampling protocol should generate a pool of conformations that include a sufficient number of near-native ones, while the scoring function should discriminate between near-native and non-near-native proposed conformations.
