the monocyte-regulating cytokines macrophage colony stimulating factor , transforming growth factor beta  <dig> , and angiopoietin  <dig>  were measured in patient plasma by elisa.
crp and m-csf levels were substantially increased in patient blood after surgery and correlated significantly with the frequency of intermediate monocytes.
c-reactive protein  and liver function parameters were retrieved from routine hospital analyses.
in addition, liver function parameters showed a significant association with intermediate monocyte levels on pod  <dig>
in  <dig> patients monocyte subsets were evaluated in blood and subhepatic wound fluid by flow cytometry before and 1- <dig> days after resection of colorectal liver metastases.
the correlation with liver parameters points to a functional involvement of these monocyte populations in liver regeneration which warrants further investigation.
three subsets have been identified to date: classical, intermediate, non-classical monocytes.
in a clinical setting, we investigated which monocyte subsets are regulated after liver resection and correlate with postoperative liver function.
monocytes reportedly contribute to liver regeneration.
the reportedly pro-angiogenic subsets of monocytes are selectively increased upon liver resection and accumulate next to the site of liver regeneration.

on post-operative day   <dig> blood monocytes shifted to significantly elevated levels of intermediate monocytes.
in wound fluid, a delayed surge in intermediate monocytes was detected by pod  <dig>  furthermore, tems were highly enriched in wound fluid as compared to circulation.
as previously proposed by in vitro experiments, the release of crp and m-csf may trigger the induction of intermediate monocytes.
