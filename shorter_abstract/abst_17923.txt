notwithstanding studies of quantitative trait loci  that influence the ability of aedes aegypti midgut  to become infected with dengue virus , no study to date has been undertaken to identify genetic markers of vector competence.
to determine whether the same proteins were identified in all three strains, we obtained polyclonal antibodies against r <dig> and r <dig> and tested them against the three strains by immunoblotting; both antibodies recognized the  <dig> and  <dig> kda proteins, corroborating the vopba results.
consequently, our results strongly suggest that this protein may be a marker of vector competence for denv in ae.
specific antibodies against both proteins were used for immunofluorescent location by confocal microscopy; the antibodies recognized the basal lamina all along the mg, and cell membranes and intercellular spaces from the middle to the end of the posterior midgut  in the neighborhood of the hindgut.
the main protein identified had an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda, although the protein identified in the ibo- <dig> strain showed a lower mass .
furthermore, it is known that mosquito populations differ greatly in their susceptibility to flaviviruses.
vector competence refers to the intrinsic permissiveness of an arthropod vector for infection, replication and transmission of a virus.
differences in vector competence may, at least in part, be due to the presence of specific midgut epithelial receptors and their identification would be a significant step forward in understanding the interaction of the virus with the mosquito.
aegypti strains that differ in their vector competence for denv, we investigated the ds <dig> strain , the ibo- <dig> strain  and the membrane escape barrier strain, dmeb, which is infected exclusively in the midgut epithelial cells.
in this paper we provide evidence that the  <dig> kda protein , described previously as a denv receptor, is related to vector competence in ae.
the midgut proteins recognized by denv were also determined by vopba after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
quantitative analysis showed more intense fluorescence in ds <dig> and dmeb than in ibo- <dig>   the viral envelope antigen was not homogeneously distributed during mg infection but correlated with mg density and the distribution of r67/r <dig>
we determined the mg proteins that bind denv by an overlay protein binding assay  in ae.
