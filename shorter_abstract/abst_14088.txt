comparative genomic analysis of four representative pgpr revealed some conserved regions, indicating common characteristics  among these pseudomonad pgpr.
however, the percentage of genes encoding transposases and their inactivated derivatives  was  <dig> % of the total genes with cogs classifications in a <dig>   <dig> % in gp <dig>   <dig> % in pf- <dig>  and  <dig> % in m <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis indicated that gp <dig> and pf- <dig> were the most closely related strains, consistent with the genome alignment results.
within this group, pseudomonas chlororaphis and pseudomonas fluorescens are non-pathogenic biocontrol agents, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas stutzeri strains are pgpr.
some strain-specific cdss were related to different kinds of biocontrol activities or plant growth promotion.
the genome sizes of gp <dig>  pf- <dig>  m <dig>  and a <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m, and the number of protein-coding genes varied among the four species.
we conducted a genomic analysis comparing gp <dig> with three other pseudomonad pgpr: p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  p. aeruginosa m <dig>  and the nitrogen-fixing strain p. stutzeri a <dig>  our aim was to identify the similarities and differences among these strains using a comparative genomic approach to clarify the mechanisms of plant growth-promoting activity.
genomic regions specific to each strain provide clues to its lifestyle, ecological adaptation, and physiological role in the rhizosphere.
the gp <dig> genome contained the cus operon  and a gene cluster involved in type iv pilus biosynthesis, which confers adhesion ability.
there were fewer conserved genes when gp <dig> cdss were compared with those of a <dig> and m <dig>  comparisons among the four pseudomonas species revealed  <dig> conserved genes in gp <dig>  illustrating common plant growth-promoting traits shared among these pgpr.
conserved genes were related to catabolism, transport of plant-derived compounds, stress resistance, and rhizosphere colonization.
