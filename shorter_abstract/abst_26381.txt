identification of agents capable of promoting the myelination of axons will likely lead to the development of new therapeutics for ms patients.
we have designed the first high capacity in vitro assay that assesses myelination of live axons.
we have characterized the cortical myelination assay by evaluating the cellular composition of the cultures and expression of markers of differentiation over the time course of the assay.
we have validated the assay scalability and consistency by screening the nih clinical collection library of  <dig> compounds and identified ten compounds that promote myelination.
