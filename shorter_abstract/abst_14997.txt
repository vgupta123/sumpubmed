the distribution of stress-responsive gene probes among major physiological functional categories was approximately the same for each agent.
gene groups responsive to diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione treatments and gene groups influenced by gsh/gssg, o22- and o2•- were only partly overlapping with distinct enrichment profiles within functional categories.
meanwhile, a separate set of genes encoding transport proteins, cpca and jlba amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factors, and some elements of sexual development and sporulation was ros responsive.
linking genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology in oxidative stress-exposed aspergillus nidulans cultures provides the opportunity to estimate the sizes of peroxide , superoxide  and glutathione/glutathione disulphide  redox imbalance responses.
genome-wide transcriptional changes triggered by diamide, h2o <dig> and menadione in a. nidulans vegetative tissues were recorded using dna microarrays containing  <dig> unique pcr-amplified probes.
oxidant-triggered, genome-wide transcriptional changes should be analyzed considering changes in oxidative stress-responsive physiological conditions and not correlating them directly to the chemistry and concentrations of the oxidative stress-inducing agent.
changes in the gsh/gssg redox state influenced expression of genes coding for pbs <dig> like mapk kinase homologue, psk <dig> kinase homologue, atfa transcription factor, and many elements of ubiquitin tagging, cell division cycle regulators, translation machinery proteins, defense and stress proteins, transport proteins as well as many enzymes of the primary and secondary metabolisms.
the gene group sizes solely responsive to changes in intracellular o22-, o2•- concentrations or to gsh/gssg redox imbalance were estimated at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively.
