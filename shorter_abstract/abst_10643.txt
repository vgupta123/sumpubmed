the abc transporters, particularly p-glycoprotein, are known to play a role in antiepileptic drug extrusion, but are not by themselves sufficient to fully explain the phenomenon of drug-resistant epilepsy.
we conclude that rlip <dig> is the predominant transporter of aed in the blood brain barrier, and that it may be a transporter involved in mechanisms of drug-resistant epilepsy.
permeability of the blood-brain barrier is one of the factors determining the bioavailability of therapeutic drugs and resistance to chemically different antiepileptic drugs is a consequence of decreased intracerebral accumulation.
rlip76-/- knockout mice exhibited dramatic toxicity upon phenytoin administration due to decreased drug extrusion mechanisms at the blood-brain barrier.
because of a significant overlap in substrates between p-glycoprotein and rlip <dig>  present studies were carried out to determine the potential role of rlip <dig> in aed transport in the brain.
immunotitration studies of transport activity in crude membrane vesicles prepared from whole-brain tissue endothelium showed that rlip <dig> represented the dominant transport mechanism for both drugs.
proteomic analyses of membrane protein differentially expressed in epileptic foci brain tissue revealed the frequently increased expression of rlip76/ralbp <dig>  a recently described non-abc multi-specific transporter.
the expression was most prominent in blood brain barrier tissue from excised epileptic foci.
rlip <dig> was expressed in brain tissue, preferentially in the lumenal surface of endothelial cell membranes.
