however, the effects of sample size in modulating the bias was not well appreciated.
our investigation revealed that sample size appreciably influences θ estimation and this effect was much higher for constrained genomic regions than that of neutral regions.
the results of this study reveal the extent of underestimation owing to small sample sizes and thus emphasize the importance of sample size in estimating a number of population genomic parameters.

our results have serious implications for neutrality tests such as tajima d, fu-li d and those based on the mcdonald and kreitman test: neutrality index and the fraction of adaptive substitutions.
for instance, use of  <dig> exomes produced  <dig>  times higher proportion of adaptive substitutions compared to that obtained using  <dig> exomes .
for instance, θ estimated for synonymous sites using  <dig> human exomes was  <dig>  times higher than that obtained using  <dig> exomes.
however, this difference was  <dig>  times for the nonsynonymous sites of the same data.
for example, θ estimated for the nonsynonymous sites of highly constrained genes  using  <dig> exomes was  <dig>  times higher than that estimated using  <dig> exomes.
we examined this issue in detail based on large-scale exome data and robust simulations.
we observed a positive correlation between the rate of increase in θ estimates  and the magnitude of selection pressure.
the estimation of θ is unbiased only under neutrality and constant population growth.
one of the fundamental measures of molecular genetic variation is the watterson’s estimator , which is based on the number of segregating sites.
