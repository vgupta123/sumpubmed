cctcc m <dig> showed exclusive anti-prelog stereoselectivity for the reduction of prochiral ketones, but the low biomass has limited its commercialization and industrial applications.
this facilitates use of the strain in the anti-prelog stereoselective reduction of prochiral ketones to enantiopure chiral alcohols as building blocks for many industries.
the recently isolated strain acetobacter sp.
the biomass and reduction activity of acetobacter sp.
by using a one-at-a-time method and a central composite rotatable design , the optimal medium and culture conditions were found to be as follows: glucose  <dig>  g/l, fructose  <dig>  g/l, soy peptone  <dig>  g/l, mnso4·h2o  <dig>  g/l, ph  <dig> , 30°c and 10%  inoculum.
under the above-mentioned conditions, the biomass after  <dig> h cultivation reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, which was  <dig> -fold higher than that obtained with basic medium.
also, the reduction activity towards 4'-chloroacetophenone was markedly enhanced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min/g from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min/g, with the product e.e.
to tackle this problem, the effects of medium components and culture conditions on the strain's growth and reduction activity were explored.
chiral alcohols are widely used in the synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals, flavors and functional materials and appropriate whole-cell biocatalysts offer a highly enantioselective, minimally polluting route to these valuable compounds.
