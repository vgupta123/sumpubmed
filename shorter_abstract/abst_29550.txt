to capture signaling between roots and leaves and identify genes acting early in the iron efficient cultivar clark, we conducted a rna-seq study at one and six hours after replacing iron sufficient hydroponic media  nitrate nonahydrate) with iron deficient media  nitrate nonahydrate).
in roots, genes involved iron uptake and development of casparian strips were induced one hour after iron stress.
genes involved in hormone signaling, regulation of dna replication and iron uptake utilization are key aspects of the early iron-efficiency response.
in leaves, genes involved in dna replication and sugar signaling responded to iron deficiency.
a lack of bioavailable iron in soil leads to iron deficiency chlorosis , causing a reduction in photosynthesis and interveinal yellowing of leaves.

the differentially expressed genes  and signaling components identified here represent new targets for soybean improvement.
we observed dynamic gene expression differences between roots and leaves, suggesting the involvement of many transcription factors in eliciting rapid changes in gene expression.
further, there was little overlap in differentially expressed genes identified in each tissue and time point.
by six hours, more genes were differentially expressed in the leaves, and a massive shift was observed in the direction of gene expression in both roots and leaves.
