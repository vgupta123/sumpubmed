phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome snps and geographical distribution of the isolates revealed spatial clustering of the b. melitensis isolates into five genotypes, i, ii, iii, iv and v. the mediterranean strains, identified as genotype i, occupied the basal node of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that b. melitensis may have originated from the mediterranean regions.
all of the asian b. melitensis strains clustered into genotype ii with the sea strains, including the two isolates sequenced in this study, forming a distinct clade denoted here as genotype iid.
genotypes iii, iv and v of b. melitensis demonstrated a restricted geographical distribution, with genotype iii representing the african lineage, genotype iv representing the european lineage and genotype v representing the american lineage.
the b. melitensis genome sequences, and two b. abortus strains used as the outgroup strains, yielded a total of  <dig>  snp sites.
phylogeographic reconstruction of the history of b. melitensis global spread at a finer scale by using whole-genome snp analyses supported the origin of all b. melitensis strains from the mediterranean region.
in addition, we performed a comparative whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis of b. melitensis strains collected from around the world, to investigate the potential origin and the history of the global spread of b. melitensis.
we showed that snps retrieved from the b. melitensis draft full genomes were sufficient to resolve the interspecies relationships between b. melitensis strains and to discriminate between the vaccine and endemic strains.
the possible global distribution of b. melitensis following the ancient trade routes was also consistent with whole-genome snp phylogeny.
single sequencing runs of each genome resulted in draft genome sequences of my1483/ <dig> and phil1136/ <dig>  which covered  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the complete genome sequences, respectively.
