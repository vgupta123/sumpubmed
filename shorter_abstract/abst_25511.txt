although many statistical methods have been proposed for data integration, the genome-wide concordance of different data sets has not been well considered in the analysis.
the results from our simulation study suggest that misleading results can be generated if the genome-wide concordance issue is not appropriately considered.
the evaluation of genome-wide concordance and the data integration can be achieved based on the normal distribution based mixture models.
the results also show that our method is robust to certain model misspecification and is practically useful for the integrative analysis of differential expression.
we expect to achieve a more efficient analysis of differential expression if an efficient statistical method can be developed for integrating different microarray data sets.
before considering data integration, it is necessary to evaluate the genome-wide concordance so that misleading results can be avoided.
based on the test results, different subsequent actions are suggested.
