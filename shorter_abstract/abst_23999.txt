in a microarray study for identifying biological pathways whose gene expressions are associated with p <dig> mutation in cancer cell lines, we found biologically relevant performance differences between the two methods.
a further  <dig> gene sets directly involve the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways,  <dig> involve the cell-cycle machinery, and  <dig> involve cytokines and/or jak/stat signaling.
gene set enrichment analysis  has been applied widely as a tool for gene-set analyses.
gene-set analysis evaluates the expression of biological pathways, or a priori defined gene sets, rather than that of individual genes, in association with a binary phenotype, and is of great biologic interest in many dna microarray studies.
we conclude that gsea has important limitations as a gene-set analysis approach for microarray experiments for identifying biological pathways associated with a binary phenotype.
the two methods are also compared in the analyses of three real microarray datasets and relevant pathways, the diverging results of which clearly show advantages of sam-gs over gsea, both statistically and biologically.
we describe here some critical problems with gsea and propose an alternative method by extending the individual-gene analysis method, significance analysis of microarray , to gene-set analyses .
using a mouse microarray dataset with simulated gene sets, we illustrate that gsea gives statistical significance to gene sets that have no gene associated with the phenotype , and has very low power to detect gene sets in which half the genes are moderately or strongly associated with the phenotype .
each of these  <dig> gene sets, then, is in a direct, well-established relationship with aspects of p <dig> signaling.
specifically, there are  <dig> additional pathways identified as significant by sam-gs over gsea, that are associated with the presence vs. absence of p <dig>  of the  <dig> gene sets,  <dig> actually involve p <dig> directly as a member.
