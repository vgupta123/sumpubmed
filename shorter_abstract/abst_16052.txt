phenotypic traits such as exopolysaccharide , lipopolysaccharide , swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation and indole acetid acid  production were also perfomed.
rhizobium tropici strain ciat  <dig> is an intriguing species in possessing features such as broad host range, high tolerance of abiotic stresses and, especially, by carrying the highest known number of nodd genes—five—and the greatest diversity of nod factors .
nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> were identified as activators of the nodd <dig> gene, whereas, for the first time, it was shown that a regulatory nodd gene—nodd4—might act as repressor or inducer, depending on the inducing environment, giving support to the hypothesis that nodd roles go beyond nodulation, in terms of responses to abiotic stresses.
up to  <dig> different structures of nod factors were detected, being higher under salt stress, except for the nodd <dig> mutant; in addition, a high number of structures was synthesized by the nodd <dig> mutant in the absence of any inducer.
expression of nodc, nodd <dig> and each nodd studied by rt-qpcr confirmed that nodd <dig> is an activator of nodd <dig>  both in the presence of apigenin and salt stress.
here we shed light on the roles of the multiple nodd genes of ciat  <dig> by reporting, for the first time, results obtained with nodd <dig>  nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants.
transcription of nodulation genes in rhizobial species is orchestrated by the regulatory nodd gene.
phenotypic and symbiotic properties, nod factors and gene expression of nodd <dig>  nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants were compared with those of the wild-type  ciat  <dig>  both in the presence and in the absence of the nod-gene-inducing molecule apigenin and of saline stress.
in contrast, nodd <dig> might be an inducer with apigenin and a repressor under saline stress, whereas nodd <dig> was an inducer under both conditions.
finally, nodulation assays were evaluated in up to six different legumes, including common bean .
nodulation required from one to four nodd genes, depending on the host legume.
in addition, nodd <dig> and nodc relative gene expressions were measured by quantitative rt-pcr in the wt and derivative mutant strains.
we report for r. tropici ciat  <dig> the most complex model of regulation of nodulation genes described so far.
nod factors were purified and identified by lc-ms/ms analyses.

the three nodd mutants were built by insertion of Ω interposon.
nodulation studies demonstrated the most complex regulatory system described so far, requiring from one  to four  nodd genes.
probable activator  or repressor roles , possibly via nodd <dig> and/or nodd <dig>  were attributed to the three nodd genes.
five nodd genes performed different roles depending on the host plant and the inducing environment.
