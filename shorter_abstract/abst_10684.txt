a further metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the differentially phosphorylated proteins were involved in signal transduction, protein modification, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and cell cycle and cell proliferation.
our phosphoproteomics-based research provides the first global overview of phosphorylation during cotton fiber initiation, and also offers a helpful dataset for elucidation of signaling networks in fiber development of g. hirsutum.
the cotton  fiber cell is an important unicellular model for studying cell differentiation.
among the detected phosphopeptides,  <dig> were differentially expressed between the fl mutant and its wt in ovules at - <dig> and  <dig> dpa.
