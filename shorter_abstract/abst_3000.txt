this retained intron is not removed from the human mrna at a detectable level, but is spliced out in a significant proportion of mouse rnas.
the related tgif <dig> protein functions in a similar manner, but does not bind ctbp.
one splice variant encodes the full length  <dig> amino acid tgif <dig>  whereas the shorter form results in the removal of  <dig> codons from the centre of the coding region.
the generation of this alternate splice form occurs with the mouse rna, but not the human, and both splice forms are present in all mouse tissues analyzed.
tgif and tgif <dig> share two major blocks of similarity, encompassing the homeodomain, and a conserved carboxyl terminal repression domain.
by pcr from mouse cdna, we identified two alternate splice forms of the tgif <dig> gene.
both splice forms of mouse tgif <dig> encode proteins which are active transcriptional repressors, and can repress both tgfβ dependent and independent transcription.
both splice forms of mouse tgif <dig> produce proteins which are functional transcriptional repressors.
in addition to repressing tgfβ activated gene expression, tgif and tgif <dig> repress gene expression by binding directly to dna.
