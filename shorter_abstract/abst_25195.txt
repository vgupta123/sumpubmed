measurement of serum ast, ck, iso-cks and ldh activities and an echocardiographic examination were performed before  and one day after  the last doxycycline administration.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate clinically the cardiac effects of an experimentally-induced doxycycline overdosing in healthy calves.
six of them  received the normal dose  and the six others  received five times the normal dose  of oral doxycycline for five consecutive days .
twelve  <dig> months-old healthy belgian blue calves were studied.
this trial failed to reproduce cardiac changes reported in accidental doxycycline-poisoning in calves, suggesting that high doses of doxycycline may not be the only etiologic factor of the cardiomyopathy reported in the field cases.
