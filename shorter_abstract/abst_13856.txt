although no clear id <dig> ortholog was identified in the arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond the id domain were isolated from rice and sorghum.
the zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make up the signature id domain , which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes.
in contrast to id <dig> mrna, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize idd genes showed a broad range of expression in various tissues.
further, western analysis with an antibody that cross-reacts with id <dig> protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three proteins are detected in immature leaves only.
comparison of idd genes identified in arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all idd genes discovered in maize est and genomic databases, suggest that id <dig> is a unique member of this gene family.
the leaf-specific id <dig> expression pattern distinguishes it from other maize idd genes examined.
the presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that id <dig> binds to dna suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation.
high levels of sequence similarity amongst all idd genes from maize, rice and arabidopsis suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor.
phylogenetic comparisons show that these putative orthologs, along with maize id <dig>  form a group separate from other idd genes.
the maize indeterminate <dig> gene, id <dig>  is a key regulator of the transition to flowering and the founding member of a transcription factor gene family that encodes a protein with a distinct arrangement of zinc finger motifs.
