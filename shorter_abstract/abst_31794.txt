hemolytic uremic syndrome  leading to acute kidney failure, is a condition linked to the production of primarily shiga toxin  <dig>  by some e. coli serotypes.
the liver recorded statistically much higher concentrations of labeled stx <dig> for groups receiving 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> antibodies after  <dig>   <dig> and 48â€‰hours, as compared with the pbs group.
in contrast, highest levels of labeled stx <dig> were detected in the kidneys of the pbs group at all  <dig> sampling times.
we have previously shown that stx <dig> a subunit-specific human monoclonal antibody  5c <dig>  and b subunit-specific humab 5h <dig> inhibit cultured cell death, and protect mice and piglets from fatal stx2-intoxication.
the results suggest that humabs 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> promoted hepatic accumulation and presumably clearance of toxin/antibody complexes, significantly diverting stx <dig> localization in the kidneys, the target of stx <dig> and the cause of hus.
the results also confirm earlier observations that both humabs are highly and equally protective against stx <dig> intoxication in mice.
because of the clinical implications associated with the formation of stx2/antibody complexes and the potential for trapping and clearance through a severely damaged kidney associated with hus, we investigated the likely site of stx2/antibody localization and clearance in intoxicated mice treated with antibody or placebo.
