in birds, we predict positive selection in the tlr2a and tlr2b genes at functionally significant amino acid residues.
this detailed phylogenetic analysis not only clarifies the gene gains and losses within the tlr <dig> gene family of birds and mammals, but also defines orthologues between these vertebrates.
in mammals, we predict amino acid sites under positive selection in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig>  we detect co-evolution between amino acid residues in tlr <dig> and the other members of this gene family predicted to maintain their ability to form functional heterodimers.
these genes were previously thought to have arisen by a series of independent gene duplications.
to understand the evolutionary pattern of the tlr <dig> gene family in vertebrates further, we cloned the sequences of tlr1a, tlr1b, tlr2a and tlr2b in duck and turkey, constructed phylogenetic trees, predicted codons under positive selection and identified co-evolutionary amino acid pairs within the tlr <dig> gene family using sequences from  <dig> birds,  <dig> mammals, an amphibian and a fish.
our phylogenetic and structural analyses of the vertebrate tlr <dig> family have clarified their evolutionary origins and predict amino acid residues likely to be important in the host's defense against invading pathogens.

the toll-like receptors represent a large superfamily of type i transmembrane glycoproteins, some common to a wide range of species and others are more restricted in their distribution.
