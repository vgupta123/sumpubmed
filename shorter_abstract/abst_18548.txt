five well defined genetic groups, one in the upper guinean forests, the four others in the lower guinean forests, were identified, corresponding to geographical patterning in the individuals.
both markers were first compared in terms of their informativeness and efficiency in a study of genetic diversity and relationships among wild c. canephora genotypes.
among coffea species, c. canephora has the widest natural distribution area in tropical african forests.
in this study, we used both microsatellite  and restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers to investigate the genetic variation pattern of c. canephora in the guineo-congolean distribution zone.
our data suggested that the dahomey gap, a biogeographical barrier, played a role in wild c. canephora differentiation.
recent hybridization between c. canephora diversity groups, both for spontaneous individuals and cultivars, was further characterised according to their geographic dissemination or breeding history as a consequence of human activities.
climatic variations during the pleistocene and/or holocene probably caused the subgroup differentiation in the congolese zone through the presence of a mosaic of putative refugia.
as expected, ssr markers were found to have a higher genetic distance detection capacity than rflp.
finally, both markers were equally effective for group discrimination and phylogenetic studies, but ssr markers tended to outperform rflp markers in discriminating the source of an individual among diversity groups and in putative hybrid detection.
it represents a good model for analyzing the geographical distribution of diversity in relation to locations proposed as part of the "refuge theory".
