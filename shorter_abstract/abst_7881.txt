these isolates were identified as ev- <dig> subgenotypes, b <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig>  a phylogenetic tree that correlated well with the present enterovirus classification scheme was established using these full genome sequences and all other available full genome sequences of ev- <dig> and human enterovirus a .
using the 5' utr, p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions, however, isolates of ev- <dig> subgenotypes b <dig> and c <dig> segregated away from other ev- <dig> subgenotypes into a cluster together with coxsackievirus a <dig>  and ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> clustered with cv-a <dig>  results from the similarity plot analyses supported the clustering of these isolates with other hev-a.
phylogenetic evidence obtained from analyses of the full genome sequence supports the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving ev- <dig> and various hev-a, including cv-a <dig>  the most common causal agent of hfmd.
in recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological complications.
the 3' end of the virus genome varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various hev-a viruses.
human enterovirus  <dig>  is a common causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease .
in contrast, at the same genomic regions, a cv-a <dig> isolate, tainan <dig>  clustered with ev- <dig>  this suggests that amongst ev- <dig> and cv-a <dig>  only the structural genes were conserved.
it is suggested that these recombination events played important roles in the emergence of the various ev- <dig> subgenotypes.
numerous recombination crossover breakpoints were identified within the non-structural genes of some of these newer ev- <dig> subgenotypes.
