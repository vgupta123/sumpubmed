the human phenotype is that of nonprogressive encephalopathy with prominent bilateral discoloration of the globi pallidi and variable seizures, the latter displayed prominently in aldh5a1-/- mice with lethal convulsions.
gaba and dhha were significantly elevated at all gestational ages in aldh5a1-/- mice, while gb was increased only late in gestation; ssa was not elevated at any time point.
our findings indicate early gabaergic alterations in aldh5a1-/- mice, possibly exacerbated by other metabolites, which likely induce a heightened excitatory state that may predispose neural networks to epilepsy in these animals.
data was evaluated using the t test and one-way anova with tukey post hoc analysis.
intact embryos were extracted and metabolites quantified by isotope dilution mass spectrometry  for each gestational age group.
ghb and d-2-hg increased in an approximately linear fashion with gestational age.
significance was set at the 95th centile.
