understanding the structural properties of mutants such as the one described here, provides useful insights into unique aspects of rab gtpase function.
mutations of this residue have a different impact than equivalent mutations in ras and can form stable associations with the exchange factor allowing us to elucidate the structure of a complex of sec4p bound to the exchange factor sec2p representing an early stage of the exchange reaction.
for ras-family gtpases, single point mutations that impact the signaling state of the molecule have been well described however less structural information is available for equivalent mutations in the case of rab proteins.
sec4p is a small monomeric ras-related gtp-binding protein  that regulates polarized exocytosis in s. cerevisiae.
our structural investigation of the sec4p-sec2p complex reveals the role of the sec2p coiled-coil domain in facilitating the fast kinetics of the exchange reaction.
