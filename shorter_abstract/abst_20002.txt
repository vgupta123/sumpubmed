assembly of reads from illumina sbs and pacific biosciences rs sequencing reveals that the tetraphis chloroplast genome comprises  <dig>  bp and the mitochondrial genome  <dig>  bp.
organellar genome sequencing offers the potential to resolve this issue through the provision of both genomic structural characters and a greatly increased quantity of nucleotide substitution characters, as well as to elucidate organellar evolution in mosses.
structural genomic features exist with the potential to be informative for phylogenetic relationships amongst the peristomate moss lineages, and thus organellar genome sequences are urgently required for exemplars from other clades.
we publish and describe the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of tetraphis pellucida, representative of the most phylogenetically intractable and morphologically isolated peristomate lineage.

major monophyletic moss lineages are characterised by different types of a spore dehiscence apparatus called the peristome, and the most important unsolved problem in higher-level moss systematics is the branching order of these peristomate clades.
the functional loss of nad <dig> from the chondrome is now shown to have occurred independently in all three bryophyte clades as well as in the early-diverging tracheophyte huperzia squarrosa.
although genomic structures are similar to those of the small number of other known moss organellar genomes, the chloroplast lacks the petn gene  and the mitochondrion has only a non-functional pseudogenised remnant of nad <dig> .
