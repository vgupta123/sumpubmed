gene exchange among s. japonica populations could be caused by anthropogenic interference and oceanographic regimes.
bayesian analysis of population structure  revealed four clusters in the kelp species .
population structure and genetic diversity of marine organisms in the northwestern pacific ocean exhibited complex patterns.
diversity indices suggested that s. japonica populations along the coast of hokkaido exhibited the highest genetic diversity.

saccharina japonica is a commercially and ecologically important kelp species widely distributed along the coast of japan sea.
bayesian skyline plots and neutrality tests suggested that s. japonica experienced postglacial expansion around  <dig>  ka.
we did not detect gene flow between the two shallow genealogies, but populations within genealogy have asymmetric gene exchange.
postglacial expansions and gene exchange apparently led to more shared haplotypes and less differentiation that in turn led to the present shallow phylogeographical patterns in s. japonica.
however, it is still poorly known about population genetics and phylogeographic patterns of wild s. japonica populations on a large geographic scale, which is an important contribution to breeding and conservation of this marine crop.
the network inferred from concatenated data exhibited two shallow genealogies corresponding to two baps groups .
the coast of hokkaido might be the origin and diversification center of s. japonica.
