we have developed such a stochastic model starting from existing kinetic models based on odes of some sub-components of the synapse, integrating other data from literature and making some assumptions about non-fully understood processes.
sensitivity analysis over several parameters of the model has provided results that may help clarify the dynamics of synaptic transmission, while experiments with the model of the complete synapse seem worth explaining short-term plasticity mechanisms.
taking advantage of the compositionality of the approach, an enhanced model could then be composed with other neural models, designed within the same framework, in order to obtain a more detailed and comprehensive model.
these exploit formal grounds developed in the theory of concurrency in computer science, account for the not continuous, nor discrete, nature of many phenomena, enjoy nice compositional properties and allow for simulations that have been demonstrated to be coherent with data in literature.
more on the computer science side, we plan to follow some directions to improve the underlying computational model and the linguistic primitives it provides as suggested by the experiments carried out, e.g.
a promising approach is represented by the study of biological phenomena as a collection of interactive entities through process calculi equipped with stochastic semantics.
our model overcomes some limitations of the kinetic ones and, to our knowledge, represents the first model of synaptic processes based on process calculi.
in the long term, we are interested, in particular, in addressing models of synaptic plasticity, i.e.
motivated by the need to address some aspects of the functioning of neural synapses, we have developed one such model for synaptic processes in the calyx of held, which is a glutamatergic synapse in the auditory pathway of the mammalia.
