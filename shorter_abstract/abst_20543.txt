although gene ontology  is available for caenorhabditis elegans, it does not include anatomical information.

one way to analyze these datasets is to associate ontologies  with genes and to look for enrichment of specific terms.
it tests a slimmed-down c. elegans tissue ontology for enrichment of specific terms and provides users with a text and graphic representation of the results.
these methods can identify thousands of genes altered between conditions, but understanding these datasets and forming hypotheses based on them remains challenging.
we have developed a tool for identifying enrichment of c. elegans tissues among gene sets and generated a website gui where users can access this tool.
we used our tool to identify multiple neuronal tissues that are down-regulated due to pathogen infection in c. elegans.
