the understanding of evolutionary relationships is a fundamental aspect of modern biology, with the phylogenetic tree being a primary tool for describing these associations.
these approaches provide additional tools for the study of phylogenetic trees and associated evolutionary processes.
furthermore, we show its applicability to both the detection of horizontal gene transfer events as well as its potential use in the prediction of interaction specificity between a pair of multigene families.
we demonstrate the application of this approach to the prediction of coevolving protein interactions and demonstrate its improved performance over the mirrortree, tol-mirrortree, phylogenetic vector projection, and partial correlation approaches.
we describe a novel approach for the comparison of phylogenetic distance information based on the alignment of representative high-dimensional embeddings .
