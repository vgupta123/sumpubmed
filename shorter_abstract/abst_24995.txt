the proposed data evaluation strategy shows an efficient way of compiling complex, multi-platform datasets to obtain significant biological information.
the main categories that appear to be significantly influenced in the transgenic plants were pathways related to redox regulation, carbon metabolism and protein degradation, e.g.
the results provide system-level information on ros metabolism and responses to oxidative stress, and indicate that some initial responses to oxidative stress may share common pathways.
reactive oxygen species  are involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes in plants, including various biotic and abiotic stress responses.
here we present system responses to oxidative stress in populus by integrating data from analyses of the cambial region of wild-type controls and plants expressing high-isoelectric-point superoxide dismutase  transcripts in antisense orientation showing a higher production of superoxide.
thus, oxidative stress tolerance mechanisms in plants are complex, and diverse responses at multiple levels need to be characterized in order to understand them.
the cambium, a thin cell layer, generates cells that differentiate to form either phloem or xylem and is hypothesized to be a major reason for phenotypic perturbations in the transgenic plants.
