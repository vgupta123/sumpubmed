therefore, we adopted moritz's mu concept, based on the species' current genetic structure, to define management units and to select mother tree candidates for seed orchards.
genetic diversity levels in putative natural populations were higher than in putative man-made populations with the exception of those on otouto-jima island.
although multiple clusters were detected in the putative man-made populations, the pattern of genetic diversity was monotonous in comparison to the natural populations.
however, this study demonstrates that we should be taking into consideration the genetic structure of the species when designing a propagation program for the conservation of this species.
a model-based clustering analysis clearly distinguished individuals into nine clusters, with a large difference in genetic composition between the population on otouto-jima island, the putative natural populations and the putative man-made populations.
the otouto-jima population appeared to be genetically differentiated from the others; a finding that was also supported by pairwise fst and rst analysis.
the genotyping by microsatellite markers revealed strong genetic structures.
typically, artificial propagation of this species has ignored the genetic structure, relying only on seeds from otouto-jima for replanting on other islands, because of a problem with inter-specific hybridization on chichi-jima and haha-jima islands.
this is because a limited number of maternal trees are likely to have been used for seed collection to establish the man-made populations.
morus boninensis, is an endemic plant of the bonin  islands of japan and is categorized as "critically endangered" in the japanese red data book.
nearly all individuals of the species were genotyped on the basis of seven microsatellite markers.
