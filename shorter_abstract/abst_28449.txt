the principal component analysis reveals that the tip colour of lemma, colour of awn and colour of stigma, cumulatively explain 74Â % of the total variation.
this study reports qualitative phenotypic trait based characterization of  <dig> short grain aromatic rice genotypes, collected from different areas of the state of odisha, india.
out of the  <dig> descriptors employed, highest variability  was observed for lemma-palea colour with a genetic diversity index  of  <dig> .
for lemma-palea colour, eight different types were detected while for tip colour of lemma, six different types were recorded, suggesting the presence of rich variability in short grain aromatic rices that are conserved in this region.
speciality rice, in general, and aromatic rice in particular, possess enormous market potential for enhancing farm profits.
though aromatic rices represent a tiny fraction of the total rice germplasm, a small collection of  <dig> land races did exhibit rich diversity for all the qualitative traits.
the population structure analysis classified the population into two subpopulations which were subdivided further into four distinct groups.
the western and southern districts of odisha are endowed with maximum diversity in comparison to eastern and northern districts and at district level comparisons, koraput and puri districts are rich with a genetic diversity values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
the proposed system not only help in conservation but also can confer ipr protection to these specialty rices.
