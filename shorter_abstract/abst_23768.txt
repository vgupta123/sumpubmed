diversity of expression within gene families may be rapidly assessed from piceagenexpress.
in conifer trees, dehydrins and late embryogenesis abundant  osmotic regulation proteins occur in large gene families compared to angiosperms.
rna-sequencing strongly confirmed tissue preferential expression and provided a robust validation of the microarray design.
together, the oligonucleotide microarray and the piceagenexpress database represent the first resource of this kind for gymnosperm plants.
a comparison of secondary xylem and phelloderm tissues showed that preferential expression in these vascular tissues was highly conserved among picea spp.
non-annotated genes were predominantly expressed at low levels in fewer tissues than genes of known or predicted function.
strong contrasts and low diversity was observed in the dehydrin family, while diverse patterns suggested a greater degree of diversification among leas.
an oligonucleotide microarray was developed from picea glauca and p. sitchensis cdna datasets.
conifers have very large genomes  that are mostly uncharacterized although extensive cdna resources have recently become available.
