in this study, through phylogenic reconstruction of mir156/ <dig> target sequences from several taxonomic groups, we have found that specific eudicot spls, despite mirna <dig> loss, retained the corresponding target site.
our results suggest loss of functionality of mir <dig> genes in the evolutionary history of eudicots and show that the mir529-responsive element present in some eudicot spls is still functional.
for instance, mirna <dig> is evolutionarily related to mirna <dig> , but it is lost in arabidopsis thaliana.
similarly to coding genes, mirna genes follow a birth and death pattern of evolution likely reflecting functional relevance and divergence.
our data support the notion that particular mirna <dig> family members might have compensated for the loss of mir <dig> regulation in eudicot species, which concomitantly may have favored diversification of eudicot spls.
detailed molecular evolutionary analyses of mir156/mir529-target sequence showed that loss of mir <dig> in core eudicots, such as arabidopsis, is correlated with a more relaxed selection of the mirna <dig> specific target element, while mirna156-specific target sequence is under stronger selection, indicating that these two target sites might be under distinct evolutionary constraints.
importantly, over-expression in arabidopsis of mir <dig> precursor from a monocot, but not from a basal eudicot, demonstrates specific mir <dig> regulation of atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> genes, which contain conserved responsive elements for both mir <dig> and mir <dig>
interestingly, both mirnas target sequences overlap in some members of the squamosa promoter-binding protein like  family, raising important questions regarding the diversification of the mir156/mir529-associated regulatory network in land plants.
