immobilized recombinant perlecan domain i  binds and modulates the activity of heparin-binding growth factors, in vitro.
in this study, we assessed the ability of soluble forms to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor- <dig>  enhanced capillary tube-like formation, and vegf receptor- <dig> phosphorylation of human bone marrow endothelial cells, in vitro.
capillary tube-like formation is enhanced by exogenous plndi; however, plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures combine to enhance formation beyond that stimulated by either plndi or vegf <dig> alone.
in solution, plndi binds vegf <dig> in a heparan sulfate and ph dependent manner.
plndi binds both immobilized neuropilin- <dig> and vegf receptor- <dig>  but has a greater affinity for neuropilin- <dig>  plndi binding to neuropilin- <dig>  but not to vegf receptor- <dig> is dependent upon the heparan sulfate chains adorning plndi.
moreover, plndi heparan sulfate chains alone or together with vegf <dig> can enhance vegfr- <dig> signaling and angiogenic events, in vitro.
our observations suggest soluble forms of plndi are biologically active.
