this work presents a protocol to produce s. cerevisiae and c. albicans ecm in an equally highly reproducible manner.
the methodologies hereby presented were equally efficiently applied to extract high amounts of ecm material from s. cerevisiae and c. albicans mats, therefore showing their robustness and reproducibility for yecm molecular and structural characterization.
yecm from s. cerevisiae and c. albicans displayed a different proteome and glycoside fractions.
s. cerevisiae yecm presented two well-defined polysaccharides with different mass/charge, and c. albicans ecm presented a single different one.
all taken, the procedures herein described present the first sensible and concise approach to the molecular and chemical characterisation of the yeast ecm, opening the way to the in-depth study of the microbe multicellular aggregates structure and life-style.
additional chemical methods were also used to test for uronic acids and sulphation.
the chemical methods further suggested the presence of uronic acids, and chemical modification, possibly through sulphate substitution.
