the lovo strategy may be also used for more general structural superposition problems such as flexible or non-sequential alignments.
the improved score optimization provided by these algorithms provide means for the refinement of protein fold maps and also for the development of scores designed to match biological function.
many algorithms exist for protein structural alignment, based on internal protein coordinates or on explicit superposition of the structures.
the solutions obtained are critical points of the scoring functions.
the algorithms are shown to be very effective for the maximization of the structal score.
these algorithms are shown to be very reliable for the maximization of the structal score, and other distance-dependent scores may be optimized with same strategy.
a practical algorithm with solid convergence properties would be useful for the refinement of protein folding maps, and for the development of new scores designed to be correlated with functional similarity.
in this work, the maximization of scoring functions in protein alignment is interpreted as a low order value optimization  problem.
the interpretation of protein alignment as a lovo problem provides a new theoretical framework for the development of convergent protein alignment algorithms.
the second algorithm replaces the dynamic programming step by a fast procedure for computing the correspondence between cÎ± atoms.
