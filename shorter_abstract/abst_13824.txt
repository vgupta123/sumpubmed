knowledge of how the raw material for evolution is produced is necessary for a full understanding of several fundamental evolutionary concepts.
our study provides a more complete view of how several mechanisms of mutation, mutation repair, and bias act simultaneously to produce the raw material for evolution.
a similar distribution bias was observed along the chromosome in natural populations of p. aeruginosa.
the distribution of mutations along the chromosome was non-random, with peaks near the terminus of replication and at positions intermediate to the replication origin and terminus.
site-specific mutation rates were higher when the focal nucleotide was immediately flanked by c:g pairings.
a universal bias towards at was observed in wild-type lines, but was reversed in mutator lines to a bias towards gc.
we performed a mutation accumulation experiment with wild-type and mismatch-repair deficient, mutator lines of the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, and used whole-genome sequencing to reveal the genome-wide rate, spectrum, distribution, leading/lagging bias, and context-dependency of spontaneous mutations.
wild-type base-pair mutation and indel rates were ~10− <dig> and ~10− <dig> per nucleotide per generation, respectively, and deficiencies in the mismatch-repair system caused rates to increase by over two orders of magnitude.
whole-genome sequencing of mutation accumulation lines allowed the comprehensive identification of mutations and revealed what factors of molecular and genomic architecture affect the mutational process.
