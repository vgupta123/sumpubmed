we investigated variation in the degree of melanism in the common frog  by comparing the degree of melanism  among twelve populations spanning over  <dig> km long latitudinal gradient across the scandinavian peninsula and  between two populations from latitudinal extremes subjected to larval temperature treatments in a common garden experiment.
as straightforward local adaptation can be ruled out, the observed trend is likely to result from environment-driven phenotypic plasticity or ontogenetic plasticity coupled with population differences in age structure.
however, the latitudinal trend observed in the wild was not present in the common garden data, suggesting that the cline in nature is not attributable to direct genetic differences.
in general, our results provide an example how phenotypic plasticity or even plain ontogeny can drive latitudinal clines and result in patterns perfectly matching the genetic differences expected under adaptive hypotheses.
comparison of the degree of population differentiation in melanism  and neutral marker loci  revealed that the pst  >fst, indicating that the differences cannot be explained by random genetic drift alone.
