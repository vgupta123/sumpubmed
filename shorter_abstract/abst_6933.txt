a comparison of five other related hypothetical proteins from various species, assigned to the alkyl hydroperoxidase d-like protein family, shows they contain the same conserved structural motif and catalytic sequence cys-x-x-cys.
however, in the p. aeruginosa protein, helices h <dig>  h <dig> of this motif are located at the n-terminal part of the chain, while in m. tuberculosis ahpd, the corresponding helices h <dig>  h <dig> are situated at the c-terminus.
the crystal structure of a putative ahpd from pseudomonas aeruginosa has been determined at  <dig>  Ã…. the protein has an all-helical fold with a chain topology similar to a known ahpd from mycobacterium tuberculosis despite a low overall sequence identity of 9%.
residues 24- <dig> of the putative catalytic region of p. aeruginosa have a higher sequence identity of 33% where the functional activity is supplied by a proton relay system of five residues, glu <dig>  cys <dig>  tyr <dig>  cys <dig>  and his <dig>  and one structural water molecule.
we have shown that ahpd from p. aeruginosa exhibits a weak ability to reduce h2o <dig> as tested using a ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange  assay, and this activity is blocked by thiol alkylating reagents.
thus, this hypothetical protein was assigned to the ahpd-like protein family with peroxidase-related activity.
