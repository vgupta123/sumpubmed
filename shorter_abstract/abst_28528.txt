anthocyanins also play beneficial health roles as potentially protective factors against cancer and heart disease.
more negative regulatory genes are retained in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory system of b. rapa.
these results will promote an understanding of the genetic mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis, as well as help the improvement of the nutritional quality of b. rapa through the breeding of high anthocyanin content varieties.
anthocyanins are a group of flavonoid compounds.
to elucidate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in brassica rapa, we conducted comparative genomic analyses between arabidopsis thaliana and b. rapa on a genome-wide level.
in total, we identified  <dig> genes in b. rapa as orthologs of  <dig> anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a. thaliana.
in b. rapa, the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  have expanded and most genes exist in more than one copy.
the anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes have expanded through whole genome and tandem duplication in b. rapa.
more structural genes located upstream of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway have been retained than downstream.
