geneannot-based custom cdfs solve the problem of a reliable reconstruction of expression levels and eliminate the existence of more than one probeset per gene, which often leads to discordant expression signals for the same transcript when gene differential expression is the focus of the analysis.
we developed a novel set of custom chip definition files  and the corresponding bioconductor libraries for affymetrix human genechips, based on the information contained in the geneannot database.
improvements in genome sequence annotation revealed discrepancies in the original probeset/gene assignment in affymetrix microarray and the existence of differences between annotations and effective alignments of probes and transcription products.
in the current generation of affymetrix human genechips, most probesets include probes matching transcripts from more than one gene and probes which do not match any transcribed sequence.
geneannot cdfs are freely distributed and fully compliant with affymetrix standards and all available software for gene expression analysis.
