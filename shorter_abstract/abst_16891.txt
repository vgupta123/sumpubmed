we show experimental results before and after introduction of hiv's dna integrase to a solution of bifunctional "y" shaped aptamers that have an hiv consensus terminus exposed for interaction.
synthetic transcription factors  promise to offer a powerful new therapeutic against cancer, aids, and genetic disease.
stfs that can appropriately target  their transcription factor binding sites on native genomic dna provide a means to directly influence cellular mrna production.
an effective mechanism for screening amongst transcription factor  candidates would itself be highly valued, and such may be possible with nanopore cheminformatics methods.
the first set of experiments we perform to explore this "transduction" hypothesis involve non-terminal dsdna binding to protein , where we show new experimental results and application of a new cheminformatics data analysis method.
