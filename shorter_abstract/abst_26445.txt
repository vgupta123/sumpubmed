lateral gene transfer was also observed in two gene clusters.
here we report the results of the genome-wide analysis of dna sequences from  <dig> orthologous groups from  <dig> xanthomonas spp.
some of the relationships between pathovars and species have not been thoroughly clarified, with old pathovars becoming new species.
our phylogeny agrees with previous phylogenetic topologies on the genus, but revealed that the genomes of xanthomonas citri and xanthomonas fuscans belong to the same species, and that of xanthomonas albilineans is basal to the joint clade of xanthomonas and xylella fastidiosa.
despite the economic, industrial and biological importance of xanthomonas, the classification and phylogenetic relationships within the genus are still under active debate.
