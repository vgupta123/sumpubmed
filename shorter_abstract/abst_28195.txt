we constructed the ppi network of autophagy in p. anserina based on the corresponding networks of yeast and human.
with the present study, we provide a comprehensive biological network of the autophagy pathway in p. anserina comprising ppi and gene expression data.
in earlier studies, it was found that autophagy in the aging model podospora anserina acts as a longevity assurance mechanism.
evidence is emerging that autophagy plays a key role in the degradation of damaged cellular components and thereby affects aging and lifespan control.
we identified hub proteins which play an essential role in the network as well as seven putative sub-pathways, and interactions which are likely to be evolutionary conserved amongst species.
we identified sub-pathways, important hub proteins, and evolutionary conserved interactions.
it is based on computational prediction as well as experimental data.
here, we report a biochemical and bioinformatics study to detect the protein-protein interaction  network of p. anserina combining experimental and theoretical methods.
we integrated paatg <dig> interaction partners identified in an own yeast two-hybrid analysis using atg <dig> of p. anserina as bait.
we confirmed that autophagy-associated genes are significantly often up-regulated and co-expressed during aging of p. anserina.
the network clearly illustrates the relation of autophagy to aging processes and enables further specific studies to understand autophagy and aging in p. anserina as well as in other systems.
