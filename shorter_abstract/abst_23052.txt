in addition, we discover two striking clusters of metabolic pathways, each cluster includes pathways that have very similar evolution.
while previous works in the field performed genomic comparisons and evolutionary studies that were based on specific genes or proteins, whole genomic sequence, or even single pathways, none of them described a genomic system level comparative analysis of metabolic pathways.
this approach can be used for building phylogenies and for pointing out specific differences that can then be analyzed in depth.
first, we describe a comprehensive, scalable, information theory based computational pipeline that calculates pathway alignment information and then compiles it in a novel manner that allows further analysis.
second, we describe a new approach for comparing the evolution of metabolic pathways.
this approach can be used for detecting co-evolutionary relationships between metabolic pathways.
we demonstrate that distance measures that are based on the topology and the content of metabolic networks are useful for studying evolution and co-evolution.
