as a rule, peptides are more flexible and unstructured than proteins with their substantial stabilizing hydrophobic cores.
the structures in one of the clusters possess a fold that markedly differs from the native fold of villin headpiece.
eight other sequences and structures, including five with a non-native fold are provided as bona fide predictions.
the results suggest that much more conformationally stable peptides may exist than are known so far, and that small fold classes could comprise well-separated sub-folds.
as a method to explore the space of conformationally stable peptides, we have developed an evolutionary algorithm that allows optimization of sequences with respect to several criteria simultaneously, for instance stability, accessibility of arbitrary parts of the peptide, etc.
predicted structure and stability were in good agreement with experiment.
in a proof-of-concept experiment we have perturbed the sequence of the peptide villin headpiece, known to be stable in vitro.
this raises the question whether there may be more such peptides that are unknown as yet.
