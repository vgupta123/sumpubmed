there are many advantages to treating variables as continuous numeric variables if the data allow this, and this should be employed more often in experimental biology.
failure to use the optimal analysis runs the risk of missing significant effects or relationships.
analysis of variance  is a common statistical technique in physiological research, and often one or more of the independent/predictor variables such as dose, time, or age, can be treated as a continuous, rather than a categorical variable during analysis â€“ even if subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups.
while this is not common, there are a number of advantages of such an approach, including greater statistical power due to increased precision, a simpler and more informative interpretation of the results, greater parsimony, and transformation of the predictor variable is possible.
