these maps will aid the de novo assembly of sequencing reads, linkage studies and the identification of candidate genes related to important traits.
we report the construction of a second generation radiation hybrid map, its synteny analysis, and a second generation linkage map containing snps  in yellowtail.
the synteny analysis may aid studies of chromosomal evolution in yellowtail compared with model fish.

physical and linkage maps are important aids for the assembly of genome sequences, comparative analyses of synteny, and to search for candidate genes by quantitative trait locus analysis.
to identify snps, cdna libraries were generated from a pool of  <dig> whole juveniles, and the gills and kidneys of  <dig> adults.
yellowtail, seriola quinqueradiata, is an economically important species in japanese aquaculture, and genetic information will be useful for dna-assisted breeding.
the second generation linkage and physical maps were constructed using  <dig>  contigs having snp markers.
<dig>  markers, including  <dig> snps markers, were mapped onto the linkage map, and  <dig>  markers were mapped in the radiation hybrid map.
