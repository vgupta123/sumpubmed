high-throughput sequencing makes it possible to rapidly obtain thousands of 16s rdna sequences from environmental samples.
fastgroupii provides users with the option of four different dereplication methods, performs rarefaction analysis, and automatically calculates the shannon-wiener index and chao <dig>  fastgroupii was tested on a set of 16s rdna sequences from coral-associated bacteria.
bioinformatic tools for the analyses of large 16s rdna sequence databases are needed to comprehensively describe and compare these datasets.
fastgroupii is an effective bioinformatics tool for the trimming and dereplication of 16s rdna sequences.
fastgroupii is a web-based bioinformatics platform to dereplicate large 16s rdna libraries.
the different grouping algorithms produced similar, but not identical, results.
