detailed study of the expression patterns of some of these genes using rt-pcr revealed new promising candidates for ovary differentiation genes in sheep.
these genes may have significant implications regarding our understanding of ovarian function in molecular terms, and for the development of innovative strategies to both promote and control fertility.
the key steps in germ cell survival during ovarian development are the entry into meiosis of oogonies and the formation of primordial follicles, which then determine the reproductive lifespan of the ovary.
in sheep, these steps occur during fetal life, between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation, respectively.
the aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed ovarian genes during prophase i meiosis and early folliculogenesis in sheep.
large-scale sequencing of these ssh libraries identified  <dig>  ests representing  <dig>  contigs.
clustering and assembly of these ests resulted in a total of  <dig>  unique sequences depicted in  <dig>  singleton  and  <dig> contigs  ests .
in order to elucidate the molecular events associated with early ovarian differentiation, we generated two ovary stage-specific subtracted cdna libraries using ssh.
