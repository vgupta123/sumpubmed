the bayesian method can flexibly incorporate all types of prior information on specific binding sites  in contrast to combinatorial formulations.
we apply the method to matching nad binding sites within single rossmann fold families, between different families in the same superfamily, and in different folds.
we also show that the procedure finds significant matches between binding sites for the same co-factor in different families and different folds.
the mcmc procedure can lead to a significant increase in the number of significant matches compared to the graph method as measured independently by rigorously derived p-values.
furthermore, sometimes the graph method is unable to identify alternative but important solutions in the neighbourhood of the distance based solution because of strict distance constraints.
the commonly used graph theoretic approach, and other related approaches, require adjustment of a matching distance threshold a priori according to the noise in atomic positions.
mcmc refinement step is able to significantly improve graph based matches.
we consider the bayesian approach to improve graph based solutions.
in principle this approach applies to other methods with strict distance matching constraints.
matching functional sites is a key problem for the understanding of protein function and evolution.
we present a new meta-algorithm for matching protein functional sites  based on an initial graph matching followed by refinement using a markov chain monte carlo  procedure.
the method accounts for the 3-dimensional structure of the site as well as the physico-chemical properties of the constituent amino acids.
