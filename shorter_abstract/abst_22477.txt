based on careful error analysis, we implemented a set of post-processing rules to correct both false positives and false negatives.
our results show that a part-of-speech tagger can be augmented with post-processing rules resulting in an entity identification system that competes well with other approaches.
we participated in both the open and the closed divisions; for the open division, we made use of data from ncbi.
we achieved a slight improvement  by employing a dictionary-based post-processing step for the open division.
where their system uses the brill tagger, we used tnt, the trigrams 'n' tags hmm-based part-of-speech tagger  <cit> .
our base system without post-processing achieved a precision and recall of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, giving an f-measure of  <dig> %.
