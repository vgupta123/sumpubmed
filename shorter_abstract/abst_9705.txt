the i-aid system induced degradation of mcm4-aid in the chromatin-bound mcm complex as well as those in soluble fractions.
we successfully improved degradation efficiency of mcm4-aid by fusion of tir <dig> with fission yeast skp <dig>  a conserved f-box-interacting component of scf , and the cells showed severe defect in growth.
however, previously published strategies for protein-depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest.
the i-aid system in conjunction with transcription repression , we achieved more efficient depletion of other proteins including pol <dig> and cdc <dig>  causing early s phase arrest.
we constructed an auxin-inducible degron  system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of aux/iaa proteins by scftir <dig> in plants, in fission yeast.
fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle.
we propose that the off-aid system is the powerful method for in vivo protein-depletion in fission yeast.
although expression of a plant f-box protein, tir <dig>  decreased mcm4-aid, a component of the mcm complex essential for dna replication tagged with aux/iaa peptide, depletion did not result in an evident growth defect.
improvement of the aid system allowed us to construct conditional null mutants of s. pombe.
