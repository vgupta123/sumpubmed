erlotinib treatment promoted modest enhancement of radiation effects in canine osteosarcoma cells, and possessed activity as a single agent in some cell lines, indicating a potential role for egfr inhibition in the treatment of a subset of osteosarcoma patients.
radiation therapy is a palliative treatment modality for canine osteosarcoma, with transient improvement in analgesia observed in many cases.
it is possible that the addition of sensitizing agents may increase tumor response to radiation therapy and prolong quality of life.
angiogenic responses to radiation and kinase inhibitors are similarly likely to be multifactorial and require further investigation.
erlotinib as a single agent reduced clonogenic survival in two canine osteosarcoma cell lines and enhanced the impact of radiation in one out of three cell lines investigated.
on the contrary, erlotinib treatment increased phosphorylated akt in these osteosarcoma cell lines.
vegf levels in conditioned media increased after erlotinib treatment as a single agent and in combination with radiation in two out of three cell lines investigated.
however, vegf levels decreased with erlotinib treatment in the third cell line.
in cell viability assays, erlotinib enhanced radiation effects and demonstrated single agent effects.
however, effects of egfr inhibition on radiation responsiveness in canine osteosarcoma have not been previously characterized.
