using both coalescent simulations and real sequencing data from modern and ancient sources, we show that this approach is robust with respect to the reference panel and has power to detect positive identity from dna libraries with less than 1Â % random and non-overlapping genome coverage in each sample.
we further reduce the amount of data required by taking advantage of patterns of linkage disequilibrium modeled by a reference panel of haplotypes to indirectly compare observations at pairs of linked snps.
this is often the case for ancient, historic, and forensic samples.
our approach makes use of the large catalogs of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers to maximize the chances of observing potentially discriminating alleles.
we describe a new method for assessing whether shotgun dna sequence data from two samples are consistent with originating from the same or different individuals.
