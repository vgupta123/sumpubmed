however, the putative mechanisms of homocysteine-induced toxicity in the developing nervous system have poorly been elucidated.
perinatal exposure to hyperhomocysteinemia might disturb neurogenesis during brain development and growth.
also, high levels of homocysteine trigger neurodegeneration in several experimental models.
interestingly, the specific inhibition of nf-κb nuclear translocation by the synthetic peptide sn <dig> was able to almost completely suppress the homocysteine-evoked rises in pro-apoptotic protein expression as well as in caspase- <dig> activity.
these observations suggest an involvement of redox state alterations and activated nf-κb in apoptosis onset triggered by homocysteine in neuroblastoma cells neuro2a.
instead, ros levels were increased by two-three folds in cells treated with  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm homocysteine, respectively, in comparison with control cells.
this study was aimed to investigate homocysteine effects in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, neuro2a.
a  <dig> h exposure to homocysteine in a concentration range of 10– <dig> μm did not affect cell viability and ros production in neuro2a cell cultures.
notably, the treatment with homocysteine  in the presence of antioxidants, such as n-acetylcysteine and irfi  <dig>  a synthetic α-tocopherol analogue, recovered cell viability and significantly reduced homocysteine-evoked increases in ros production.
moreover, antioxidants, particularly irfi  <dig>  were able to counteract nf-κb activation induced by  <dig> μm homocysteine.
however, further investigations are needed to characterize molecular events involved in the nf-κb activation induced by homocysteine.
