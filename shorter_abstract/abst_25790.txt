we analyzed  <dig> protein spots  by 2d-dige, and identified the differentially expressed proteins using maldi-tof/tof ms. a joint analysis of transcriptome and proteome showed genes related to two pathways, polyamine synthesis and stress response, might play an important role on adventitious root development.
we also demonstrated for the first time the combined use of two important technologies as a powerful approach to advance research on non-model, but otherwise important, larch species.
the functions of the unigenes, as indicated by their gene ontology annotation, included diverse roles in the molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular component categories.
these results provide fundamental and important information for research on the molecular mechanism of adventitious root development.
this method can be used to identify differentially expressed genes, and then two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis  and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  analyses can be used to analyze their corresponding proteins.
they are routinely propagated via rooted stem cuttings.
despite the importance of rooting, little is known about the regulation of adventitious root development in larch hybrids.
in this study, we analyzed semi-lignified cuttings of two clones of l. kaempferi × l. olgensis with different rooting capacities to study the molecular basis of adventitious root development.

we constructed four cdna libraries from 25- <dig> and 23- <dig> at two development stages.
<dig> gs flx titanium technology represents a new method for characterizing the transcriptomes of non-model species.
hybrids of larch  are important afforestation species in northeastern china.
