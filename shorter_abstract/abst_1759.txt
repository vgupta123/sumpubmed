our expression atlas and associated publicly available database, the mozatlas , provides information on the relative strength and specificity of gene expression in several somatic and reproductive tissues, isolated from a single strain grown under uniform conditions.
the data will serve as a reference for other mosquito researchers by providing a simple method for identifying where genes are expressed in the adult, however, in addition our resource will also provide insights into the evolutionary diversity associated with gene expression levels among species.
identifying genes expressed in particular tissues or involved in specific biological processes is an essential part of this process.
the somatic and reproductive tissues we examined each displayed patterns of sexually dimorphic and tissue-specific expression.
in this study, we present transcription profiles for ~82% of annotated anopheles genes in dissected adult male and female tissues.
by comparing expression profiles with drosophila melanogaster we also assessed which genes are well conserved within the diptera versus those that are more recently evolved.
the mosquito, anopheles gambiae, is the primary vector of human malaria, a disease responsible for millions of deaths each year.
