ifn-γ regulated the pathway associated with arthritis development, whereas ifn-β regulated the pathway associated with disease protection through phytol.
subcutaneous administration of phytol leads to an accumulation of the compound in the inguinal lymph nodes, with peak levels being reached approximately  <dig> days after administration.
hence, global gene-expression profiling on inguinal lymph nodes was performed  <dig> days after the induction of pristane-induced arthritis  and phytol administration.
importantly, these two molecular pathways were also confirmed to differentiate between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti  rat, , and the arthritis-protected da.ncf-1e <dig> rat .
a polymorphism in the activating component of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase complex, neutrophil cytosolic factor  <dig> , has previously been identified as a regulator of arthritis severity in mice and rats.
this discovery resulted in a search for nadph oxidase-activating substances as a potential new approach to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis .
the aim of this study was to use gene-expression profiling to understand the protective effect against arthritis of activation of nadph oxidase in the immune system.
naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms in the ncf- <dig> gene modulate the activity of the nadph oxidase complex, which strongly regulates the severity of arthritis.
treatment of arthritis-susceptible rats with an nadph oxidase-activating substance, phytol, protects against arthritis.
however, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clearly understood.
