regarding genome assembly, merged reads only outcompete original paired-end reads when coverage depth is low, and larger libraries tend to yield better assembly results.
we used 250Â bp illumina miseq paired-end reads of different library sizes generated from genomic dna from escherichia coli dh <dig> and streptococcus parasanguinis fw <dig> to compare the assembly results of different library sizes and assembly approaches.
these results imply that distance information is the most critical factor during assembly.
our results also indicate that when depth is sufficiently high, assembly from subsets can sometimes produce better results.
however, the influences of different library sizes and assembly methods on paired-end sequencing-based de novo assembly remain poorly understood.
in summary, this study provides systematic evaluations of de novo assembly from paired end sequencing data.
because increasing numbers of projects aim at bacteria genome sequencing, our study provides valuable suggestions for the field of genomic sequence construction.
among the assembly strategies, we find that overlapping paired-end reads is not always beneficial for bacteria genome assembly and should be avoided or used with caution especially for genomes containing high fraction of repetitive sequences.
