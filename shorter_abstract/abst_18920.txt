cells were treated with:  tpa, forskolin, ibmx, fgf- <dig> or  retinoic acid and 2-mercaptoethanol .
treatment  induced differentiation into neuron-like cells within  <dig> hours, while a longer treatment was required when using retinoic acid and bme.
in bmsc both treatments induced the expression of neural markers such as nf, gfap, tuj- <dig> and neuron-specific enolase.
in particular, it has been shown that bone marrow stem cells can give rise to cells of different tissues, including neural cells, hepatocytes and myocytes, expanding their differentiation potential.
in order to identify factors able to lead differentiation of stem cells towards cells of neural lineage, we isolated stromal cells from human adult bone marrow .
our study may contribute towards the identification of mechanisms involved in the differentiation of stem cells towards cells of neural lineage.
morphological modifications were more dramatic after treatment  compared with treatment .
