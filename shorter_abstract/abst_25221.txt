unexpectedly, neither asc nor nlrp <dig> played a significant role in host defense against s. typhimurium infection, as reflected by equal bacterial counts in wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice at all time points, in both the typhoid and colitis models.
despite this reduction, bacterial counts, cytokine levels and histological inflammation did not differ between wild-type and knockout mice in either model.
proinflammatory cytokine levels  and the extent of hepatic and splenic pathology did not differ between groups in the typhoid model.
our results reveal a limited role for asc and nlrp <dig> during in vivo s. typhimurium infection despite its role in cytokine maturation.
release of the inflammasome cytokine il- <dig> was hampered in asc−/− but not nlrp3−/− mice  during s. typhimurium infection.
il- <dig> release was reduced in asc−/− but not nlrp3−/− mice during s. typhimurium infection.
it leads to the activation of and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1β and il- <dig>  s. typhimurium is a gram-negative intracellular bacterium, which is known to trigger inflammasome assembly via recognition by the cytosolic receptors, nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig>  to induce cell death and cytokine release.
in the colitis model small differences were seen with regard to splenic and hepatic inflammation, although this was il- <dig> independent.
we sought to characterize the role of asc and nlrp <dig> in two different murine models  of systemic salmonella infection.
