we describe the programming interface, as well as techniques for handling input/output, process control, and state transitions.
a layer above the event-oriented schema integrates events into a workflow by defining "processing directives", which act as automated project managers of items in the system.
the model utilizes several abstraction techniques, focusing especially on the concepts of inheritance and meta-data.
association between regular entities and events is managed via simple "many-to-many" relationships.
the design allows straightforward definition of a "processing pipeline" as a sequence of events, obviating the need for separate workflow management systems.
we describe a general modeling framework for laboratory data and its implementation as an information management system.
