p. freudenreichii adapts its metabolism during entry into stationary phase by down-regulating oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the wood-werkman cycle by exploiting new nitrogen  sources, by down-regulating the transcription, translation and secretion of protein.
propionibacterium freudenreichii is an actinobacterium widely used in the dairy industry as a ripening culture for swiss-type cheeses, for vitamin b <dig> production and some strains display probiotic properties.

during this study, p. freudenreichii cirm-bia 138 , which has a generation time of five hours in yeast extract lactate medium at 30 °c under microaerophilic conditions, was incubated for 11 days  in a culture medium, without any adjunct during the incubation.
its physiological adaptation was investigated by rna-seq analysis and revealed a complete disruption of metabolism at the entry into stationary phase as compared to exponential phase.
