a hitherto unknown function for either dnaa in replication restart or pric in initiation of dna replication that occurs in certain dnaa temperature sensitive mutant strains at the permissive temperature of 30°c has been documented.
it is shown herein that a pric303::kan mutation is synthetically lethal with either a dnaa <dig> or dnaa <dig> temperature sensitive mutation at the permissive temperature of 30°c.
pria, prib, pric, dnat, rep and dnac form multiple pathways to restart repaired replication forks.
dnaa is an essential protein in the regulation and initiation of dna replication in many bacteria.
dna replication forks initiated at oric by dnaa can collapse on route to the terminus for a variety of reasons.
rnha339::cat mutations allow dnaa-independent initiation of dna replication.
models considering roles for pric during initiation of dna replication and roles for dnaa in replication restart were tested and found not to decisively explain the data.
other roles of dnaa in transcription and nucleoid structure are additionally considered.
the pric-dnaa lethality is specific for the dnaa allele.
