a higher cytokinin status in the roots activated the expression of numerous genes normally expressed predominantly in the shoot, while a lower cytokinin status in the shoot reduced the expression of genes normally more active in the shoot to a more root-like level.
the shift of the root and shoot transcriptomes towards the respective other organ depending on the cytokinin status indicated that the hormone determines part of the organ-specific transcriptome pattern independent of morphological organ identity.
it may be assumed that organ-specific regulation of gene expression is involved in these differential activities, but little is known about it.
to get more insight into the transcriptional events triggered by cytokinin in roots and shoots, we studied genome-wide gene expression in cytokinin-treated and cytokinin-deficient roots and shoots.
this shift predominantly affected nuclear genes encoding plastid proteins.
it was found by principal component analysis of the transcriptomic data that the immediate-early response to a cytokinin stimulus differs from the later response, and that the transcriptome of cytokinin-deficient plants is different from both the early and the late cytokinin induction response.
an organ-specific regulation was assigned to a number of genes previously known to react to a cytokinin signal, including root-specificity for the cytokinin hydroxylase gene cyp735a <dig> and shoot specificity for the cell cycle regulator gene cdka; <dig>  numerous cytokinin-regulated genes were newly discovered or confirmed, including the meristem regulator genes shepherd and clavata <dig>  auxin-related genes , several genes involved in brassinosteroid  and flavonol  synthesis, various transporter genes , numerous members of the ap2/erf transcription factor gene family, genes involved in light signalling , and more than  <dig> ribosomal genes.
however, contrasting with the fundamental difference of the growth response of roots and shoots to the hormone, the vast majority of the cytokinin-regulated transcriptome showed similar response patterns in roots and shoots.
