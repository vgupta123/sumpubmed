correspondingly, naïve t cells, regulatory t cells and hematopoietic stem cells  accumulate in the bone marrow of nod mice.
these results suggest that the elevated cxcl <dig> expression promotes tid in nod mice by altering t cell and hematopoietic stem cell trafficking.
we found that the level of cxcl <dig> transcript is significantly elevated in the bone marrow of nod mice as compared to balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> mice.
treatment of nod mice with amd <dig>  an antagonist for cxcl12's receptor cxcr <dig>  mobilizes t cells and hsc from the bone marrow to the periphery, concomitantly inhibits insulitis and delays the onset of diabetes.
type i diabetes  is an autoimmune disease resulting from destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells by autoreactive t cells.
despite these initial observations, however, how cxcl <dig> affects development of tid has not been fully investigated.
