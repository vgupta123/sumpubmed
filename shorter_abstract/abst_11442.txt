the question arose how these complexes evolved with regard to gene number in the evolution of insects concentrating on diptera and the hymenoptera apis mellifera.
in drosophila melanogaster the enhancer of split-complex  consists of seven highly related genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix  repressors and intermingled, four genes that belong to the bearded  family.
the ancestral ur-complexes, however, consisted most likely of just two genes: e-c contains one bhlh member of mβ type and one brd family member of mα type and as-c contains one sc/l'sc and a highly diverged ase like gene.
in drosophilids both gene complexes are highly conserved, spanning roughly  <dig> million years of evolution.
