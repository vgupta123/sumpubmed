since it is difficult to accurately call individual snp frequencies when the depth of sequence coverage is low, variant frequencies were averaged across larger regions.
the tc_rph <dig> resistance allele resulted in a significant fitness cost relative to the wild type allele in unselected beetles over eighteen generations.
progeny from defined genetic crosses of tribolium castaneum  segregating for the phosphine resistance trait were exposed to phosphine to select for the resistance trait while the remainders were left unexposed.
the approach relied on regional averaging of snp frequencies and was used to successfully identify candidate gene loci for phosphine resistance in t. castaneum.
this is a relatively simple and rapid approach to identifying genomic regions associated with traits in defined genetic crosses that does not require any specialised statistical analysis.
the reads were mapped against the annotated t. castaneum genome from ncbi  and analysed for snp variations.
results from regional snp frequency averaging identified two loci, tc_rph <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and tc_rph <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which together are responsible for high level resistance.
individually, homozygosity of tc_rph <dig> or tc_rph <dig> results in only weak resistance to phosphine , whereas in combination they interact synergistically to provide a high-level resistance >200Ã—.
we report a simple approach to identify regional linkage to a trait that requires only two pools of dna to be sequenced from progeny of a defined genetic cross  at low coverage  and without parentage assignment of individual snps.
