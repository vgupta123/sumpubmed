this protein has an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release per synapse, axonal growth and bouton formation.
despite that, we have detected that significant evolutionary rate acceleration had occurred in frq <dig> in early times from the duplication, in which positive selection  had probably an important role.
the results reveal a possible mechanism of regulatory diversification between frq <dig> and frq <dig>
here we show that the action of positive selection in concordance with some extent of regulatory diversification might explain these findings.
here, we have investigated the factors involved in this unusual feature by examining the molecular evolution of the two frq genes in drosophila and the evolutionary dynamics of ncs family in a large set of bilaterian species.
in contrast, synonymous substitutions have been prevalent in the evolution of the coding region of frq <dig> and frq <dig>  indicating the presence of strong functional constraints following gene duplication.
drosophila frequenin , the homolog of the mammalian neuronal calcium sensor- <dig> , is a high affinity calcium-binding protein with ubiquitous expression in the nervous system.
selected amino acid substitutions in frq <dig> likely contributed to the functional divergence between the two duplicates, which, in turn, should have diverged in their regulation by ecdysone-induced early genes.
in d. melanogaster, frequenin is encoded by two genes , a very unexpected feature in the frq/ncs- <dig> subfamily.
these genes are located in tandem in the same genomic region, and their products are 95% identical in their amino acid sequence, clearly indicating their recent origin by gene duplication.
the presence of two frequenins in drosophila and the rapid accumulation of amino acid substitutions after gene duplication are very unusual features in the evolution of the frq/ncs- <dig> subfamily.
