an increased usage of specific v segments and v-j pairing were observed in malignant meningiomas samples.
multiplex pcr has been previously developed to assay immune repertoire; however, the use of primer pools leads to inherent biases in target amplification.
further development of this technology may enable a comprehensive delineation of immune repertoire, including other forms of tcrs as well as immunoglobulins.

mapping of sequencing data showed that 64% to 96% of mapped tcrv-containing reads belong to trb subtype.
by utilizing a universal primer paired with a single primer targeting the conserved constant region, we amplified tcr-beta  variable regions from total rna extracted from blood.
as one of the genetic mechanisms for adaptive immunity, vj recombination generates an enormous repertoire of t-cell receptors .
with the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, systematic exploration of vj recombination becomes possible.
next-generation sequencing libraries were then prepared for illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencer, which generates 151-bp read length to cover the entire vj recombination region.
we demonstrated the technical feasibility and effectiveness of ligation-anchored pcr approach in capturing the tcr-beta landscapes.
we evaluated this approach on blood samples from healthy donors and from patients with malignant and benign meningiomas.
