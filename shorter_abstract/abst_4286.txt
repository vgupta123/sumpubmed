significant changes were observed after about  <dig> h pi:  uptake of extracellular glucose and lactate release into the cell culture supernatant were clearly increased in infected cells compared to mock-infected cells.
more insights on mammalian cell metabolism after a viral infection could give hints on limitations and cell-specific virus production capacities.
comparing these results with literature values for the time course of infection with same influenza strains, underline the hypothesis that influenza infection only represents a minor additional burden for host cell metabolism.
thus, infection dynamics are obviously reflected in host cell metabolism.
for most metabolites the comparison of infected  and mock-infected cells showed a very similar behavior during the first 10- <dig> h post infection .
a detailed metabolic characterization of an influenza infected adherent cell line  was carried out based on extracellular and intracellular measurements of metabolite concentrations.
at the same time  intracellular metabolite concentrations of the upper part of glycolysis were significantly increased.
the comparison of experimental data from two variants of the a/pr/8/ <dig> virus strain  with different productivities and infection dynamics showed comparable metabolic patterns but a clearly different timely behavior.
the metabolic changes observed after <dig> h pi are most probably caused by the onset of apoptosis in infected cells.
