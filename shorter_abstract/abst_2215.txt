codon alignments of the frks kinase subdomains and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were used in the codon substitution models of the codeml program in the paml package to detect selective pressure between frk groups.
interestingly, the whole mekk subfamily has significantly expanded throughout evolution, especially in solanaceous species.
expansion and rapid evolution of the frk class members in solanaceous species support the hypothesis that they have acquired new roles, mainly in male and female reproductive development.
this holds true for members of the frk class, which have also strongly expanded and diverged.
members of the plant map kinases superfamily have been mostly studied in arabidopsis thaliana and little is known in most other species.
with the aim of finding all members of the mekk subfamily members in plants, we screened the genomes of  <dig> species from different clades of the plant kingdom.
mekks were identified using blast and hidden markov model  to build profiles using the  <dig> mekks from a. thaliana.
in solanum chacoense, a wild species close to the common potato, it had been reported that members of a specific group in the mekk subfamily, namely scfrk <dig> and scfrk <dig>  are involved in male and female reproductive development.
