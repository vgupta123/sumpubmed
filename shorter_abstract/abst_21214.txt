we apply tigar <dig> to both simulation data and real data of human samples and evaluate performance of transcript quantification with tigar <dig> in comparison to existing methods.
our method models substitution, deletion, and insertion errors of sequencers based on gapped-alignments of reads to the reference cdna sequences so that sensitive read-aligners such as bowtie <dig> and bwa-mem are effectively incorporated in our pipeline.
we propose tigar <dig>  a statistical method for quantifying transcript isoforms from fixed and variable length rna-seq data.
tigar <dig> is a sensitive and accurate tool for quantifying transcript isoform abundances from rna-seq data.
recently, longer sequence reads become available thanks to the development of new types of sequencing technologies as well as improvements in chemical reagents for the next generation sequencers.
also, a heuristic algorithm is implemented in variational bayesian inference for faster computation.

although several computational methods have been proposed for quantifying gene expression levels from rna-seq data, they are not sufficiently optimized for longer reads .
