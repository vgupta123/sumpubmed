at the same time, lncrnas expressed downstream of protein-coding genes are characterized by rapid induction, followed by transcriptional repression.
integration of genomic and transcriptomic levels of information allowed us to demonstrate specific behavior of lncrnas organized in different genomic architectures.
lncrna expression was studied in a 120-hours timecourse of differentiation of human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells into neurons upon treatment with retinoic acid , the compound used for the treatment of neuroblastoma.
this is the first report detailing dynamical changes of multiple lncrnas during ra-induced neuroblastoma differentiation.
recent studies have implicated several lncrnas as playing important roles in embryonic development and cancer progression.
quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed the discovered functional modes for several selected lncrnas associated with proteins involved in cancer and embryonic development.
a custom microarray chip was utilized to interrogate expression levels of  <dig>  lncrnas in the course of differentiation.
our study aimed at bridging lncrna architecture with dynamical patterns of their expression using differentiating human neuroblastoma cells model.
mammalian genomes are extensively transcribed producing thousands of long non-protein-coding rnas .
we further classified the lncrnas by the temporal patterns of their expression dynamics.
it allowed us to demonstrate positive correlation of lncrnas with their associated protein-coding genes at bidirectional promoters and for sense-antisense transcript pairs.
this study also provides a list of lncrnas with possible roles in neuroblastoma.
