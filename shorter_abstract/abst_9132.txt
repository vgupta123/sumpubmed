growth of s. chartarum on suitable substrates and under favorable environmental conditions leads to the production of secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins and microbial volatile organic compounds .
the aim of this study was to characterize mvoc emission profiles of seven toxigenic strains of s. chartarum, isolated from water-damaged buildings, in order to identify unique mvocs generated during growth on gypsum wallboard and ceiling tile coupons.
the data showed that anisole  was emitted from all of the s. chartarum strains tested on both types of substrates.
these data could provide useful information for the future construction of a robust mvoc library for the early detection of this mold.
this study identifies the production of anisole by seven toxigenic strains of stachybotrys chartarum within a period of one week of growth on gypsum wallboard and ceiling tiles.
mvocs are suitable markers for fungal identification because they easily diffuse through weak barriers like wallpaper, and could be used for early detection of mold growth in hidden cavities.
gas samples were collected from the headspace for three to four weeks using tenax ta tubes.
stachybotrys chartarum is a filamentous mold frequently identified among the mycobiota of water-damaged building materials.
