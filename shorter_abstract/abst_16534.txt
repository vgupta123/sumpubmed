the activities of derivatives of fourteen serine integrases that either possess or lack a nuclear localization signal were compared using a standardized recombinase mediated cassette exchange reaction.
phage-encoded serine integrases, such as ϕc <dig> integrase, are widely used for genome engineering but have not been optimized for use in saccharomyces cerevisiae although this organism is a widely used organism in biotechnology.
we show that in general the active phage-encoded serine integrases were an order of magnitude more efficient in promoting genome integration reactions than a simple homologous recombination.

the results of our study allow us to identify the integrases of the phage ϕbt <dig>  tp901 ~ nls, r <dig>  bxb <dig>  mr <dig>  a <dig>  ϕk <dig>  ϕc31 ~ nls, wβ and spbc ~ nls as active in s. cerevisiae and indicate that vertebrate cells are more restricted than yeast in terms of which integrases are active.
the relative activities of these integrases in s. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells suggested that the major determinant of the activity of an integrase is the enzyme itself and not the cell in which it is working.
