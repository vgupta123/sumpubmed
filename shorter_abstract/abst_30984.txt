as attested by the fossil record, cretaceous environmental changes have significantly impacted the diversification dynamics of several groups of organisms.
though there is evidence that the latter promoted the diversification of phytophagous insects, the response of other insect groups to cretaceous environmental changes is still largely unknown.
contrary to other insect groups, we found no support for a positive shift in diversification rates during the cretaceous; instead there is evidence for an  <dig> -fold increase in extinction rates that was not compensated by a joint increase in speciation rates.
we hypothesize that this pattern is better explained by the concomitant reduction of arid environments starting in the mid-cretaceous, which likely negatively impacted the diversification of arid-adapted species that were predominant at that time.
to gain novel insights on this issue, we assess the diversification dynamics of a hyperdiverse family of detritivorous beetles  using molecular dating and diversification analyses.

age estimates reveal an origin after the triassic-jurassic mass extinction , followed by the diversification of major lineages during pangaean and gondwanan breakups.
