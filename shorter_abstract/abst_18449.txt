chaining is a major problem in constructing gene families.
we compare examples of output from scwib and the markov cluster algorithm , and also compare some curated arabidopsis thaliana gene families with the results of automatic clustering.
we apply our method to  <dig> published angiosperm genomes with annotation, and discover that amborella trichopoda is distinct from all the others in having substantially and systematically smaller proportions of moderate- and large-size gene families.

this differs from other definitions in how it controls the "chaining effect", by ensuring clusters satisfy a tolerant edge density criterion that takes into account cluster size.
we define a new kind of cluster on graphs with strong and weak edges: soft cliques with backbones .
