pathogenicity of r. solanacearum relies on the type iii secretion system that injects type iii effector  proteins into plant cells.
we provide the catalogue of t3e in the r. solanacearum species complex, as well as candidates in newly sequenced strains.
establishment of t3e repertoires in strains representatives of the r. solanacearum biodiversity allowed determining a set of  <dig> t3e present in all the strains but provided no clues on host specificity determinants.
systematical analyses were performed to detect lateral t3e gene transfer events and identify t3e genes under positive selection.
ralstonia solanacearum is a soil-borne beta-proteobacterium that causes bacterial wilt disease in many food crops and is a major problem for agriculture in intertropical regions.

our analyses also pinpoint the ripf translocon proteins as major discriminating determinants among the phylogenetic lineages.
t3e collectively perturb host cell processes and modulate plant immunity to enable bacterial infection.
this curated t3e catalog is available on a public website and a bioinformatic pipeline has been designed to rapidly predict t3e genes in newly sequenced strains.
r. solanacearum is a heterogeneous species, both phenotypically and genetically, and is considered as a species complex.
