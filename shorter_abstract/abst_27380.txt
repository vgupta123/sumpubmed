the rat nek <dig> gene is located in a region syntenic to portions of human chromosome  <dig> and mouse  <dig>  scanning electron microscopy confirmed abnormally long cilia on lpk kidney epithelial cells, and fluorescence immunohistochemistry for nek <dig> protein revealed altered cilia localisation.

nephronophthisis  as a cause of cystic kidney disease is the most common genetic cause of progressive renal failure in children and young adults.
previously, we characterized an autosomal recessive phenotype of cystic kidney disease in the lewis polycystic kidney  rat.
this study establishes the lpk rat as a novel model system for nphp and further consolidates the link between cystic kidney disease and cilia proteins.
when assessed relative to other nek <dig> nphp mutations, our results indicate the whole propeller structure of the rcc <dig> domain is important, as the different mutations cause comparable phenotypes.
targeted genome capture and next-generation sequencing of this region identified a non-synonymous mutation r650c in the nima - related kinase  <dig>  gene.
specifically, the r650c substitution is located within a glg repeat motif of the predicted seven bladed beta-propeller structure of the rcc <dig> domain.
in this study, quantitative trait locus analysis was used to define a ~ <dig> mbp region on rat chromosome 10q <dig> harbouring the lpk mutation.
