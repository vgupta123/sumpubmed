our findings suggest that grammatical relations play an important role in the interaction extraction task.
the rapid growth of the amount of publicly available reports on biomedical experimental results has recently caused a boost of text mining approaches for protein interaction extraction.
in this work, we contribute to this evaluation by studying the relative importance of deep syntactic features, i.e., grammatical relations, shallow syntactic features  and lexical features.
moreover, the net advantage of adding lexical and shallow syntactic features is small related to the number of added features.
the smaller the training corpus compared to the test data, the more important the role of grammatical relations becomes.
moreover, deep syntactic information based classifiers prove to be more robust on heterogeneous texts where no or only limited common vocabulary is shared.
this implies that efficient classifiers can be built by using only a small fraction of the features that are typically being used in recent approaches.
our results reveal that the contribution of the different feature types varies for the different data sets on which the experiments were conducted.
