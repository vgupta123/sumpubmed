microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  has enabled the high-resolution detection of dna copy number aberrations.
we have developed a robust and flexible methodology for high-resolution analysis of dna copy number of whole genomes, using affymetrix high-density expression oligonucleotide microarrays.
copy number is obtained from fluorescence signals after processing with novel normalization, spatial artifact correction, data transformation and deletion/duplication detection.
the sequencing of many genomes and tiling arrays consisting of millions of dna segments spanning entire genomes have made high-resolution copy number analysis possible.
while many of the methods and algorithms developed for the analysis microarrays have focused on expression analysis, the same technology can be used to detect genetic alterations, using for example standard commercial affymetrix arrays.
