gene expression studies were used to determine that the uzu derivatives are attenuated in downstream brassinosteroid signaling.
the pathogen resistance of uzu derivatives may be due to pleiotropic effects of bri <dig> or the cascade effects of their repressed br signaling.
brassinosteroid hormones regulate many aspects of plant growth and development.
it was due to a combination of preformed, inducible and constitutive defence responses, as determined by a combination of transcriptomic and biochemical studies.
