some of the more prevalent quality issues involve low per-base sequencing quality at the 3’ end, pcr amplification bias, and bisulfite conversion rates.
hence, it is important to study methylation signals at the single cytosine site level, which is now possible utilizing bisulfite conversion technique  and next generation sequencing  technologies.
therefore, it is important to conduct quality assessment before downstream analysis.
to conduct the quality assessment of bisulfite methylation sequencing data, we have developed a pipeline named methyqa.
methyqa combines currently available open-source software packages with our own custom programs written in perl and r. the pipeline can provide quality assessment results for tens of millions of reads in under an hour.
this epigenetic modification can significantly affect gene expression in both normal and diseased cells.
the novelty of our pipeline lies in its examination of bisulfite conversion rates and of the dna sequence structure of regions that have different conversion rates or coverage.
dna methylation is an epigenetic event that adds a methyl-group to the 5’ cytosine.
