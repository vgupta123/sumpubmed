we first introduce the kefed approach as a general approach and describe its possible role as a way of introducing structured reasoning into models of argumentation within new models of scientific publication.
we present web-application software as part of the 'bioscholar' project  that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to study the neural connectivity of the rat brain.
the software has three parts:  the kefed model editor - a design editor for creating kefed models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol;  the kefed data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model;  a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data.
the main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'knowledge engineering from experimental design'  based on experimental variables and their interdependencies.
this is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the brain architecture management system .
