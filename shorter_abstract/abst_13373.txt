we find evidence for bimodal variation among egg clutches in the number of developing embryos that subsequently arrest, indicating that there is genetic variation for incompatibility between mating individuals.
we show that eggs laid by g. bimaculatus females mated to g. campestris males are less likely to begin embryogenesis than eggs from conspecific mating pairs.
they are sufficiently large, that if the species interbreed where they are sympatric, these barriers could play a role in the maintenance of reproductive isolation between them.
female g. bimaculatus preferentially store sperm from conspecific males when mated to both conspecific and heterospecific partners.
these interactions have the potential to act as barriers to gene flow between species, and may be important in the process of speciation.
the number of eggs that fail to develop represents a substantial cost of hybridization to g. bimaculatus females, and this cost could reinforce the evolution of barriers occurring earlier in the reproductive process.
there are multiple post-mating barriers to interbreeding between the hybridising field crickets gryllus bimaculatus and g. campestris.
additionally, conspecific males sire an even greater proportion of offspring than would be predicted from their spermâ€™s representation in the spermatheca.
of the eggs that are successfully fertilised and start to develop, those from heterospecific mating pairs are more likely to arrest early, prior to blastoderm formation.
