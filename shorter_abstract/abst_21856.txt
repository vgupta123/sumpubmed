we tested for potential long-branch attraction  using taxon deletion experiments, and with relative rate tests.
we also performed bayesian and parsimony analyses on separate and combined partitions, and tested the contribution of each partition.
surprisingly, previous research found no rate heterogeneity.
we found significant rate heterogeneity between species for both the 18s rrna and combined datasets, introducing the possibility of lba.
rate heterogeneity and conflict between data partitions mean that existing molecular and morphological evidence is unable to resolve a well-supported eumalacostracan phylogeny.
we combined evidence from four nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial loci  with a newly synthesized morphological dataset.
hitherto, no phylogenetic analysis of all major eumalacostracan taxa  has either combined evidence from multiple loci, or combined molecular and morphological evidence.
we tested the homogeneity of data partitions, both in terms of character congruence and the topological congruence of inferred trees.
moreover, 18s rrna trees show striking branch length differences between species, accompanied by a conspicuous clustering of taxa with similar branch lengths.
recent morphological and molecular phylogenies appear highly incongruent, but this has not been assessed quantitatively.
we detected significant conflict between data partitions, especially between morphology and molecules.
