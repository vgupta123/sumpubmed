abiotic stresses which include drought and heat are amongst the main limiting factors for plant growth and crop productivity.
these results show evidence for both cross-talk and specificity in the sorghum response to combined heat and drought stress.
a functional characterization of the genes and pathways identified here could lead to new targets for the enhancement of plant stress tolerance, which will be particularly important in the face of climate change and the increasing prevalence of these abiotic stress types.
in the field, these stress types are rarely presented individually and plants are often subjected to a combination of stress types.
in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying combined stress tolerance in this important crop, we have used microarrays to investigate the transcriptional response of sorghum subjected to heat and drought stresses imposed both individually and in combination.
microarrays consisting of  <dig> gene probes identified gene expression changes equating to ~4% and 18% of genes on the chip following drought and heat stresses respectively.
ontological analysis of these ‘unique’ transcripts identified a potential role for specific transcription factors including myb <dig> and ataf <dig>  chaperones including unique heat shock proteins  and metabolic pathways including polyamine biosynthesis in the sorghum combined stress response.
it is clear that some aspects of the combined stress response are unique compared to those of individual stresses.
sorghum bicolor is a cereal crop which is grown in arid and semi-arid regions and is particularly well adapted to the hot and dry conditions in which it originates and is now grown as a crop.
