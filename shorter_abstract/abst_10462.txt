additionally,  <dig> raw milk samples, representing bulk tank milk of  <dig> different dairy farms,  <dig> minced meat  samples and  <dig> e. coli isolates from cattle e. coli mastitis were analyzed.
of the total of  <dig> isolates,  <dig> were e. coli, one was citrobacter youngae and one was enterobacter cloacae.
in contrast, none of the minced meat, none of the bulk tank milk samples and only one of the mastitis milk samples contained esbl producing strains.
the impact of food animals as a possible reservoir for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  producing enterobacteriaceae, and the dissemination of such strains into the food production chain need to be assessed.
the relatively high rates of esbl producers in food animals and the high genetic diversity among these isolates are worrisome and indicate an established reservoir in farm animals.
as many as  <dig> % of the porcine,  <dig> % of the bovine,  <dig> % of the sheep and  <dig> % of the chicken fecal samples yielded esbl producers after an enrichment step.
five detected esbls  belonged to the shv group and  <dig> isolates  contained a tem-type enzyme.
