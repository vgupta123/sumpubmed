the results, however, depend on the sequences in target databases and on search algorithms.
the improved database was then used to compare four search algorithms: mascot, omssa, x!
in this study, we aimed at finding a greater number of eligible splice variants based on newly available transcript sequences and the latest genome annotation.
database searches were conducted using the same set of spectral data, search parameters, and protein database but with different algorithms.
<dig> plausible isoforms were discovered by focusing on the consensus peptides which were detected by at least three different algorithms.
unlike the identifications of the peptides and the refseq proteins, large variations existed between the putative splice variants identified by different algorithms.
the updated alternative splicing database predicted  <dig> putative protein variants, 61% more than the previous results.
this suggests that applications of multiple search engines effectively reduced the possible false positive results and validated the protein identifications from tandem mass spectra using an alternative splicing database.
the analysis found different conserved domains in two putative isoforms of udp-galactose 4-epimerase.
<dig> candidates of putative isoforms were reported based on the consensus peptide-spectrum matches.
the false discovery rates of the peptide-spectrum matches were estimated < 2%.
whereas 42%  of peptide assignments were unanimous, the comparison showed that 51%  of the refseq proteins and 15%  of the putative splice variants were inferred by all algorithms.
there was transcript evidence for 50% of the updated genes compared to the previous 35% coverage.
database searching is the most frequently used approach for automated peptide assignment and protein inference of tandem mass spectra.
