consensus maps for the two species were constructed and aligned.
this study provides map locations for a large set of est-ssrs in two oak species of recognized biological importance in natural ecosystems.
we developed a set of  <dig> expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeats  and located  <dig> markers  on the  <dig> oak chromosomes  on the basis of mendelian segregation patterns in  <dig> full-sib mapping pedigrees of two species: quercus robur  and quercus petraea .
we assessed the transferability of est-ssrs to other fagaceae genera and a subset of these markers was mapped in castanea sativa, the european chestnut.
they showed a high degree of macrosynteny between these two sympatric european oaks.
finally, based on the orthologous relationships between the oak, arabidopsis, grape, poplar, medicago, and soybean genomes and the paralogous relationships between the  <dig> oak chromosomes, we propose an evolutionary scenario of the  <dig> oak chromosomes from the eudicot ancestral karyotype.
reasonably high levels of macrosynteny were observed between oak and chestnut.
a large number of mapping populations have been developed for oak, but few gene-based markers are available for constructing integrated genetic linkage maps and comparing gene order and qtl location across related species.
genetic markers and linkage mapping are basic prerequisites for comparative genetic analyses, qtl detection and map-based cloning.
this first step toward the construction of a gene-based linkage map will facilitate the assignment of future genome scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes.
