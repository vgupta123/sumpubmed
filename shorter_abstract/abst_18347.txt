such analyses, however, critically depend on the availability of appropriate reference genome databases against which the sequencing reads can be aligned.
we selected  <dig> bacteria isolated from dairy products belonging to  <dig> different species and  <dig> genera, and succeeded to reconstruct the draft genome of  <dig> of them at a standard or high quality level, including isolates from the genera kluyvera, luteococcus and marinilactibacillus, still missing from public database.
metagenomic analysis of these communities by high throughput shotgun sequencing is a promising approach to characterize their genomic and functional profiles.
we built a reference genome catalog suitable for short read metagenomic analysis using a low-cost sequencing strategy.
microbial communities of traditional cheeses are complex and insufficiently characterized.
to demonstrate the potential of this catalog, we analysed the microbial composition of the surface of two smear cheeses and one blue-veined cheese, and showed that a significant part of the microbiota of these traditional cheeses was composed of microorganisms newly sequenced in our study.
the origin, safety and functional role in cheese making of these microbial communities are still not well understood.
