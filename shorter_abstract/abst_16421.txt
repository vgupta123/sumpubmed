the estimated number of true exons in twinscan's predictions is  <dig> .
finally, the log odds ratio is developed to classify putative exons into the group of coding exons and the group of non-coding regions.
the method was tested on pre-aligned human-mouse sequences where the putative exons are predicted by genscan and twinscan.
the results and the executable codes can be downloaded from
one common limitation of these tools is the relatively low specificity due to the large amount of non-coding regions.
by first exploiting the homology between genomes of two related species, a probability model for the evolutionary conservation pattern of codons across different genomes is developed.
a probability model for the dependency between adjacent codons/triplets is added to differentiate coding exons and random sequences.
