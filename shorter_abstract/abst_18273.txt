since an allelic series of npr <dig> was recently described, the behavior of these alleles was tested in response to methyl jasmonate.
surprisingly, the application of methyl jasmonate also induces resistance, and npr <dig> is also suspected to be relevant.
the response to methyl jasmonate of different npr1s alleles and npr <dig> paralogs null mutants was measured by the growth of a pathogen.
the localization of the protein in npr <dig> alleles does not affect the response to methyl jasmonate.
some npr <dig> alleles have a phenotype in this response likely because they are affecting the interaction between bops and tgas, and these two families of proteins are responsible for the resistance induced by methyl jasmonate in wild type plants.
npr <dig> is a gene of arabidopsis thaliana required for the perception of salicylic acid.
the genes that are required in a redundant fashion are the bops.
the bops are paralogs of npr <dig>  and they physically interact with the tga family of transcription factors.
