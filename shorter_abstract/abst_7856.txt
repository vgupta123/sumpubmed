wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide kinases, potently inhibited chloroplast responses but did not influence the actin cytoskeleton at the same concentration.
chloroplasts redistribute in response to blue light in the mesophyll cells of nicotiana tabacum.
no blue light specific actin reorganization was detected.
our results suggest also that mg2+ is a regulatory molecule cooperating with ca2+ in the signaling pathway of blue light-induced tobacco chloroplast movements.
the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton in the mesophyll of tobacco is significantly modulated by strong light.
magnesium ions were equally or more effective than ca2+ in restoring chloroplast motility after treatment with egta, trifluoperazine or wortmannin.
the actin cytoskeleton was affected by strong blue and red light.
calcium ions have multiple functions in the mechanism of the movements.
actin bundles play the role of tracks in chloroplast movements activated by light.
this modulation does not affect the direction of chloroplast redistribution in the cell.
chloroplast movements were measured photometrically as changes in light transmission through the leaves.
the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the responses of plants to environmental signals.
the aim of this work was to study the relationship between chloroplast responses and the organization of actin cytoskeleton in living tobacco cells.
the actin cytoskeleton, labeled with plastin-gfp, was visualised by confocal microscopy.
egta and trifluoperazine strongly inhibited chloroplast responses and disrupted the integrity of the cytoskeleton.
