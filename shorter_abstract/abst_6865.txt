pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which has the potential to become extremely harmful in the nosocomial environment, especially for cystic fibrosis  patients, who are easily affected by chronic lung infections.
at typing of this italian collection could be easily integrated with the global p. aeruginosa at-typed population, uncovering that most at-genotypes identified  belonged to two large clonal clusters, and included  <dig> among the most abundant clones of the global population.
the arraytube  multimarker array represented a robust and portable alternative to reference techniques for performing p. aeruginosa molecular typing, and allowed us to draw conclusions especially suitable for epidemiologists on an italian clinical collection from chronic and acute infections.
for epidemiological purposes, discriminating p.aeruginosa isolates is a critical step, to define distribution of clones among hospital departments, to predict occurring microevolution events and to correlate clones to their source.
the presence of the exou gene correlated with non-cf patients within the intensive care unit  whereas the pklc102-like island appeared to be prevalent in the cf centre.
an investigation on co-infections events revealed that almost 40% of cf patients were colonized by more than one genotype, whereas less than 4% were observed in non cf patients.
a collection of  <dig> p. aeruginosa clinical strains isolated within italian hospitals from patients with chronic infections, i.e.
cystic fibrosis  patients, and with acute infections were genotyped.
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing  were employed as reference genotyping techniques to estimate the arraytube resolution power.
almost 30% of the genotypes belonged to a main cluster of clones.
