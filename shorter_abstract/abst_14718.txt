this study case demonstrates that the sysnet software is an effective platform for interactive analysis of molecular expression information in systems biology.
the user must first generate visualization data with a preferred data mining algorithm and then upload the resulting data into the visualization package for graphic visualization of molecular relations.
it integrates interactive graphic visualization and statistical data mining into a single package.
the existing software packages provide limited data mining capability.
it is also applicable to comparative analysis of molecular expression data, such as time course data.
molecular correlations and comparative studies of molecular expression are crucial to establishing interdependent connections in systems biology.
systems biology aims to understand biological systems on a comprehensive scale, such that the components that make up the whole are connected to one another and work through dependent interactions.
presented is a novel interactive visual data mining application, sysnet that provides an interactive environment for the analysis of high data volume molecular expression information of most any type from biological systems.
sysnet interactively presents intermolecular correlation information with circular and heatmap layouts.
