alginate overproduction in p. aeruginosa, also referred to as mucoidy, is a poor prognostic marker for patients with cystic fibrosis .
furthermore, it seems likely that muce may be part of the signal transduction system that senses certain types of cell wall stress to p. aeruginosa.
additionally, the presence of triclosan and sodium dodecyl sulfate was shown to cause an increase in pmuce activity.
our data indicates there is a positive feedback regulation between muce and algu.
in the current study, we mapped the muce transcriptional start site, and determined that pmuce activity was dependent on algu.
it was observed that muce-mediated mucoidy in cf isolates was dependent on both the size of muca and the genotype of algu.
we previously reported the construction of a unique mucoid strain which overexpresses a small envelope protein muce leading to activation of the protease algw.
