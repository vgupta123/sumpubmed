further, kegg pathway analysis demonstrated that  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways in which host genes were associated showed significant overrepresentation of proteins encoded by the mrna targets of associated intragenic mirnas.
these results are consistent with the observation that more than 60% of intronic mirnas are found within the first five 5' introns.
although a role of intragenic mirnas as negative feedback regulators has been speculated, to the best of our knowledge there have been no conclusive large-scale studies investigating the relationship between intragenic mirnas and host genes and their pathways.
mirna-containing host genes were three times longer, contained more introns and had longer 5' introns compared to a randomly sampled gene cohort.
a high-confidence set of predicted mrna targets of intragenic mirnas also shared many of these features with the host genes.
our findings suggest that both host genes and intragenic mirna targets may potentially be subject to multiple layers of regulation.
to this end, we examined the potential for negative feedback loops between intragenic mirnas, host genes, and mirna target genes.
we describe, how higher-order mirna feedback on hosts' interactomes may at least in part explain correlation patterns observed between expression of host genes and intragenic mirna targets in healthy and tumor tissue.
coincidentally, recent literature suggests that several components of the mirna biogenesis pathway are required for the rapid decay of mrnas containing ares.
tight regulatory control of these genes is likely critical for cellular homeostasis and absence of disease.
host gene 3'-untranslated regions  were 40% longer and contained significantly more adenylate/uridylate-rich elements  compared to a randomly sampled gene cohort.
approximately 20% of intragenic mirnas were predicted to target their host mrna transcript.
