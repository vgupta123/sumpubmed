first, several transcript and protein attributes, including coding potential of transcripts and differences in functional domains of proteins, were compared between splice variants and protein isoforms to assess transcript and protein diversity in a biological system.
alternative splicing was shown to increase transcript and function-related protein diversity in developing arabidopsis embryos.
alternative splicing has been proposed to increase transcript diversity and protein plasticity in eukaryotic organisms, but the extent to which this is the case is currently unclear, especially with regard to the diversification of molecular function.
the methods presented here can be used in any biological system to assess transcript diversity and protein plasticity and to predict candidate regulators, their targets, and rna-binding motifs for splicing factors.
analysis of inferred splicing factor targets revealed an unexpected role for the unfolded protein response in embryo development.
inference of co-splicing networks capturing these types of interactions is important for understanding this crucial, highly regulated post-transcriptional process at the systems level.
