a complex layer of control is the dynamic spatial organization of the nucleus.
we present a bioinformatics solution  to support the experimentalist in detecting long-ranging intra or inter chromosomal contacts by chromosome conformation capture  assays.
our software is available as a web server at: http://www.pristionchus.org/3cprimerdesign/.
our primer design reduces the level of experimental error as primers are highly similar in terms of physical properties and amplicon length.
