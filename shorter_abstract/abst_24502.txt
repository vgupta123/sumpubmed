here we present predgpi, a prediction method that, by coupling a hidden markov model  and a support vector machine , is able to efficiently predict both the presence of the gpi-anchor and the position of the ω-site.
predgpi outperforms all the other previously described methods and is able to correctly replicate the results of previously published high-throughput experiments.
several eukaryotic proteins associated to the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane carry a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor, which is linked to the c-terminal residue after a proteolytic cleavage occurring at the so called ω-site.
predgpi reaches a lower rate of false positive predictions with respect to other available methods and it is therefore a costless, rapid and accurate method for screening whole proteomes.
computational methods were developed to discriminate proteins that undergo this post-translational modification starting from their aminoacidic sequences.
