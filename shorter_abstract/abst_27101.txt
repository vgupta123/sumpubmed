our data shows that atcc  <dig> induces a characteristic set of genes at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels during growth on alkanes, many of which differ from those expressed by pao <dig>  of particular interest was the lack of expression from the rhl operon of the quorum sensing  system, resulting in no measurable rhamnolipid production by atcc  <dig>  further examination showed that atcc  <dig> lacked the entire lasi/lasr arm of the qs response.
while informative, this strategy often leads to inappropriate conclusions about the system as a whole.
this strategy reduces the likelihood of improper conclusions, provides a framework for elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships, and brings finer resolution to comparative genomic experiments.
here, we apply a multi-omic approach to analyze the gene expression profiles of two closely related pseudomonas aeruginosa strains grown in n-alkanes or glycerol.
this work represents the first time results from rna-seq, microarray, ribosome footprinting, proteomics, and small molecule lc-ms experiments have been integrated to compare gene expression in bacteria.
