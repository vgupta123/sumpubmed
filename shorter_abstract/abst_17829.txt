in particular, we tested whether: 1) vicariance diversification events are concomitant with past climatic events; and 2) current ecological factors  contribute to phenotypic divergence between allopatric populations.
in particular, our results suggested that  desert-adapted plumage evolved at least three times and  variation in body size was mainly driven by interspecific competition, but the response to competition was stronger in more arid areas.
phenotypic variation did not correlate with the history of populations, but was strongly influenced by current ecological conditions.
mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that the crested and thekla lark species groups diverged in the early pliocene and that subsequent speciation events were congruent with major late pliocene and pleistocene climatic events.
climatic fluctuations of the plio-pleistocene strongly impacted diversification patterns in the galerida larks.
in addition, since most studies focused on europe and north america, the influence of many other biogeographic barriers such as the sahara remains poorly understood.
in particular, steep increase in aridity in africa near  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago were coincident with two north-south vicariance speciation events mediated by the sahara.
firstly, we found that cladogenesis coincides with major climatic changes, and the sahara appears to have played a key role in driving speciation events.
subsequent glacial cycles of the last million years seem to have shaped patterns of genetic variation within the two widespread species .
the sahara appears to have allowed dispersal from the tropical areas during climatic optima but to have isolated populations north and south of it during more arid phases.
in this paper, climate-driven diversification was investigated by using a comparative phylogeographic approach in combination with phenotypic data in two avian species groups distributed on both sides of the deserts belt of africa and asia.
