horizontal gene transfer, particularly via the symbiotic plasmid characteristic of this species, seems to play an important role in diversity but the lineages maintain their evolutionary cohesiveness.
we identified high levels of dna polymorphism in r. etli, and found that there was an average divergence of 4% to 6% among the tested strain pairs.
our data suggest that r. etli is a species composed of separated lineages with low homologous recombination among the strains.
here, we compared draft genomic sequences versus complete genomic sequences to obtain reliable measures of genetic diversity and then estimated the role of recombination in the generation of genomic diversity among rhizobium etli.
the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria rhizobium etli is highly variable in both genomic structure and gene content.
however, no previous report has provided a detailed genomic analysis of this variation at nucleotide level or the role of recombination in generating diversity in this bacterium.
most of the dna variations found in bacterial species are in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms , but there is some debate regarding how much of this variation comes from mutation versus recombination.
in most instances, the nucleotide diversity  was greater in dna segments with recombinant events than in non-recombinant segments.
