an efficient way to perform comparative cytogenetic mapping is based on bac clones mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
the cytogenetic mapping data were also integrated with bac-end sequences information of o. niloticus and comparatively analyzed against the genome of other fish species and vertebrates.
comparative in silico analysis also identified large genomic blocks that were conserved in distantly related fish groups and also in other vertebrates.
in this report, to address the knowledge gap on the genome evolution in cichlid fishes, bac clones of an oreochromis niloticus library covering the linkage groups   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were mapped onto the chromosomes of  <dig> african cichlid species.
although it has been suggested that fishes contain plastic genomes with high rates of chromosomal rearrangements and probably low rates of synteny conservation, our results evidence that large syntenic chromosome segments have been maintained conserved during evolution, at least for the considered markers.
