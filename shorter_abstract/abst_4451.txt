for the other suc++ mutants  that were catalase positive, no mutation in rpos was detected.
however, the causes of this polymorphism and consequential physiological effects on gene expression in pathogenic strains are not fully understood.
the selection for loss of rpos on poor carbon sources is also operant in most pathogenic strains, and thus is likely responsible for the occurrence of rpos polymorphisms among e. coli isolates.
expression of two pathogenicity-related phenotypes, cell adherence and rdar  morphotype, were also attenuated, indicating positive control by rpos.
though rpos is important for survival of pathogenic escherichia coli in natural environments, polymorphism in the rpos gene is common.
strain o157:h <dig> edl <dig> yielded mainly mutants  that were impaired in catalase expression, suggesting the loss of rpos function.
mutants  forming large colonies on succinate were isolated at a frequency of 10- <dig> mutants per cell plated.
in this study, we found that growth on non-preferred carbon sources can efficiently select for loss of rpos in seven of ten representative verocytotoxin-producing e. coli  strains.
