the present study also makes use of bioinformatic analysis to verify that the haloacid permease deh4p of burkholderia sp.
deh4p exhibits many common features of the mhs family proteins.
mba <dig> is a mfs protein but with atypical features.
mba <dig>  comparative analyses suggested that deh4p is a member of the major facilitator superfamily , which includes thousands of membrane transporter proteins.
the results mainly agree with the predicted model.
both phoa and lacz activities were determined in these cells.
2-haloacids can be found in the natural environment as degradative products of natural and synthetic halogenated compounds.
we have recently identified a novel haloacid permease deh4p from a bromoacetate-degrading bacterium burkholderia sp.
thirty-six deh4p-reporter recombinants were constructed and expressed in e. coli.
the phoa-lacz reporter system is convenient for analysis of the topology of membrane proteins.
further comparative analysis of deh4p has assigned it to the metabolite:h+ symporter   <dig> a.
