comparative sequence analysis employed here provided a better understanding of the host association, evolution of members of the m. avium complex and could help in deciphering the phenotypic differences observed among sheep and cattle strains of map.
hominissuis strain  <dig> and lost  <dig> large regions that are present in the bovine strain.
to systematically characterize all genomic differences that may be associated with the specific hosts, we sequenced the genomes of three u.s. sheep isolates and also obtained an optical map.
in addition, optical mapping defined the presence of  <dig> large inversions between the bovine and ovine genomes .
a similar approach based on whole-genome sequencing combined with optical mapping could be employed to examine closely related pathogens.
whole-genome sequencing of  <dig> additional sheep strains of map  further confirmed genomic homogeneity of the sheep isolates despite the presence of polymorphisms on the nucleotide level.
our analysis of one of the isolates, map s <dig>  revealed a genome  <dig>  mb in size with  <dig>  open reading frames .
the genome of mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  is remarkably homogeneous among the genomes of bovine, human and wildlife isolates.
however, previous work in our laboratories with the bovine k- <dig> strain has revealed substantial differences compared to sheep isolates.
