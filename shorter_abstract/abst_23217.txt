our findings strongly support the monophyly of malagasy canarium, suggesting that this clade represents a previously undocumented in situ radiation.
contrary to expectations of dispersal from africa during the oligocene, concurrent with the formation of madagascarâ€™s rain forest biome, our analyses support a late miocene origin for malagasy canarium, probably by long distance dispersal from southeast asia.
our study illustrates the importance of considering long distance dispersal as a viable explanation for clades with pantropical distributions diversifying subsequent to the oligocene, and it highlights the formation of the indo-australian archipelago and associated fast-moving equatorial surface currents, suggesting an under-appreciated evolutionary link among tropical centers of endemism.
