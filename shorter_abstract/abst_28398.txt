a comparison of spacer-based phylogenies and cas gene phylogenies shows that they resolve very different time scales for this data set.
the crispr/cas system is known to act as an adaptive and heritable immune system in eubacteria and archaea.
even in closely related strains, spacer content is very dynamic and evolves quickly.
we present probabilistic models that are specific for spacer content evolution.
spacer content similarities are displayed in a distance based phylogeny using the estimated times.
the simulations and data analyses show that the presented models are useful for quantifying spacer content evolution and for displaying spacer content similarities of closely related strains in a phylogeny.
this allows for comparisons of different crispr arrays or for comparisons between crispr arrays and nucleotide substitution rates.
we use the presented models to analyze different yersinia pestis data sets and find that the results among them are largely congruent.
parameters of the underlying models are estimated for a pair of arrays by maximum likelihood using explicit ancestor enumeration.
there is a bias in the rate estimation when including fragment deletions.
immunity is encoded in an array of spacer sequences.
