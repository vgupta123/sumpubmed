the combined p method and other competing methods were compared using three spike-in datasets  and array data from a biological study validated with qrt-pcr.
based on power and false discovery rates computed for the spike-in datasets, we demonstrate that the combined p method compares favorably with other methods.
we illustrate the use of the combined p method for diagnostic purposes using examples.
in addition, the combined p method is particularly well suited as a diagnostic tool for exploratory analysis of microarray data.
recently testing methods have been proposed which incorporate probe level information.
currently, most tests of differential gene expression using affymetrix expression array data are performed using expression summary values representing each probe set on a microarray.
combined p is a promising alternative to existing methods of testing for differential gene expression.
specifically, we combine p-values from probe level tests of significance.
