singular value decomposition  is a powerful method to derive primary components of a given matrix.
in order to select a critical set of tfbms from genomic dna information and an array-derived data, an efficient algorithm to solve a combinatorial optimization problem is required.
the prediction included matches to the core binding motifs of biologically known tfbms such as ap <dig>  sp <dig>  egr <dig>  krox, gc-box, abi <dig>  etf, e2f, srf, stat, ik- <dig>  pparγ, staf, roaz, and nfκb, and their significance was evaluated numerically using monte carlo simulation and genetic algorithm.
the results would be useful to evaluate analytically a contribution of individual dna sequences.
the matrix was decomposed with svd, and the effects of  <dig> potential tfbms  were predicted from a pool of  <dig> random dna sequences.
the described svd-based prediction is an analytical method to provide a set of potential tfbms involved in transcriptional regulation.
applying svd to a promoter matrix defined from regulatory dna sequences, we derived a novel method to predict the critical set of tfbms.
the promoter matrix was defined to establish a quantitative relationship between the il-1-driven mrna alteration and genomic dna sequences of the il- <dig> responsive genes.
although computational approaches based on evolutionary algorithms are commonly employed, an analytical algorithm would be useful to predict tfbms at nearly no computational cost and evaluate varying modelling conditions.
