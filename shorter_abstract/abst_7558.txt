the binding site in trbp is a  <dig> aa domain, called c <dig>  located at the c-terminal end of trbp.
tarbp2-/- cells, which do not express trbp, do not support rna interference  mediated by short hairpin or micro rnas against egfp.
we show that the trbp binding site in dicer is a  <dig> amino acid  region located between the atpase and the helicase domains.
both trbps, but not trbpsΔc <dig>  were able to rescue rnai function.
in human cells with low rnai activity, addition of trbp <dig> or  <dig>  but not trbpsΔc <dig>  rescued rnai function.
trbps, but not trbpsΔc <dig>  rescue rnai activity in rnai-compromised cells, indicating that the binding of dicer to trbp is critical for rnai function.
the c <dig> domain is therefore necessary to bind dicer, irrespective of the presence of rna.
