two primary cultures, bovine aortic and human dermal endothelial cells were used in in vitro  and in vivo  models of angiogenesis in the presence of growth factors and cheiradone.
the effect of cheiradone on the binding of growth factors to their receptors was also investigated.
angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature is associated with physiological  and pathological conditions .
cheiradone inhibited vegf-induced angiogenesis by binding to vegf receptors - <dig> and - <dig> and may be a useful investigative tool to study the specific contribution of vegf to angiogenesis and may have therapeutic potential.
