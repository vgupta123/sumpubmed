the observed ifnγ-mediated restoration of the inducibility of il- <dig> in the presence of ascites provides a possible explanation for the association of an interferon signaling-associated signature with a favorable clinical outcome.
consistent with these results, ifnγ was able to abrogate the suppressive effect of ovarian cancer ascites on the inducibility of il12b expression and il- <dig> secretion, a key determinant of a cytotoxic immune response.
intriguingly, analysis of published data for  <dig> ovarian cancer patients revealed a strong association of this transcriptional signature with a longer overall survival.
a hallmark of subgroup a is a high expression of clinically unfavorable markers, including  high cd <dig> expression, a surface receptor characteristic of an anti-inflammatory activation state,  increased pcolce <dig> expression, indicative of enhanced extracellular matrix organization, and  elevated ascites levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  linked to the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer and immune suppression.
in contrast, subgroup b tams are characterized by the upregulation of genes linked to immune defense mechanisms and interferon  signaling.
we have addressed this issue by analyzing global expression patterns of tams isolated from the ascites of ovarian cancer patients.
tams isolated from different ovarian cancer patients can be stratified by coexpression or principal component analysis into subgroups with specific biological features and associated with distinct clinical outcomes.
the survival of ovarian cancer patients is linked to the presence of tams with a transcriptional signature that is characterized by a low expression of protumorigenic and immunosuppressive markers and an upregulation of genes linked to interferon signaling.
