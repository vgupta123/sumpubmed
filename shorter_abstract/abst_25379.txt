this fold is surprisingly reminiscent of the clec-folds of viral and bacterial dgr variable protein, but differs sufficiently to define a new clec-fold subclass, which is consistent with early divergence between bacterial and archaeal dgrs.
however, nanoarchaeota dgr variable proteins were unassignable to known protein folds and apparently unrelated to characterized dgr variable proteins.
to address the issue of how nanoarchaeota dgr variable proteins accommodate massive sequence variation, we determined the  <dig>  Å resolution limit crystal structure of one such protein, avpa, which revealed a c-type lectin -fold that organizes a putative ligand-binding site that is capable of accommodating  <dig> sequences.
these variable proteins may aid nanoarchaeota and these uncultivated archaea in symbiotic relationships.
our results have uncovered the widespread conservation of the clec-fold in viruses, bacteria, and archaea for accommodating massive sequence variation.
diversity-generating retroelements  provide organisms with a unique means for adaptation to a dynamic environment through massive protein sequence variation.
the structure also enabled identification of a group of avpa-like proteins in multiple putative dgrs from uncultivated archaea.
