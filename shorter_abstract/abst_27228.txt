the pathogens are linked to infant formula; however, they have also been isolated from a wide range of foods and environmental samples.
further characterization using  <dig> chromogenic media  and  <dig> sets of pcr primers detecting its , 16s rrna, zpx, glua, glub, ompa genes followed by nucleotide sequencing of some pcr amplicons did not confirm the identity of all the isolates as none of the methods proved to be free of both false positives or false negatives.
none of the biochemical, chromogenic or pcr primers proved to be a reliable method for confirmation of the identity of the isolates as all of them gave either false positives or false negatives or both.
the final confirmation step was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis identifying only  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates as cronobacter spp.
it is therefore concluded that 16s rrna sequencing is pivotal to confirm the identity of the isolates.
in this study,  <dig> samples of food, infant formula and environment were screened for the presence of cronobacter spp.
among the  <dig> samples of infant food, infant formula, milk powder and non-milk dairy products tested, only one sample of infant food contained cronobacter spp.
our studies showed that cronobacter spp.
twenty nine strains were isolated from samples of spices, herbs, infant foods, and dust obtained from household vacuum cleaners.
are highly diverse and share many phenotypic traits with other enterobacteriaceae members highlighting the need to use several methods to confirm the identity of this pathogen.
