the present study demonstrates three key findings: 1) trace fear memory does not undergo protein synthesis dependent reconsolidation in the pfc, regardless of the intensity of the training, and 2) regardless of whether the memory is recent or remote, and 3) intra-mpfc inhibition of protein synthesis immediately following training impaired remote  memory.
in the present study, we examine whether protein synthesis inhibition in the mpfc following recall similarly results in the observation of reconsolidation of trace fear memory.
one of the differences noted is that not every brain region involved in consolidation exhibits reconsolidation.
in trace fear conditioning, the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex  are required for consolidation of long-term memory.
these results suggest that not all structures that participate in memory storage are involved in reconsolidation.
we have previously demonstrated that trace fear memory is susceptible to infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin into the hippocampus following recall.
