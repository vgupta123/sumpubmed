the upms generally occupy specific positions in the resolved 3-d structures, especially the loop regions on the structural surfaces.
these motifs coincide with the recognition sites for antibodies, as the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antibodies were shown to overlap with the upms.
we have developed a reinforced merging algorithm  with which non-gapped upms were identified in a variety of query protein sequences including members of human ribonuclease a , epidermal growth factor receptor , matrix metalloproteinase , and sma-and-mad related protein families .
members of a protein family often have highly conserved sequences; most of these sequences carry identical biological functions and possess similar three-dimensional  structures.
the ability to identify and localize such upms is paramount in recognizing the characteristic role of each member of a protein family.
our study provides a bioinformatic approach for searching and predicting potential epitopes and interacting motifs that distinguish different members of a protein family.
most of the upms were found to correlate well with the potential antigenic regions predicted by protean.
