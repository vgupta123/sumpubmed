the stimulation by tetrandrine is not affected by incubation with actinomycin d,  <dig> mm kcl, the i chelator,  <dig> -bis  ethane-n,n,n',n',-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethylester  or in the absence of extracellular ca2+.
both tetrandrine and thapsigargin stimulate arachidonic acid release, but based on the different results obtained in the presence of actinomycin d, the i chelator,  <dig> mm kcl and in the absence of extracellular ca2+, the mechanisms leading to this release and pathways leading to apoptosis and/or cancer chemoprevention may be different.
in contrast, stimulation by thapsigargin is inhibited by incubation with actinomycin d,  <dig> mm kcl, bapta/am or in the absence of extracellular ca2+.
the effects of tetrandrine and thapsigargin on arachidonic acid release from human colon carcinoma and rat liver cells and prostacyclin production by rat liver cells are compared in the current studies.
tetrandrine and thapsigargin stimulate arachidonic acid release from human colon carcinoma and rat liver cells and prostacyclin production in rat liver cells.
thapsigargin, however, is a weak tumor promoter in the two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis, yet it can induce apoptosis in androgen-independent prostatic cancer cells.
speculation on the association between its effects on k+ and ca2+ channels and cancer chemoprevention has been made.
i have postulated that arachidonic acid release from cells in culture is associated with cancer chemoprevention.
