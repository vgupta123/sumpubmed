gastric dilatation-volvulus  is a life-threatening condition of mammals, with increased risk in large breed dogs.
time series modeling provided a novel method for evaluating the association between meteorological variables and gdv in a large population of dogs.
this study introduces the binary time series approach to the investigation of the possible meteorological risk factors for gdv.
all of the odds/multiplicative factors of a day being gdv day were interpreted conditionally on the past gdv occurrences.
minimum and maximum daily atmospheric pressure on the day of gdv event and the maximum daily atmospheric pressure on the day before the gdv event were positively associated with the probability of gdv.
appropriate application of this method was enhanced by a common environment for the dogs and availability of meteorological data.
