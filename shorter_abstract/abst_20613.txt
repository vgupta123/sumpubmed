the dystrophin glycoprotein complex is disrupted in duchenne muscular dystrophy and many other neuromuscular diseases.
the principal heterodimeric partner of dystrophin at the heart of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex in the main clinically affected tissues  is its distant relative, α-dystrobrevin.
the choice of isoform is understood, amongst other things, to determine the stoichiometry of syntrophins  in the dystrophin glycoprotein complex.
lineage-specific mutations in the murids mean that the mouse brain has fewer than half of the α-dystrobrevin isoforms found in the human brain.
we show here that, contrary to the literature, most α-dystrobrevin genes, including that of humans, encode three distinct syntrophin-binding sites, rather than two, resulting in a greatly enhanced isoform repertoire.
the α-dystrobrevin gene is subject to complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, generating a substantial range of isoforms by alternative promoter use, alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing.
our finding that there are likely to be fundamental functional differences between the α-dystrobrevins  of mice and humans raises questions about the current use of the mouse as the principal model animal for studying duchenne muscular dystrophy and other related disorders, especially the neurological aspects thereof.
