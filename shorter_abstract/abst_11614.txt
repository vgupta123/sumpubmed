to generate the analyzed amino acid and nucleotide data sets, we sequenced the chloroplast dnas  of  <dig> chlorophycean taxa; these included representatives from  <dig> of the  <dig> primary clades previously recognized in the chlamydomonadales, two taxa from a coccoid lineage  that was suspected to be sister to the golenkiniaceae, and two sphaeroplealeans.
using bayesian and/or maximum likelihood inference methods, we analyzed an amino acid data set that was assembled from  <dig> cpdna-encoded proteins of  <dig> core chlorophyte , as well as two nucleotide data sets that were generated from the  <dig> genes coding for these proteins and  <dig> rna-coding genes.
within the chlamydomonadales,  <dig> taxa formed an assemblage of five major clades/lineages.
although studies based on the nuclear 18s rrna gene or a few combined genes have shed light on the diversity and phylogenetic structure of the chlamydomonadales, the positions of many of the monophyletic groups identified remain uncertain.
to our surprise, the jenufa species and the two spine-bearing green algae belonging to the golenkinia and treubaria genera were recovered in a highly supported monophyletic group that also included three taxa representing distinct families of the sphaeropleales .
the class chlorophyceae  includes morphologically and ecologically diverse green algae.
the earliest-diverging clade displayed hafniomonas laevis and the crucicarteria, and was followed by the radicarteria and then by the chloromonadinia.
here, we used a chloroplast phylogenomic approach to delineate the relationships among these lineages.
