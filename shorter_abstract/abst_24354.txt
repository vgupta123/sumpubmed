the escherichia coli response regulator narl controls transcription of genes involved in nitrate respiration during anaerobiosis.
a footprint assay demonstrated that the narl od only partially bound recognition sites at the narg promoter, and the binding affinity was increased by the presence of the phosphorylated rd.
analytical ultracentrifugation used to examine domain oligomerization showed that the narl rd forms dimers in solution while the od is monomeric.
the od alone could not activate narg-lacz expression; this activity required the presence of the narl rd.
the data also imply that narl phosphorylation results in rd dimerization and in the separation of the entire linker region from the od.
these in vivo expression assays revealed that the narl od, in the absence or presence of linker helix Î± <dig>  constitutively repressed frda-lacz expression regardless of nitrate availability.
the narl rd operates as an on-off switch to occlude or release the od in a nitrate-responsive manner, but has additional roles to directly stimulate transcription at promoters for which the od lacks independent function.
narl consists of two domains joined by a linker that wraps around the interdomain interface.
phosphorylation of the narl n-terminal receiver domain  releases the, otherwise sequestered, c-terminal output domain  that subsequently binds specific dna promoter sites to repress or activate gene expression.
narl od constructs containing different linker segments were examined for their ability to repress frda-lacz or activate narg-lacz reporter fusion genes.
the aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which the narl od and rd function independently to regulate transcription, and the affect of the linker on od function.
