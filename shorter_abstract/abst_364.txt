this issue has not been well addressed in literature, especially in the situation when the permutation procedure is necessary for p-value calculation.
in practice, it is usually necessary to calculate p-value by a permutation procedure.
q-value is a widely used statistical method for estimating false discovery rate , which is a conventional significance measure in the analysis of genome-wide expression data.
we proposed a statistical method for the conservative adjustment of q-value.
we have demonstrated the importance of conservative adjustment of q-value, particularly in the situation that the proportion of differentially expressed genes is small or the overall differential expression signal is weak.
