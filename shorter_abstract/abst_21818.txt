the eye morphology of nocturnal reef teleosts is characterized by a syndrome that indicates better light sensitivity, including large relative eye size, high optical ratio and large, rounded pupils.
the trade-off between improved dim-light vision and reduced optical diversity may be a key factor in explaining the lower trophic diversity of nocturnal reef teleosts.
diurnal teleost reef fish, released from the stringent functional requirements of dim-light vision have much higher morphological and optical diversity than nocturnal species, with large ranges of optical ratio, depth of focus, and lens accommodation.
both teleost reef fish and terrestrial amniotes meet the functional requirements of dim-light vision with a similar evolutionary response of morphological and optical modifications.
diel activity pattern is the main mechanism controlling the visual environment of teleost reef fish, with day-active  fish active in well-illuminated conditions, whereas night-active  fish cope with dim light.
we analyzed a large comparative dataset on morphological traits of the eyes in  <dig> species of teleost reef fish in  <dig> different families.
ambient light levels are often considered to drive the evolution of eye form and function.
physiological optics predicts several specific evolutionary responses to dim-light vision that should be reflected in visual performance features of the eye.
physical characteristics of the environment are an important factor in the evolution and diversification of the vertebrate eye.
