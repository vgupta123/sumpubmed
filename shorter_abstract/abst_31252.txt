by modeling the joint distribution of the samples that have been profiled across all time points, we gain sensitivity compared to a marginal analysis that examines each time point in isolation.
based on results from theory, simulated data, and application to the genomic data presented here, we show that betr has increased power to detect subtle differential expression in time-series data.
most commonly used methods for identifying differentially expressed genes treat each time point as independent and ignore important correlations, including those within samples and between sampling times.
we present a flexible random-effects model that takes such correlations into account, improving our ability to detect genes that have sustained differential expression over more than one time point.
we assign each gene a probability of differential expression using an empirical bayes approach that reduces the effective number of parameters to be estimated.
