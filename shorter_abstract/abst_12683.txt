the aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates from hospitalised diarrhoeal patients in zhejiang province, china.
in an active surveillance of enteric pathogens in hospitalised diarrhoeal patients, nine non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates were identified from  <dig> diarrhoeal stool samples at a rate of  <dig> %.
a single st, st <dig>  was predominant which persisted over several years in different cities and caused two outbreaks in recent years.
none of the isolates carried the cholera toxin genes or toxin co-regulated pilus genes but the majority carried a type iii secretion system as the key virulence factor.
these isolates and an additional  <dig> isolates from sporadic cases and three outbreaks were analysed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing .
non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae is an important contributor to diarrhoeal infections in china.
continuous surveillance of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae is important for control and prevention of diarrhoeal infections.

antibiotic resistance varied with the majority of the isolates resistant to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and nearly all isolates either resistant or intermediate to erythromycin and rifampicin.
