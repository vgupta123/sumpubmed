the phylogenetic analysis of mammalian ppp1r <dig> and related pseudogenes suggested that ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> retroposons appeared before the great mammalian radiation, while the remaining pseudogenes are primate-specific and retroposed at different times during primate evolution.
given the role of ppp1r <dig> in sperm motility, the presence of these proteins was assessed in human sperm, and two ppp1r2-related proteins were detected, ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  signatures of negative and positive selection were also detected in ppp1r2p <dig>  further suggesting a role as a functional protein.
the results show that contrary to initial observations ppp1r2-related pseudogenes are not simple bystanders of the evolutionary process but may rather be at the origin of genes with novel functions.
