model organisms in laboratory settings form the basis for the assignment of gene function, and the ecological context of gene function is lacking.
in turn we predict that morphology and expressed genes promote burst swimming in riverine sockeye and continuous swimming in lake-type sockeye.
this study provides a framework for understanding sockeye life history from a transcriptomic perspective and a starting point for more extensive, targeted studies determining the ecological context of genes.
there are a growing number of genomes sequenced with tentative functions assigned to a large proportion of the individual genes.
we compared morphology and gene expression in natural juvenile sockeye populations related to river and lake habitats.
gene expression patterns were measured using a 16k microarray, discovering  <dig> genes with significant differential expression.
we found the riverine sockeye population had deep, robust bodies and lake-type had shallow, streamlined bodies.
