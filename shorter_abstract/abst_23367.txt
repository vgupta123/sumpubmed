this then led to the activation of a restricted subset of transcription factors, with the consequent induction of genes primarily involved in the cell death pathway.
engagement of the antigen receptor on immature b-lymphocytes leads to cell cycle arrest, and subsequent apoptosis.
finally, integration of these results into a mathematical model provided further substantiation to the novel finding that the ground state of the intracellular signaling machinery constitutes an important determinant of the outcome of receptor-induced cellular responses.
this is an essential process for eliminating self reactive b cells during its different stages of development.
our results identify the global events leading to the g <dig> arrest and subsequent apoptosis in immature b cells upon receptor activation.
here we employed a systems biology approach that combined extensive experimentation with in silico methodologies to chart the network of receptor-activated pathways that mediated the arrest of immature b cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle.
subsequent experiments revealed that the weak initiation of intracellular signaling pathways derived from desensitization of the receptor-proximal protein tyrosine kinase lyn, to receptor-dependent activation.
