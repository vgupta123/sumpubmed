analyzing interaction networks for functional characterization poses significant challenges arising from the noisy, incomplete, and generic nature of both the interaction data as well as functional annotation of molecules.
we also propose novel measures of topological proximity that are more robust to noisy and incomplete interaction data.
we derive the following results in this paper:  there exists strong correlation between functional similarity and topological proximity in various network abstractions, with domain interaction networks  demonstrating higher correlation than protein interaction networks ;  measures that quantify coherence among entire sets of proteins are superior to aggregates of known pair-wise measures; and  random-walk based measures of topological proximity are better suited to existing interaction data.
in this paper we perform a formal comparative investigation of the relationship between functional coherence and topological proximity in networks.
