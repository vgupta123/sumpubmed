these findings demonstrate that tg <dig> mice propagate prions of caprine origin and provide a suitable baseline for examination of samples identified in the expanded us caprine scrapie surveillance program.
a suitable rodent model for examining the effect of caprine scrapie isolates in the ovine host will be useful in the ovine scrapie eradication effort.
the united states control program for classical ovine scrapie is based in part on the finding that infection is typically spread through exposure to shed placentas from infected ewes.
in this study, we describe the incubation time, brain lesion profile, glycoform pattern and prpsc distribution patterns in a well characterized transgenic mouse line  expressing the ovine vrq prion allele, following inoculation with brain from scrapie infected goats.
first passage incubation times of caprine tissue in tg <dig> ovinized mice varied widely but second passage intervals were shorter and consistent.
