our findings suggest that chick gastrointestinal tracts are colonised by many transient species and that bacterial assemblages gradually transition to a more stable adult state.
these data provide the framework for future studies targeting the causes and consequences of variation in bacterial assemblages in wild birds.
phenotypic differences between chicks and adults may lead to these strong differences in bacterial communities.
we characterised the cloacal bacteria assemblages of chicks and adults in a natural population of black-legged kittiwakes , using molecular methods.
however, changes in microbial community structure with host age remain poorly understood.
