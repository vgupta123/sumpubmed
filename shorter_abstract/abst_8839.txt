the extracellular domain of kit is obtained in the spermatogonia stage, but the intracellular domain  is constantly expressed in both sscs and spermatogonia.
there are dynamic transcription and translation changes of c-kit before and after sscs’ anticipated differentiation and most importantly, ra is a significant upstream regulatory factor for c-kit expression.
the long transcripts include the full-length canonical c-kit transcript and the 3′ end short transcript.
short transcripts include the  <dig>  kb short transcript and several truncated transcripts .
this study aims to reveal and compare c-kit expression profiles in the sscs before and after the anticipated differentiation, as well as to examine its relationship with retinoic acid  stimulation.
the c-kit expression profiles in the testis and the spermatogonial stem cell lines vary after ra stimulation.
it has been proven that c-kit is crucial for proliferation, migration, survival and maturation of spermatogenic cells.
we have found that there are more than  <dig> transcripts of c-kit expressed in the cell lines and in the testes.
