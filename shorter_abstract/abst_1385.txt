antimicrobial peptides  have been proposed as a new compounds suitable for plant disease control.
fire blight is an important disease affecting rosaceous plants.
we expected that the combination of bp <dig> with lysozyme may produce a synergistic effect, enhancing its activity and reducing the effective concentration needed for fire blight control.

the causal agent is the bacteria erwinia amylovora which is poorly controlled with the use of conventional bactericides and biopesticides.
the combination of bp <dig> with lysozyme showed synergism on the bactericidal activity against e. amylovora and provide the basis for developing better formulations of antibacterial peptides for plant protection.
combination of bp <dig> with lysozyme reduced the time required to achieve cell death and the minimal inhibitory concentration , and increased the activity of bp <dig> in the presence of leaf extracts even when the peptide was applied at low doses.
the combination of a synhetic multifunctional undecapeptide  with lysozyme produces a synergistic effect.
the results obtained in vitro were confirmed in leaf infection bioassays.
bp <dig>  a synthetic linear undecapeptide , has been reported to be effective against e. amylovora infections.
we showed a significant increase of the antimicrobial activity against e. amylovora that was associated to the increase of cell membrane damage and to the reduction of cell metabolism.
moreover, bp <dig> showed bacteriolytic activity, moderate susceptibility to protease degradation and low toxicity.
