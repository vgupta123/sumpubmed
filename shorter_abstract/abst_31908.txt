pyruvate kinase  catalyzes the generation of pyruvate and atp in glycolysis and functions as a key switch in the regulation of carbon flux distribution.
corynebacterium glutamicum is an industrial workhorse for the production of various amino acids and organic acids.
fed-batch fermentation of the pyk2-overexpressing wtΔpyk <dig> strain produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of lactic acid, which was a 47% increase compared to the parent strain under oxygen deprivation.
here, we identified that ncgl <dig> was a novel pyruvate kinase  in c. glutamicum.
furthermore, pyk <dig> and ldha, which encodes l-lactate dehydrogenase, were co-transcribed as a bicistronic mrna under aerobic conditions and pyk <dig> deficiency had a slight effect on the intracellular activity of pyk.
however, the mrna level of pyk <dig> in the wild-type strain under oxygen deprivation was  <dig> -fold higher than that under aerobic conditions.
pyk <dig> functioned as a pyruvate kinase and contributed to the increased level of pyk activity under oxygen deprivation.
under oxygen deprivation, pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> deficiency decreased the generation of lactic acid, and the overexpression of either pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> increased the production of lactic acid as the activity of pyk increased.
although c. glutamicum was assumed to possess only one pyk , ncgl <dig> was annotated as a pyruvate kinase with an unknown role.

the catalytic activity of pyk <dig> was allosterically regulated by fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate  activation and atp inhibition.
