our results indicated the time to the most recent common ancestors of common minke whales to be about  <dig>   million years ago.
further, we found that genes associated with epilation and tooth-development showed signatures of positive selection, supporting the morphological uniqueness of whales.

we present four common minke whale  genomes with depth of ×13 ~ × <dig> coverage and perform resequencing technology without a reference sequence.
the transition from land to water has led to various aquatic specializations related to hairless skin and ability to regulate their body temperature in cold water.
