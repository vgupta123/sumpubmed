to investigate the mechanisms of target gene regulation by human estrogen receptor α , we combine extensive location and expression datasets with genomic sequence analysis.
our results support the model of long-range interactions of herα with the promoter-bound cofactor sp <dig> residing at the promoter of herα target genes.
finally we integrate these multiple datasets to define a high confidence set of primary herα target genes.
the localization of chip-chip sites relative to annotated genes shows that weak sites are enriched near transcription start sites, while stronger sites show no positional bias.
we find that strong chip-chip sites co-localize with strong herα consensus sites and detect nucleotide bias near herα sites.
the study of fox and sp <dig> cofactor sites near herα chip sites shows that induced genes frequently have fox or sp <dig> sites.
in particular, we study the influence of patterns of dna occupancy by herα on expression phenotypes.
assessing the relationship between binding configurations and expression phenotypes, we find binding sites downstream of the transcription start site  to be equally good or better predictors of herα-mediated expression as upstream sites.
fox motifs co-occur with herα motifs along responsive genes.
