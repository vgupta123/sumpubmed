this method allowed rapid examination of multiple candidate genes and found phenotypic differences apparently associated with variation in sp_ <dig>  a rela/ spot homolog  involved in the stringent response.
understanding genetic determinants of a microbial phenotype generally involves creating and comparing isogenic strains differing at the locus of interest, but the naturally existing genomic and phenotypic diversity of microbial populations has rarely been exploited.
here we report use of a diverse collection of  <dig> carriage isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and their genome sequences to help identify a novel determinant of pneumococcal colonization.
these results indicate that analysis of naturally existing genomic diversity complements traditional genetics approaches to accelerate genotype-phenotype analysis.
using a similar strategy, variation in another rsh gene  was found to alter resistance to neutrophil-killing.
to establish causality, the alleles corresponding to sp_ <dig> were switched between the tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig>  the wild-type sp_ <dig> conferred higher resistance to neutrophil-killing and competitiveness in mouse colonization.
