we performed next generation sequencing using illumina miseq technology on the dsm <dig> strain of clostridium autoethanogenum and observed  <dig> single nucleotide discrepancies when compared to the published finished sequence , with  <dig>  % present in coding regions.
we present a revised manually curated full genome sequence for clostridium autoethanogenum dsm <dig>  which provides reliable information for genome-scale models that rely heavily on the accuracy of annotation, and represents an important step towards the manipulation and metabolic modelling of this industrially relevant acetogen.
as a result, different functions were assigned to gene products or previous functional annotations rejected because of missing evidence in various occasions.
clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium capable of producing high value commodity chemicals and biofuels from the c <dig> gases present in synthesis gas.

however, crucial to metabolic modelling and directed pathway engineering is a reliable and comprehensively annotated genome sequence.
this was corroborated by the observation that over 90 % occurred within homopolymer regions of greater than  <dig> nucleotides in length.
