for sustainable production of second generation biofuels and other products of industrial biotechnology, efficient degradation of non-edible plant polysaccharides such as hemicellulose is required.
applying this network-based approach, we provide the first genome-scale characterization of all genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes identified in a. niger.
combination of this information network with gene expression analysis on mono- and polysaccharide substrates has allowed elucidation of concerted gene expression from this organism.
the mapping of plant polysaccharide structures along with the corresponding enzymatic activities is a powerful framework for expression analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes.
through the compilation of information from  <dig> articles, we have systematized knowledge on the structure and degradation of  <dig> major types of plant polysaccharides to form a graphical overview.
as a case example, we have combined this with a list of  <dig> genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes from aspergillus niger, thus forming an analysis framework, which can be queried.
one such example is the identification of a full set of extracellular polysaccharide-acting genes for the degradation of oat spelt xylan.
