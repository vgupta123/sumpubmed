accurate analyses of comprehensive genome-wide snp genotyping and gene expression data sets is challenging for many researchers.
in addition, snpexpress allows concurrent interpretation of these items with hidden-markov model  inferred loss-of-heterozygosity - and copy number regions.
we present snpexpress, a software tool to accurately analyze affymetrix and illumina snp genotype calls, copy numbers, polymorphic copy number variations  and affymetrix gene expression in a combinatorial and efficient way.
in fact, obtaining an integrated view of both large scale snp genotyping and gene expression is currently complicated since only a limited number of appropriate software tools are available.
