we describe the crystal structure of the human dysferlin inner dysf domain with a resolution of  <dig>  Ã…ngstroms.
dysferlin is a type two-anchored membrane protein, with a single c terminal trans-membrane helix, and most of the protein lying in cytoplasm.
dysferlin contains several c <dig> domains and two dysf domains which are nested one inside the other.
the high resolution structure of the dysferlin dysf domain gives a template on which to interpret in detail the pathogenic mutations that lead to disease.
mutations in dysferlin, the first protein linked with the cell membrane repair mechanism, causes a group of muscular dystrophies called dysferlinopathies.
the high resolution of the structure show that these interactions are a mixture of parallel ring/guanadinium stacking, perpendicular h bond stacking and aliphatic chain packing.
