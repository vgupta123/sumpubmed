optimized in situ purification of his-tagged recombinant proteins has the potential to become the new gold standard for cost-effective generation of high-quality and high-density protein microarrays.
using peg-coated chelated cu2+ slides, consistently higher purities of recombinant proteins were measured.
an optimized platform for in situ protein purification on microarray slides using his-tagged recombinant proteins is a desirable tool for the screening of novel protein functions and protein-protein interactions.
two slide surfaces were examined, chelated cu2+ slides suspended on a polyethylene glycol  coating and chelated ni2+ slides immobilized on a support without peg coating.
we identified several antigens among the in situ-purified proteins via assays with anti-s. pneumoniae rabbit antibodies and a human patient antiserum, as a demonstration project of large scale microarray-based immunoproteomics profiling.
hexa-histidine is one of the most commonly used fusion tags for protein expression due to its small size and convenient purification via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography .
we established methods to determine the level of purification of such proteins on metal chelate-modified slide surfaces.
