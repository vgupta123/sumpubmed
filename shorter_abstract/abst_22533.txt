many fish alter their expressed visual pigments during development.
in situ hybridisation revealed that glass eels express only rh <dig> opsin in their cone photoreceptors, while larger yellow eels continue to express rh <dig> opsin in the majority of their cones, but also have <5% of cones which express sws <dig> opsin.
silver eels showed the same expression pattern as the larger yellow eels.
the rh <dig> and sws <dig> opsin sequences from the european eel were isolated, sequenced and expressed in vitro for an accurate measurement of their Î»max values.
eels are known to change the expression of their rod opsins as they mature, but might they also change the expression of their cone opsins?
larger yellow and silver european eels express two different cone opsins, rh <dig> and sws <dig>  this work demonstrates that only the rh <dig> cone opsin is present in younger fish , the sws <dig> opsin being expressed additionally only by older fish and only in <5% of cone cells.
