furthermore, the percentage of variants that had high values  for another three measures  were  <dig>  for gatk .
second, we assessed the imputation accuracy  when imputing from high density snp array data to whole-genome sequence using data from around  <dig> individuals from six different generations.
with all imputation programs, correlation between original and imputed genotypes was > <dig>  on average with randomly masked  <dig> snps from the snp array and > <dig>  for a leave-one-out cross-validation within sequenced individuals.
genotype concordance  defined as the proportion of individuals whose array-derived genotypes are the same as the sequence-derived genotypes over all non-missing snps on the array were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  .
fimpute performed slightly worse than minimac and impute <dig> in terms of genotype correlation, especially for snps with low minor allele frequency, while it had lowest numbers in mendelian conflicts in available father-progeny pairs.
several variant callers based on different algorithms have emerged and have made it possible to extract single nucleotide polymorphisms  out of the whole-genome sequence.
first, we compared the sets of variants detected with different variant callers, namely gatk, freebayes and samtools, and checked the quality of genotypes of the called variants in a set of  <dig> fully sequenced white and brown layers.
performance of all variant callers studied was very good in general, particularly for gatk and samtools.

the technical progress in the last decade has made it possible to sequence millions of dna reads in a relatively short time frame.
three different imputation programs  were checked in different validation scenarios.
