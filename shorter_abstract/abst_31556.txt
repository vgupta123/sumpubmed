this expression pattern strongly differs from the spatiotemporal expression of other ameloblast-secreted scpps, such as the enamel matrix proteins .
we showed that  amtn is tooth  specific and underwent pseudogenization in toothless turtles and birds, and  the amtn structure changed during tetrapod evolution.
its functions were conserved in amphibians and sauropsids while a change occurred early in the mammalian lineage, modifying its expression pattern during amelogenesis and its gene structure.
we found that amtn is expressed throughout amelogenesis in non-mammalian tetrapods, in contrast to its expression limited to enamel maturation in rodents.
in rodents, amtn is expressed during the maturation stage of amelogenesis only.
to infer amtn function, we studied spatiotemporal expression of amtn during amelogenesis in a salamander and a lizard, and compared the results with available expression data from mouse.
