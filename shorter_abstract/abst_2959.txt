comparison of the diplogastrid phylogeny to a comprehensive beetle phylogeny revealed no major congruence and thus no evidence for a long-term coevolution.
the diplogastridae, a monophyletic clade within the rhabditid nematodes, are frequently associated with beetles.
a molecular phylogeny of beetle-associated diplogastrid nematodes was established by various algorithms.
comparison of nematode and beetle phylogenies provides, however, no evidence for long-term coevolution of diplogastrid nematodes and their beetle hosts.
the stem species of the diplogastridae existed at the same time period when the major radiations of the beetles occurred.
the molecular phylogeny of the diplogastridae provides a framework for further examinations of the evolution of these associations, for the study of interactions within the ecosystems, and for investigations of diplogastrid genome evolution.
pristionchus pacificus of the family of the diplogastridae has been developed as a satellite model for comparison to c. elegans.
as a prerequisite to answering this question a robust phylogeny of beetle-associated diplogastridae is needed.
reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of beetle-associated diplogastridae yields four distinct subclades, whose deep phylogenetic divergence, as indicated by short internal branch lengths, shows evidence for evolution by successions of ancient rapid radiation events.
