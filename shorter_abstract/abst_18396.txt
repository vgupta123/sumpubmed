these findings were further supported by gene set enrichment analysis.
while arsenic and cadmium are well known to cause adverse health effects at high doses, the molecular impact resulting from exposure to environmentally relevant doses of these metals remains largely unexplored.
these results highlight that even at low levels of exposure both metals can dramatically influence the expression of important cellular pathways.
this study is the first to compare the transcriptional responses induced by low dose exposure to cadmium and arsenic in human lymphoblastoid cells.
