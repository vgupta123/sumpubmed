in this work, we studied genome organization divergence taking into account the contribution of both genome order rearrangements and genome content dynamics.
a complete picture about genome organization evolution therefore requires to account for both kinds of events.
in a first part of the paper, we fit a measure of backbone gene order conservation  against phylogenetic distance for over  <dig> genome comparisons, improving existing models for the divergence in time of backbone stability.
in a second part of the text, we show that in pathogens, gene content dynamics  have a much more dramatic effect on genome organization stability than backbone rearrangements.
by studying species with multiple sequenced genomes available, we were able to explore genome organization stability at different time-scales and to find significant differences for pathogen and non-pathogen species.
the output of our framework also allows to identify the conserved gene clusters and/or partial occurrences thereof, making possible to explore how gene clusters assembled during evolution.
intra- and inter-specific comparisons were treated separately to focus on different time-scales.
we developed an approach where we model chromosomes as graphs on which we compute different stability estimators; we consider genome rearrangements as well as the effect of gene insertions and deletions.
two kinds of events affect genome organization: on one hand translocations and recombinations change the relative position of genes shared by two genomes ; on the other, insertions and deletions leave the backbone gene order unchanged but they alter the gene neighborhoods by breaking the syntenic regions.
the use of multiple genomes of a same species allowed to identify genomes with diverging gene order with respect to their conspecific.
the inter-species analysis indicates that pathogens are more often unstable with respect to non-pathogens.
