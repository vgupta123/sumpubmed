in vitro stimulation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  and blood leukocytes with a. pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, pma and lps led to production of different amounts of h2o <dig>  no and tnf-α, depending on the stimulus, individual, breed and time of infection.
in the present study we characterized and compared in vitro and in vivo activation of immune markers of different pig breeds  <dig> days before, and  <dig> and  <dig> days after an experimental aerosol infection with actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae.
moreover, results showed different correlation grades between the immune markers produced in vitro or in vivo and the clinical manifestations.
our findings revealed differences in the activation of the immune markers with respect to infection time, individuals and breeds.
in plasma and balf tnf-α could not be detected, whereas variable levels of ifn-γ were found at pre- and post-infection times.
h2o <dig>  plasma haptoglobin and balf ifn-γ for german landrace pigs.
further analyses will have to show whether these markers may serve as correlates of protection against porcine respiratory infections.
in pigs little is known about the role of innate immune defence in bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, despite their major role in pig production.
plasma haptoglobin levels mirrored the clinical manifestations at  <dig> days post-infection.
the different expression levels in individuals within the breeds correlated for some markers with the severity of clinical manifestations, e.g.
generally, significant responses to in vitro stimulation were observed only in blood leukocytes, whereas the alveolar macrophages showed a high basal activation.
il- <dig> was found in some plasma but in none of the balf samples.
