it holds the promise to achieve continuing improvement whenever better training data that contain additional verified or high confidence positive targets and properly selected negative targets are available.
micrornas  are single-stranded non-coding rnas known to regulate a wide range of cellular processes by silencing the gene expression at the protein and/or mrna levels.
a comprehensive training data set is constructed for mammalian mirnas with its positive targets obtained from the most up-to-date mirna target depository called mirecords and its negative targets derived from  <dig> microarray data.
svmicro is shown to be able to achieve robust performance.
all the related materials including source code and genome-wide prediction of human targets are available at http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/svmicro.html.
constructing a richer and more reliable training data set and developing an algorithm that properly exploits this data set would be the key to improve the performance current prediction algorithms.
comprehensive evaluation of svmicro performance has been carried out on the training data, proteomics data, and immunoprecipitation  pull-down data.
computational prediction of mirna targets is essential for elucidating the detailed functions of mirna.
comparisons with some popular algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction specificity, sensitivity and precision in all tested cases.
