tunel assay and qrt-pcr showed h2o <dig> induced apoptosis and up-regulated mir- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner in rgc- <dig> cells.
conversely, lentiviral-mediated mir- <dig> down-regulation protected h2o <dig> induced apoptosis, promoted neurite growth and activated akt/erk and trkb pathways through phosphorylation.
in the present study, we investigated the protective effect of mircorna  <dig>  against oxidative stress induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells.
luciferase assay confirmed that igf1r was directly regulated by mir- <dig> in rgc- <dig> cells, and sirna-mediated igf1r knockdown activated akt protein through phosphorylation, down-regulated mir- <dig>  therefore exerted a protective effect on rgc- <dig> apoptosis.
rat rgc- <dig> cells were cultured in plates and h2o <dig> was added to induce oxidative stress.
