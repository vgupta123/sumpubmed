here we present a case in which difficulties in ascertaining the organellar mtdna sequence from modern samples hindered their comparison to ancient dna sequences.
in specific taxa, due to nuclear insertions some regions of the mitochondrial genome may not be useful for the characterization of modern or ancient dna.
using the same pcr primers applied to the ancient specimens and the primers used to generate the modern muskox dna sequences in a previous study, we failed to definitively identify the organellar sequence from the two modern muskox samples tested.
sequencing individual clones of a > <dig> kb pcr fragment from modern samples did not alleviate the problem as there was not a consistent match across the entire length of the sequences to ovibos when compared to sequences in genbank.
nuclear insertions of mitochondrial sequences  have been identified in a wide variety of organisms.
this presents both opportunities and challenges for forensics, population genetics, evolutionary genetics, conservation biology and the study of dna from ancient samples.
we obtained mitochondrial hypervariable region  sequences from six ancient samples of tundra muskox  that were reproducible but distinct from modern muskox sequences reported previously.
