we aimed to identify the target proteins modulated by the long-term consumption of four diets differing in the quality and quantity of lipids in the whole proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
metabolic syndrome is a multi-component disorder associated to a high risk of cardiovascular disease.
the long-term consumption of hsfa, compared to hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig>  seems to increase the cardiovascular disease  risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, and seem lead to dna damage as a consequence of high oxidative stress.
its etiology is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including dietary habits.
the hsfa diet induced the expression of proteins responding to oxidative stress, degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and dna repair.
however, hmufa, lfhcc and lfhcc n- <dig> diets down-regulated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress-related proteins and dna repairing proteins.
a randomized, controlled trial conducted within the lipgene study assigned  <dig> mets patients for 12 weeks each to  <dig> of  <dig> diets: a) high-saturated fatty acid , b) high-monounsaturated fatty acid , c) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with placebo  and d) low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets supplemented with long chain  n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  .

we analyzed the changes induced in the proteome of both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of pbmc using 2-d proteomic analysis.
sixty-seven proteins were differentially expressed after the long-term consumption of the four diets.
