wrky group iii tfs could interact with other proteins by binding to cis elements existing in the promoter regions of other genes to regulate pathogen-related gene expression.
positive and negative expression patterns showed that wrky group iii genes could also respond to tylcv infection in tomato.
quantitative real-time–polymerase chain reaction  and vigs analyses demonstrated that group iii genes served as positive and negative regulators in tomato–tylcv interaction.
subcellular localization analysis indicated that solywrky <dig> and solywrky <dig> were nuclear proteins in vivo.
transmitted by the whitefly bemisia tabaci, tomato yellow leaf curly virus  has posed serious threats to plant growth and development.
interaction network analysis revealed that group iii tfs could interact with other proteins, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and isochorismate synthase , to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses.
plant innate immune systems against various threats involve wrky group iii transcription factors .
in this study,  <dig> wrky group iii tfs  were identified, and these tfs responded to tylcv infection.
in the present study,  <dig> wrky group iii tfs in tomato were identified to respond to tylcv infection.
many elements, including w-box, were found in the promoter region of group iii tfs.
