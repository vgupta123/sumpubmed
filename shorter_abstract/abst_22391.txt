we modify the original feature selection algorithms to use pre-evaluation information.
experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method improved the quality of the feature subset produced by modified feature selection algorithms.
feature selection or feature subset selection provides a sub-optimal solution within a reasonable amount of time.
thus, it is necessary to select a small number of novel features to characterize the entire dataset.
the feature subset should be improved by using the top ranking pairs for two features in the selection process.
all combinations of the features subset must be evaluated to produce an ideal feature subset, but this is impossible using currently available computing power.
