re-expression of just one licpa allele  was sufficient to complement the reduced infectivity of both Δlicpa mutants for human macrophages, which confirms the importance of licpa for l. infantum virulence.
research has been hampered by the lack of good laboratory models and tools for genetic manipulation.
we found that jpcm <dig> has attributes that make it an excellent laboratory model; different stages of the parasite life cycle can be studied in vitro, it is accessible to genetic manipulation and it has retained its virulence.
licpa was found to share a high percentage of amino acid identity with cpa proteins of other leishmania species.
visceral leishmaniasis caused by members of the leishmania donovani complex is often fatal in the absence of treatment.
in contrast, in vivo experiments did not show any virulence recovery of the re-expressor clone Δlicpac1::cpa compared with the cpa-deficient mutant Δlicpac <dig>
further studies will be necessary to elucidate the precise roles that licpa plays and why the re-expression of licpa in the Δlicpa mutants complemented the gene deletion phenotype only in in vitro and not in in vivo infection of hamsters.
in this study, we have characterised a l. infantum line  that was isolated from a naturally infected dog and then cloned.
the data suggest that cpa is not essential for replication of l. infantum promastigotes, but is important for the host-parasite interaction.
