a mouse with exon  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb transcript gt resulted in hypomorphic expression of dlc <dig> protein and an embryonic lethal phenotype in the homozygous condition, which indicates that this isoform plays a major role in mouse development.
the mouse has three major transcriptional isoforms of the dlc <dig> gene that are differentially expressed in various tissues.
extensive 3' race experiments were carried out in order to identify all possible dlc <dig> isoforms and splice variants in the mouse.
in addition, we have generated a gene trapped mouse that targets one of these isoforms in order to study its biological function.
also, differences in the number of isoforms and splice variants reported still exist between different mammalian species.
cultured serum-free mouse embryo cells from dlc <dig> deficient embryos had elevated rhoa activity and displayed alterations in the organization of actin filaments and focal adhesions.
several transcriptional isoforms have been described but the functional significance and tissue distribution of each form is presently poorly understood.
the dlc <dig> deficient cells showed altered cytoskeleton structure, increased rhoa activity and cellular migration.
the effect of this gene trap insertion on the splicing of other isoforms has also been studied.
dlc1gt/gt embryos showed defects in the brain, heart, and placental blood vessels.
mice heterozygous for the gene trapped allele were phenotypically normal, but homozygous mutant embryos did not survive beyond  <dig>  days post coitum.
a gene trapped embryonic cell line, with an insertion between exon  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig>  kb transcriptional isoform, was used to generate a transgenic mouse.
