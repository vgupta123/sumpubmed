automated information extraction from biomedical literature is important because a vast amount of biomedical literature has been published.
we developed an automated recognition system based on the svm algorithm and evaluated it in task  <dig> a of biocreative, a competition for automated gene/protein name recognition.
we investigated and evaluated the effect of these features as well as the effect of tuning the parameters of the svm algorithm.
this supports the fact that the svm algorithm is robust on the high dimensionality of the feature vector space and means that feature selection is not required.
during svm learning, each feature alone had a marginally positive effect on system performance.
