possible relationships between te diversity  and genome size have not been investigated to date, though there are reasons to expect either a positive or a negative correlation.
this study compares data from  <dig> species of animals, plants, fungi, and “protists” to determine whether te diversity at the superfamily level is related to genome size.
no simple relationship was found between te diversity and genome size.
some te superfamilies tend to be present across all major groups of eukaryotes, but there is considerable variance in te diversity in different taxa.
differences in genome size are thought to arise primarily through accumulation of tes, but beyond a certain point , te diversity does not increase with genome size.
there is no significant correlation across all eukaryotes, but there is a positive correlation for genomes below 500mbp and a negative correlation among land plants.
the genomes of eukaryotes vary enormously in size, with much of this diversity driven by differences in the abundances of transposable elements .
there is also substantial structural and phylogenetic diversity among tes, such that they can be classified into distinct classes, superfamilies, and families.
