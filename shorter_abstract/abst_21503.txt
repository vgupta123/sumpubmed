they frequently contain c-type lectin domains, pkd repeats, a rej domain, a gps domain, a plat/lh <dig> domain, 1â€“ <dig> transmembrane segments and a c-terminal coiled-coil domain.
the study of individual pkd <dig> proteins will increase our knowledge of the importance of this gene family.
humans have five hpkd <dig> proteins, whereas sea urchins have  <dig>  the pkd <dig> proteins of the sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, are referred to as the receptor for egg jelly, or sprej proteins.
the sea urchin genome is one-fourth the size of the human genome, but sea urchins have  <dig> sprej proteins, whereas humans have five.
sea urchins are basal deuterostomes, the line of evolution leading to the vertebrates.
the sprej proteins form a subfamily within the pkd <dig> family.
except for sprej <dig> and  <dig>  that are thought to be associated with the sperm acrosome reaction, the functions of the other sprej proteins remain unknown.
possession of a rej domain of about  <dig> residues defines this family.
all  <dig> sprejs are transcribed in either embryos or adult tissues.
adult tissues show tissue-specific patterns of sprej expression.
mutations in the human polycystic kidney disease- <dig>  gene result in ~85% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most frequent human monogenic disease.
the secondary structures of their deduced proteins were predicted and compared to the five human hpkd <dig> proteins.
