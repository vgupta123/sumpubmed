milk chemoattractants are potentially involved in the recruitment of lymphocytes from the maternal bloodstream in lactating mammary glands.
normal mammary gland contains an extravascular population of b lymphoblasts, precursors of the immunoglobulin plasma cells that play a key role in the passive protection of neonates by secreting immunoglobulins to colostrum and milk.
these data are consistent with the saa23â€“ <dig> fragment being involved in preplasma b-cell recruitment to the mammary gland and resultant benefit to the neonate.
then, the saa mrna expression was analysed and we observed more saa transcripts during lactation than gestation.
at the lower concentration , it attracted b-cell lymphoblasts, whereas at the higher , it attracted b lymphocytes.
we investigated the presence of chemoattractants in the milk by analysing the chemoattractant activity of various fractions of this secretion.
