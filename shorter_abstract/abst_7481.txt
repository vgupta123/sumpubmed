unlike other classification methods, the underlying baysic model does not require training using a “gold standard” of true positives.
we demonstrated baysic’s superior variant-calling accuracy, both for somatic mutation detection and germline variant detection.
here we describe baysic , which combines snp variant calls produced by different methods  into a more accurate set of variant calls.
baysic differs from majority voting, consensus or other ad hoc intersection-based schemes for combining sets of genome variant calls.
baysic provides a method for combining sets of snp variant calls produced by different variant calling programs.
the integrated set of snp variant calls produced by baysic improves the sensitivity and specificity of the variant calls used as input.
the user specifies a posterior probability threshold according to the user’s tolerance for false positive and false negative errors; lowering the posterior probability threshold allows the user to trade specificity for sensitivity while raising the threshold increases specificity in exchange for sensitivity.
in addition to combining sets of germline variants, baysic can also be used to combine sets of somatic mutations detected in the context of tumor/normal sequencing experiments.
