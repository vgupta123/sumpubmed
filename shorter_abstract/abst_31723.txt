fortunately, tremendous progress has been made in the past decades in terms of modeling to assist growers in the decision making process and many tools are now available to achieve more sustainable practices both environmentally and economically.
in a greenhouse setting, corn plants were grown under tightly controlled nitrogen and water conditions, allowing sampling of various tissues and stress combinations.
overall, this study suggests that the molecular signature of a specific combination of stresses on the transcriptome might be as unique as the impact of individual stresses, and hence underlines the difficulty to extrapolate conclusions obtained from the study of individual stress responses to more complex settings.
nevertheless large gaps remain between our empirical knowledge of the physiological changes observed in the field in response to nitrogen and water stresses, and our limited understanding of the molecular processes leading to those changes.
a clustering analysis also revealed how the interaction between the two stresses shapes the patterns of gene expression over various levels of water stresses and recovery.
a microarray profiling experiment was performed using this material and showed that the concomitant presence of nitrogen and water limitation affects gene expression to an extent much larger than anticipated.
