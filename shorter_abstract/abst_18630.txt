we describe the graph theoretical identification and searching of highly hydrogen bonded base triples, where each base is involved in at least two hydrogen bonds with the other bases.

highly hydrogen bonded base interactions play a major part in stabilizing the tertiary structures of complex rna molecules, such as transfer-rnas, ribozymes and ribosomal rnas.
our approach correlates theoretically predicted base triples with literature-based compilations and other actual occurrences in crystal structures.
