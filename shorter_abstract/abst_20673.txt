a large number of genes usually show differential expressions in a microarray experiment with two types of tissues, and the p-values of a proper statistical test are often used to quantify the significance of these differences.
the purpose of this paper is to present a new method of estimating this number and use it for the fdr procedure construction.
this procedure has also been tested with good results using a real dataset.
one key question is what should be the threshold to consider the p-values small.
