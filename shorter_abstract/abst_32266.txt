β-lactams target the peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall and most β-lactam antibiotics cause filamentation in susceptible gram-negative bacteria at low concentrations.
this indicates that antibiotic resistant e. coli undergo the same morphological changes as sensitive bacteria in the presence of β-lactam antibiotic.
the objective was to determine the initial morphological response of cephalosporin resistant ctx-m-1-producing e. coli to cefotaxime and to determine whether the response depended on the growth phase of the bacterium and the concentration of antibiotic.
we showed that e. coli resistant to β-lactams by an extended-spectrum β-lactamase, blactx-m- <dig>  produced filaments when exposed to cefotaxime.
two antibiotic resistant strains carrying blactx-m- <dig> on the chromosome and on an inci <dig> plasmid and three sensitive strains were used in this study.
the resistant strains displayed elongated cells when exposed to cefotaxime at sub-inhibitory as well as therapeutic concentrations  in both lag and early exponential phase, suggesting that the elongation was an initial response mechanism to the antibiotic.
in cultures with high concentrations of cefotaxime , no growth other than initial filamentation was observed, but spheroplats appeared after 14– <dig> hours in cultures of the resistant strains.
filaments were also observed in sensitive control strains with sub-inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime.
it was showed that the filament formation was an initial response to the antibiotics.
normal sized cells were the dominant cell type in exponential and stationary growth phase.
the filament formation was restricted to early growth phases and the time the cells grew as filaments was antibiotic concentration dependent.
