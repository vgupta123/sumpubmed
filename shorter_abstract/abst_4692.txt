functional annotation and enrichment analysis of the transcriptome also pinpoint the relevance of specific biological processes for stress responses.
in addition, a significant number of genes up-regulated in osmyb <dig> transgenic maize under control or heat treatments have been associated with responses to abiotic stresses including high temperature, dehydration and oxidative stress.
the latter is a common and major consequence of imposed heat and drought conditions, suggesting that this altered gene expression may be associated with the improved stress tolerance in these transgenic lines.
this was evidenced by the higher plant biomass and reduced leaf damage exhibited by the transgenic lines compared to wild type when plants were subjected to individual or combined stresses and during or after recovery from stress.
over-expression of osmyb <dig> in maize decreased the negative effects of high temperature and drought resulting in improved plant growth and performance under these conditions.
here, we analyzed the transcriptome and improved tolerance to heat stress and drought of maize plants over-expressing the osmyb <dig> gene.
a global transcriptomic analysis using rna sequencing revealed that several genes induced by heat stress in wild type plants are constitutively up-regulated in osmyb <dig> transgenic maize.
our results show that expression of osmyb <dig> can improve tolerance to heat stress and drought in maize plants.
possible implications for the improved tolerance to heat stress and drought of osmyb <dig> transgenic maize are discussed.
enhanced expression of stress-associated genes may be involved in osmyb55-mediated stress tolerance.
