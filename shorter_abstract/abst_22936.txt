here, we examined the impact of zinc and copper stress on acinetobacter baumannii, a common opportunistic pathogen.
transcriptional analyses show that four of these transporters are responsive to zinc stress, five to copper stress and seven to the combination of zinc and copper stress, thereby revealing a likely foundation for the zinc-induced copper starvation in a. baumannii.
in addition, we show that zinc and copper play crucial roles in management of oxidative stress and the membrane composition of a. baumannii.
