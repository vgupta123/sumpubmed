twelve populations of e. coli were serially propagated for  <dig>  generations in a glucose-supplemented minimal medium in order to study the dynamics of evolution.
when transduced into the ancestor, this mutation increased competitive fitness by about 5%.
we sought to find and characterize one of the beneficial mutations responsible for the adaptation and other phenotypic changes, including increased cell size, in one of these populations.
we used transposon-tagging followed by p1-transduction into the ancestor, screening for increased cell size and fitness, co-transduction analysis, and dna sequencing.
we identified a 1-bp insertion in the boxg <dig> region located upstream of glmus, an operon involved in cell-wall biosynthesis.
the 1-bp insertion in the boxg <dig> region near glmus was demonstrably beneficial in the environment in which it arose.
these results show the unpredictability of adaptive evolution, whereas parallel substitutions at other loci in these same populations reveal the predictability.
the absence of similar mutations in the other evolved populations suggests that they substituted other mutations that rendered this particular mutation unimportant.
