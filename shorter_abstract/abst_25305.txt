to detect quantitative trait loci  for black rot resistance, we performed whole-genome resequencing of two cabbage parental lines and genome-wide snp identification using the recently published b. oleracea genome sequences as reference.
we evaluated black rot resistance in the mapping population in three independent inoculation tests using f2: <dig> progenies and identified one major qtl and three minor qtls.
in addition, we identified novel qtls for black rot resistance.
among  <dig> dcaps markers derived from candidate snps,  <dig>  were validated as bona fide snps showing polymorphism between the parental lines.
black rot is a destructive bacterial disease causing large yield and quality losses in brassica oleracea.

the high-density genetic map will promote qtl analysis for other important agricultural traits and marker-assisted breeding of b. oleracea.
we then improved the resolution of a previous genetic map by adding  <dig> markers including  <dig> snp-based dcaps markers.
reference genome-guided mapping and snp calling revealed  <dig>  snps between the two cabbage lines, with an average of one snp per  <dig>  bp.
we report successful utilization of whole-genome resequencing for large-scale snp identification and development of molecular markers for genetic map construction.
the new map composed of  <dig> markers and covers  <dig>  cm with an average interval of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
