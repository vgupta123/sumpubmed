the software introduced in this article is designed for the automatic analysis of relaxation dispersion data and the extraction of the parameters mentioned above.
experimental data can be fitted to different models using the levenberg-marquardt minimization algorithm and different statistical tests can be used to select the best model.
to demonstrate the functionality of this program, synthetic data as well as nmr data were analyzed.
analysis of these data including the generation of plots and color coded structures can be performed with minimal user intervention and using standard procedures that are included in the program.
