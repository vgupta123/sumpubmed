coupled with a mathematical model applied to laboratory generated data, and sparse sampling of capture probes, the prototype microarray platform was able to capture the signature of each organism in all mixed samples with high sensitivity and specificity.
open-target detection of organisms was accomplished using a reference library of hybridization patterns for three test organisms whose dna sequences were not included in the design of the microarray probes.
these 'target-specific' platforms require creation of new physical capture reagents when new organisms are targeted.
when all  <dig>  probes were used, the model correctly detected the signature of three test organisms in all mixed samples ) =  <dig> , ci =  <dig> ), with a 6% false positive rate.
a multivariate mathematical model based on the partial least squares regression  was developed to detect the presence of three test organisms in mixed samples.
we conceived an 'open-target' approach to biosensing, and hypothesized that a relatively small, non-specifically designed, dna microarray is capable of identifying the presence of multiple organisms in mixed samples.
an 'open-target' approach to dna microarray biosensing is proposed and substantiated using laboratory generated data.
a sampling algorithm was then developed to sparsely sample the probe space for a minimal number of probes required to capture the hybridization imprints of the test organisms.
the plsr detection model was capable of correctly identifying the presence of the three test organisms in all mixed samples using only  <dig> probes ) =  <dig> , ci =  <dig> ) with nearly 100% specificity.
