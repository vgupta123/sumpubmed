here, we evaluate the role of bzip <dig>  a transcription factor involved in light and nitrogen sensing, by exposing wild-type  and bzip <dig> t-dna null mutant plants to a combinatorial space of nitrogen  and light  treatment conditions and performing transcriptome analysis.
this transcriptome analysis demonstrates that a mutation in the bzip <dig> gene can alter the l and/or n-regulation of several gene clusters.
more surprisingly, the bzip <dig> mutation can also trigger n and/or l regulation of genes that are not normally controlled by these signals in wt plants.
we use anova analysis combined with clustering and boolean modeling, to evaluate the role of bzip <dig> in mediating l and n signaling genome-wide.
these findings demonstrate that the bzip <dig> mutation triggers a genome-wide de-regulation in response to l and/or n signals that range from i) a reduction of the l signal effect, to ii) unlocking gene regulation in response to l and n combinations.
this analysis also reveals that bzip <dig> can, to a large extent, invert gene regulation .
