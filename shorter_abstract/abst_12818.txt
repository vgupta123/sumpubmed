multidrug resistance  <dig>  gene encodes for an atp binding cassette transporter - p-glycoprotein  - involved in chemoresistance to taxanes.
pca cell lines were exposed to a dna methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-2â€²deoxycytidine  and histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin a .
our data suggests that, in prostate carcinogenesis, mdr <dig> downregulation is mainly due to histone post-translational modifications.
mdr <dig> promoter methylation is frequent in prostate carcinoma , suggesting an epigenetic regulation but no functional correlation has been established.
methylation and histone posttranscriptional modifications status were characterized and correlated with mrna and protein expression.
mdr <dig> promoter methylation levels and frequency significantly increased from npts, to hgpin and to pca.
conversely, decreased or absent p-gp immunoexpression was observed in hgpin and pca, inversely correlating with methylation levels.
exposure to dac alone did not alter significantly methylation levels, although increased expression was apparent.
this occurs concomitantly with aberrant promoter methylation, substantiating the association with p-gp decreased expression.
mdr <dig> promoter methylation and p-gp expression were assessed in  <dig> pca,  <dig> high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ,  <dig> benign prostatic hyperplasia  and  <dig> morphologically normal prostate tissue  samples, using quantitative methylation specific pcr and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
we aimed to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms involved in mdr <dig> deregulation in pca.
however, p-gp mrna and protein re-expression were higher in cell lines exposed to tsa alone or combined with dac.
