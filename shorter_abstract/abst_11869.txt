transcriptional regulation of the coup-tfii gene in response to starvation and cold exposure seems to be the regulatory mechanism of ucp <dig> mrna expression in brown adipose and skeletal muscle tissue determining the final appropriate rate of transcript synthesis.
ucp <dig> is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane with a role in lipid metabolism preventing deleterious effects of fatty acids in states of high lipid oxidation.
these findings add a crucial component to the complex transcriptional machinery controlling expression of ucp <dig>  given the substantial evidence for a function of ucp <dig> in lipid metabolism, coup-tfii may not only be a negative regulator of glucose responsive genes but also transactivate genes involved in lipid metabolism.
ucp <dig> is expressed in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and controlled by a transcription factor complex including pparalpha, myod and the histone acetyltransferase p <dig>  several studies have demonstrated interaction of these factors with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor ii .
by quantitative pcr we demonstrated a positive correlation of coup-tfii and ucp <dig> mrna expression in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue in response to food deprivation and cold exposure, respectively.
in this study we in silico analyzed the upstream region of ucp <dig> of the djungarian hamster phodopus sungorus and identified several putative response elements for coup-tfii.
this nuclear receptor is involved in organogenesis and other developmental processes including skeletal muscle development, but also co-regulates a number of metabolic genes.
we therefore investigated whether coup-tfii is a further player in the transcriptional control of the ucp <dig> gene in rodents.
binding of coup-tfii to this upstream enhancer was confirmed in electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays.
