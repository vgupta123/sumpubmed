we discovered a new  <dig> kb genomic island, spi- <dig>  in the chromosome sequence of s. derby, encoding  <dig> orfs, ten of which are putative ttss effector proteins.
alignment of the genome nucleotide sequences of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> with salmonella pathogenicity islands  identified unique complements of genes associated with host adaptation.
comparative functional genomics using the rast annotation system showed that predominantly mechanisms that relate to metabolite utilisation, in vivo and ex vivo persistence and pathogenesis distinguish s. derby from s. mbandaka.
we also describe a new genomic island with a putative role in pathogenesis, spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> is present in several s. enterica serovars, including s. agona, s. dublin and s. gallinarum, it is absent in its entirety from s. mbandaka.
here we compare the first sequenced genomes of s. derby and s. mbandaka as a basis for further analysis of the potential host adaptations that contribute to their distinct host species distributions.
statistics for salmonella isolations from livestock production in the uk show that s. derby is most commonly associated with pigs and turkeys and s. mbandaka with cattle and chickens.
the two serovars possess distinct complements of metabolic genes; many of which cluster into pathways for catabolism of carbon sources.
