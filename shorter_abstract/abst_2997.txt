this software uses a linear model that broadens its application from plain case–control studies to complex experimental designs.
this software empowers the hta  <dig>  arrays for as event detection as an alternative to rna-seq: simplifying considerably the required analysis, speeding it up and reducing the required computational power.
however, the interpretation software provided by its vendor  does not fully exploit its potential  and can only be applied to case–control studies.
given the cel files and the design and contrast matrices, the software retrieves a list of all the detected events indicating: 1) the type of event , 2) its fold change and its statistical significance, and 3) the potential protein domains affected by the as events and the statistical significance of the possible enrichment.
there is an increasing interest in its role in different pathologies.
