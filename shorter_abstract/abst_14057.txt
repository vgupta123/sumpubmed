neutron exposure resulted in mostly downregulated genes, whereas x-rays showed both down- and up-regulated genes.
most biological processes significantly enriched at both timepoints were consistently represented by either under- or over-expressed genes.
we describe, for the first time, the gene expression profile of mouse blood cells following exposure to neutrons.
we have found that neutron radiation results in both distinct and common gene expression patterns compared with x-ray radiation.
mice exposed to either  <dig>  or  <dig> gy of neutron or  <dig> or  <dig> gy x-ray radiation were sacrificed at  <dig> or  <dig> days after exposure.
whole genome microarray analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the blood of mice exposed to neutron or x-ray radiation, respectively.
cell cycle genes downregulated at day  <dig> were mostly distinct from the cell cycle genes upregulated at day  <dig>  however, five cell cycle genes, fzr <dig>  ube2c, ccna <dig>  nusap <dig>  and cdc25b, were both downregulated at day  <dig> and upregulated at day  <dig>
in the event of an improvised nuclear device detonation, the prompt radiation exposure would consist of photons plus a neutron component that would contribute to the total dose.
