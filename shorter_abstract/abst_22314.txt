the divalent cations zn2+ and cu2+, and the β1-selective inhibitor salicylidine salicylhydrazide , inhibited gaba-activated currents at α4β1δ receptors.
the neurosteroid tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone  significantly increased gaba-initiated responses in concentrations above  <dig> nm for α4β1δ receptors.
this study highlights some notable differences in the pharmacology of murine and human α4β1δ receptors.
with this study we report the first pharmacological characterisation of various gabaa receptor ligands acting at murine α4β1δ gabaa receptors, thereby improving our understanding of the molecular pharmacology of this receptor isoform.
we consider the likelihood that the α4β1δ receptor may play a role as an extrasynaptic gabaa receptor in the nervous system.
