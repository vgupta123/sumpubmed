the intuitive user interface enables scientists  to setup workflows for their specific problems by simple drag-and drop like operations.
this emphasizes the urgent need for user-friendly windows-based software interfaces that could process the diversity of large tab-delimited raw data files generated by these methods.
it is implemented to handle, join and preprocess large tab delimited ascii data files.
gene annotations as well as information concerning the samples analyzed may be appended, renewed or extended.
tablebutler is a monolithic windows application.
before the actual statistical or cluster analysis, these data tables have to be combined and merged to expression matrices .
often additional data values shall be computed or certain features must be filtered out.
depending on the study, dozens to hundreds of these data tables are generated.
in order to perform these tasks, we have developed a microsoft windows based application, "tablebutler", which allows biologists or clinicians without substantial bioinformatics background to perform a plethora of data processing tasks required to analyze the large-scale data.
