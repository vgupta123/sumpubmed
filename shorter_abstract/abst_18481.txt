the promoter activation was strongly dependent on the myb-p binding box tcctacc having a core sequence ccwacc positioned on its 5' end region and it seems that the complexity of the promoter plays an important role.
the detailed analysis of the transcription factor -mediated regulation of the oligofamily of one of the key enzymes, i.e., chalcone synthase chs_h <dig> that efficiently catalyzes the production of naringenin chalcone, a direct precursor of prenylflavonoids in hop, constitutes an important part of the dissection of the biosynthetic pathways leading to the accumulation of these compounds.
this study on the sequences and functions of various lupulin gland-specific transcription factors provides insight into the complex character of the regulation of the chs_h <dig> gene that depends on variable activation by combinations of r2r3myb, bhlh and wdr tf homologues and inhibition by a myb repressor.
comparative analyses of hop and a. thaliana tfs revealed a complex activation of pchs_h <dig> and pchs <dig> in combinatorial or independent manners.
lupulin glands of hop produce a specific metabolome including hop bitter acids valuable for the brewing process and prenylflavonoids with promising health-beneficial activities.
homologues of flavonoid-regulating tfs hlmyb <dig> , hlbhlh <dig>  and hlwdr <dig>  from hop were cloned using a lupulin gland-specific cdna library from the hop variety osvald's  <dig>  using a "combinatorial" transient gus expression system it was shown that these unique lupulin-gland-associated tfs significantly activated the promoter  of chs_h <dig> in ternary combinations of b <dig>  w <dig> and either m <dig> or the previously characterized hlmyb <dig> .
