gamma-band cmc  occurred in both small and large dynamic force conditions without any significant difference between both conditions.
although in some subjects beta-range cmc was observed during both dynamic force conditions no significant difference between conditions could be detected.
however, when we normalized the magnitude of the errors to the amplitude of the applied force  no significant difference between both dynamic conditions was observed.
the main focus so far has been on corticomuscular coherence  during static force condition, for which coherence in beta-range has been described.
for the static force condition we found the well-documented, significant beta-range cmc  over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex.
with respect to the motor performance, the lowest errors were obtained in the static force condition and the highest ones in the dynamic condition with large amplitude.
in contrast, we showed in a recent study  <cit>  that dynamic force condition is accompanied by gamma-range cmc.
we suggest that gamma cmc is rather associated with the internal state of the sensorimotor system as supported by the unchanged relative error between both dynamic conditions.
the cmc, the cortical eeg spectral power , the emg sp and the errors in motor performance  were analyzed.
moreover, we show that amplitude modulation of dynamic force has no effect on the gamma cmc in the low force range investigated.
these findings confirm that during dynamic force output the corticomuscular network oscillates at gamma frequencies.
the modulation of the cmc by various dynamic force amplitudes, however, remained uninvestigated.
the visuomotor task consisted in isometric compensation for  <dig> forces  generated by a manipulandum.
