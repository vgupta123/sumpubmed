in this study, a transcriptome study between the tolerant  accession and a salt susceptible  accession was conducted, under control and salt treatments, and in shoot and root tissues.
kentucky bluegrass  is a prominent turfgrass in the cool-season regions, but it is sensitive to salt stress.
previously, a relatively salt tolerant kentucky bluegrass accession was identified that maintained green colour under consistent salt applications.
gene expression profiling identified salt-responsive gene families that were consistently down-regulated in pi  <dig> and unlikely to contribute to salt tolerance in kentucky bluegrass.
the transcript assembly represents the first such assembly in the highly polyploidy, facultative apomictic kentucky bluegrass.

gene expression profiling also identified sets of transcripts relating to transcription factors, ion and water transport genes, and oxidation-reduction process genes with likely roles in salt tolerance.
the transcripts identified provide genetic information on how this plant responds to and tolerates salt stress in both shoot and root tissues, and can be used for further genetic testing and introgression.
a de novo assembly resulted in  <dig>  transcripts, with  <dig>  detected as differentially expressed.
sample replicates grouped tightly by tissue and treatment, and fewer differentially expressed transcripts were detected in the tolerant pi  <dig> samples compared to the susceptible pi  <dig> samples, and in root tissues compared to shoot tissues.
