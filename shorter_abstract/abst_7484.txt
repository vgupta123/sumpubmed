sequences of microbial origin have been observed within small rna sequencing data obtained from blood samples.
abundant non-human small rna sequences were identified in plasma and plasma exosomal samples.
in addition, extremely abundant small rnas derived from human y rnas were detected.
a characteristic profile of a subset of the human microbiome can be obtained by sequencing small rnas present in the blood.

most reads mapped to rrna sequences.
the human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining normal physiology.
the majority of bacterial reads were from the phylum proteobacteria, whilst for  <dig> of  <dig> individuals over 90% of the more abundant fungal reads were from the phylum ascomycota; of these over 90% were from the order hypocreales.
