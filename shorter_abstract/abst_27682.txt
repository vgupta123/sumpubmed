results of this study support the findings of bi-parental linkage mapping and expression studies that the cbf gene family plays an essential role in ft.
as the most frost tolerant small grain cereal, rye  is an ideal cereal model for investigating the genetic basis of frost tolerance , a complex trait with polygenic inheritance.
candidate gene based-association studies are a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of ft in rye.
distribution of snp effect sizes expressed as percentage of the genetic variance explained by individual snps was highly skewed towards zero with a few snps obtaining large effects.
using  <dig> genotypes from five eastern and middle european winter rye populations, this study reports a multi-platform candidate gene-based association analysis in rye using  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and nine insertion-deletion  polymorphisms previously identified from twelve candidate genes with a putative role in the frost responsive network.
two snps in sccbf <dig> and one in sccbf <dig>  all leading to amino acid exchanges, were significantly associated with ft over all three phenotyping platforms.
relatively low to medium empirical correlations of snp-ft associations were observed across the three platforms underlining the need for multi-level experimentation for dissecting complex associations between genotypes and ft in rye.
statistically significant  associations between ft and snps/haplotypes of candidate genes were identified.
two-way epistasis was found between  <dig> pairs of candidate genes.
phenotypic data analyses of ft in three different phenotyping platforms, controlled, semi-controlled and field, revealed significant genetic variations in the plant material under study.
