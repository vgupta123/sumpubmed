iron regulatory protein  <dig> , a post-transcriptional regulator of cellular iron metabolism, undergoes iron-dependent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
moreover, the replacement of domain  <dig> of irp <dig> with the corresponding region of irp <dig> sensitized the chimerical irp11–3/irp <dig> protein to iron-dependent degradation, while the reverse manipulation gave rise to a stable chimerical irp21–3/irp <dig> protein.
our data suggest that the c-terminus of irp <dig> contains elements that are necessary but not sufficient for iron-dependent degradation.
however, mutants lacking this fragment remain sensitive to degradation in iron-replete cells.
deletion mutants lacking the entire c-terminal domain  <dig>  of irp <dig> remained stable following iron treatments.
