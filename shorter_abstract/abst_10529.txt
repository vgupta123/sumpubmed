ubiquilins are proteins that function as ubiquitin receptors in eukaryotes.
the infrequent lineage-specific amplifications observed may be linked to the emergence of novel functions in particular tissues.
in this study, evolutionary and functional data are combined to determine the origin and diversification of the ubiquilin gene family and to characterize novel potential roles of ubiquilins in mammalian species, including humans.
the ubiquilin gene family is highly conserved in eukaryotes.
significantly, marsupial and eutherian mammals have the most complex ubiquilin gene families, composed of up to  <dig> genes.
however, ubiquilin functions are still poorly understood.
a gene with related features has independently arisen in species of the drosophila genus.
seven different ubiquilins have been detected in vertebrates.
mutations in two ubiquilin-encoding genes have been linked to the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
many organisms  have single ubiquilin genes, but duplications in animal, plant, alveolate and excavate species are described.
positive selection acting on some mammalian ubiquilins has been detected.
the analysis of more than six hundred sequences allowed characterizing ubiquilin diversity in all the main eukaryotic groups.
