the satisfactory performance suggests that network topological features can be used as quantification measures to determine the importance of a site on a protein, and this approach can complement existing methods for prediction of disease-associated saps.
here, we use complex networks to study the role of an amino acid in both local and global structures and determine the extent to which disease-associated and polymorphic saps differ in terms of their interactions to other residues.
the values of total accuracy and mcc were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, as determined by 5-fold cross-validation.
we compiled a dataset from the swiss-prot variant pages and constructed a model to predict disease-associated saps based on the random forest algorithm.
with an independent dataset, our model achieved a total accuracy of  <dig> % and mcc of  <dig> , respectively.
we found that saps can be well characterized by network topological features.
the rapid accumulation of data on non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  should allow us to further our understanding of the underlying disease-associated mechanisms.
mutations are probably disease-associated when they occur at a site with a high centrality value and/or high degree value in a protein structure network.
