all three methods detected greater than 70% of the expected number of genes and had a 50% probability of detecting genes with abundance greater than  <dig> to  <dig> molecules.
measurement reliability increased with expression level for all methods and we conservatively estimate measurements to be quantitative at an expression level greater than ~5– <dig> molecules.
methods for single-cell rna sequencing  have received considerable attention, but the broad reliability of single cell methods and the factors governing their performance are still poorly known.

despite the small number of molecules, sequencing depth significantly affected gene detection.
here, we conducted a large-scale control experiment to assess the transfer function of three scrna-seq methods and factors modulating the function.
