phylogenetic networks model reticulate evolutionary histories.
first, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic networks and report on anomaly results for different networks.
our findings can form the basis for achieving higher accuracy when inferring phylogenetic networks and open up new venues for research in this area, including new problem formulations based on the notion of a network’s parental trees.
third, we demonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that lends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.
we formally define the set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on this definition.
the last two decades have seen an increased interest in establishing mathematical results and developing computational methods for inferring and analyzing these networks.
our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees displayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network.
second, we demonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer a species tree that could be augmented into the correct network.
