tissues and their component cells have unique dna methylation profiles comprising dna methylation patterns of tissue-dependent and differentially methylated regions .
here, we investigated the genome-wide dna methylation profiles of mouse neural progenitors derived from different developmental stages using hpych4iv, a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme that recognizes acgt residues, which are uniformly distributed across the genome.
using a microarray-based genome-wide dna methylation analysis system focusing on  <dig> -kb regions around transcription start sites , we analyzed the dna methylation profiles of mouse neurospheres derived from telencephalons at embryonic days  <dig>   and  <dig>   and the adult brain .
previous studies reported that dna methylation plays crucial roles in cell differentiation and development.
we identified t-dmrs with different dna methylation statuses between e <dig> nsph and e <dig> nsph at genes involved in neural development and/or associated with neurological disorders in humans, such as dclk <dig>  nrcam, nfia, and ntng <dig>  these t-dmrs were located not only within 2Â kb but also distal  from the tsss, and those hypomethylated in e <dig> nsph tended to be in cpg island  associated genes.
mouse adult brain dna methylation and gene expression profiles could be attributed to developmental dynamics of t-dmrs in neural-related genes.
