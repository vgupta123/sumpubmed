box-covering dimensions for fractal graphs rely on a linear log−log plot of minimum numbers of covering subgraph boxes versus the box sizes.
in the human brain, networks of functional or structural connectivity model the information-flow between cortex regions.

three different methods to apply ndim to weighted networks are finally presented and exemplified by comparisons of functional brain connectivity of healthy and depressed subjects.
the large informative power and a convenient computational cpu-time for moderately sized networks may make ndim a valuable tool for the analysis of biological networks.
numerical applications to lattice-graphs and to fractal and non-fractal graph models, together with formal proofs show, that ndim estimates a dimension of complexity for arbitrary graphs.
however, box-covering dimensions are only applicable to fractal networks.
we propose a new measure, ndim, estimating the complexity of arbitrary networks.
we introduce a new measure of complexity for networks.
it allows the comparison of the complexity of networks of different type, e.g., between fractal graphs characterized by hub repulsion and small world graphs with strong hub attraction.
the network measure ndim grows with the proliferation of increasing network connectivity and is essentially determined by the cardinality of a maximum k-clique, where k is the characteristic path length of the network.
comparisons of ndim with topological measures of complexity  show that ndim has larger informative power.
this measure is based on a fractal dimension, which is similar to recently introduced box-covering dimensions.
we demonstrate the affinity between ndim and the fractal box-covering dimensions but also that ndim extends the concept of a fractal dimension to networks with non-linear log−log plots.
