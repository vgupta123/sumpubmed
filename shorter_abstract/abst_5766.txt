in the periventricular regions  known as structures of prominent cu content, cu was reduced in turn by a factor of  <dig>  this corroborates the view of the pvr as efflux compartments with active transport of cu into the cerebrospinal fluid.
this study confirmed stable cerebral cu accumulation in parenchyma and discovered reduced cu in cerebrospinal fluid in atp7b null mice underlining the diagnostic value of micro-local analytical techniques.
we could confirm cu accumulation in brain parenchyma by a factor of two in wd  vs. controls  that was already fully established at 11 months.
otherwise the architecture of cu distribution was essentially maintained.
we have applied laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and performed comparative metal bio-imaging in brain sections of wild type and atp7b null mice in the age range of 11– <dig> months.
messenger rna and protein expression of a panel of inflammatory markers were assessed using rt-pcr and western blots of brain homogenates.
inflammatory markers tnf-α, timp- <dig> and the capillary proliferation marker α-sma were increased by a factor of 2– <dig> in wd.
zinc  was increased by up to 40% especially in regions of high cu but not in typical zn accumulator regions, a side effect due to the fact that zn is to some degree a substrate of cu-atpases.
these show a gradual accumulation and concentration of cu in liver, kidneys, and brain.
