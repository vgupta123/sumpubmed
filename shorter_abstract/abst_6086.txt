we developed an r software package, xmrf, that can be used to fit markov networks to various types of high-throughput genomics data.
encoding the models and estimation techniques of the recently proposed exponential family markov random fields , our software can be used to learn genetic networks from rna-sequencing data , mutation and copy number variation data , and methylation data .
xmrf is the only tool that allows network structure learning using the native distribution of the data instead of the standard gaussian.
