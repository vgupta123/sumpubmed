leaf discs were cut from infected brussels sprout leaves, transferred to microwell plates and submerged in small amounts of water.
the in vitro leaf disc method established from p. brassicae infected brussels sprout leaves facilitates convenient and high-throughput production of infectious zoospores and is thus suitable to drive small and large scale inoculation experiments.
phytophthora species are notorious oomycete pathogens that cause diseases on a wide range of plants.
since the current p. brassicae zoospore isolation methods are generally regarded as inefficient, we aimed at developing an alternative method for obtaining high concentrations of p. brassicae zoospores.
p. brassicae isolates were tested for pathogenicity on brussels sprout plants .
microscopic examination of leaves, stems and roots infected with a gfp-tagged transformant of p. brassicae clearly demonstrated the susceptibility of the various tissues.
the zoospores were shown to be infectious on brussels sprouts and arabidopsis.
in the disease cycle, however, sporangia or zoospores are the infectious propagules.
one attractive model system is the interaction between arabidopsis and phytophthora brassicae.
upon maturation the zoosporangia released zoospores in high amounts and zoospore production continued during a period of at least four weeks.
under laboratory conditions, arabidopsis can be easily infected with mycelial plugs as inoculum.
in the leaf discs the hyphae proliferated and abundant formation of zoosporangia was observed.
