the proteolytic activities from the membrane fractions solubilized by other detergents were not inhibited by 2-ketone.
in this study, we have investigated the proteolytic activity of atspp to define the function of spps in plants.
to confirm the proteolytic activity of atspp, the protein was expressed as either a gfp fusion protein or solely atspp in yeast.
the data from the in vitro cell-free assay indicated that the membrane fraction of both arabidopsis cells and atspp recombinantly expressed in yeast actually possessed proteolytic activity for a human spp substrate.
we concluded that plant spp possesses proteolytic activity and may be involved in rip.
rip proteases mediate various key life events by releasing bioactive peptides from the plane of the membrane region.
we found that an n-dodecyl-ÃŸ-maltoside -solubilized membrane fraction from arabidopsis cells digested the myc-prolactin-pp-flag peptide, a human spp substrate, and this activity was inhibited by 2-ketone, an spp-specific inhibitor.
signal peptide peptidase  is a multi-transmembrane aspartic protease involved in intramembrane-regulated proteolysis .
sds-page analysis showed that migration of the fragments that were cleaved by atspp were identical in size to the fragments produced by human spp using the same substrate.
