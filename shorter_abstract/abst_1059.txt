at fetal stages near term, oxytocin-induced nkcc <dig> downregulation has been implicated in the developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing gaba action.
this developmental shift in gabaergic transmission may contribute to fetal analgesia and neuroprotection at birth.

these results indicate that nkcc <dig> activity transiently decreases in drgn at fetal stages near term.
the results were compared to data previously obtained in fetal drgn at e <dig> and in mature cells.
mature dorsal root ganglion neurons , however, express high nkcc <dig> levels and maintain high intracellular chloride levels with consequent gaba-induced depolarization.
gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings were used to assess the developmental change in chloride homeostasis in rat cultured small drgn at the embryonic day  <dig>  and  <dig> .
