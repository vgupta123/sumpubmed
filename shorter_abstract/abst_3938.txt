genomic and transcriptomic comparison of bruchid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean could reveal bruchid-resistant genes  for this pest and give insights into the bruchid resistance of mungbean.
in addition to identifying bruchid-resistance-associated genes, we found that conserved metabolism and tes may be modifier factors for bruchid resistance of mungbean.
mungbean  is an important legume crop with high nutritional value in south and southeast asia.
next generation sequencing followed by de novo assembly of the genome of the bruchid-resistant recombinant inbred line  <dig>  revealed more than  <dig>  genes.
the genome sequence of a bruchid-resistant inbred line, candidate genes and sequence variations in promoter regions and exons putatively conditioning resistance as well as markers detecting these variants could be used for development of bruchid-resistant mungbean varieties.
flow cytometry showed that the genome size varied by 61 mb  among the tested mungbean accessions.
degs and scps comprised genes involved in resistant-related, transposable elements  and conserved metabolic pathways.
the crop plant is susceptible to a storage pest caused by bruchids .
we found  <dig> nucleotide variations  between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible lines in regions spanning 2 kb  of the promoters of  <dig> degs.
