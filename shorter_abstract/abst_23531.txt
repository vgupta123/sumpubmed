we validated the b-y filter on the set of linear peptides from nist library, and demonstrate that it is an effective way to find high-quality mass spectra.
we have designed a novel cross-link search algorithm -xlpm - and implemented it both as an online tool and as a downloadable archive of scripts.
the difficulties are due to higher charges of fragment ions, and to the overall low-abundance of cross-link species in the background of linear peptides.
the cross-links were mapped to the x-ray structure of rim <dig> tetramer.
we designed a filter based on an observation that observation of a b-ion implies observation of a complimentary y-ion with high probability .
next, we generated cross-linked data from an ssdna binding protein, rim1with a specific cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate, and a semi-specific cross-linker nhs-diazirine, followed by analysis of the cross-linked products by nanolc-ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometry.
we also put forward a new method of estimating specificity and sensitivity of identification of a cross-linked residue in the case of a non-specific cross-linker.
analysis of the mixture of nhs-diazirine cross-linked 15n and 14n-labeled rim <dig> tetramers yielded 15n-labeled to 14n-labeled cross-linked peptide pairs, corresponding to c-terminus-to-n-terminus cross-linking, demonstrating interaction between different two rim <dig> tetramers.
