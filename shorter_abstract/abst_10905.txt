we present evidence that the decision to activate p <dig> given a specific number of breaks is not entirely stochastic, but instead is influenced by both cell-intrinsic factors and previous exposure to dna damage.
we also show that the natural variations in the initial amount of p <dig>  rate of dsb repair and cell cycle phase do not affect the probability of activating p <dig> in response to dna damage.
the use of fluorescent reporters to quantify dna damage and p <dig> levels in live cells provided a quantitative analysis of the complex interrelationships between both processes.
we found a large variation in the initial number of dsbs and the rate of repair between individual cells.
using fluorescent reporters we developed a system for following in individual cells the number of dsbs, the kinetics of repair and the p <dig> response.
previous studies that averaged the response across cell populations suggested that one or two dna breaks are sufficient for activating atm and p <dig>  however, it is possible that by averaging over a population of cells important features of the dependency between dna breaks and p <dig> dynamics are missed.
dna double strand breaks  induce the activation of the kinase atm, which stabilizes p <dig> and activates its transcriptional activity.
understanding the origin and consequences of such variability in normal and cancerous cells is crucial for developing efficient and selective therapeutic interventions.
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> is activated by cellular stress.
