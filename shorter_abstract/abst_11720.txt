the study involved  <dig> local pigs sampled from the three agro-ecological zones of ghana.
pca analysis of snp data revealed a strong location and breed effect on clustering of local ghanaian pigs.
analyses of the mitochondrial d-loop region and y-chromosome sequences revealed both european and asian genetic signatures, with differences between the geographical zones.
black coat colour is the most predominant within the breed, with black mc1r alleles of both asian and european origin.
the ashanti dwarf pig  of ghana is an endangered pig breed with hardy and disease resistant traits.
characterisation of animal genetic resources provides relevant data for their conservation and sustainable use for food security and economic development.
european alleles for spotting are present at a low frequency in the sample set, and may account for the occurrence of spotted piglets in some apd litters.
understanding the effects of admixture on important adaptive and economic traits of the adp and other local breeds in africa is critical for developing sustainable conservation programmes to prevent the decline of these genetic resources.
