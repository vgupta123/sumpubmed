a significant set  of randomly selected clinical p. aeruginosa isolates, including multidrug and non-multidrug resistant isolates, were assigned to sequence types  and compared them with their antibiotic susceptibility profile classified as follows: extensively drug resistant , multidrug resistant  and non-multidrug resistant .
twenty-two isolates corresponded to new sequence types  of which  <dig> isolates were non-mdr and  <dig> isolates were mdr or xdr.
the aim of the study is to ascertain the population structure of this clinical pathogen in the hospital son llàtzer, spain.
the multiresistant isolates studied are grouped in the prevalent sequence types found in other spanish hospitals and at the international level, and the susceptible isolates correspond mainly to singleton sequence types.
the population structure of clinical p. aeruginosa present in our hospital indicates the coexistence of nonresistant and resistant isolates with the same sequence type.

the analysis of seven loci, acsa, aroe, guaa, mutl, nuod, ppsa and trpe, demonstrated that the prevalent sts were st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig>  the majority of the xdr and mdr isolates were included in st- <dig> and st- <dig>  st- <dig> is the third in frequency and included non-mdr isolates.
the genetic diversity was assessed by applying the multilocus sequence typing  scheme developed by curran and collaborators, and by the phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated tree.
the  <dig> singleton sequence types corresponded mainly to non-mdr isolates.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen that exhibits multiple resistances to antibiotics with increasing frequency, making patient treatment more difficult.
