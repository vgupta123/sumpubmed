to prevent propagation of p. aeruginosa infection among humans and animals, detailed characteristics of the isolates, including antibiotic susceptibility and genetic features, are needed.
in this study, we surveyed p. aeruginosa distribution in chinchillas bred as pets or laboratory animals.
p. aeruginosa was isolated from  <dig> % of the  <dig> chinchillas included in the study.
dna analyses confirmed that none of the isolates contained the gene encoding extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases; however,  <dig> of the total  <dig> isolates were found to have a gene similar to the pill gene that has been identified in the pathogenicity island of a clinical isolate of p. aeruginosa.
p. aeruginosa is widely spread in chinchillas, including strains with reduced susceptibility to the antibiotics and highly virulent strains.
for the antibiotic susceptibility test,  <dig> % of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin,  <dig> % to ciprofloxacin,  <dig> % to imipenem, and  <dig> % to ceftazidime.
slide agglutination and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis discriminated  <dig> serotypes and  <dig> unique patterns, respectively.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major infectious agent that causes otitis media, pneumonia, septicaemia enteritis, and sudden death in chinchillas.
we also characterized the isolates from these chinchillas by testing for antibiotic susceptibility and by gene analysis.
this bacterium is also a leading cause of nosocomial infections in humans.
chinchillas  are popular as pets and are often used as laboratory animals for various studies.
