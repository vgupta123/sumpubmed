given a search query, candidate homologs from different species are tested for their known mirna properties, such as secondary structure, energy and alignment and conservation, in order to asses their fidelity.
previously, experimental and computational methods were used to construct mirna gene repositories agreeing with careful submission guidelines.
micrornas , present in most metazoans, are small non-coding rnas that control gene expression by negatively regulating translation through binding to the 3'utr of mrna transcripts.
when applying mirnaminer on seven mammalian species we identified several hundreds of high-confidence homologous mirnas increasing the total collection of   mirnas, in these species, by more than 50%.
