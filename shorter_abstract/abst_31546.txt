similar detailed plethysmographic changes were found in adult rats injected with aav <dig> tdp- <dig>  fus gene transfer to adult rats yielded a consistent pre-clinical model with relevant motor paralysis in the early to middle stages and respiratory dysfunction at the end stage.
respiratory abnormalities manifested 4–7 weeks post gene transfer including increased respiratory frequency and decreased tidal volume.
we expressed human fus in rats to determine if fus would induce als relevant respiratory changes to serve as an early stage disease indicator.
this modeling method yields disease relevant motor and respiratory changes in adult rats.
als manifests in patients as a progressive paralysis which leads to respiratory dysfunction and failure, the primary cause of death in als.
the fus expression was initiated in adult rats by way of an intravenously administered adeno-associated virus vector serotype  <dig>  providing an adult onset model.
rats with breathing abnormalities also had arterial blood acidosis.
