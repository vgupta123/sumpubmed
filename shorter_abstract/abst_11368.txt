to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of direct regulation of alanine dehydrogenase, pyruvate metabolism genes and type iii secretion system by σ54-dependent regulators.
desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, a model bacterium for sulfate reduction studies, has a high number of ebps, more than most sequenced bacteria.
to characterize the σ54-dependent regulome of d. vulgaris hildenborough, we identified ebp binding motifs and regulated genes by a combination of computational and experimental techniques.
the σ54-dependent regulome is an important component of transcriptional regulatory network in d. vulgaris hildenborough and related free-living deltaproteobacteria.
we reassessed and refined the results of earlier studies on regulation in d. vulgaris hildenborough and consolidated them with our new findings.
it allowed us to reconstruct the σ <dig> regulome in d. vulgaris hildenborough.
these predictions were supported by our reconstruction of σ54-dependent promoters by comparative genomics.
our study provides a representative collection of σ54-dependent regulons that can be used for regulation prediction in deltaproteobacteria and other taxa.
