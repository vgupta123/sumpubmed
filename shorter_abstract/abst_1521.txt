these results will be useful for the development of marker-assisted selection to breed soybean cultivars with high or low isoflavone contents and for map-based cloning of new isoflavone related genes.
overlapped loci of eqtls and phenotypic qtls  were analyzed to identify the potential candidate genes underlying the accumulation of isoflavone in soybean seed.
thirty three eqtls  underlying the transcript abundance of the four gene families were identified on fifteen chromosomes.
five eqtl intervals were overlapped with pqtls.
the objective of this study is to identify eqtl underlying expression of four gene families encoding isoflavone synthetic enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which are phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , chalcone synthase , 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase  and flavanone 3-hydroxylase .
a total of eleven candidate genes within the overlapped eqtl and pqtl were identified.
