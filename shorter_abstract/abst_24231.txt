ie6m-hd/sd mice showed lower learning rates compared with control  or masticatory rehabilitated  animals.
for  <dig> months  or  <dig> months , we fed three groups of mice from postnatal day  <dig> respectively with a hard diet  of pellets; pellets followed by a powdered, soft diet ; or pellets followed by powder, followed by pellets again .
here we induced spatial learning impairment in mice by reducing masticatory activity and then tested the effect of a combination of environmental enrichment and masticatory rehabilitation in recovering spatial learning at adulthood and in later life.
in adults, masticatory rehabilitation recovered spatial abilities in both sedentary and active mice, and rehabilitation of masticatory activity combined with ee recovered these losses in aged mice.

learning rates did not correlate with swim speed.
to measure the impact of masticatory reduction on learning and memory, previous studies have produced experimental masticatory reduction by modified diet or molar removal.
to mimic sedentary or active lifestyles, half of the animals from each group were raised from weaning in standard cages  and the other half in enriched cages .
reduction in masticatory activity imposed on mice previously fed a hard diet  impaired spatial learning in the morris water maze.
to evaluate spatial learning, we used the morris water maze.
