the reporter genes are significantly enriched for regulators and effectors covering a wide range of biological processes, and faithfully capture gene-level and pathway-level changes.
we apply the approach to ipsc derived cardiomyocytes and primary human hepatocytes to describe changes in molecular phenotype during development or drug response.
we propose molecular phenotyping as a useful approach to understand diseases and drug action at the network level.
we compiled a panel of  <dig> human pathway reporter genes, representing  <dig> human signaling and metabolic networks for integrated knowledge- and data-driven understanding of biological processes.
digital amplicon based rna quantification by sequencing is a useful technology for molecular phenotyping as a novel tool to characterize the state of biological systems.
the reporter genes deliver an accurate pathway-centric view of the biological system under study, and identify known and novel modulation of signaling networks consistent with literature or experimental data.
a panel of  <dig> pathway reporter genes is sufficient to describe changes in the molecular phenotype defined by  <dig> signaling cascades in various human cell types.

the phenotype of a living cell is determined by its pattern of active signaling networks, giving rise to a “molecular phenotype” associated with differential gene expression.
we show here that the activity of signaling networks can be assessed based on a set of established key regulators and expression targets rather than the entire transcriptome.
