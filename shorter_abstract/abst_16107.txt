it may be difficult in practice, however, to retrieve a  <dig> bp fragment from archival specimens,  or from environmental samples .
we used a bioinformatics analysis using all co <dig> barcode sequences from genbank and calculated the probability of having species-specific barcodes for varied size fragments.
we further successfully tested the utility of this primer set on a comprehensive set of taxa from all major eukaryotic groups as well as archival specimens.
we establish a novel approach based on a much shorter barcode sequence and demonstrate its effectiveness in archival specimens.
we then developed a universal primer set for the amplification of mini-barcodes.
this analysis established the potential of much smaller fragments, mini-barcodes, for identifying unknown specimens.
in this study we address the important issue of minimum amount of sequence information required for identifying species in dna barcoding.
