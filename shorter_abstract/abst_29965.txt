ndnf also protected cultured hippocamal neurons against excitotoxicity and amyloid beta-peptide toxicity.
the results of this study indicated that ndnf is a novel neurotrophic factor derived from neurons that may be useful in the treatment of neuronal degeneration diseases and nerve injuries.
cajal-retzius cells, cortex neurons, hippocampus neurons, olfactory mitral cells, cerebellar purkinje cells, cerebellar granular cells and spinal neurons were found to be ndnf-positive.
neuron-derived neurotrophic factor  is evolutionarily well conserved, being present in invertebrate animals such as the nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, as well as in the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster.
western blotting showed that ndnf was exclusively expressed in the brain and spinal cord.
ndnf expression was observed in the neurons during development.
ndnf is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded secretory protein that contains a fibronectin type iii domain.
