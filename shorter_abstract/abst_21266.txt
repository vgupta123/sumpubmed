oedxs, oeges, oege10h and oeadh, encoding putative 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-p synthase, geraniol synthase, geraniol 10-hydroxylase and arogenate dehydrogenase, respectively, were almost exclusively present at  <dig> days after flowering , suggesting that these compounds might play a key role in regulating secoiridoid accumulation during fruit development.
this study will attempt to provide further insight into the profile of olive phenolic compounds during fruit development and to identify the major genetic determinants of phenolic metabolism.
the content of these compounds varied significantly among the cultivars and decreased during fruit development and maturation, with some compounds showing specificity for certain cultivars.
their mrna levels were determined using rt-qpcr analysis on fruits of high- and low-phenolic varieties  during three different fruit developmental stages.
the concentration of the major phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein, demethyloleuropein, 3â€“ <dig> dhpea-eda, ligstroside, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, verbascoside and lignans, were measured in the developing fruits of  <dig> olive cultivars.
thirty-five olive transcripts homologous to genes involved in the pathways of the main secondary metabolites were identified from the massive sequencing data of the olive fruit transcriptome or from cdna-aflp analysis.
metabolic and transcriptional profiling led to the identification of some major players putatively involved in biosynthesis of secondary compounds in the olive tree.
a strong correlation was observed between phenolic compound concentrations and transcripts putatively involved in their biosynthesis, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of the corresponding pathways.
