the two populations communicate via l-tryptophan and interleukin- <dig> to highlight the population border by the production of a fluorescent protein.
here, we present the first mammalian synthetic network for reciprocal cell-cell communication to compute the border between a sender/receiver and a processing cell population.
this communication is often difficult to decipher in its native context, but synthetic biology provides tools to engineer well-defined systems that allow the convenient study and manipulation of intercellular communication networks.

the sharpness of that visualized edge can be adjusted by modulating key parameters of the network.
we anticipate that this network will on the one hand be a useful tool to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of tissue formation in nature and will on the other hand contribute to our ability to engineer artificial tissues.
multicellular organisms depend on the exchange of information between specialized cells.
