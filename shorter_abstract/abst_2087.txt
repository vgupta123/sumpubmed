to address this we have performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of acute phase responses to a single ph1n <dig> influenza virus, a/california/04/ <dig> , in the lung of mice, macaques and swine.
in mouse, non human primate, and swine infection models, the ph1n <dig> virus efficiently replicates in the lung and induces pro-inflammatory host responses; however, whether similar or different cellular pathways were impacted by ph1n <dig> virus across independent infection models remains to be further defined.
by comparing transcriptional changes in the context of clinical and virological measures, we identified differences in the host transcriptional response to ph1n <dig> virus across independent models of acute infection.
we found genes associated with the retinoid x receptor  signaling pathway known to control pro-inflammatory and metabolic processes that were differentially regulated during infection in each species, though the heterodimeric rxr partner, pathway associated signaling molecules, and gene expression patterns varied among the three species.
despite similarities in the clinical course, we observed differences in inflammatory molecules elicited, and the kinetics of their gene expression changes across all three species.
underlying overt clinical disease are molecular events that suggest therapeutic targets identified in one host may not be appropriate in another.
