results from the unifrac tool can vary greatly for the same input depending on the arbitrary choice of input format.
unifrac produces different outputs for these equivalent forms of the same input tree.
this is illustrated using metagenomics data from a lake sediment study.
in this paper we identify a discrepancy in the unifrac methodology that causes semantically equivalent inputs to produce different outputs in tests of statistical significance.
an isomorphic transform can be defined that will convert trees between these two formats without altering the semantic meaning of the trees.
the phylogenetic trees that are input into unifrac may or may not contain abundance counts.
unifrac is a well-known tool for comparing microbial communities and assessing statistically significant differences between communities.
