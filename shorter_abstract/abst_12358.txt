commensal gram-negative  microbiota have been identified on human skin by dna sequencing; however, methods to reliably culture viable gram-negative skin organisms have not been previously described.
our protocol will permit future functional studies on the influences of cgn on skin homeostasis and disease.
we identified several previously uncharacterized cgn at the species level by optimizing growth conditions and limiting the inhibitory effects of nutrient shock, temperature, and bacterial competition, factors that may have previously limited cgn isolation from skin cultures.
through the use of selective antibiotics and minimal media we developed methods to culture cgn from skin swabs.
