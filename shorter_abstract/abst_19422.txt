canine mammary sarcomas  are rarely diagnosed in female dogs, which explains the scarcity of immunohistochemical findings concerning those tumors.
four percent of all canine mammary tumors  were classified as cmss, and they represented  <dig> % of malignant cmts.
this paper presents the results of a retrospective study into cmss and discusses the clinical features of the analyzed tumors, the expression of intermediate filaments ck, vim, des and α-sma, and the expression of p <dig>  ki <dig>  erα, pr and p <dig> protein.
our results revealed that cmss form a heterogeneous group, therefore, immunohistochemical examinations could support differential and final diagnosis.
although this study analyzed a limited number of samples, the reported results can expand our knowledge about cmss.
