we suggest that these factors do not apply to the scfv-piii fusion since it remains anchored to the bacterial inner membrane as part of the innate phage packaging and budding process.
this suggests that scfvs capable of high overall expression and display levels may not produce high yields of non phage-fused soluble protein in either the periplasmic or extracellular fractions of e. coli.
display propensity, overall expression and soluble localisation to the periplasm and extracellular fractions were clone specific characteristics which varied despite high levels of sequence homology.
differential degrees of periplasmic aggregation of non-fused scfv between clones may affect the partitioning of scfv in the periplasm and culture supernatant abrogating any correlation.
we characterised the relationship between overall scfv expression and display propensity for a panel of  <dig> anti-tetanus toxin scfvs and found a strong positive correlation  between the two parameters.
we conclude that in the absence of premature cytosolic aggregation or folding, the propensity of a scfv to be displayed on phage is directly related to its overall expression level and is thus indirectly influenced by factors such as codon bias, mrna abundance or putative dna motifs affecting expression.
they exhibit low thermodynamic stability, resulting in low levels of premature cytosolic folding or aggregation which facilitates sec yeg-mediated translocation and phage in e. coli.
there was no correlation between display of scfv or its expression in non-fused  form with soluble scfv localisation to the periplasm or culture supernatant.
