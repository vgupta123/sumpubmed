analyses of copy number variants in chicken breeds had focused primarily on those from commercial varieties with nothing known about the occurrence and diversity of copy number variants in locally raised chinese chicken breeds.
we presented a detailed analysis of the copy number variants in locally raised chinese chicken breeds identified using a customized comparative genomic hybridization array.
our description of the distribution of the copy number variants and comparison of the differences among the copy number variant regions of the  <dig> chicken breeds supplemented the information available concerning the copy number variants of other chinese chicken breeds.
to address this deficiency, we characterized copy number variants in  <dig> chicken breeds and compared the variation among these breeds.
principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed the close relatedness of the four locally raised chicken breeds, shek-ki, langshan, qingyuan partridge, and wenchang.
in addition to its relevance for functional analysis, our results provided the first insight into how chicken breeds can be clustered on the basis of their genomic copy number variation.
