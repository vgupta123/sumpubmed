these results were validated by rt-qpcr analysis for ten candidates genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, autophagy and skeletal muscle growth.
using illumina rna-seq technology, skeletal muscle sequence reads for g. chilensis were generated under control and handling stress conditions.
the present data demonstrated that handling stress promotes skeletal muscle atrophy in the marine teleost g. chilensis through the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems.
however, there is no information on the stress- and cortisol-induced mechanisms that decrease skeletal muscle growth in this teleost.
this study is an important step towards understanding the atrophy system in non-model teleost species and provides novel insights on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control skeletal muscle growth in early vertebrates.
furthermore, cortisol was a powerful inductor of skeletal muscle atrophy in fish myotubes.
although most fish follow a conserved pattern of stress response, with increased concentrations of cortisol, each species presents specificities in the cell response and stress tolerance.
the red cusk-eel  is a new economically important marine species for the chilean aquaculture industry.
additionally, using a primary culture of fish skeletal muscle cells, the effect of cortisol was evaluated in relation to red cusk-eel skeletal muscle atrophy.

reads were mapped onto a reference transcriptome, resulting in the in silico identification of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated transcripts.
gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of catabolic genes associated with skeletal muscle atrophy.
