vibrational spectroscopic imaging is now used in several fields to acquire molecular information from microscopically heterogeneous systems.
these features are then applied to tissue samples in order to visualize the chemical composition of the tissue without the use of chemical stains.
recent advances have led to promising applications in tissue analysis for cancer research, where chemical information can be used to identify cell types and disease.
however, recorded spectra are affected by the morphology of the tissue sample, making identification of chemical structures difficult.
