here we present insertionmapper, a pipeline tool for the identification of targeted sequences from multidimensional high throughput sequencing data.
this pipeline tool is applicable to similar scenarios requiring analysis of the tremendous output of short reads produced in ngs sequencing experiments of targeted genome sequences.
however, there is at present no available generalized tool for the computational analysis of target-enriched ngs data from multidimensional pools.
with adjustable parameters and experiment configurations, this tool can save great computational effort to biologists interested in identifying their sequences of interest within the huge output of modern dna sequencers.
insertionmapper consists of four independently working modules: data preprocessing, database modeling, dimension deconvolution and element mapping.
the advent of next-generation high-throughput technologies has revolutionized whole genome sequencing, yet some experiments require sequencing only of targeted regions of the genome from a very large number of samples.
insertionmapper is proven efficacious for the identification of target-enriched sequences from multidimensional high throughput sequencing data.
identified sequences are validated by pcr assays.
