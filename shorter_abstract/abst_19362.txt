yet it is becoming increasingly clear that long non-coding rnas  could represent a missing regulatory layer across a broad range of organisms.
to date, the regulatory elements orchestrating these critical parasite processes remain largely unknown.
this approach enabled the annotation of over one thousand lncrna transcript models and their comprehensive global analysis: coding prediction, periodicity, stage-specificity, correlation, gc content, length, location relative to annotated transcripts, and splicing.
our sample set profiled 56Â h of p. falciparum blood stage development.
as compared to neighboring mrnas, the expression of antisense-sense pairs was significantly anti-correlated during blood stage development, indicating transcriptional interference.
by contrast, antisense transcript levels significantly dropped during invasion.
to investigate the regulatory capacity of lncrna in p. falciparum, we harvested fifteen samples from two time-courses.
we then developed and validated strand-specific, non-polya-selected rna sequencing methods, and pursued the first assembly of p. falciparum strand-specific transcript structures from rna sequencing data.
non-polya-selected deep sequencing also enabled the prediction of hundreds of intriguing p. falciparum circular rnas, six of which we validated experimentally.
we also validated that p. falciparum produces circrnas, which is notable given the lack of rna interference in the organism, and discovered that a highly expressed, five-exon antisense rna is poised to regulate p. falciparum gametocyte development  <dig> , a gene required for early sexual commitment events.
