hordeum chilense is one of the wild relatives with a high potential for cereal breeding, due to its high crossability  and polymorphism for adaptation traits.
from the  <dig> wheat est-ssr markers tested for transferability and polymorphism in the wild barley genome,  <dig> primer pairs  gave cross-species transferability and  <dig> primer pairs  showed polymorphism.
a significant correlation between geographical and genetic distance was detected in the central chilean region for the first time in the species.
in addition, significant ecological influence in genetic distance has been detected for one of the population structure groups  in the central chilean region.
multi-allelic microsatellite markers have become the markers of choice for the determination of genetic structure in plants.
in order to analyze the genetic structure and ecogeographical adaptation of this wild species, it is necessary to increase the number of polymorphic markers currently available for the species.
the genetic structure and diversity was investigated in a collection of  <dig> h. chilense accessions, using a set of  <dig> ssr markers distributed across the seven chromosomes.
according to the results, the germplasm can be divided into two groups, with morphological and ecophysiological characteristics being key determinants of the population structure.
the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  alleles per locus and a mean polymorphic information content  of  <dig> .
synteny across cereals has allowed the cross-species and cross-genera transferability of ssr markers, which constitute a valuable and cost-effective tool for the genetic analysis and marker-assisted introgression of wild related species.
the latter were used for further analysis in the h. chilense germplasm.
finally, the association of the ssr markers with ecogeographical variables was investigated and one marker was found significantly associated with precipitation.
the h. chilense-triticum aestivum addition lines were used to test the chromosomal location of the new polymorphic microsatellite markers.
microsatellite markers showed a total of  <dig> alleles over all loci.
these findings have a potential application in cereal breeding.
