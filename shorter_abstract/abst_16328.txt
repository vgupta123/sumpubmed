a combination of de novo transcriptome assembly and dge analysis was shown to be a powerful method for identifying genes encoding enzymes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of important secondary metabolites in a non-model plant.
more than  <dig> million high-quality reads from a cdna library were generated and de novo assembled.
sequences for all of the known enzymes involved in tias synthesis were identified.
digital gene expression profile  analysis was performed on the three capsule developmental stages, and based on genes possessing expression profiles consistent with rin and irn levels; four cyp450s, three methyltransferases and three isomerases were identified as the candidates most likely to be involved in the later steps of rin and irn biosynthesis.
the transcriptome data from this study provides an important resource for understanding the formation of major bioactive constituents in the capsule extract from uncaria, and provides information that may aid in metabolic engineering to increase yields of these important alkaloids.
additionally,  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> ,  <dig> methyltransferase and  <dig> isomerase genes were identified, that are potential candidates for enzymes involved in rin and irn synthesis.
