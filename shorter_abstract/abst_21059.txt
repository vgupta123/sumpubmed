comparisons of expression patterns revealed  the redundancy of bmp <dig> expression with its homologs in presumably plesiomorphic expression domains, such as the fin fold, heart, and tail bud, which might have permitted its loss in the tetrapod lineage, and  the loss of craniofacial expression and gain of swim bladder expression of bmp <dig> after the gene duplication between bmp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  our findings highlight the importance of documenting secondary changes of gene repertoires and expression patterns in other gene families.
our molecular phylogenetic study revealed a high affinity of bmp <dig> to the bmp2/ <dig> subfamily.
in situ hybridization showed embryonic expression of the zebrafish bmp <dig> in the developing swim bladder, heart, tail bud, and ectoderm of pectoral and median fin folds in pharyngula stages, as well as gut-associated expression in 5-day embryos.
this suggests that the absence of a bmp <dig> ortholog in tetrapods is due to a secondary loss.
the target of the present study, the tgfÎ² superfamily, contains many genes involved in vertebrate development, and provides an ideal system to explore the relationships between evolution of gene repertoires and that of developmental programs.
importantly, further analyses based on the maximum-likelihood method unambiguously ruled out the possibility that this teleost-specific gene is a product of teleost-specific genome duplication.
whole genome sequences have allowed us to have an overview of the evolution of gene repertoires.
