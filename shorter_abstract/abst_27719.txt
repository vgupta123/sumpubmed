the peculiarities of the expression of clustered mirnas were studied using publicly available libraries of sequenced small rnas from different drosophila tissues.
the presence of exclusively upstream promoters in mirna clusters containing uncoordinated mirnas means that the clusters are transcribed as single transcription units.
the difference of tissue expression profiles of uncoordinated mirnas and the corresponding mirs* suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of their processing or stability.
we have shown that although mirnas from almost all clusters have similar tissue expression profiles , some clusters contain mirnas with uncoordinated expression profiles.
the expression profiles of mir and mir* sequences in uncoordinated clustered mirnas do not correlate while their profiles from the coordinated clustered mirnas are similar.
