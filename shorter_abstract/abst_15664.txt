chy silenced tubers showed more dramatic changes in carotenoid content than lcy-e silenced tubers, with beta-carotene increasing up to 38-fold and total carotenoids up to  <dig> -fold.
combination of different engineering strategies holds good promise for the manipulation of tuber carotenoid content.
these changes were accompanied by a decrease in the immediate product of beta-carotene hydroxylation, zeaxanthin, but not of the downstream xanthophylls, viola- and neoxanthin.
together with epsilon-cyclization of lycopene, beta-carotene hydroxylation is another regulatory step in potato tuber carotenogenesis.
