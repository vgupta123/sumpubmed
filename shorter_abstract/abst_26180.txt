using cdna microarrays and real-time pcr we found gene expression differences between the male and female embryonic brain  that may be independent of morphological differentiation of the gonads.
in conclusion, this study provides novel insights into sexually dimorphic gene expression in the embryonic chicken brain and its possible involvement in sex differentiation of the nervous system in birds.
genetic mechanisms independent of steroid hormones produced by the gonads have recently been suggested to partly explain these dimorphisms.
genes located on the sex chromosomes  were common among the differentially expressed genes, several of which  have previously been implicated in avian sex determination.
