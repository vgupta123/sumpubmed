we describe successful transmission in a cohabitation model with natural e. hepatopenaei -infected shrimp in closed, perforated plastic containers placed in aquaria together with free-swimming, uninfected shrimp.
a laboratory cohabitation model for studying e. hepatopenaei  has been developed and used to confirm that e. hepatopenaei  can be directly transmitted horizontally among shrimp via water.
after a period of 14Â days all the free-swimming shrimp tested positive by pcr  and gave positive histological and in situ hybridization results for e. hepatopenaei  in the hepatopancreas.
the model will facilitate studies on methods to prevent the e. hepatopenaei  transmission.
