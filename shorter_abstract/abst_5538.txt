laser capture microdissection  combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry  enabled the analysis of primary metabolite levels,which might be of plant or fungal origin, within these cells.
high levels of the amino acids, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, and glutamine, were observed in arbuscule-containing cells.
therefore tools allowing the analysis of molecular changes at a cellular level are required to reveal insight into arbuscular mycorrhizal  symbiosis development and functioning.
the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is characterized by the presence of different symbiotic structures and stages within a root system.
here we describe the analysis of metabolite pools in arbuscule-containing cells, which are the site of nutrient transfer between am fungus and host plant.
elevated amounts of sucrose and the steady-state of hexose levels indicated a direct assimilation of monosaccharides by the fungal partner.
