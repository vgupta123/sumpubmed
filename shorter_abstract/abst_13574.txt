microarray technology is commonly used as a simple screening tool with a focus on selecting genes that exhibit extremely large differential expressions between different phenotypes.
microarray technology yields multidimensional information on the function of the whole genome.
we also applied our procedure to a set of biological data and found some potentially important genes that were not selected by the traditional method.
it lacks the ability to select genes that change their relationships with other genes in different biological conditions .
