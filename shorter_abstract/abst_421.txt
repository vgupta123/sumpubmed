the release was evident by  <dig> min but further increased up to  <dig> h. to study the biological effects of protease release we tested supernatants from tc-ligrlo, tc-olrgil  and antigen-activated pmc for proteolytic activity by seeding with tnf , incubating for  <dig> h at 37Â°c, and measuring tnf remaining in the supernatants.
antigen and tc-olrgil induced no significant release of such proteolytic activity.
mast cell -derived serine proteases have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory processes.
these data indicate that a par-2ap induces the release of proteases from mast cells, which may degrade extracellular cytokines and other substrates thus modulating the inflammatory response.
western blot analysis of pmc supernatants revealed that a par-2ap, tc-ligrlo , stimulated the release of rat mc protease - <dig>  rmcp- <dig> and carboxypeptidase-a.
therefore, we hypothesized that specific par- <dig> agonist peptides  induce protease release from pmc.
