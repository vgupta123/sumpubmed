in this paper, we propose a novel predictive method that uses a support vector machine  and physicochemical properties to predict bioluminescent proteins.
to identify the most prominent features, we carried out feature selection with three different filter approaches, relieff, infogain, and mrmr.
so far, no specific method has been reported to identify bioluminescent proteins from primary sequence.
identification of bioluminescent proteins is more challenging due to their poor similarity in sequence.
blprot was trained using a dataset consisting of  <dig> bioluminescent proteins and  <dig> non-bioluminescent proteins, and evaluated by an independent set of  <dig> bioluminescent proteins and  <dig> non-bioluminescent proteins.
high prediction accuracy and successful prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that blprot can be a useful approach to identify bioluminescent proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.
