isogenic mutants in vapdhi were attenuated for survival inside human respiratory epithelial cells  and human brain microvascular endothelial cells , the in vitro models of mucosal infection and the blood-brain barrier, respectively.
although escherichia coli does not contain a homologue of either vapdhi or vapxhi, overexpression of the vapdhi toxin in trans resulted in e. coli cell growth arrest.
certain strains of an obligate parasite of the human upper respiratory tract, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae , can cause invasive diseases such as septicemia and meningitis, as well as chronic mucosal infections such as otitis media.
originally identified on plasmids, ta loci have been found on the chromosomes of a number of bacterial pathogens, and have been implicated in the control of translation during stressful conditions.
transcomplementation with a vapdhi allele restored wild-type nthi survival within both cell lines.
this arrest could be rescued by providing the vapxhi antitoxin on a compatible plasmid.
however, truncated protein subunits did interact with full-length subunits, and this interaction resulted in a dominant-negative phenotype.
we conclude that vapdhi and vapxhi may constitute a h. influenzae ta locus that functions to enhance nthi survival within human epithelial and endothelial cells.
a pcr survey of  <dig> h. influenzae strains isolated from various anatomical sites determined the presence of a vapdhiallele in 100% of strains.
subunits of full-length vapdhi homodimerized, but subunits of the truncated protein did not.
we have identified a facilitator of nthi survival inside human cells, virulence-associated protein d .
translation arrest would enhance survival within human cells and facilitate persistent or chronic mucosal infections.
to do this, the organism must invade and survive within both epithelial and endothelial cells.
