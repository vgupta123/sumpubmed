our results suggest an important role of mdp <dig> in persistent infection.
a class of proteins called mycobacterial histone-like proteins has been associated with regulation of replication and latency, but their precise role in the infection process has yet to be uncovered.
down-regulation of mdp <dig> resulted in reduced secretion of the cytokine il-1Î² by infected human pbmc.
mdp <dig> was revealed to be required for growth at acidic ph and for intracellular replication in human blood monocytes.
mdp <dig> from m. bovis bcg affects the growth at acidic ph and the intracellular replication in human monocytes.
this strain was now used to analyse the impact of reduced amount of mdp <dig> on the interaction with human blood monocytes, macrophage lines and pbmc .
our study aimed at defining the impact of the histone-like protein mdp <dig> from m. bovis bcg  on early steps of infection.
it furthermore affects cytokine secretion by host cells, and the formation of fused multi-nucleated macrophages.
mycobacterium tuberculosis differs from most pathogens in its ability to multiply inside monocytes and to persist during long periods of time within granuloma in a status of latency.
in monocyte preparations from human blood as well as in human and mouse macrophage cell lines, both the percentage of multi-nucleated cells and the number of nuclei per cell were much enhanced when the monocytes were infected with bcg expressing less mdp <dig>
