we find that the running time for computing the optimal center string is dominated by the subroutine calls for d = dopt - <dig> and d = dopt.
we describe how to use this information to speed up two previously published search tree algorithms.
finally, we present results of an evaluation study for two different data sets from a biological application.
in this paper, we focus on exact methods for the problem that are also swift in application.
the center string  problem is a classic computer science problem with important applications in computational biology.
we first introduce data reduction techniques that allow us to infer that certain instances have no solution, or that a center string must satisfy certain conditions.
given k input strings and a distance threshold d, we search for a string within hamming distance at most d to each input string.
our data reduction is very effective for both, either rejecting unsolvable instances or solving trivial positions.
