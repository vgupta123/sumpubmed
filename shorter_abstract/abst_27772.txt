our results demonstrate that each fln protein contributes to wild type growth, and acting additively are absolutely essential for plant growth and development.
here, we report the characterization of arabidopsis fln knockout alleles to examine the contribution of each gene in plant growth, chloroplast development, and in mediating pep-dependent transcription.
normal plastid development in both light and dark requires the flns, but surprisingly skotomorphogenesis is unaffected in fln seedlings.
additional work demonstrated that rnai-mediated reduction in fln expression specifically diminished transcription of pep-dependent genes.
induction of fln-ha after  <dig> hours of germination cannot rescue the mutant phenotype, indicating that the effects of loss of fln are not always reversible.
we show that fln plants have severe phenotypes with fln <dig> resulting in an albino phenotype that is seedling lethal without a source of exogenous carbon.
fln <dig> fln <dig> double mutant analysis reveals haplo-insufficiency, and fln <dig> fln <dig> plants have a similar, but more severe phenotype than either single mutant.
