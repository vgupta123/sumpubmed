we analyzed k-mer frequencies for a wide range of k. at this low genome coverage  highly repetitive 20-mers constituted 44% of the genome but represented only 1% of all possible k-mers.
the challenges of accurate gene prediction and enumeration are further aggravated in large genomes that contain highly repetitive transposable elements .
yet tes play a substantial role in genome evolution and are themselves an important subject of study.
here we introduce the tallymer software, a flexible and memory-efficient collection of programs for k-mer counting and indexing of large sequence sets.
among one hundred annotated bacterial artificial chromosomes , k-mer frequency could be used to detect transposon-encoded genes with 92% sensitivity, compared to 96% using alignment-based repeat masking, while both methods showed 92% specificity.
the tallymer software was effective in a variety of applications to aid genome annotation in maize, despite limitations imposed by the relatively low coverage of sequence available.
repeat annotation, based on counting occurrences of k-mers, has been previously used to distinguish tes from low-copy genic regions; but currently available software solutions are impractical due to high memory requirements or specialization for specific user-tasks.
among expressed sequence tags , a notable fraction contained high-copy k-mers, suggesting that transposons are still active in maize.
this gives a much larger flexibility concerning the choice of the k-mer size.
unlike previous methods, tallymer is based on enhanced suffix arrays.
