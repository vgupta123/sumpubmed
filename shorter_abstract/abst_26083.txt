the efficiency of the classification for each type of modification and the prediction power of the method is estimated here using recall , precision values, the area under receiver operating characteristic  curves and leave-one-out tests .
the training datasets, precompiled binaries for ams  <dig>  tool and the source code are available at http://code.google.com/p/automotifserver under the apache  <dig>  license scheme.
the significant differences in the performance for differently optimized neural networks are observed, yet the ams  <dig>  tool integrates those heterogeneous classification schemes into the single consensus scheme, and it is able to boost the precision and recall values independent of a ptm type in comparison with the currently available state-of-the art methods.
ten different physicochemical features describe each amino acid; therefore nine residues long segment is represented as a point in a  <dig> dimensional space.
the standalone version of ams  <dig>  presents an efficient way to indentify post-translational modifications for whole proteomes.
the database of sequence segments with confirmed by experiments post-translational modification sites are used for training a set of anns.
the query protein sequence is dissected into overlapping short sequence segments.
