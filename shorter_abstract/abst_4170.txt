this effect was modulated by long-term musical training: standard probability changes influenced mmn amplitude in the group of non-musicians only.
long-term musical training influences this encoding, in that non-musicians benefit to a greater extent from a good signal-to-noise ratio , while musicians are less dependent on the salience of an acoustic environment.

the amplitude of mmn from the right hemisphere was influenced by the standard probability.
this study indicates that pattern violations are detected automatically, even if they are of very low salience, both in non-musicians and musicians, with salience having a stronger impact on processing in the right hemisphere of non-musicians.
the human auditory cortex automatically encodes acoustic input from the environment and differentiates regular sound patterns from deviant ones in order to identify important, irregular events.
using magnetoencephalography , we investigated the mmn response to salient or less salient deviants by varying the standard probability  of a pattern oddball paradigm.
we observed significant mmn in all conditions, including the least salient condition , in response to violations of the predominant tone pattern for both groups.
it is also elicited by violations of more complex regularities and musical expertise has been shown to have an effect on the processing of complex regularities.
to study the effects of musical expertise in the encoding of the patterns, we compared the responses of a group of non-musicians to those of musicians.
