annotation sources include the go association database , the entrez gene2go table, and various manufacturersâ€™ array annotation files.
a software tool  was implemented that combines data from various publicly available sources and uses the gene ontology  project term relationships to produce gsea compatible hierarchical go based gene sets for all species for which association data is available.
go2msig enables the bioinformatician and non-bioinformatician alike to generate gene sets required for gsea analysis for almost any organism for which go term association data exists.
additional features include the ability to restrict by evidence code, to remap gene descriptors, to filter by set size and to speed up repeat queries by caching the go term hierarchy.
the tool can be used in standalone form, or via a web interface.
synonymous go terms are remapped to the version preferred by the go ontology supplied.
