this analysis provided mechanistic insights into how several molecules involved in t cell receptor signaling are regulated at the dna, rna and protein levels.
integrating multi-omics datasets allowed us to investigate genome-wide methylation and its effect on mrna/protein expression patterns, extent of rna editing under normal physiological conditions and allele specific expression in naïve cd4+ t cells.
availability of multi-omics data from an identical genetic background also allowed us to employ novel proteogenomics approaches to identify individual-specific variants and putative novel protein coding regions in the human genome.
in addition, we carried out a multi-omic comparative analysis of naïve with primary resting memory cd4+ t cells to identify molecular changes underlying t cell differentiation.
technological advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics have enabled massively parallel and unbiased measurements.
we utilized multiple high-throughput technologies to derive a comprehensive profile of two primary human cell types, naïve cd4+ t cells and memory cd4+ t cells, from a single donor.
here, we report the first multi-omic analysis of human primary naïve cd4+ t cells isolated from a single individual.
through vertical as well as horizontal integration of whole genome sequencing, methylation arrays, rna-seq, mirna-seq, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, we derived an integrated and comparative map of these two closely related immune cells and identified potential molecular effectors of immune cell differentiation following antigen encounter.

phosphoproteomics revealed downstream signaling events that regulate these two cellular states.
