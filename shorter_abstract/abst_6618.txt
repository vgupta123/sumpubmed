somatic embryo cultures were also modified to enable the production of plants with heritable mutations, with the frequency of dna modifications increasing with culture time.
a novel cloning strategy and vector system based on in-fusionÂ® cloning was developed to simplify the production of crispr/cas <dig> targeting vectors, which should be applicable for targeting any gene in any organism.
small deletions were the most common type of mutation produced, although snps and short insertions were also observed.
