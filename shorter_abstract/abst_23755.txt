have proved the importance of model checking approach by inferring new regulation of signaling crosstalk in c. elegans and confirming the regulation with biological experiments.
secondly, we employ two major biological fate determination rules – rule i and rule ii – to vpc fate model.
however, the understandings of hybrid lineages are hard to make on a discrete model because the hybrid lineage occurs when the system comes close to certain thresholds as discussed by sternberg and horvitz in  <dig>  our simulation results suggest that: rule i that cannot be applied with qualitative based model checking, is more reasonable than rule ii owing to the high coverage of predicted fate patterns .
however, since both discrete and continuous features appear to be an indispensable part of biological processes, it is more appropriate to use quantitative models to capture the dynamics of biological systems.
a novel method of modeling and simulating biological systems with the use of model checking approach is proposed based on hybrid functional petri net with extension  as the framework dealing with both discrete and continuous events.
the quantitative simulation-based model checking approach is a useful means to provide us valuable biological insights and better understandings of biological systems and observation data that may be hard to capture with the qualitative one.
we then conduct  <dig>  simulations for each of  <dig> sets of different genotypes, investigate variations of cell fate patterns under each genotype, and validate the two rules by comparing three simulation targets consisting of fate patterns obtained from in silico and in vivo experiments.
firstly, we construct a quantitative vpc fate model with  <dig> components by using hfpne.
in particular, an evaluation was successfully done by using our vpc fate model to investigate one target derived from biological experiments involving hybrid lineage observations.
