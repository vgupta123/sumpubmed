the adjusted herd prevalence of brucellosis was  <dig> %  and the adjusted individual animal prevalence was  <dig> %  based on diagnosis using commercial kits of the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for brucella abortus antibodies.
a risk factor could not be identified at the animal level but two risk factors were identified at the herd level: large herd size and history of abortion.
human brucellosis has been found to be prevalent in the urban areas of kampala, the capital city of uganda.
a cross-sectional study was designed to generate precise information on the prevalence of brucellosis in cattle and risk factors for the disease in its urban and peri-urban dairy farming systems.
mean within-herd prevalence was found to be  <dig> %  and brucellosis prevalence in an infected herd ranged from  <dig> % to 50%.
