from our experiments, clipcrop infer reliable svs for the data set with more than  <dig> bases read lengths and 20x depth of coverage, both of which are reasonable values in current ngs data set.
to assess the performance of clipcrop with other sv-detecting tools, we generated various patterns of simulation data – sv lengths, read lengths, and the depth of coverage of short reads – with insertions, deletions, tandem duplications, inversions and single nucleotide alterations in a human chromosome.
clipcrop can detect svs with higher discovering rate and call accuracy than any other tool in our simulation data set.
discordant pair approach, depth of coverage approach and split read approach, respectively.
structural variations  change the structure of the genome and are therefore the causes of various diseases.
we developed a new method and implementation named clipcrop for detecting svs with single-base resolution using soft-clipping information.
for comparison, we selected breakdancer, cnvnator and pindel, each of which adopts a different approach to detect svs, e.g.
