increased occurrence of outbreaks of v. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis in china indicates the need to evaluation of the prevalence of this pathogenic species.
v. parahaemolyticus distribution in shellfish from the eastern coast of china has been reported previously.
however, to date, the prevalence of v. parahaemolyticus in retail aquatic products in north china has not been determined.
to investigate the prevalence of v. parahaemolyticus in aquatic products in north china,  <dig> aquatic product samples were obtained from retail markets in  <dig> provinces of north china from november to december in  <dig> and july to august in  <dig>
v. parahaemolyticus was detected in  <dig>  of the samples by the most probable number method.
the density of v. parahaemolyticus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> mpn/g.
v. parahaemolyticus was detected at a rate of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in summer and in winter, respectively.
the density of v. parahaemolyticus was significantly higher in summer than in winter, with mean levels of  <dig>  mpn/g and  <dig>  mpn/g, respectively.
among 145 v. parahaemolyticus isolates examined, none of the isolates possessed tdh and trh.
the findings of this study will help in defining appropriate monitoring programs, understanding of the dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains, and providing information for the assessment of exposure to this microorganism at the consumption level.
