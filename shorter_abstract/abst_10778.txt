during the response to dehydration stress the changes in h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> patterns show different dynamics and specific patterns at up-regulated, down-regulated, and unaffected genes.
the molecular mechanisms of genome reprogramming during transcriptional responses to stress are associated with specific chromatin modifications.
we have no knowledge of chromatin modifications taking place at genes whose transcription has been down-regulated or on the genome-wide chromatin modification patterns that occur during the plant's response to dehydration stress.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing  we established the whole-genome distribution patterns of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> mono-, di-, and tri-methylation  in arabidopsis thaliana during watered and dehydration stress conditions.
the h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> marks are more widely distributed  than the h3k4me <dig> marks , but the h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> levels changed only modestly during dehydration stress.
the broad h3k4me <dig> distribution profiles on nucleosomes of stress-induced genes uncovered a specific chromatin pattern associated with many of the genes involved in the dehydration stress response.
a higher number  of annotated arabidopsis genes carry one or more types of h3k4me marks than previously reported.
available data, however, describe histone modifications only at individual plant genes induced by stress.
