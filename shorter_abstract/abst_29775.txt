we evaluated the molecular consequences of sleep and sleep deprivation outside the brain, in heart and lung.
these results mirror previous findings in brain.
our results also suggest that sleep may provide a zeitgeber, or synchronizing cue, in the lung as a large cluster of transcripts demonstrated systematic changes in inter-animal variability as a function of both sleep duration and circadian time.
dna repair and protein metabolism annotations were significantly enriched among the sleep-enhanced transcripts in the heart.
markers of cellular stress and the unfolded protein response were reduced during sleep in both tissues.
sleep specific transcripts in these tissues demonstrated highly significant overlap and shared temporal dynamics.
in each tissue, nearly two thousand genes demonstrated statistically significant differential expression as a function of sleep/wake behavioral state.
our data support the notion that the molecular consequences of sleep/wake behavioral state extend beyond the brain to include peripheral tissues.
we conclude that sleep enhances organ specific molecular functions and that it has a ubiquitous role in reducing cellular metabolic stress in both brain and peripheral tissues.
using microarrays we compared gene expression in tissue from sleeping and sleep deprived mice euthanized at the same diurnal times.
finally, our data suggest a novel role for sleep in synchronizing transcription in peripheral tissues.
transcripts related to carbohydrate and sulfur metabolic processes were enhanced by sleep in the lung, and collectively favor buffering from oxidative stress.
