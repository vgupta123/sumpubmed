the current extensive use of the domestic goat  is the result of its medium size and high adaptability as multiple breeds.
domestic goat mitogenomes descended from a small number of founding haplotypes that underwent domestication after surviving the last glacial maximum in the near eastern refuges.
we present the first extensive survey of goat mitogenomic variability based on  <dig> complete sequences selected from an initial collection of  <dig> samples that represent  <dig> different breeds of c. hircus, as well as its wild sister species, bezoar  from iran.
a common standard by which to analyze maternally-inherited variability of livestock species is through complete sequencing of the entire mitogenome .
zooarchaelogical data indicate that domestication first occurred in southeastern anatolia.
more than 90 % of goats examined were in haplogroup a. these domestic lineages are predominantly nested within c. aegagrus branches, diverged concomitantly at the interface between the epipaleolithic and early neolithic periods, and underwent a dramatic expansion starting from ~12–10 ka ago.
our phylogenetic analyses dated the most recent common ancestor of c. hircus to ~ <dig>  years  ago and identified five distinctive domestic haplogroups .
the novel diagnostic mutational motifs defined here, which distinguish wild and domestic haplogroups, could be used to understand phylogenetic relationships among modern breeds and ancient remains and to evaluate whether selection differentially affected mitochondrial genome variants during the development of economically important breeds.
