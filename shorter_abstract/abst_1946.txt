the enzyme activity was completely inhibited by pcmb, iodoacetate and depc indicating cysteine and histidine residues at the active site.
therefore, this protease may turn out to be an efficient choice for the pharmaceutical, medicinal, food, and biotechnology industry.
however, on addition of sulfhydryl reagents  reverse the strong inhibition by pcmb.
cprhg has a broad substrate specificity and stability in ph, temperature, etc.
proteolytic enzymes play central role in the biochemical mechanism of germination and intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and development.
immunoblot analysis shows that the enzyme synthesized as zymogen  and processed to a  <dig> kda proenzyme which was further degraded to give  <dig> kda active enzyme.
to study the mechanism of protein mobilization, undertaken the task of purifying and characterizing proteases, which occur transiently in germinating seeds of horse gram.
cysteine protease  was purified to homogeneity with  <dig> fold by four step procedure comprising crude extract, 2so <dig> fractionation, deae-cellulose and cm-sephacel chromatography from the  <dig> day germinating cotyledons of horse gram  verdc.).
cprhg composed of high content of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and serine.
