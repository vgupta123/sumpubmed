species from higher latitudes tended to be younger, and colour-polymorphic species were older than monomorphic species.
species that are colour polymorphic, viviparous, and/or live at low latitudes have exhibited resilience to past environmental changes, and hence may be better able to deal with current climate change.
mode of reproduction was important also, in that the age of oviparous species decreased with latitude, whereas no pattern was apparent for viviparous species.
we used phylogenetic comparative methods to show that color polymorphism, latitude and reproduction  affected the timing of the oldest diversification event within a species.
strong variations are observed between and within taxonomic groups in the age of extant species and these differences can clarify factors that render species more vulnerable to extinction.
we explored the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the timing of the oldest diversification event in over  <dig> vertebrate species distributed worldwide.
organisms which have already persisted for a long time may be more likely to deal with future modifications of their environment.
