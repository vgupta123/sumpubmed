we present a method for the efficient calculation of accurate saxs curves based on the debye formula and a set of scattering form factors for dummy atom representations of amino acids.
two coarse-grained representations of protein structure were investigated; two scattering bodies per amino acid led to significantly better results than a single scattering body.
the purpose of this study is to develop a method for the efficient calculation of accurate saxs curves from coarse-grained protein models.
we show that the obtained point estimates allow the calculation of accurate saxs curves from coarse-grained protein models.
small angle x-ray scattering  is an established low resolution method for routinely determining the structure of proteins in solution.
genome sequencing projects have expanded the gap between the amount of known protein sequences and structures.
such a method can for example be used to construct a likelihood function, which is paramount for structure determination based on statistical inference.
in conclusion, the presented method shows great promise for use in statistical inference of protein structures from saxs data.
our method was also comparable to crysol in recognizing native structures among native-like decoys.
no ad hoc scaling or correction factors are applied in the calculation of the curves.
we estimated the form factors using generated data from a set of high quality protein structures.
as a proof-of-concept, we combined the coarse-grained debye calculation with a previously described probabilistic model of protein structure, torusdbn.
the resulting curves are on par with the current state-of-the-art program crysol, which requires full atomic detail.
such a method avoids the computationally costly iteration over all atoms.
the limitations of current high resolution structure determination methods make it unlikely that this gap will disappear in the near future.
