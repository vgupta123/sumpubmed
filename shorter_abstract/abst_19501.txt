β-mannosidase is an important constituent of the mannan-degrading enzyme system and it plays an important role in many industrial applications, such as food, feed and pulp/paper industries as well as the production of second generation bio-fuel.
the results of phylogenetic analysis, amino acid alignment and biochemical properties indicate that the tth man <dig> is a novel β-mannosidase of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  the optimal activity of the tth man <dig> β-mannosidase was obtained at ph  <dig>  and 85°c and was stable over a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and exhibited  <dig> h half-life at 90°c.
therefore, the mannose-tolerant β-mannosidase with high catalytic efficiency for bioconversion of mannan has a great potential in the fields as above.
it displayed high tolerance to mannose, with a ki value of approximately  <dig> mm.
this work provides a novel and useful β-mannosidase with high mannose tolerance, thermostability and catalytic efficiency, and these characteristics constitute a powerful tool for improving the enzymatic conversion of mannan through synergetic action with other mannan-degrading enzymes.
