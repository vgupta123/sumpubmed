observed co-expression of a group of genes is frequently attributed to co-regulation by shared transcription factors.
we identified  <dig> experiments for human and mouse in the arrayexpress database where transcription factors were manipulated and which exhibited a significant number of differentially expressed genes.
we checked for over-representation of transcription factor binding sites in up- or down-regulated genes using the over-representation analysis tool opossum.
in  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments, this procedure identified the binding matrices of the affected transcription factors.
again, the detected motifs shared significant similarity with the matrices of the affected transcription factors.
this assumption has led to the hypothesis that promoters of co-expressed genes should share common regulatory motifs, which forms the basis for numerous computational tools that search for these motifs.
we also carried out de novo prediction of regulatory motifs shared by differentially expressed genes.
our results support the claim that functional regulatory motifs are over-represented in sets of differentially expressed genes and that they can be detected with computational methods.
