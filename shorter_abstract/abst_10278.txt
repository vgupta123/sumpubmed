the reference elisa i had a specificity of 100% in this study.
in assumed negative farms that were not continually monitored, more positive samples were found with elisa ii to iv.
to interpret the results, specificity and sensitivity data as well as agreement to a reference elisa must be available.
according to kappa coefficient, the results showed an almost perfect agreement between elisa i as reference and elisa ii and iii , and substantial agreement between elisa i and elisa iv .
in this study, three commercial elisas  were compared to a standard elisa .
the specificity and sensitivity of the tested commercial elisas, however, differed.
elisa ii had the highest specificity and elisa iii had the highest sensitivity in comparison to the reference elisa.
furthermore, serum samples of  <dig> pigs of prrsv positive herds,  <dig> pigs of monitored prrsv negative herds,  <dig> fatteners of assumed prrsv negative herds with unknown herd history and  <dig> wild boars were tested with all four elisas.
the specificity of the elisas determined in samples of monitored prrsv negative herds was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
elisa iv had a lower sensitivity and specificity than the other elisas.
sensitivity of elisa ii, iii and iv was  <dig> %, 100% and  <dig> %, respectively.
elisas ii and iii were able to detect seroconversion of vaccinated pigs with a similar reliability.
in recent years, several new elisas for the detection of antibodies against the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus  in pig serum have been developed.
