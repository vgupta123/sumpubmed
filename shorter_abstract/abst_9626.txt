the ncbi taxonomy provides one of the most powerful ways to navigate sequence data bases but currently users are forced to formulate queries according to a single taxonomic classification.
in this paper, we present a solution to the problem of generating modifications of the ncbi taxonomy, based on the computation of an edit script that summarises the differences between two classification trees.
our algorithms find the shortest possible edit script based on the identification of all shared subtrees, and only take time quasi linear in the size of the trees because classification trees have unique node labels.
given that there is not universal agreement on the classification of organisms, providing a single classification places constraints on the questions biologists can ask.
