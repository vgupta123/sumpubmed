it may also explain the frequent co-occurrence of several sex-ratio distorting parasite species in nature.
however, recent empirical studies indicate that some sex-ratio distorting parasites have retained the capability for horizontal transmission.
numerical simulations using biologically realistic parameters suggest that a feminising parasite is only likely to lose the capability for horizontal transmission if its host occurs at low density and/or has a male-biased primary sex ratio.
it is also demonstrated that even a small amount of horizontal transmission can allow multiple feminising parasites to coexist within a single host population.
finally it is shown that, by boosting its host's rate of population growth, a feminising parasite can increase its own horizontal transmission and allow the invasion of other, more virulent parasites.
the prediction that sex-ratio distorting parasites are likely to retain a degree of horizontal transmission has important implications for the epidemiology and host-parasite interactions of these organisms.
sex-ratio distorting parasites are of interest due to their effects upon host population dynamics and their potential to influence the evolution of host sex determination systems.
