the exhaustive nature of the search rules out alternative causes and supports previous findings of novel transcripts causing cytoplasmic male sterility.
we constructed the rubber tree mitochondrial genome of a cytoplasmic male sterile variety, bpm  <dig>  using  <dig> sequencing, including 8Â kb paired-end libraries, plus illumina paired-end sequencing.
the rubber tree, hevea brasiliensis, is an important plant species that is commercially grown to produce latex rubber in many countries.

we annotated this mitochondrial genome with the aid of illumina rna-seq data and performed comparative analysis.
the rubber tree variety bpm  <dig> exhibits cytoplasmic male sterility, inherited from the variety gt  <dig>
the novel transcript is consistent with changes that cause cytoplasmic male sterility through a slight reduction to atp production efficiency.
we then compared the sequence of bpm  <dig> to the contigs of the published rubber tree, variety rrim  <dig>  and identified a rearrangement that is unique to bpm  <dig> resulting in a novel transcript containing a portion of atp <dig>
