these variants in the revolver family shared the downstream region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5' first exon.
a putative tata box is located at base  <dig>  with a cap site at base  <dig> and a possible polyadenylation signal aataaa at base  <dig>  revolver shows considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives.
eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer t. dicoccoides in israel and high revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses.
by pcr with the 3'-flanking region of a typical genomic clone of revolver- <dig> used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1r and 5r could be simultaneously identified.
revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the triticeae genome.
it is the interesting finding because the majority of triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for bare- <dig> element in hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution.
there were  <dig> clones, which showed partial homology to revolver, among  <dig>  expressed sequence tagged  clones sourced from triticeae.
in these revolver homologues with lengths of 360- <dig> bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved , but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into  <dig> types, and did not have est sequences with open reading frames .
the remarkable quantitative differences among copy numbers of revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest strong amplification activity within the last  <dig>  years.
extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among  <dig> genotypes of the single species triticum dicoccoides collected from  <dig> populations in israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic stresses .
revolver cdnas varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp in length.
