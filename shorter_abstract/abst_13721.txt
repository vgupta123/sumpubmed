the presence of bidirectional promoters in all vertebrate species suggests that the promoters may be maintained in orthologous positions.
thus we used them as models to study the orthologous patterns of bidirectional promoters.
we validate hundreds of orthologous bidirectional promoters through the presence of orthologous flanking gene annotations in the second species.
in particular, more than one third of human bidirectional promoters annotated from spliced est annotations regulate ncrna, of which over 90% are lncrnas.
in this manuscript we report the cross-species comparisons between human and mouse genomes, where the bidirectional promoter sets regulating ucsc known genes and spliced est annotations were mapped from human to mouse and vice versa.
although evolutionary conservation shows a weaker signature in promoters than coding regions, our technique of mapping of orthologous genes shows that most bidirectional promoter arrangements are conserved across human and mouse genomes, suggesting a critical function.
we developed a method to annotate these regulatory regions by confirming the orthology of the genes found on each side of the promoters.
