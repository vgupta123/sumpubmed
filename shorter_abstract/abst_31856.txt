the gene ontology analysis suggested a number of altered biological processes in otsccs, including enhancements in phosphate transport, collagen catabolism, i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab signaling cascade, extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis, chemotaxis, as well as suppressions of superoxide release, hydrogen peroxide metabolism, cellular response to hydrogen peroxide, keratinization, and keratinocyte differentiation in otsccs.
genes that exhibit statistically significant differences in expression between otsccs and normal were identified.
genome-wide transcriptomic profiles were obtained for  <dig> primary otsccs and  <dig> matching normal tissues.
the head and neck/oral squamous cell carcinoma  is a diverse group of cancers, which develop from many different anatomic sites and are associated with different risk factors and genetic characteristics.
the oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma  is one of the most common types of hnoscc.
