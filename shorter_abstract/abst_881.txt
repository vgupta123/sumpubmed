our results show that, using the lp approach, we were able to train our potentials using a dataset of transient complexes only the newly developed potentials outperform three other known potentials in this test.
to achieve this we considered a set of  <dig> transient complexes and generated a large set of putative docked structures , based on a shape complementarity criterion, for each complex.
the demand on the potentials was to yield, for the native  structure, a potential energy lower than those of any of the non-native  structures.
the performance of the atom-based potentials was evaluated by a jackknife test on a set of  <dig> complexes taken from the zdock <dig>  decoys set.
