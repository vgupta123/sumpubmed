to characterize its regulatory functions, recd was genetically fused to recb through deletion and substitution mutations.
both fusion mutants proved to be recombination proficient, viable and resistant to dna damaging agents, and to have dna unwinding, atp-dependent dsdna exonuclease and chi genetic activities.
our findings suggest that the recb-recd fusion may form a recbd fusion protein and therefore affect recd assembly, but this does not change the three-dimensional structure of the heterotrimer.
the recb-recd fusion led to a decreased amount of the heterotrimer.
recd is a 5'-3' helicase and is required for the nuclease activity of recbcd and for tight binding to dsdna ends.
