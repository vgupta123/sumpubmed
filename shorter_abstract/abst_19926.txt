w. ichthyophaga is an extremophilic specialist that shows only low levels of adaptability and genetic recombination.
the analysis also reveals a significant enrichment in hydrophobins, which are cell-wall proteins with multiple cellular functions.
contrary to the closely related species wallemia sebi, w. ichthyophaga appears to have lost the ability for sexual reproduction.
to investigate the genomic basis of this exceptional phenotype, we obtained a de-novo genome sequence of the species type-strain and analysed its transcriptomic response to conditions close to the limits of its lower and upper salinity range.
this is reflected in the characteristics of its genome and its transcriptomic response to salt.
several protein families are significantly expanded or contracted in the genome.
half of these are differentially expressed, and most contain an unusually large number of acidic amino acids.
no unusual traits were observed in common salt-tolerance mechanisms, such as transport of inorganic ions or synthesis of compatible solutes.
availability of the genomic sequence is expected to facilitate further research into this unique species, and shed more light on adaptations that allow it to thrive in conditions lethal to most other eukaryotes.
the basidomycete wallemia ichthyophaga from the phylogenetically distinct class wallemiomycetes is the most halophilic fungus known to date.
instead, various data indicate a role of the cell wall of w. ichthyophaga in its response to salt.
it requires at least 10% nacl and thrives in saturated salt solution.
