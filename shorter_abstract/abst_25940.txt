a major determinant  for russeting development putatively involved in cuticle organization is proposed as a candidate for controlling the trait.
in this study we report the mapping of a major genetic russeting determinant on linkage group  <dig> of apple as inferred from the phenotypic observation in a segregating progeny derived from ‘renetta grigia di torriana’, the construction of a 20 k illumina snp chip based genetic map, and qtl analysis.
russeting is a disorder developed by apple fruits that consists of cuticle cracking followed by the replacement of the epidermis by a corky layer that protects the fruit surface from water loss and pathogens.
snp and ssr markers tightly co-segregating with the ru_rgt locus may assist the breeder selection.
although influenced by many environmental conditions and orchard management practices, russeting is under genetic control.
the difficulty in classifying offspring and consequent variable segregation ratios have led several authors to conclude that more than one genetic determinant could be involved, although some evidence favours a major gene .
