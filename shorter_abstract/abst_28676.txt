despite showing efficacy in in vitro functional assays, the human iga failed to protect against parasite challenge in vivo in mice transgenic for the human fcα receptor .
the lack of protection afforded by msp119-specific iga against parasite challenge in mice transgenic for human fcαri suggests that this antibody class does not play a major role in control of infection.
however, we cannot exclude the possibility that protective capacity may have been compromised in this model due to rapid clearance and inappropriate bio-distribution of iga, and differences in fcαri expression profile between humans and transgenic mice.
to explore the mechanism by which iga may mediate a protective effect, we generated fully human iga specific for the c-terminal 19-kda region of plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein  <dig> , a major target of protective immune responses.
this novel human iga bound antigen with an affinity comparable to that seen for an epitope-matched protective human igg <dig>  furthermore, the human iga induced significantly higher nadph-mediated oxidative bursts and degranulation from human neutrophils than the epitope-matched human igg <dig> from which it was derived.
