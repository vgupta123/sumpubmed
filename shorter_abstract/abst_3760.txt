advantages with these statistical methods include measurements of phylogenetic relationship with relatively small pieces of dna sampled from almost anywhere within genomes, detection of foreign/conserved dna, and homology searches.
tests were performed on distant homology searches with large dna sequences, detection of foreign/conserved dna, and plasmid-host similarity comparisons.
rofs were best suited for distant homology searches, whilst the hexanucleotide zom and mcm measures were more reliable measures in terms of phylogeny.
the dinucleotide zom method produced high correlation values when used to compare real genomes to an artificially constructed random genome with similar %gc, and should therefore be used with care.
our aim was to explore the reliability and best suited applications for some popular methods, which include relative oligonucleotide frequencies , di- to hexanucleotide zero'th order markov methods  and  <dig> order markov chain method .
these methods compare observed genomic frequencies of fixed-sized oligonucleotides with expected values, which can be determined by genomic nucleotide content, smaller oligonucleotide frequencies, or be based on specific statistical distributions.
the tetranucleotide zom measure was a good measure to detect horizontally transferred regions, and when used to compare the phylogenetic relationships between plasmids and hosts, significant correlation  was found with genomic gc content and intra-chromosomal homogeneity.
