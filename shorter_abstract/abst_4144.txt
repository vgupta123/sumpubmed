key to developing accurate predictive software will be a complete sampling of conformations accessible to protein structures.
pka values are a measure of the protonation of ionizable groups in proteins.
ionizable groups are involved in intra-protein, protein-solvent and protein-ligand interactions as well as solubility, protein folding and catalytic activity.
the pka shift of a group from its intrinsic value is determined by the perturbation of the residue by the environment and can be calculated from three-dimensional structural data.
combinatorial and regression analysis is also used in an attempt to find a consensus approach towards pka prediction.
the tendency of individual programs to over- or underpredict the pka value is related to the underlying methodology of the individual programs.
here we use a large dataset of experimentally-determined pkas to analyse the performance of different prediction techniques.
