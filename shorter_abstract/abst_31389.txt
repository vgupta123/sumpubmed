the capacity for true quadrupedal terrestrial locomotion in mystacina is a secondarily derived condition, reflected in numerous skeletal and muscular specializations absent in other extant bats.
the lack of ground-based predatory native nz mammals has been assumed to have facilitated the evolution of terrestrial locomotion and the unique burrowing behaviour of mystacina, just as flightlessness has arisen independently many times in island birds.
study of the myology of m. tuberculata indicates that these features are functionally correlated with terrestrial locomotion in this bat.
their presence in i. aenae suggests that this extinct mystacinid was also adapted for terrestrial locomotion, despite the existence of numerous ground-based mammalian predators in australia during the early miocene.
in combination with recent molecular divergence dates, the new postcranial material of i. aenae constrains the timing of the evolution of terrestrial locomotion in mystacinids to between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago .
mystacina tuberculata is also the last surviving member of mystacinidae, the only mammalian family endemic to new zealand  and a member of the gondwanan bat superfamily noctilionoidea.
new postcranial remains of an early miocene mystacinid from continental australia, icarops aenae, offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis.
several distinctive derived features of the distal humerus are shared by the extant mystacina tuberculata and the early miocene australian mystacinid icarops aenae.
new zealand's lesser short-tailed bat mystacina tuberculata is one of only two of c. <dig> extant bat species to use a true walking gait when manoeuvring on the ground .
rather, selective advantage appears to be the primary evolutionary driving force behind habitual terrestriality in the rare bats that walk.
