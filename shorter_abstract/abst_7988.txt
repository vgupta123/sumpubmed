phage display antibody libraries have been made from the lymphocytes of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases in which the antibodies are known to play a role in the pathogenesis or are important for the diagnosis of the disease.
this can be proposed as a general method to study the pathogenic role of autoimmune antibodies in autoimmune diseases.
these are produced by genetic fusion of anti-ttg scfv to human, mouse or rat fc domains, making them suitable for in vivo expression.
finally, the in vivo expression in mice leads to detectable serum levels with no apparent gross immune response by the host.
in this work we demonstrated the usefulness of a method for the in vivo expression of miniantibodies specific to transglutaminase, corresponding to the autoimmune specificity of celiac disease.
the results obtained here indicate that the miniantibody molecule is efficiently secreted, and that the reactivity to the antigen is retained even after fusion to heterologous fc domains.
in the case of celiac disease, the immune response is directed against the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase.
