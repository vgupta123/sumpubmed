despite a large amount of information on microbial proteases, a search for novel proteases with unique properties is still of interest for both basic and applied aspects of this highly complex class of enzymes.
of the  <dig>  clones screened, all six isolated positive clones comprised one overlapping open reading frame of 45% identity to the aprx gene from bacillus species.
the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme showed optimal catalytic conditions at ph  <dig>  and 55Â°c, based on the azocasein assay containing  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  maximum catalytic activity was found at  <dig> m nacl with residual activity of 30% at  <dig> m nacl.
this gene, designated aprx-sk <dig> was cloned into pet21d and over-expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  the enzyme product, designated aprx-sk <dig>  was purified by an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity and characterized.
we propose the name of this new family as alkaline serine protease-x .
microbial proteases are one of the most commercially valuable enzymes, of which the largest market share has been taken by subtilases or alkaline proteases of the bacillus species.
thermal stability of the enzyme was also enhanced by  <dig> m nacl.
the enzyme activity was sensitive towards reducing agents, urea, and sds, but relatively stable up to 5% of h2o <dig>  phylogenetic analysis suggested that aprx-sk <dig> belongs to a novel family of the subtilase superfamily.
oxidant stable proteases  have been shown to have a wide application in the detergent and bleaching industries and recently have become one of the most attractive enzymes in various biotechnological applications.
the stability towards h2o <dig> and moderately halo- and thermo-tolerant properties of the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme are attractive for various biotechnological applications.
a gene encoding a novel member of the subtilase superfamily was isolated from virgibacillus sp.
