to further investigate the genetics underlying interspecific variation in aggressiveness,  <dig> wild individuals from five baboon species  were screened for two polymorphisms in promoter regions of genes relevant for the 5-ht system .
surprisingly, despite considerable interspecific variation in aggressiveness, baboons are monomorphic in 5-httlpr, except for p. hamadryas, which carries one additional allele.
accordingly, this locus cannot be linked to behavioral variation among species.
aggressiveness is a quantitative trait that is highly heritable.
due to considerable variation in allele frequencies among populations of the same species, this genotype cannot be invoked to explain variation in aggressiveness at the species level.
a comparison among  <dig> papionin species, including nine species of macaques, shows that the most common baboon allele is similar to the one described for barbary macaques , probably representing the ancestral allele in this tribe.
the results on maoalpr alleles in papio indicate that variation in the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters and associated behaviors is more important among populations than among species.
we, therefore, propose to compile behavioral data from additional populations of papio to obtain further insight into the genetics underlying behavioral differences among primate species.
there is considerable variation in aggressiveness among individuals both within and among species.
aggressive behaviors are an integral part of competitive interactions.
it should be noted that  all baboons live in africa, but within macaca only m. sylvanus lives on this continent.
