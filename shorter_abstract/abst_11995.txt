this tube-dwelling worm forms dense colonies on the surface of hydrothermal chimneys and can withstand long periods of hypo/anoxia and long phases of exposure to hydrogen sulphides.
to survive, alvinella has developed numerous adaptations at the physiological and molecular levels, such as an increase in the thermostability of proteins and protein complexes.
a. pompejana specifically inhabits chimney walls of hydrothermal vents on the east pacific rise.
a. pompejana inhabits deep-sea hydrothermal vents and is currently known as one of the most thermotolerant eukaryotes in marine environments, withstanding the largest known chemical and thermal ranges .
their composition shows enrichment in positively charged amino acids that might contribute to their thermostability.
this pool is enriched in glycoproteins that play a key role in intercellular communication, hormonal regulation and immunity.
we have constructed four full length enriched cdna libraries to investigate the biology and evolution of this intriguing animal.
our annotation reveals a good coverage of most animal pathways and networks with a prevalence of transcripts involved in oxidative stress resistance, detoxification, anti-bacterial defence, and heat shock protection.
the gene content of alvinella reveals that an important pool of genes previously considered to be specific to deuterostomes were in fact already present in the last common ancestor of the bilaterian animals, but have been secondarily lost in model invertebrates.
alvinella proteins seem to show a slow evolutionary rate and a higher similarity with proteins from vertebrates compared to proteins from arthropods or nematodes.
