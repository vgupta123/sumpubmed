we present a method, statistical algorithm for variant frequency identification , to estimate the frequency of alleles in a set of samples.
analyzing sequencing data through estimating allele frequencies using empirical bayes methods is a powerful complement to the ever-increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies.
in this case, the progression of the disease can be traced through the trajectory of the frequency of the oncogenic alleles.
the method employs bayesian analysis and uses an iterative procedure to derive empirical priors.
the approach allows for the comparison of allele frequencies across several samples, e.g.
many problems in biomedical research can be posed as a comparison between related samples .
thus obtaining precise estimates of the frequency of abnormal alleles at various stages of the disease is paramount to understanding the processes driving it.
a commonly occurring application is the identification of somatic mutations occurring in tumor tissue samples driving a single cell to expand clonally.
