fruiting bodies contain a number of cell types not found in vegetative mycelium, and these morphological differences are thought to be mediated by changes in gene expression.
however, little is known about the spatial distribution of gene expression in fungal development.
here, we used laser microdissection  and rna-seq to determine gene expression patterns in young fruiting bodies  and non-reproductive mycelia of the ascomycete sordaria macrospora.
quantitative analysis showed major differences in the gene expression patterns between protoperithecia and total mycelium.
this allowed a high spatial resolution and sensitivity, and yielded a detailed picture of gene expression during development.
our data revealed significant differences in gene expression between protoperithecia and non-reproductive mycelia, and showed that the transcription factor pro <dig> is involved in the regulation of many genes expressed specifically in sexual structures.
the lm/rna-seq approach will also be relevant to other eukaryotic systems in which multicellular development is investigated.
during sexual development, filamentous ascomycetes form complex, three-dimensional fruiting bodies for the protection and dispersal of sexual spores.
rna-seq analysis of protoperithecia from the sterile mutant pro <dig> showed that many genes that are differentially regulated in these structures are under the genetic control of transcription factor pro <dig>
