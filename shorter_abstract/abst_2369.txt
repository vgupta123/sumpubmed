we have used transcriptome sequencing to systematically elucidate the contents the c. geographus venom duct, dividing it into four segments in order to investigate each segmentâ€™s mrna contents.
moreover, the most highly expressed venom component is not paralytic, but causes sensory disorientation and is expressed in a different segment of the venom duct from venoms believed to cause sensory disruption.
furthermore, venom expression profiles also suggest a sophisticated layering of venom-expression patterns within the venom duct, with disorientating and paralytic venoms expressed in different regions.
the fish-hunting cone snail, conus geographus, is the deadliest snail on earth.
we have also identified several new toxins of interest for pharmaceutical and neuroscience research.
conus geographus is believed to prey on fish hiding in reef crevices at night.
in the absence of medical intervention, 70% of human stinging cases are fatal.
thus, our transcriptome analysis provides a new physiological framework for understanding the molecular envenomation strategy of this deadly snail.
