to identify genes involved in cr development, we compared global gene expression profile in stem bases of crl <dig> mutant and wild-type  plants.
auxin induces crl <dig> expression and consequently it is expected that auxin also alters the expression of genes that are early regulated by crl <dig>  to identify genes under the early control of crl <dig>  we monitored the expression kinetics of a selected subset of genes, mainly chosen among those exhibiting differential expression, in crl <dig> and wt following exogenous auxin treatment.
nevertheless some genes, fas1/fsm, gte <dig> and map, require crl <dig> to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by crl <dig>  these genes have a function related to polarized cell growth, cell cycle regulation or chromatin remodelling.
among the few characterized rice mutants affected in root development, crown rootless <dig> mutant is unable to initiate crown root primordia.
fsm/fas <dig> and gte <dig> are known in rice and arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively.
crown rootless <dig>  is induced by auxin and encodes an as2/lob-domain transcription factor that acts upstream of the gene regulatory network controlling cr development.
this suggests that these genes are controlled by crl <dig> and involved in cr initiation in rice.
in rice, the major part of the post-embryonic root system is made of stem-derived roots named crown roots .
our data showed that the differential regulation of most genes in crl <dig> versus wt may be an indirect consequence of crl <dig> inactivation resulting from the absence of cr in the crl <dig> mutant.
this analysis revealed that most of these genes, mainly related to hormone, water and nutrient, development and homeostasis, were likely not regulated directly by crl <dig>  we hypothesized that the differential expression for these genes observed in the crl <dig> mutant is likely a consequence of the absence of cr formation.
