the strong induction of the urea cycle, in combination with increased expression of enzymes of the tricarboxylic-acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, indicated a strong stimulation of amino-acid oxidation peaking at  <dig> hours.
hence, gene-expression profiling, pathway, network and gene-set enrichment analysis and immunohistochemistry were carried out on mouse liver after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of fasting.
the continuous high expression of enzymes of the urea cycle, malate-aspartate shuttle, and the gluconeogenic enzyme pepck and the re-appearance of glycogen in the pericentral hepatocytes indicate that amino-acid oxidation yields to glucose and glycogen synthesis during prolonged fasting.
liver structure and metabolic zonation were preserved.
expression profiling and pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in amino-acid, lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism responded most significantly to fasting, that the response peaked at  <dig> hours, and had largely abated by  <dig> hours.
the induction of genes involved in the unfolded-protein response underscored the cell stress due to enhanced energy metabolism.
liver wet weight had declined ~ <dig>  ~ <dig>  ~ <dig> and ~10% per day after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of fasting, respectively.
the changes in liver gene expression during fasting indicate that, in the mouse, energy production predominates during early fasting and that glucose production and glycogen synthesis become predominant during prolonged fasting.
at this time point, fatty-acid oxidation and ketone-body formation were also induced.
the contribution of individual organs to the whole-body adaptive response to fasting has not been established.
