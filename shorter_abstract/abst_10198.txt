epec are characterized by an attaching and effacing virulence mechanism.
the attenuated strain was able to persist in the intestinal lumen, where it elicited an immune response against epec-related virulence proteins, as was shown using an espb-specific elisa.
after verifying its complete loss of virulence, we used the attenuated strain in vaccination-challenge experiments in which complete protection against a homologous, but virulent, strain was observed.
such a combination vaccine may be developed using intimin null mutants, as the latter were clearly shown to be safe and effective against homologous infections.
these data indicate that protection against repec infections is at least partly bio-/serogroup dependent and a multivalent vaccine may be needed for protection against the full range of repec types.
we constructed an intimin deletion mutant of the rabbit epec  wild-type strain 97/ <dig>   and examined its protective capacity.
