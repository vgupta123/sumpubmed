swine plays an important role as a carrier of this pathogen.
our results indicate that swine is a significant reservoir of stec strains in china.
based on comparison by serotypes and sequence types with human strains and presence of virulence genes, the swine stec may have a low potential to cause human disease.
a total of  <dig> samples, including  <dig> fecal,  <dig> small intestinal contents and  <dig> colon contents samples, was analyzed.

all  <dig> stec isolates harbored stx <dig> only, all of which were stx2e subtype including  <dig> isolate being a new variant of stx2e.
the majority of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline , nalidixic acid , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  and kanamycin .
isolates of the same sts generally showed the same or similar drug resistance patterns.
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  is recognized as an important human diarrheal pathogen.
the stec isolates were divided into  <dig> pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and  <dig> sequence types .
two hundred and fifty five samples were stx-positive by pcr and  <dig> stec isolates were recovered from  <dig> stx-positive samples.
<dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % stec isolates carried asta, hlya and ehxa respectively.
four stec isolates harbored the high-pathogenicity island.
of the  <dig> adherence-associated genes tested,  <dig>  were all absent while  <dig>  were present in  <dig> and  <dig> stec isolates respectively.
a higher proportion of stec isolates from chongqing showed multidrug resistance with one st  resistant to  <dig> antimicrobials.
