in addition to confirming literature results, progolemâ€™s model has a 10-fold cross-validated predictive accuracy that is superior, at the 95% confidence level, to another ilp system previously used to study protein/hexose interactions and is comparable with state-of-the-art statistical learners.
the development of ilp systems which can learn rules of the complexity required for studies on protein structure remains a challenge.
in this work we use a new ilp system, progolem, and demonstrate its performance on learning features of hexose-protein interactions.
the rules also reveal a previously unreported dependency for residues cys and leu.
the rules induced by progolem detect interactions mediated by aromatics and by planar-polar residues, in addition to less common features such as the aromatic sandwich.
an appropriate machine learning approach is inductive logic programming , which automatically generates comprehensible rules in addition to prediction.
this paper shows that inductive logic programming implemented in progolem can derive rules giving structural features of protein/ligand interactions.
