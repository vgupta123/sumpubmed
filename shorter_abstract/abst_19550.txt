a tolerance-associated gene candidate encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase viii  was selected for functional characterization.
genetic loss-of-function analysis of the lrr-rlk viii gene revealed altered as sensitivity and the metal accumulation in roots.
here, we report on transcriptional changes with as treatment in two arabidopsis accessions, col- <dig> and ws- <dig>
