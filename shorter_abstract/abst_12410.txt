this cross-sectional prospective survey provided a useful method for the collection of information on the indication-based use of antimicrobials in different animal species.
cattle were the most commonly treated animal species during the study period.
as cattle received most of the treatments, results from the survey are given using cattle as an example species.
of the parenteral treatments , benzyl penicillin was used in 83% of the treated animals , while fluoroquinolones were used in  <dig> cases .
benzyl penicillin was the drug most frequently used for the treatment of mastitis, which seems appropriate according to the national guidelines on the use of antimicrobials in cattle in finland.
for cattle, the most common reason for treatment was acute mastitis , followed by dry-cow therapy , subclinical mastitis  and treatment for acute enteritis .
for acute mastitis, parenteral or intramammary treatment was used in 36% and 34% of the cases, respectively.
the most common indication for antimicrobial use in cows was mastitis.
of the  <dig> cows receiving intramammary treatment, ampicillin combined with cloxacillin was most commonly used , followed by cephalexin+streptomycin .
indication-based data on the use of antimicrobials in animals were collected using a prospective cross-sectional survey, similarly as for surveys carried out in human medicine, but adapting the questionnaire to include veterinary-specific issues.
