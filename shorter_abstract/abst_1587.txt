here, we report the complete moss genome re-annotation  incorporating the increased transcript availability from a multitude of developmental stages and tissue types.
we demonstrate the utility of the improved p. patens genome annotation for comparative genomics and new extensions to the cosmoss.org resource as a central repository for this plant “flagship” genome.
comparative analysis of gene structure evolution along the green plant lineage provides novel insights, such as a comparatively high number of loci with 5’-utr introns in the moss.
the structural annotation of  <dig>  protein-coding genes results in  <dig> additional loci including  <dig> loci with known protein domains or homologs in plantae.
therefore, in the light of accumulating evidence for missing genes, fragmentary gene structures, false annotations and a low rate of functional annotations on the original release, we decided to improve the moss genome annotation.
functional annotations were improved regarding quality and coverage, resulting in 58% annotated loci  that comprise also  <dig> additional loci with go annotations.
comparative analysis of functional annotations reveals expansions of moss house-keeping and metabolic genes and further possibly adaptive, lineage-specific expansions and gains including at least 13% orphan genes.
the moss physcomitrella patens as a model species provides an important reference for early-diverging lineages of plants and the release of the genome in  <dig> opened the doors to genome-wide studies.
access and manual curation of the functional and structural genome annotation is provided via the http://www.cosmoss.org model organism database.
