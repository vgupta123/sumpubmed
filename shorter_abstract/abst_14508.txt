an ability to extract ancient dna from holocene sediments potentially allows exciting new insights into the genetic consequences of long-term environmental change.
the low dna copy numbers we found in fossil material and the discovery of multiple sequence variants from single macrofossil extractions highlight the need for careful experimental and laboratory protocols.
exceptions suggest that dna molecules from surrounding nearby sediments may permeate or adhere to macrofossils in sediments.
this will allow changes in census populations, estimated from fossils and associated sediment, to be directly associated with population genetic changes.
we successfully sequenced dna from  <dig> samples  comprised of bulk sediment and seeds, leaf fragments, budscales, and samaras extracted from holocene lake sediments in the western great lakes region of north america.
quaternary plant ecology in much of the world has historically relied on morphological identification of macro- and microfossils from sediments of small freshwater lakes.
