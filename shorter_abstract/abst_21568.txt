eggplant  and turkey berry , a wild ally of eggplant with promising multi-disease resistance traits, are of great economic, medicinal and genetic importance, but genomic resources for these species are lacking.
from these data, it appears that eggplant and its wild leptostemonum clade relative turkey berry split from each other in the late miocene, ~ <dig>  million years ago, and that leptostemonum split from the potatoe clade in the middle miocene, ~ <dig>  million years ago.
these resources establish a foundation for further investigations of eggplant biology and for agricultural improvement of this important vegetable.
furthermore,  <dig> and  <dig> plant resistance genes were identified in eggplant and turkey berry respectively, indicating the variation of disease resistance genes between them.
in the present study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of eggplant and turkey berry to accelerate research on these two non-model species.
we obtained  <dig>  unigenes for eggplant and  <dig>  unigenes for turkey berry.
comparison of eggplant, turkey berry and another  <dig> plant proteomes resulted in  <dig> high-confidence single-copy orthologous groups, reasonable phylogenetic tree inferences and reliable divergence time estimations.
