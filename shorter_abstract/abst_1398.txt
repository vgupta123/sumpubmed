using this method, we provide evidence that intronic splicing regulation occurs predominantly within  <dig> bp of the alternative splice sites and that conserved elements in this region are, as expected, functioning as splicing regulators.
we achieve nearly identical performance using only the conservation score  of each splice junction normalized by average conservation over  <dig> bp of the corresponding flanking intron, demonstrating that conservation is an unexpectedly powerful indicator of alternative splicing patterns.
we also propose a new definition of intronic splicing regulatory elements  that is independent of conservation, and show that most isres do not match known binding sites or splicing factors despite being predictive of percent-spliced-in.
these findings suggest that one mechanism for the evolutionary transition from constitutive to alternative splicing is the emergence of cis-acting splicing inhibitors.
we present a computational model that predicts absolute  percent-spliced-in of cassette exons more accurately than previous models, despite not using any ‘hand-crafted’ biological features such as motif counts.
exclusion of cassette exons, also called exon skipping, is the most common type of alternative splicing in mammals.
we show that among conserved cassette exons, increased conservation of flanking introns is associated with reduced inclusion.
the association of our isres with differences in splicing suggests the existence of novel rna-binding proteins and/or novel splicing roles for known rna-binding proteins.
