after exposure to cre recombinase, the transgene stopped egfp expression and began expression of rfp and a mirna, which silenced the expression of specific cellular genes.
this construct initially expressed egfp gene, which was flanked by loxp sites.
transgenic rnai holds promise as a simple, low-cost, and fast method for reverse genetics in mammals.
further experiments indicate that the 3'-utr intron enhances rfp expression by its intrinsic gene-expression-enhancing activity and by eliminating the inhibitory effect of the pre-mirna on the expression of rfp.
we have designed and tested a conditional mirna-expression construct and showed that this construct expresses both the marker genes strongly and can silence the target gene efficiently upon cre-mediated induction of the mirna expression.
this construct can be used to increase the efficiency of making cell lines or transgenic animals that stably express mirna targeting specific genes.
one expressed a red fluorescent protein  and a mirna placed in its 3' untranslated region .
based on these findings, we incorporated the intron-embedded pre-mirna design into a conditional expression construct that employed the cre-loxp system.
furthermore, because microrna  targeting specific genes can be expressed simultaneously with protein coding genes, incorporation of fluorescent marker proteins can simplify the screening and analysis of transgenic rnai animals.
