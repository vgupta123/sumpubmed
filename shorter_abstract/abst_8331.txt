evaluation results on simulated sequencing reads showed that the application of contextmap to either tophat or mapsplice mappings improved the mapping accuracy of both initial mappings considerably.
using our method, mappings provided by other state-of-the-art methods can be refined and alignment accuracy can be further improved.
as a simple alignment to the genome will fail to identify reads crossing splice junctions and a transcriptome alignment will miss novel splice sites, several approaches have been developed for this purpose.
although contextmap can be used as a stand-alone version using either a genome or transcriptome as input, the version presented in this article is focused on refining initial mappings provided by other mapping algorithms.
second, in case of multiple possible mappings, the mapping with the fewest mismatches is usually chosen which may lead to wrong assignments due to sequencing errors.
