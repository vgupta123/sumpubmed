although crispr/cas enables one-step gene cassette knock-in, assembling targeting vectors containing long homology arms is a laborious process for high-throughput knock-in.
we recently developed the crispr/cas-based precise integration into the target chromosome  system for a gene cassette knock-in without long homology arms mediated by microhomology-mediated end-joining.
by combining the exo <dig> and pitch-directed donor vectors, we achieved convenient one-step knock-in of gene cassettes and floxed allele both in human cells and mouse zygotes.
our results provide a technical platform for high-throughput knock-in.
here, we identified exonuclease  <dig>  as an enhancer for pitch in human cells.
