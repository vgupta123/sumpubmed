we developed a computational strategy that identifies clusters of patients in a synthetic patient network according to their genetic overlap and phenotype enrichments.
for this method, we analyzed a dataset of structural variants and phenotypes for  <dig>  patients from the decipher database, which encompasses one of the most comprehensive collections of pathogenic copy number variations  and their associated ontology-controlled phenotypes.
here we make use of patient genomic data to exploit different network-based analyses to study genetic and phenotypic relationships between individuals.
given the growing availability of personalized genomic and phenotypic profiles, network models offer a robust integrative framework for the analysis of "omics" data, allowing the characterization of the molecular aetiology of pathological processes underpinning genetic diseases.
network medicine is a promising new discipline that combines systems biology approaches and network science to understand the complexity of pathological phenotypes.
