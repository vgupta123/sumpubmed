the effects on mutation frequency and alteration of dna structure were compared.
heavy-ion beams show high linear energy transfer  and thus more effectively induce dna double-strand breaks than other mutagenic techniques.
therefore, c ions with letmax might be useful as a highly efficient reverse genetic system in conjunction with snp detection systems, and will be beneficial for forward genetics and plant breeding.
these small alterations can be determined by single-nucleotide polymorphism  detection systems.
the c ions with letmax showed high mutation efficiency and predominantly induced base substitutions or small deletions/insertions, most of which were null mutations.
the mutation frequency induced by c ions with letmax was two-fold higher than that with  <dig>  kev Î¼m- <dig> and similar to the mutation frequency previously induced by ethyl methane sulfonate.
previously, we determined the most effective heavy-ion let  for arabidopsis mutagenesis by analysing the effect of let on mutation induction.
over 80% of the mutations caused by c ions with both lets were base substitutions or deletions/insertions of less than  <dig> bp.
