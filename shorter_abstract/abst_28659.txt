thousands of papers and talks include phylogeny figures, and often during everyday work, one would like to quickly get a graphical display of, e.g., the phylogenetic relationship between a set of sequences as calculated by an alignment program such as clustalw or the phylogenetic package phylip.
this paper presents an online tool, phy·fi, which encompasses all the qualities of existing online programs and adds functionality to hopefully eliminate the need for post-processing the phylogeny figure in some other general-purpose graphics program.
phy·fi is fast and easy to use, yet still offers full color control, tree manipulation, and several image formats.
the need to depict a phylogeny, or some other kind of abstract tree, is very frequently experienced by researchers from a broad range of biological and computational disciplines.
the user can create a color figure from any phylogeny, or other kind of tree, represented in the widely used parenthesized newick format.
