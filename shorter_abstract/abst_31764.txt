this study demonstrates that svm based qsar model can predict substrate specificity of major cyp isoforms with high accuracy.
different isoforms of cytochrome p <dig>  metabolized different types of substrates  and make them soluble during biotransformation.
we have also evaluated the performance of our model on an independent dataset of  <dig> drug molecules and achieved average accuracy  <dig> %.
thirdly, support vector machine  based qsar models were developed using  <dig> best descriptors and achieved an average accuracy of  <dig> %, evaluated using fivefold cross-validation.
this is possible to develop highly accurate models for predicting substrate specificity of major isoforms using cdk descriptors.
therefore, fate of any drug molecule depends on how they are treated or metabolized by cyp isoform.
all models were trained and tested on  <dig> approved drug molecules.
firstly,  <dig> molecular descriptors for each drug molecule were calculated using various softwares.
these models can be used to predict isoform responsible for metabolizing a drug molecule.
a web server metapred has been developed for predicting metabolizing isoform of a drug molecule http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/metapred/.
there is a need to develop models for predicting substrate specificity of major isoforms of p <dig>  in order to understand whether a given drug will be metabolized or not.
secondly, best  <dig> descriptors were selected using general and genetic algorithm.
in addition, svm based models were developed using  <dig> chemistry development kit  molecular descriptors and achieved an average accuracy of  <dig> %.
