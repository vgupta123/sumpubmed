for users who would like to further analyze the output data with their favourite software, raw results can also be downloaded.
normal mode analysis  has become the method of choice to investigate the slowest motions in macromolecular systems.
the tool can be applied to for example membrane transporters and provides biologists studying transmembrane proteins with an approach to investigate which α-helices are likely to undergo the largest displacements, and hence which helices are most likely to be involved in the transportation of molecules in and out of the cell.
each analysis is performed independently from the others and results can be visualized using only a web browser.
it relies on the hypothesis that the vibrational normal modes having the lowest frequencies  describe the largest movements in a protein and are the ones that are functionally relevant.
starting from a structure file at the pdb format, the server computes the normal modes of the protein and identifies which helices in the bundle are the most mobile.
we built a novel and unique tool, tmm@, to study the mobility of transmembrane α-helices.
