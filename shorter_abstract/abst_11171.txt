we tested this method to enrich ca- and ga-microsatellites from cdna of asian seabass, and demonstrated that enrichment of microsatellites from normalized cdna could increased the efficiency of microsatellite isolation over  <dig> times as compared to direct sequencing of clones from cdna libraries.
the average allele number of the  <dig> microsatellites was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while the expected heterozygosity was  <dig>  ±  <dig> .
microsatellites in cdna are useful as molecular markers because they represent transcribed genes and can be used as anchor markers for linkage and comparative mapping, as well as for studying genome evolution.
the microsatellites isolated from cdna could be useful for linkage and comparative mapping, as well as for studying genome evolution.
unique microsatellite sequences accounted for  <dig> %  of sequenced clones.
however, in most fish species, no ests are available or the number of ests is limited, although fishes represent half of the vertebrates on the earth.
the described method for isolation of microsatellites from cdna has the potential to be applied to a wide range of fish species.
we developed a simple and efficient method for isolation of microsatellites from cdna in fish.
all the isolated microsatellites inherited in a mendelian pattern.
