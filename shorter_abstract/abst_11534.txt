production of these biopolymers constitutes a drain on key components in the central carbon metabolism, but so far little is known concerning if and how the cells divide their resources between cell growth and production of exopolysaccharides.
the aim of this study was to identify genes that are necessary for obtaining a normal level of alginate production in alginate-producing pseudomonas fluorescens.
the engineered strain was subjected to random transposon mutagenesis and a library of about  <dig> mutants was screened for strains with altered alginate production.
the majority of the identified mutants resulted in diminished alginate biosynthesis while cell yield in most cases were less affected.
in some cases, however, a higher final cell yield were measured.
in this way we would avoid identification of genes merely involved in regulating the expression of the alginate biosynthetic genes.

alginate is an industrially important linear polysaccharide synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate by several bacterial species.
identified inactivated genes were mainly found to encode proteins involved in metabolic pathways related to uptake and utilization of carbon, nitrogen and phosphor sources, biosynthesis of purine and tryptophan and peptidoglycan recycling.
