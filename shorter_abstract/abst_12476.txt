for example, domestic cats are obligate carnivores and their receptor tas1r <dig>  associated with the human perception of sweet, is present only as a pseudogene.
domestic cats  have a reputation for being rather unpredictable in their dietary choices.
the cat sequence for tas2r <dig> contains  <dig> major amino acid residues known to confer the taster phenotype , which is associated with sensitivity to the bitter compounds prop and ptc.
results with cat tas2r <dig> also demonstrate that additional residues beyond those classically associated with prop sensitivity in humans influence the sensitivity to prop and ptc.
the responses of both cat receptors to the bitter ligands were concentration-dependent and were inhibited by the human bitter blocker probenecid.
this report includes the first functional characterization of domestic cat taste receptors.
functional studies of the human bitter receptor family are being applied to the development of food and medicinal products with more appealing flavor profiles.
these data demonstrate that the response profiles of the cat bitter receptors tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> are distinct from those of their orthologous human receptors.
