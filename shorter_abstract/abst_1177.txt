drug combinations containing butorphanol cause an apparent delay in gastrointestinal transit in healthy horses without substantially affecting somatic nociception at the doses studied.
the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of prolonged constant rate infusions  of lidocaine , butorphanol , and ketamine  alone and in combination on gastrointestinal transit, behavior, and thermal nociceptive threshold in healthy horses.
two-hundred plastic beads were administered intragastrically by nasogastric tube immediately prior to the bolus.
prolonged drug infusions are used to treat horses with severe signs of pain, but can be associated with altered gastrointestinal transit.
combinations of lidocaine and ketamine may have less impact on gastrointestinal transit than infusions combined with butorphanol.
significant changes in behavior scores, vital parameters, or thermal threshold were not observed.
there were no apparent differences between groups in vital parameters or thermal threshold.
transit time was delayed for lb and lbk with a corresponding decrease in fecal weight that was most severe in the final  <dig> hours of infusion.
behavior was scored every  <dig> hours, vital parameters every  <dig> hours, and thermal nociceptive threshold every  <dig> hours for  <dig> hours.
