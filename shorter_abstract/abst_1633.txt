present study focused on time-course comparisons of stress responses in the brain and kidney and the identification of a set of genes which are diagnostic for stress response.
<dig>  stress responses in fish brain and kidney are different in function and time-course.
<dig>  identification of stress-regulated genes provides the possibility for measuring stress responses in various conditions and further search for the functionally related genes.
metal ion binding proteins, glycolytic enzymes and motor proteins were induced transiently, whereas expression of genes involved in stress and immune response, cell proliferation and growth, signal transduction and apoptosis, protein biosynthesis and folding changed in a reciprocal fashion.
gene expression profiles were analysed in terms of gene ontology categories.
this platform included clones from normalized and subtracted libraries and genes selected through functional annotation.
stress response in brain was characterized with dramatic temporal alterations.
we constructed a rainbow trout cdna microarray targeted at the identification of genes which are differentially expressed in response to environmental stressors.
mitochondria, extracellular matrix and endopeptidases  were the major targets in kidney.
overall, the number of differentially expressed genes was markedly higher in est than in genes selected through gene ontology annotations, however 63% of stress-responsive genes were from this group.
microarray technologies are rapidly becoming available for new species including teleost fishes.
despite dramatic difference between tissues and time-points, we were able to identify a group of  <dig> genes that showed strong correlation of expression profiles  in  <dig> microarray experiments being regulated by stress.
