the failure of cells to react with anti-cd <dig> antibodies in cd <dig> b pigs was associated to ten amino-acid substitutions in domain  <dig> and/or one amino-acid substitution in joining region  <dig> of cd <dig> b. we also found exon  <dig> was defective in some cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b resulting in the loss of the transmembrane domain, which implies that these cd <dig> proteins are secreted from helper t cells into the circulation.
in comparison with the swine cd <dig> amino-acid sequence , cd <dig> a had seven amino-acid substitutions and cd <dig> b had  <dig> amino-acid substitutions.
we previously identified two phenotypes of cd4+ cells with and without reactions to anti-pig cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry in a herd of microminipigs.
in addition, we developed a pcr-rflp method that enabled us to simply identify the cd <dig> sequence variant and the positive and negative pbmcs reactivity to our anti-pig cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies without the need to use flow cytometric analysis.
in this study, we analyzed the coding sequences of cd <dig> and certified the expression of cd <dig> molecules in order to identify the genetic sequence variants responsible for the positive and negative pbmcs reactivity to anti-pig cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies.
the amino-acid sequences within domain  <dig> of cd <dig> b were identical to the swine cd <dig>   sequence that had been reported previously to be a modified cd <dig> molecule that had lost reactivity with an anti-pig cd <dig> antibody in nih miniature pigs.
we identified two cd <dig> alleles, cd <dig> a and cd <dig> b, corresponding to antibody positive and negative, respectively, by nucleotide sequencing of pcr products using cd <dig> specific primer pairs.

we transfected hela cells with the flag-tagged cd <dig> a or cd <dig> b vectors, and certified that transfected hela cells expressed flag in both vectors.
