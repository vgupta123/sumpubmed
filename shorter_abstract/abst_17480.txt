to study the role of rela in physiology and in disease states in a manner that circumvents this embryonic lethal phenotype, we have generated a mouse with rela conditional knockout  alleles containing loxp sites that are deleted by activated cre recombinase.
our mating of relacko/cko mice with zp3-cre transgenic led to embryonic lethality of rela-deficient embryos.
we demonstrate that relacko/cko mice are fertile, do not display any developmental defects and can be crossed with cre-expressing mice to delete rela in a temporal, tissue-specific manner.
in contrast, mating of relacko/cko mice with col1Î±2-creer mice allowed for the generation of double transgenics which could be stimulated with tamoxifen to induce fibroblast-specific rela deletion in adulthood.
