however, there is almost no information available about the resistance pathways mediated by any of those genes.
transgenic potato lines containing a single rb gene showed a rate-limiting resistance against all known races of phytophthora infestans, the late blight pathogen.
these results provide additional evidence for the universal role of the sgt <dig> gene in various r gene-mediated plant defense responses.
all of the silenced potato plants displayed phenotypically normal growth.
the most effective and environmentally sound way for controlling late blight is to incorporate natural resistance into potato cultivars.
several late blight resistance genes have been cloned recently.
we previously cloned a late blight resistance gene, rb, from a diploid wild potato species solanum bulbocastanum.
the late blight resistance of the rar <dig> and sgt <dig> silenced lines were evaluated by a traditional greenhouse inoculation method and quantified using a gfp-tagged p. infestans strain.
however, the sgt <dig> gene is essential for the rb-mediated late blight resistance.
late blight is the most serious potato disease world-wide.
