differences in relative abundance of bacterial taxa, alpha diversity and beta diversity indices were assessed between age-matched foals with diarrhea  and healthy foals , and between time points.
preventative and therapeutic measures for diarrhea should focus on maintaining bacterial microbiota richness.
the objective was to compare the fecal bacterial microbiota of healthy foals to foals with diarrhea at two and four weeks of life.
of  <dig> enriched species in healthy foals at t <dig>   <dig>  were lachnospiraceae or ruminococcaceae.
the chao richness index was increased in healthy foals at t <dig> compared to t <dig> .
the effect of diarrhea on the fecal bacterial microbiota in foals has not been investigated.

differences in microbial community composition based on time point and health status were observed on all taxonomic levels.
diarrhea had an inconsistent effect, while time point had a consistent effect on microbial community structure.
