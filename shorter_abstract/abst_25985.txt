however, traditional ecological methods can only be applied on a small scale and for relatively well-understood biological systems.
revecor is open source software for the study of microbial community ecology.
the revecor r package is freely available under the gnu general public license v.  <dig>  at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/revecor/ with the vignette and typical usage examples, and the interactive shiny web application is available at http://yiluheihei.shinyapps.io/shiny-revecor, or can be installed locally with the source code accessed from https://github.com/yiluheihei/shiny-revecor.
here, we present revecor, an r package and a shiny web application that implements the reverse ecology algorithm for determining microbeâ€“microbe interactions in microbial communities.
recently, a graph-theory-based algorithm called the reverse ecology approach has been developed that can analyze the metabolic networks of all the species in a microbial community, and predict the metabolic interface between species and their environment.
