this phenotype is associated with the stimulation of enod <dig> expression, an early marker of infection, and with the down-regulation of flotillin  <dig> , a protein involved in rhizobial entry.
these findings provide new information about the complex mechanism that controls the competence of root epidermal cells for rhizobial invasion.
we show here that mtn <dig> is a nf-responsive gene expressed at a very early phase of symbiosis in epidermal cells and root hairs.
mtn5-silenced roots inoculated with rhizobia display an increased root hair curling and a reduced number of invaded primordia compared to that in wild type roots, but with no impairment to nodule primordia formation.

the purpose of this work was to investigate the role of mtn <dig> by studying its spatial and temporal pattern of expression during the symbiotic interaction, also in relation to known components of the symbiotic signalling pathway, and by analysing the phenotypic alterations displayed by rhizobia-inoculated mtn5-silenced roots.
nf perception induces the expression of several genes called early nodulins.
the symbiotic interaction between leguminous plants and rhizobia involves two processes: bacterial infection, resulting in the penetration of bacteria in epidermal and cortical cells, and root nodule organogenesis.
mtn <dig> expression is induced in vitro by rhizobial effector molecules and by auxin and cytokinin, phytohormones involved in nodule organogenesis.
these data indicate that mtn <dig> acts downstream of nf perception and upstream of flot <dig> in regulating pre-infection events.
