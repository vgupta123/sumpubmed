the repertoire of gene families encoding surface proteins is smaller in pg <dig>  several genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism and protein degradation are also absent from, or degraded in, pg <dig>
capri , is a more ubiquitous pathogen in small ruminants causing mastitis, arthritis, keratitis, pneumonia and septicaemia and is also found as saprophyte in the ear canal.
this is the result of large genetic rearrangements due to mobile elements that have also led to marked gene decay.
the  <dig> genome contains five types of is, present in fewer copies than in pg <dig>  and two copies of an integrative conjugative element.
most of the sequences present in pg <dig> but not  <dig> are highly repeated insertion sequences  and large duplicated dna fragments.
to understand the genetics underlying these phenotypic differences, we compared the mmmsc pg <dig> type strain genome, which was already available, with the genome of an mmc field strain  that was sequenced in this study.
these mobile genetic elements have played a key role in genome plasticity, leading to inversions of large dna fragments.
this is consistent with a non-adaptative genomic complexity theory, allowing duplications or pseudogenes to be maintained in the absence of adaptive selection that would lead to purifying selection and genome streamlining over longer evolutionary times.
these findings also suggest that mmmsc only recently adapted to its bovine host.
one subspecies, mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides small colony , is the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia.
we also compared the  <dig> genome with the recently published genome of another mmc strain  to evaluate mmc strain diversity.
the mycoplasma mycoides cluster consists of five species or subspecies that are ruminant pathogens.
