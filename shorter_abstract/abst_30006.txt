in contrast, the reported splicing site variation in brflc <dig>  which also leads to a non-functional locus, was detected but not correlated with variation in flowering time in oil-type b. rapa, although it was correlated with variation in flowering time in vegetable-type b. rapa.
the observed different relationship between brflc <dig> or brflc <dig> and flowering time variation indicates that the control of flowering time has evolved separately between oil-type and vegetable-type b. rapa groups.
flowering locus c  is a mads-box transcription factor that acts as a potent repressor of flowering.
our results suggest that the naturally occurring deletion mutation across exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> in brflc <dig> gene contributes greatly to variation in flowering time in oil-type b. rapa.
there are four copies of flc in b. rapa.
analyses of different segregating populations have suggested that braa.flc.a  and braa.flc.b  play major roles in controlling flowering time in b. rapa.
we analyzed the brflc <dig> sequence in nine b. rapa accessions, and identified a 57-bp insertion/deletion  across exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> resulting in a non-functional allele.
the indel was used to develop a pcr-based marker, which was used to screen a collection of  <dig> b. rapa accessions.
the deletion genotype was present only in oil-type b. rapa, including ssp.
flowering time is an important trait in brassica rapa crops.
