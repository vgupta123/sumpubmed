furthermore, in alternatively spliced genes, the prevalent splice form has a stronger splice site signal than the non-prevalent form.
in almost all cases, as results in a truncated orf, leading to a coding sequence that is around 50% shorter than the prevalent splice form.
as in land plants, intron retention is the most prevalent form of as.
chlamydomonas, a simple unicellular green alga, is part of the lineage that includes land plants.
however, it diverged from land plants about one billion years ago.
the extent of as in chlamydomonas that we observed is much smaller than observed in land plants, but is much higher than in simple unicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes.
analysis of constitutively spliced introns revealed an over-abundance of motifs with simple repetitive elements in comparison to introns involved in intron retention.
using rt-pcr we verified as of two genes and show that they produce more isoforms than indicated by est data.
our analysis of as using blat and a modified version of the sircah tool revealed as of  <dig> transcriptional units with  <dig> events, representing about 3% of the total number of genes.
we performed a global analysis of alternative splicing in chlamydomonas reinhardtii using its recently completed genome sequence and all available ests and cdnas.
all cdna/est alignments and splice graphs are provided in a website at http://combi.cs.colostate.edu/as/chlamy.
the percentage of different alternative splicing events is similar to flowering plants.
