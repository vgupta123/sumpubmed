the standard models of the red queen dynamics exhibit persistent ld oscillations under most circumstances.
we then show that in a stochastic regime, drift can counteract this dampening and maintain the oscillations.
as a consequence, the rqh can strongly depend on population size and should therefore not be interpreted as a purely deterministic hypothesis.
since host-parasite interactions often have a strong genetic basis, recombination between different hosts can increase the fraction of novel and potentially resistant offspring genotypes.
a prerequisite for this mechanism is that host-parasite interactions generate persistent oscillations of linkage disequilibria .
here, we show that altering the standard model from discrete to continuous time or from simultaneous to sequential updating results in damped ld oscillations.
we use deterministic and stochastic models to investigate the persistence of ld oscillations and its impact on the rqh.
this suggests that ld oscillations are structurally not robust.
