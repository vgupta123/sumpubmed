no significant differences were observed, in either the forelimbs or the hind limbs, between the left and right sides or between the two directions for any of the variables.
significant pvf  differences were observed in the forelimbs  and hind limbs , and significant vi differences were observed in the forelimbs .
the sheep were judged to be healthy based on the results of complete physical and orthopaedic examinations and had no history of lameness.
the peak vertical force , vertical impulse , gait cycle time, stance time, swing time, stride length, and the percentage body weight distribution among the four limbs were determined.
young healthy sheep differ from older sheep in the vertical forces they create when walking at the same velocity on a pressure-sensing walkway.
a trial was considered valid if the sheep walked within the correct velocity  and acceleration  ranges.
the data from the first five valid trials in each direction were collected for each sheep and analysed using the designated software.
the animals were examined from two directions: first on the left side and then on the right side of the handler.
therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate kinetic and temporospatial parameters in clinically healthy sheep from three different age groups with a pressure-sensing walkway.
understanding normal gait requires allowing for variations in normal patterns by the sex, age, and species in question.
