these results illustrate the power of comparative sequencing to identify novel genomic features.
the mitochondrial genomes of plants generally encode 30- <dig> identified protein-coding genes and a large number of lineage-specific orfs.
despite the fact that there are now over  <dig> mitochondrial genome sequences for land plants and green algae, this gene has remained unidentified and largely undetected until now because of the unlikely coincidence that most of the earlier sequences were from the few lineages that lack the intact gene.
from a broad survey of land plants, we have found that the orf-bryo <dig> gene is also conserved in the mitochondria of vascular plants and charophycean green algae.
in several lineages, such as crucifers and grasses, where the rpl <dig> gene has been lost from the mitochondrion, we suggest that a copy of the nucleus-encoded chloroplast-derived rpl <dig> gene may serve as a functional replacement.
