qtl affecting md resistance were identified by selective dna pooling using a panel of  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellite markers.
at the f <dig> generation, a total of  <dig> chicks were produced  and phenotyped for md resistance measured as survival time in days after challenge with a very virulent plus  strain of mdv.
since mhc blood type  is known to affect md resistance, a total of  <dig> independent pool pairs were constructed according to family Ã— bt combination, with some combinations represented twice for technical reasons.
twenty-one qtl regions  affecting post-challenge survival time were identified, distributed among  <dig> chromosomes , with about two-thirds of the md resistance alleles derived from the more md resistant parental line.
eight of the qtlr associated with md resistance, were previously identified in a backcross  mapping study with the same parental lines.
there was considerable evidence suggesting that md resistance alleles tend to be recessive.
these results provide a firm basis for high-resolution linkage disequilibrium mapping and positional cloning of the resistance genes.
marek's disease  is a t-cell lymphoma of chickens caused by the marek's disease virus , an oncogenic avian herpesvirus.
