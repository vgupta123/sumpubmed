pda considers an extended single-point association test, which can compare allele frequencies between two dna pools constructed under different experimental conditions.
however, no software has been developed for complete pooled-dna analyses, including data standardization, allele frequency estimation, and single/multipoint dna pooling association tests.
this new multipoint testing procedure overcomes a computational bottleneck of conventional haplotype-oriented multipoint methods in dna pooling analyses and can handle data sets having a large pool size and/or large numbers of polymorphic markers.
this motivated the development of the software, 'pda' , to analyze pooled dna data.
we develop the software, pda, for the analysis of pooled-dna data.
all of the pda functions are illustrated in the four bona fide examples.
pda is simple to operate and does not require that users have a strong statistical background.
pda provides estimates of the coefficient of preferential amplification and allele frequency.
genotyping large numbers of snps individually is performed routinely but is cost prohibitive for large-scale genetic studies.
moreover, pda also provides novel chromosome-wide multipoint association tests based on p-value combinations and a sliding-window concept.
