here we use the nematode c. elegans to address the neurogenetic basis of responses to thermal stimuli over a broad range of intensities.
in order to study the response of c. elegans to a broad range of noxious thermal stimuli, we developed a novel assay that allows simultaneous characterization of multiple aspects of escape behavior elicited by thermal pulses of increasing amplitudes.
at different intensities of aversive thermal stimuli, these distinct combinations of molecules converge onto qualitatively similar stereotyped behavioral sequences.
responding to noxious stimuli by invoking an appropriate escape response is critical for survival of an organism.
we exposed the laboratory strain n <dig>  as well as  <dig> strains with defects in various aspects of nervous system function, to thermal pulses ranging from Δt =  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c and recorded the resulting behavioral profiles.
through analysis of the multidimensional behavioral profiles, we found that the combinations of molecules shaping avoidance responses to a given thermal pulse are unique.
c. elegans responds to aversive temperature by eliciting a stereotypical behavioral sequence.
