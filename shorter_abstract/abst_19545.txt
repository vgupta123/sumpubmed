moreover, decreases in propionic and acetic acids coupled with increases in branched-chain fatty acids and valeric acid caused changes in faecal total vfas in dogs on the hpgm diet.
food intake, body weight, and faecal consistency scores, dry matter, ph, ammonia, volatile fatty acids , and faecal canine calprotectin concentrations were determined.
faecal canine calprotectin concentration was higher with the hpgm diet and correlated positively with valeric acid concentration.
faecal ammonia concentrations decreased with the hcs diet.
faecal ph was higher with the hpgm diet.
we fed high-carbohydrate starch based , , high-protein greaves-meal ,  and dry commercial ,  diets, and studied their effects on the metabolism of the colonic microbiota and faecal calprotectin concentrations in five beagle dogs, allocated according to the graeco-latin square design.
all dogs fed the hpgm diet developed diarrhoea, which led to differences in faecal consistency scores between the diets.
the hpgm diet led to diarrhoea in all dogs, and there were differences in faecal vfa profiles and faecal canine calprotectin concentrations.
we previously reported that dietary composition impacts upon the faecal microbiota of healthy dogs.
this study aims at evaluating the dietary influences on bacteria-derived metabolic products associated with the changes in faecal microbiota that we had previously reported.
