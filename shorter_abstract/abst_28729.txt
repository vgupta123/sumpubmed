under short days or long days in plants that have not satisfied their vernalization requirement.
temperature and day length are the main environmental regulators of flowering and drivers of adaptation in temperate cereals.
in particular, ppdh <dig> function is assumed to be limited to the ability of a short photoperiod to promote flowering.
this mechanism is indicated to be a component of an adaptation syndrome of barley to mediterranean conditions.
understanding the adaptation of cereals to environmental conditions is one of the key areas in which plant science can contribute to tackling challenges presented by climate change.
under field conditions in which the vernalization requirement of winter cultivars is not satisfied, the dominant ppdh <dig> allele promotes flowering, even under increasing photoperiods above  <dig> h. this hypothesis was supported by expression analysis of vernalization-responsive genotypes.
these genes from the vernalization and photoperiod pathways show complex interactions to promote flowering that are still not understood fully.
however, old landraces from the iberian peninsula, which also have a vernalization requirement, possess this allele at a much higher frequency than modern winter barley cultivars.
the dominant ppdh <dig> allele is represented widely in spring barley cultivars but is found only occasionally in modern winter cultivars that have strong vernalization requirements.
when the dominant allele of ppdh <dig> was expressed, this was associated with enhanced levels of vrnh <dig> and vrnh <dig> expression.
the presence of the dominant allele is associated with early expression of vrnh <dig> and early flowering.
we propose that ppdh <dig> promotes flowering of winter cultivars under all non-inductive conditions, i.e.
