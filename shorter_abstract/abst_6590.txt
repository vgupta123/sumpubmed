this study demonstrates the central role of comparative genomics for refining gene catalogs and exploring the evolutionary history of gene repertoires, particularly as applied for the characterization of species-specific gene gains and losses.
based on gene prediction and a functionality test using the ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitution rates , we provide compelling structural and functional evidence for the identification of  <dig> new protein-coding genes in the canine genome and  <dig> gene losses, characterized as undetected gene or pseudogenes.
of particular interest are the more than  <dig> of genes annotated in primates and rodent genomes, but missing in dog.
using over  <dig>  orthologous genes between human, chimpanzee, mouse rat and dog, we built multiple pairwise synteny maps to infer short orthologous intervals that were targeted for characterizing the canine missing genes.
