biochemical studies of sea urchin emap and vertebrate emls implicate these proteins in the regulation of microtubule stability.
elp- <dig> is also expressed in a subset of mechanoreceptor neurons, including the ray neurons in the male tail, microtubule-rich touch receptor neurons, and the six ciliated il <dig> neurons.
these data imply that elp- <dig> may play an important role during the transmission of forces and signals between the body surface and both muscle cells and touch receptor neurons.
in larvae and adults, elp- <dig> is expressed in the body wall, spermatheca and vulval muscles, intestine, and hypodermal seam cells.
consistent with this idea, decreasing elp- <dig> expression decreases sensitivity to gentle touch applied to the body wall.
the emap-like protein family has five members in mammals  and only one in both drosophila  and c. elegans .
we examined the expression pattern of c. elegans elp- <dig> by means of transgenic gene expression in living embryos and adults, and by immunolocalization with an elp-1-specific antibody in fixed tissues.
the founding member of the emap-like protein family is the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein , so-named for its abundance in sea urchin, starfish, and sand dollar eggs.
in muscle, elp- <dig> is associated with adhesion complexes near the cell surface and is bound to a criss-crossing network of microtubules in the cytoplasm.
