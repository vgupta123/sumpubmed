sequence homology can be ineffective to annotate prohormone genes in sequenced species like the pig due to the multifactorial nature of the prohormone processing.
we identified  <dig> unique prohormone genes,  <dig> alternative calcitonin-related sequences,  <dig> prohormone convertases and  <dig> cleavage facilitator in the pig genome  <dig>  assembly and trace archives.
of these,  <dig> pig prohormone genes have not been reported in the uniprot, unigene or gene databases.
most differentially expressed prohormone genes were under-expressed in pigs experiencing immune challenge relative to the un-challenged controls, in non-pregnant relative to pregnant sows, in old relative to young embryos, and in non-neural relative to neural tissues.
the pig is a biomedical model to study human and livestock traits.
in addition, a novel neuropeptide s was identified in the pig genome correcting the previously reported pig sequence that is identical to the rabbit sequence.
the goal of this study is to undertake the first complete survey of prohormone and prohormone convertases genes in the pig genome.
many of these traits are controlled by neuropeptides that result from the cleavage of prohormones by prohormone convertases.
the present genomic and functional characterization supports the use of the pig as an effective animal model to gain a deeper understanding of prohormones, prohormone convertases and neuropeptides in biomedical and agricultural research.
the cleavage sites of prohormone sequences into potentially active neuropeptides were predicted.
the cleavage prediction models did not find conclusive evidence supporting the production of the bioactive neuropeptides urocortin  <dig>  urocortin  <dig>  torsin family  <dig> member a, tachykinin  <dig>  islet amyloid polypeptide, and calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide  <dig> in the pig.
the cleavage prediction based on human sequences had the best performance with a correct classification rate of cleaved and non-cleaved sites of 92% suggesting that the processing of prohormones in pigs is similar to humans.
