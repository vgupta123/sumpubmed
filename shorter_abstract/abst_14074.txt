picalm depletion altered the intracellular distribution of clathrin while clathrin reduction affected the subcellular pattern of picalm labelling.
we used sirna to deplete levels of picalm, its isoforms and clathrin heavy chain in the human brain-derived h <dig> neuroglioma cell line that expresses endogenous levels of app.
we have investigated the involvement of picalm in the processing of amyloid precursor protein  to understand how picalm could be linked to the development of ad.

following depletion of all the isoforms of picalm by sirna in h <dig> cells, levels of intracellular app, intracellular β-c-terminal fragment  and secreted sappβ  were significantly reduced but aβ <dig> was not affected.
levels of functional endocytosis were quantified using alexa 488-conjugated transferrin and flow cytometry as a marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis .
functional endocytosis was significantly reduced after both picalm and clathrin depletion, highlighting the importance of picalm in this process.
however, depletion of clathrin did not affect app but did reduce β-ctf levels.
we then used western blotting, elisa and immunohistochemistry to detect intra- and extracellular protein levels of endocytic-related proteins, app and app metabolites including β-amyloid .
both picalm and clathrin depletion reduced the expression of bace <dig> mrna and picalm sirna reduced protein levels.
the depletion of picalm in brain-derived cells has significant effects on the processing of app, probably by reducing cme.
individual depletion of picalm isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> did not affect app levels while clathrin depletion had a differential effect on the isoforms, increasing isoform  <dig> while decreasing isoform  <dig> expression.
thus a decrease in picalm expression in the brain could be beneficial to slow or prevent the development of ad.
