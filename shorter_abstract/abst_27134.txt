our data are consistent with previous studies showing a high percentage of phosphorylation during competency in the barnacle balanus amphitrite and the bryozoan bugula neritina.
a previous study on the total changes to the proteome during the various developmental stages of p. vexillosa suggested that little or no de novo protein synthesis occurs during metamorphosis.
this is the first study to report changes in phosphoprotein expression patterns during the metamorphosis of the marine polychaete p. vexillosa.
a combination of affinity chromatography, 2d-page, and mass spectrometry was used to identify the phosphoproteins in pre-competent larvae, competent larvae, and newly metamorphosed juveniles.
the highest percentage of phosphorylation was observed during the competent larval stage.
these phosphoproteins belonged to six categories of biological processes:  development,  cell differentiation and integrity,  transcription and translation,  metabolism,  protein-protein interaction and proteolysis, and  receptors and enzymes.
we reproducibly detected  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> phosphoproteins in pre-competent larvae, competent larvae, and newly metamorphosed juveniles, respectively.
about  <dig> stage-specific phosphoprotein spots were detected in the competent stage, and  <dig> phosphoproteins were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the three stages.
in this study, we used multicolor fluorescence detection of proteins in 2-d gels for differential analysis of proteins and phosphoproteins to reveal the dynamics of post-translational modification proteins in this species.
