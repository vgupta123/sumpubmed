the fih/ard protein interaction is predicted to create an oxygen threshold for hifα cad-hydroxylation and to significantly sharpen the signal/response curves, which not only focuses hifα cad-hydroxylation into a defined range of oxygen tensions, but also makes the response ultrasensitive to varying oxygen tensions.
competition by ard proteins for fih is hypothesised to affect fih activity towards hifα; however the extent of this competition and its effect on the hif-dependent hypoxic response are unknown.
our model predicts that an oxygen-regulated sequestration of fih by ard proteins significantly shapes the input/output characteristics of the hif system.
our model further suggests that the hydroxylation status of the ard protein pool can encode the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode, which may allow cells to memorise these features for a certain time period after reoxygenation.
the fih/ard protein interaction has the potential to contribute to oxygen-range finding, can sensitise the response to changes in oxygen levels, and can provide a memory of the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode.
phd-dependent hydroxylation targets hifα for rapid proteasomal degradation; fih-catalysed asparaginyl-hydroxylation of the c-terminal transactivation domain  of hifα suppresses the cad-dependent subset of the extensive transcriptional responses induced by hif.
to analyse if and in which way the fih/ard protein interaction affects hif-activity, we created a rate equation model.
the activity of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor  is regulated by the post-translational, oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of its α-subunit by members of the prolyl hydroxylase domain -family and by factor inhibiting hif .
