several of the candidate genes have human homologues that were identified in studies of human sleep, suggesting that genes affecting variation in sleep are conserved across species.

additive models incorporating multiple snps explained as much as 55% of the genetic variance for sleep in males and females.
we identified many snps in novel loci that are potentially associated with natural variation in sleep, as well as snps within genes previously known to affect drosophila sleep.
we used the drosophila genetic reference panel  to perform a genome-wide association  study of sleep in d. melanogaster.
our discovery of genetic variants that influence environmental sensitivity to sleep may have a wider application to all gwa studies, because individuals with highly plastic genotypes will not have consistent phenotypes.
the genetic basis of natural variation in sleep remains unknown.
we identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with differences in the mean as well as the environmental sensitivity of sleep traits; these snps typically had sex-specific or sex-biased effects, and were generally located in non-coding regions.
