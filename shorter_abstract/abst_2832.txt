the pfm18aap enzyme performs various functions in the parasite and the erythrocytic host such as hemoglobin digestion, erythrocyte invasion, parasite growth and parasite escape from the host cell.
the combined approach of 3d qsar, pharmacophore, and structure-based molecular docking yielded  <dig> novel pfm18aap inhibitors from chembl antimalarial library,  <dig> novel inhibitors from each derivative of quinine, chloroquine, 8-aminoquinoline and  <dig> novel inhibitors from who antimalarial drugs.
the pharmacophore modeling identified dhrr  as an essential feature of pfm18aap inhibitors.
the 3d qsar models of pfm18aap inhibitors provided useful information about the structural characteristics of inhibitors which are contributors of the inhibitory potency.
the plsr qsar model showed highest value for correlation coefficient r <dig>  and predictive correlation coefficient  = <dig>  for external test set among all qsar models.
the plasmodium falciparum m <dig> aspartyl aminopeptidase  is only aspartyl aminopeptidase which is found in the genome of p. falciparum and is essential for its survival.
in the present work, we employed 3d qsar modeling, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular docking to identify novel potent inhibitors that bind with m18aap of p. falciparum.
additionally, high throughput virtual screening identified top  <dig> compounds as antimalarial leads showing g-scores - <dig>  to - <dig>  , compared with control compounds which are known antimalarial m18aap inhibitors .
it is a valid target to develop antimalarial drugs.
