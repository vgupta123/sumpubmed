nucleotide diversity indices indicated that the coding region of mrp <dig> may have undergone negative selection or recent population expansion.
to facilitate association studies of this gene with diseases and/or drug response, exons and flanking introns of mrp <dig> were screened for polymorphisms in  <dig> dna samples from four different populations.
interestingly, the str polymorphism at the 5' untranslated region  occurs at high but different frequencies in the different populations.
snps e10/ <dig> g>t  and e16/ <dig> g>t  which occur at low frequency in only one or two of four populations examined were predicted to be functionally deleterious and hence are likely to be under negative selection.
these snps may be useful for studies associating this gene with rare events including adverse drug reactions.
sequence variations within this gene might account for differences in drug response in different individuals.
frequencies of common polymorphisms in our populations were comparable to those of similar populations in hapmap or perlegen.
seventy-one polymorphisms, including  <dig> biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms , ten insertions/deletions  and one short tandem repeat  were identified.
