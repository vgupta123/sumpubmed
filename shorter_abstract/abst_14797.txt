a few senescence-associated mirnas  have been identified as important participants in regulating leaf senescence by modulating the expression levels of their target genes.
to elucidate mirna roles in leaf senescence and their underlying molecular mechanisms in maize, a stay-green line, yu87- <dig>  and an early leaf senescence line, early leaf senescence- <dig> , were selected as experimental materials for the differential expression of candidate mirnas.
degradome sequencing results indicated that these candidate sa-mirnas may regulate leaf senescence through their target genes, mainly transcription factors, and potentially control chlorophyll degradation pathways.
the results highlight the regulatory roles of mirnas during leaf senescence in maize.

four small rna libraries were constructed from ear leaves at  <dig> and  <dig> days after pollination and sequenced by illumina deep sequencing technology.
of these,  <dig> mirnas of nine families were differentially expressed between els- <dig> andyu87- <dig>  the phenotypic and chlorophyll content analyses of both lines identified these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas as candidate sa-mirnas.
in this study,  <dig> candidate sa-mirnas of els- <dig> were identified through small rna deep sequencing technology.
