despite its likely importance in the evolution of these limits, little is known about phenotypic covariance in geographically marginal populations, and the degree to which it constrains, or facilitates, responses to selection.
we investigated phenotypic covariance in morphological traits at species’ borders by comparing phenotypic covariance matrices , including the degree of shared structure, the distribution of strengths of pair-wise correlations between traits, the degree of morphological integration of traits, and the ranks of matricies, between central and marginal populations of three species-pairs of coral reef fishes.
neither the degree of morphological integration, nor ranks of p, indicated greater evolutionary constraint at range edges.
greater structural differences in p were observed between populations close to range margins and conspecific populations toward range centres, than between pairs of conspecific populations that were both more centrally located within their ranges.
characteristics of p observed here provide no support for constraint contributing to the formation of these species’ borders, but may instead reflect structural change in p caused by selection or drift, and their potential to evolve in the future.
