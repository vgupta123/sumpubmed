rapid progress in the field of gene expression-based molecular network integration has generated strong demand on enhancing the sensitivity and data accuracy of experimental systems.
by using specially designed primers, the new system amplifies sequences in neighboring exons separated by big introns so that mrna sequences may be effectively discriminated from other highly related sequences including their genes, unprocessed transcripts, pseudogenes and pseudogene transcripts.
to meet the need, a high-throughput gene profiling system of high specificity and sensitivity has been developed.
highly reproducible results were obtained from duplicate samples with the same number of cells, and from those with a small number  and a large number  of cells.
the specificity of the system was demonstrated by comparing results from a breast cancer cell line, mcf- <dig>  and an ovarian cancer cell line, nci/adr-res, and by using genomic dna as starting material.
it may also be used for gene expression profiling of very few  or single cells.
