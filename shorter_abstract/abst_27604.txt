therefore, development of alternative approaches to stimulate host innate immune responses could be beneficial in prophylaxis against s. aureus infection.
synthetic cpg-motifs containing oligodeoxynucleotide  mimics the stimulatory effect of bacterial dna.
odn <dig> as well as odn <dig> but not odn <dig> were able to significantly inhibit the intracellular bacterial growth because about  <dig> % as well as  <dig> % of intracellular s. aureus could survive the pretreatment of saos- <dig> cells with odn <dig> or odn <dig> respectively  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-infection.
intracellular bacteria were streaked on bhi plates  <dig> h and  <dig> h after infection.
tlr <dig> is the intracellular receptor which recognizes unmethylated bacterial cpg-dna and activates immune cells.
osteoblast-like saos- <dig> cells were pretreated with cpg-odn type-a  <dig>  type-b  <dig>  or negative cpg-odn  <dig>   <dig> h before infection with s. aureus isolate edcc  <dig> .
moreover, treating saos- <dig> cells with the antioxidant diphenyleneiodonium  obviously reduced s. aureus killing ability of tlr <dig> agonists mediated by oxidative stress.
in this work we demonstrated for the first time that cpg-odns have inhibitory effects on s. aureus survival inside saos- <dig> osteoblast-like cell line.

this effect was attributed to stimulation of tlr <dig> and subsequent induction of oxidative stress.
rt-pcr analysis of cdnas from saos- <dig> cells showed that pretreatment with odn <dig> or odn <dig> stimulated the expression of tlr <dig>  pretreatment of saos- <dig> cells with odn <dig> or odn <dig> but not odn <dig> managed to induce reactive oxygen species  production inside osteoblasts as measured by flow cytometry analysis.
