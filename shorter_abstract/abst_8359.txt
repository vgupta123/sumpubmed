the functional annotation of genes with exonic, non-synonymous snps, which are common in all three mangalicas but are absent in either the reference genome or the sequenced duroc of this study, highlighted  <dig> genes in lipid metabolism processes.
genome analysis of mangalica breeds revealed that local/rare breeds could be a rich source of sequence variations not present in cosmopolitan/industrial breeds.
to explore their genetic resources, we have analysed data from next-generation sequencing of an individual male from each of three mangalica breeds along with a local male duroc pig.
structural variations, such as snps, indels and cnvs, were identified and particular genes with snp variations were analysed with special emphasis on functions related to fat metabolism in pigs.
the identified mangalica variations may, therefore, be a very useful resource for future studies of agronomically important traits in pigs.
