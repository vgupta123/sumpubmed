we found that a variant of asb <dig> that lacks the socs box  was naturally detected in human cell lines but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or normal hepatocytes.
the differential expression and function of asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs may be a key factor in the growth of human cell lines and primary cells.
the socs box of asb proteins is important in a ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis pathway.
the ankyrin repeat domains of asb <dig> can associate with the substrate binding site of umtck in a socs box-independent manner.
asb <dig> interacts with the creatine kinase system and negatively regulates cell growth.
we also identified ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase  as a new target of asb <dig> in human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cells.
however, only expression of asb <dig> induced abnormal mitochondrial structure and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential.
furthermore, the creatine kinase activities and cell growth were significantly reduced by asb <dig> but not by asb9Δsocs.
the ankyrin repeat and suppressor of cytokine signalling  box proteins  are a large protein family implicated in diverse biological processes including regulation of proliferation and differentiation.
