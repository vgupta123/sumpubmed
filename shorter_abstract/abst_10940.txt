two additional exons within intron  <dig> of the abcc <dig> gene were identified; one of the exons exhibits alternative donor splice sites.
finally, we show that the evolutionarily conserved abcc5_sv <dig> transcript is translated into a protein abundantly present in endothelial cells of inner retinal blood vessels and along rpe membranes.
abcc <dig> and its novel isoforms are abundantly expressed in the human retina.
