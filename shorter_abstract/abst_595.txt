the data provide initial characterization of the substituent effects of amino acid side chains and suggest that these properties affect electron density along the peptide backbone.
electronic properties of amino acid side chains such as inductive and field effects have not been characterized in any detail.
pm <dig> analysis of electron distribution and polarizability was used to derive quantitative scales that describe steric factors, inductive effects, resonance effects, and field effects of amino acid side chains.
these studies revealed that:  different semiempirical qm methods yield similar results for the electronic effects of side chain groups,  polarizability, which reflects molecular deformability, represents steric factors in electronic terms, and  inductive effects contribute to the propensity of an amino acid for Î±-helices.
