to circumvent this problem we developed an alternative procedure that does not use forward-reverse primer pair in the same reaction.
the use of a single primer in each amplification reaction increases the probability of success of primers relative to previous methods employing a forward and reverse primer pair in the same reaction.
we developed an alternative method that starts with two single-primer reactions in parallel using high-fidelity pwo dna polymerase.
in protein engineering, site-directed mutagenesis methods are used to generate dna sequences with mutated codons, insertions or deletions.
thus, we call the method with the acronym sprinp.
in initial studies we used a double-primer pcr mutagenesis protocol, but sequencing of products showed tandem repeats of primer in cloned dna.
the sprinp mutagenesis protocol yields mutants reliably and with high fidelity.
