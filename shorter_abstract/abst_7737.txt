hmtdb is a well-integrated web-based human mitochondrial bioinformatic resource aimed at supporting population genetics and mitochondrial disease studies, thanks to a new approach based on site-specific nucleotide and aminoacid variability estimation.
these data are at present worldwide distributed in differently organised databases and web sites not well integrated among them.
population genetics studies based on the analysis of mtdna and mitochondrial disease studies have produced a huge quantity of sequence data and related information.
the hmtdb project will contribute towards completing and/or refining haplogroup classification and revealing the real pathogenic potential of mitochondrial mutations, on the basis of variability estimation.
moreover it is not generally possible for the user to submit and contemporarily analyse its own data comparing them with the content of a given database, both for population genetics and mitochondrial disease data.
hmtdb consists of a database of human mitochondrial genomes, annotated with population data, and a set of bioinformatic tools, able to produce site-specific variability data and to automatically characterize newly sequenced human mitochondrial genomes.
nucleotide site-specific variability data and multialigned genomes can be downloaded.
the first release contains  <dig> fully annotated human mitochondrial genomes.
