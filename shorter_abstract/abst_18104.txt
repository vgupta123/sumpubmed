a meta-analysis was first performed using manual inference and confirmed by biomercator v <dig> to identify possible qtl clusters and hotspots.
previous studies have identified a plethora of qtl attributed to fiber quality, disease and pest resistance, branch number, seed quality and yield and yield related traits, drought tolerance, and morphological traits.
qtl clusters are composed of qtl of various traits which are concentrated in a specific region on a chromosome, whereas hotspots are composed of only one trait type.
the presence of qtl clusters and hotspots indicates consensus regions across cultivated tetraploid gossypium species, environments, and populations which contain large numbers of qtl, and in some cases multiple qtl associated with the same trait termed a hotspot.
however, results among these studies differed due to the use of different genetic populations, markers and marker densities, and testing environments.
putative qtl clusters were identified via meta-analysis and will be useful for breeding programs and future studies involving gossypium qtl.
qtl hotspots for fiber quality traits were found in the same regions as the clusters, indicating that clusters may also form hotspots.
this study combines two previous meta-analysis studies and adds all other currently available qtl studies, making it the most comprehensive meta-analysis study in cotton to date.
since two previous meta-qtl analyses were performed on fiber traits, a number of papers on qtl mapping of fiber quality, yield traits, morphological traits, and disease resistance have been published.
the study of quantitative trait loci  in cotton  is focused on traits of agricultural significance.
in this study, a total of  <dig>  qtl from  <dig> different qtl studies in gossypium were surveyed and mapped using biomercator v <dig> based on the gossypium consensus map from the cotton marker database.
