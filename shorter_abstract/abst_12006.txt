here we analyze the data on genotype frequencies and scrapie prevalence in the dutch sheep population obtained from both surveillance and affected flocks, to identify temporal trends.
most importantly, the estimated scrapie prevalence level per head of susceptible genotype is also declining significantly, indicating that selective breeding causes a population effect.
a recent decline in the scrapie prevalence per tested sheep of susceptible prion protein genotype indicates that selective breeding causes the desired population effect.
we also estimate the genotype-specific relative risks to become a detected scrapie case.
we find that the breeding programme has produced a steady increase in the level of genetic scrapie resistance in the dutch sheep population.
susceptibility of sheep to scrapie infection is known to be modulated by the prp genotype of the animal.
