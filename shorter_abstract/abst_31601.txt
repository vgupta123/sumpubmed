to test the web service, we created a pilot web application to access a preliminary knowledge base of resources.
the index generated can be automatically updated by adding additional manuscripts describing new resources.
in this paper, we present the bioinformatics resource inventory , a new approach for automatically discovering and indexing available public bioinformatics resources using information extracted from the scientific literature.
we have developed web services and applications to test and validate our approach.
the web service can be used by third-party web services or web-based applications.
