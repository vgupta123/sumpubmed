we present a hybrid system for short read mapping utilizing both fpga-based hardware and cpu-based software.
for single-end alignment, our hybrid system achieves faster processing speed than gassst  and bwa ; for pair-end alignment, our design achieves a slightly worse sensitivity than that of bwa but has a higher processing speed.
this paper shows that our hybrid system can effectively accelerate the mapping of short reads to a reference genome based on the seed-and-extend approach.
our hybrid system design also shows that the performance bottleneck for the short read mapping problem can be changed from the alignment stage to the seed generation stage, which provides an additional requirement for the future development of short read aligners.
a number of short read mapping software tools have been proposed.
the computation intensive alignment and the seed generation operations are mapped onto an fpga.
the performance comparison to the gassst and bwa software implementations under different conditions shows that our hybrid design achieves a high degree of sensitivity and requires less overall execution time with only modest fpga resource utilization.
the rapid growth of short read datasets poses a new challenge to the short read mapping problem in terms of sensitivity and execution speed.
the performance is compared to the multi-threaded cpu-based gassst and bwa software implementations.
existing methods often use a restrictive error model for computing the alignments to improve speed, whereas more flexible error models are generally too slow for large-scale applications.
