c-jun nh2-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase  and the p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  are important components of cellular signal transduction pathways, which have been reported to be involved in viral replication.
moreover, ev <dig> infection also increased the release of ifn-Î² and il- <dig> p <dig>  pretreatment of idcs with sp <dig> and sb <dig>  could severely impair viral replication and its induced phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> p <dig> mapk, c-fos and c-jun.

thus, idcs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and performed to explore the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in the two signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during ev <dig> replication.
jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways are beneficial to ev <dig> infection and positively regulate secretions of inflammatory cytokines in idcs.
