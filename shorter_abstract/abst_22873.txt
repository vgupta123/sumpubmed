the types of amino acid residues that define the epc-n domain suggest a role in mediating protein-protein interactions, possibly specifically in the context of chromatin binding, and the types of proteins in which it is found  strongly suggest a role in epigenetic structure formation and/or recognition.
the other two subfamilies  appear to be related to one another by duplication events in a primordial fungal-metazoan-mycetozoan ancestor.
in addition, an unusual phyletic distribution of epc-n-containing proteins is observed.
the unusual phyletic distribution of epc-n-containing proteins may provide a conduit for future insight into how different organisms form, perceive and respond to epigenetic information.
all non-epc-n proteins studied thus far that contain the pzpm have been implicated in histone methylation and/or gene silencing.
subfamilies iii and iv are further defined by the presence of an evolutionarily conserved five-center-zinc-binding motif in the loop connecting the second and third helices of the four-helix bundle.
this domain is conserved across eukaryotes and is predicted to form a right-handed orthogonal four-helix bundle with extended strands at both termini.
it is possible that the epc-n domain serves as a direct link between histone acetylation and methylation statuses.
the data suggest that the epc-n domain is a protein-protein interaction module found in chromatin associated proteins.
this motif appears to consist of a phd followed by a mononuclear zn knuckle, followed by a phd-like derivative, and will thus be referred to as the pzpm.
