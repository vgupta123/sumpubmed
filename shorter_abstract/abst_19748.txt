using intact total rna as starting material, probes can be spaced at the minimum anticipated library size minus  <dig> nucleotides to achieve continuous depletion.
we further provide a bioinformatics tool to design suitable pdd probe sets.
here we describe probe-directed degradation , an approach that employs hybridisation to dna oligonucleotides at the single-stranded cdna library stage and digestion with duplex-specific nuclease .
finally, as pdd utilises unmodified dna oligonucleotides it can provide a low-cost option for large-scale projects, or be flexibly customised to suit different depletion targets, sample types and organisms.
targeting saccharomyces cerevisiae rrna sequences in illumina hiseq libraries generated by the split adapter method we show that pdd results in efficient removal of rrna.
we find that pdd is a rapid procedure that results in effective and specific depletion of unwanted sequences from deep-sequencing libraries.
the probes generate extended zones of depletion as a function of library insert size and the requirements for dsn cleavage.
methods for depletion of such unwanted sequences typically require treatment of rna samples prior to library preparation, are costly and not suited to unusual species and applications.
