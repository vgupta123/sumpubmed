studies have shown how gene networks are employed to pattern butterfly eyespots, fly bristles and vertebrate epithelial appendages such as teeth, feathers, hair and mammary glands.
we investigate the expression of conserved gene networks  known to pattern iterative structures and teeth in other vertebrates.
these data show how a complex multi-rowed vertebrate dentition is organized and how developmental tinkering of conserved gene networks during iterative pattern formation can impact upon the evolution of trophic novelty.
we address this problem through the molecular analysis of oral jaw dental diversity in lake malawi cichlids, where closely related species exhibit from  <dig> to  <dig> rows of teeth, with total teeth counts ranging from around  <dig> to  <dig>
periodic patterning of iterative structures is a fundamental process during embryonic organization and development.
epithelial wnt7b and mesenchymal eda are expressed in the inter-germ and inter-row regions, and likely regulate the spacing of these shh-positive units.
coordinated patterns of gene expression differ among malawi species and prefigure the future-ordered distribution of functional teeth of specific size and spacing.
this variation in gene expression among species occurs early in the developmental programme for dental patterning.
finally, we used chemical knockdown to demonstrate the fundamental role of hedgehog signalling and initial placode formation in the organization of the periodically patterned cichlid dental programme.
we show that spatiotemporal variation in expression pattern reflects adult morphological diversity among three closely related malawi cichlid species.
combinatorial epithelial expression of pitx <dig> and shh appears to govern the competence both of initial tooth sites and future tooth rows.
