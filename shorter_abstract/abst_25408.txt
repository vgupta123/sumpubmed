intron migration and exon duplication together may account for a significant amount of novel intron positions in conserved coding sequences.
other novel introns seem to have been gained by regional tandem duplications of coding sequences containing a proto-splice site.
we identified  <dig> unambiguous cases of novel intron positions in  <dig> drosophila genes that exhibit near intron pairs .
here, a nip consists of an ancient and a novel intron position that are separated by less than  <dig> nt.
a survey for nips among  <dig> drosophila genomes identifies intron sliding  as one of the more frequent causes of novel intron positions.
recent intron gains sometimes appear to have arisen by duplication of exonic sequences and subsequent intronization of one of the copies.
positions of spliceosomal introns are often conserved between remotely related genes.
however, introns verified as novel are needed to evaluate contemporary processes of intron gain.
