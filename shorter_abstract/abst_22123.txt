however, some full-scale composting plants experience difficulties with the efficiency of biowaste degradation and with the emission of noxious odours.
a detailed comparison of the bacterial diversity revealed a large difference in composts at the species and strain level from the different composting plants.
tightened eu legislation now requires treatment of the continuously growing quantities of organic municipal waste before final disposal.
statistical calculations estimated a total bacterial diversity of over  <dig> different phylotypes in the studied composts.
bacterial species composition was determined by isolating total dna followed by amplifying and sequencing the gene encoding the 16s ribosomal rna.
however, at the genus level, the difference was much smaller and illustrated a delay of the composting process in the full-scale, sub-optimally performing plants.
in this study we examine the bacterial species richness and community structure of an optimally working pilot-scale compost plant, as well as a full-scale composting plant experiencing typical problems.
most of the sequences observed in either one or both of the composting processes studied here were similar to the bacterial species reported earlier in composts, including bacteria from the phyla actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, proteobacteria and deinococcus-thermus.
