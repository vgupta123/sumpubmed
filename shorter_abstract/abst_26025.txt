the initial findings of low morbidity and zero mortality encountered during captive observation and post-release tracking periods support the viability of this surgical technique for the implantation of long-term telemetry devices in phocids.
surgeries were performed under general anesthesia and a single transmitter was inserted into the ventrocaudal abdominal cavity via a 7–8 cm incision along the ventral midline between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis or preputial opening in each animal.

pinnipeds, including many phocid species of concern, are inaccessible and difficult to monitor for extended periods using conventional, externally attached telemetry devices that are shed during the annual molt.
archival satellite transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally into three stranded pacific harbor seal pups  that completed rehabilitation, to evaluate the viability of this surgical technique for the deployment of life long telemetry devices in phocids.
all three animals exhibited an expected inflammatory response, with acute phase responses lasting approximately three to four weeks.
