in our work, we investigated several life history traits  in two tropical and two temperate natural populations of d. melanogaster recently collected, and in a temperate population maintained for twelve years at the constant temperature of 18°c in the laboratory.
in order to characterise the plasticity of these life history traits, the populations were grown at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> °c.
differences for the plasticity of other life history traits investigated between tropical and temperate populations were also found.
our results evidence a better cold tolerance in temperate populations that seems to have been evolved during the colonisation of temperate countries by d. melanogaster afrotropical ancestors, and support the hypothesis of an adaptive response of plasticity to the experienced environment.
thermal selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these differences.
productivity was the fitness trait that showed clearly adaptive differences between latitudinal populations: tropical flies did better in the heat but worse in the cold environments with respect to temperate flies.
